IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea
On August 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.
Equatorial Guinea’s overall real GDP growth has been weak in recent years averaging
-0.5 percent from 2010-14, largely due to a trend decline of the dominant hydrocarbon sector.
Economic performance deteriorated substantially in the wake of the 2014 oil-price shock. In
2015, the pace of the contraction intensified, and economic activity declined by 7.4 percent.
Hydrocarbon activity fell 8.9 percent, as lower oil prices prompted producers to cut costs,
resulting in lower production. Non-hydrocarbon activity slumped by 5.2 percent, as fiscal
adjustment slowed public investment and private sector construction. Ongoing fiscal adjustment
helped to reduce the overall deficit from 4.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.2 percent in 2015.
However, the fiscal position remains under pressure, with deficit financing needs requiring
domestic borrowing in the form of central bank credit and further use of government deposits.
The terms-of-trade deterioration resulted in a widening of the current account deficit to
16.8 percent of GDP. Inflation is very low at 0.6 percent during the second quarter of 2016,
down from over 4 percent in 2014.
The near-term outlook is very challenging, given prospects for depressed energy prices and a
continued decline in hydrocarbon production. Weak oil revenues and limited buffers will require
further cuts to public investment, leading to a deep contraction of the large construction sector
and public administration. As such, overall economic activity in 2016 is expected to decline
further by nearly 10 percent. The overall economy is unlikely to grow in the medium term given
the still large weight of the hydrocarbons and the impact of fiscal consolidation on nonhydrocarbon activities. However, the pace of the overall contraction should lessen over time as
the national development strategy shifts focus to human resource development and facilitates the
emergence of new drivers of non-hydrocarbon growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Equatorial Guinea is facing challenging circumstances, as
declining hydrocarbon production and depressed oil prices have led to a deep economic
contraction. Given limited buffers, Directors underscored that, in the face of the sharp drop in
hydrocarbon income, sustained policy adjustment is needed to restore fiscal sustainability. They
noted that achieving sustainable and inclusive growth will require significant efforts to diversify
the economy toward non-resource sectors, as well as enhancing human capital development and
improving the business climate.
Directors welcomed the fiscal adjustment already underway, which reflects the improving
receptiveness to IMF policy advice, but encouraged the authorities to increase the pace of
consolidation. They were encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to contain current spending and
freeze new public investment projects. However, Directors urged swift progress in defining other
key elements of the adjustment strategy, including measures to mobilize non-resource revenues,
rationalize tax exemptions, and increase investment efficiency. They emphasized the need to
prioritize ongoing projects, while retaining investment in social development, particularly in
health and education. The consolidation process would benefit from a comprehensive review of
tax policy, and a strategy to develop debt management capacity, supported by IMF technical
assistance as needed.
Directors highlighted the importance of decisive action to engender growth in the non-resource
economy. In order to leverage the potential of Equatorial Guinea’s considerable infrastructure,
they recommended developing a comprehensive reform agenda to improve the business climate,
strengthen governance, foster human capital development, and reduce factor costs, including
through fiscal consolidation. Greater cooperation with the World Bank on business climate
diagnostics could help establish the immediate structural reform priorities.
Directors cautioned that while the country’s banks appear well capitalized, the high level of
non-performing loans and declining profitability call for renewed vigilance. They noted that
financial sector vulnerabilities stem from fiscal-financial linkages, as fiscal consolidation and
government arrears to contractors affect firms’ ability to service loans. Directors encouraged the
authorities to adopt a repayment strategy for accumulated arrears, which threaten the credibility
of the fiscal adjustment and financial stability. They also emphasized the importance of
maintaining adequate capital buffers in the banking sector, strengthening bank supervision at the
regional level, and promoting financial inclusion.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors commended Equatorial Guinea’s recent steps to improve statistical production and
dissemination, notably the adoption of legislation and a development strategy for the national
statistical system, the rebasing of the national accounts, and the application to join the enhanced
General Data Dissemination Standard (e-GDDS) of the IMF. Nonetheless, Directors urged
continued efforts, with assistance from the IMF and other partners, to address remaining data
gaps to support effective surveillance and policy formulation.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic Context. Equatorial Guinea is facing difficult circumstances, as the oil price shock
severely complicates the effort to transform the economy. Although the authorities have
embarked on fiscal adjustment, the decline of the non-resource primary balance has fallen
short of what is needed to avoid a rapid deterioration in debt levels and fiscal buffers.
Outlook and risks. With the oil market expected to remain weak, further large cuts to
public investment are unavoidable, likely contributing to further economic contraction. The
key short- to medium-term downside risk is an insufficient fiscal adjustment, risking a rapid
accumulation of arrears and public debt, or disorderly adjustment.
Policies. Macroeconomic policies should aim to accelerate an economic reset driven by the
non-resource economy.


Fiscal policies should aim to sustain the pace of fiscal adjustment to forestall total
depletion of remaining buffers. To set the stage for a recovery, it is essential to
rationalize and reorient public investment to focus on maximum returns, and accelerate
reforms to mobilize more non-hydrocarbon revenues.



The authorities need to take decisive measures to improve the competitiveness of the
non-resource sector by better leveraging the existing strong infrastructure base, and by
addressing the weak business climate and governance.



Financial sector weakness stems from fiscal-financial linkages, as fiscal consolidation
and government arrears to suppliers and contractors affect firms’ ability to service loans.
It is essential that the authorities adopt a repayment strategy for accumulated arrears,
which are rapidly rising and threaten the credibility of the fiscal adjustment and financial
sector stability, and ensure adequate capital and liquidity buffers in the banking sector,
critical to mitigating exposures to weak economic activity. Implementing critical
financial structural reforms will also boost resilience to shocks, while promoting poverty
reduction.



Building on progress made thus far, address the critical shortage of macroeconomic and
socio-demographic data, which is essential for informed decision-making.

CONTEXT: LONG BOOM, PROTRACTED DECLINE?
1.
Following a long hydrocarbon-fueled boom, Equatorial Guinea’s economy is in the
midst of a protracted decline. From 2000 to 2008, average real growth exceeded 30 percent, as the
country grew to become the third-largest hydrocarbon producer in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Activity
slowed with the onset of a secular decline in production in 2008, but the economy rebounded thanks
to high commodities prices and massive infrastructure investment (averaging 25 percent of GDP per
year) under the national development plan—Horizonte 2020. Since end-2012, with fiscal buffers
under pressure, investment cuts and resource

output have led to an overall contraction of

GDP of some 30 percent. With bleak prospects
for a recovery of resource revenues, the
authorities’ efforts to restore fiscal
sustainability largely hinge on further cuts to
investment, as well as extracting more value
for money. However, changing course is a
challenge with several long-term projects still
mid-stream.
2.
The boom lifted Equatorial Guinea
to one of the highest average per capita
incomes in SSA. A recent rebasing of the
national accounts to 2006 as base year better captures the changing structure of the economy in
recent years. The new series also incorporates new and more robust methodologies. As a result,
there has been an upward revision of the size of the economy by roughly 30 percent (Annex I: GDP
Rebasing).1 Nonetheless, high levels of public investment have yet to deliver significant economic
diversification, and the economy remains heavily dependent on a resource sector in decline. Based
on the recent census results, income per
capita now lies below the World Bank

school enrollment and indicators of maternal and infant health. While development indicators that
depend on infrastructure, e.g., access to water and electricity, have improved markedly, low overall
spending on health and education delivery has led to vaccination and primary school completion
rates that have fallen well short of the achievements of other SSA countries with much lower per
capita incomes. In the face of significantly reduced oil revenues, the authorities need to shift limited
resources to health and education sector, particularly to prevention and outreach programs, in order
to promote more inclusive and equitable growth (Annex II: Progress on Social Indicators).
4.
The traction of IMF policy recommendations is improving. In the past year, the
authorities have acted on recommendations to better monitor investment spending, and shift the
focus to human development. They have been implementing IMF technical assistance toward
increasing tax revenue. Significant steps have been taken to address weak statistical data, including
the adoption of a national statistical development strategy and the decision to subscribe to the IMF’s
enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS). However, there has been little progress on
recommended business climate reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The oil-price shock since 2014 is exacerbating Equatorial Guinea’s economic
contraction (Figure 1 and Tables 1–5). Overall GDP declined by 7½ percent during 2015.
Hydrocarbon activity declined by 8.9 percent with both price and production playing a role. Lower oil
prices prompted producers to adjust by cutting operating costs by an average of 40 percent, which
partly mitigated the fall in value added in the sector, but also resulted in lower-than-expected
production. Non-hydrocarbon activity slumped by 5.2 percent, as fiscal adjustment slowed public
investment and private sector construction.
6.
Fiscal adjustment in terms of the improvement in the non-resource primary balance
has fallen short of what is needed, so debt levels are rising and fiscal buffers are deteriorating
rapidly.


Outturn data for 2015 show a further decline of the overall deficit (cash basis) to 3.2 percent of
GDP, reducing the overall fiscal deficit by half. The authorities proactively sought to mitigate the
resource revenue shock through a revised 2015 budget involving measures to mobilize nonresource revenues and a freeze on new capital projects. Nonetheless, investment spending
exceeded the revised budget target by nearly 8 percent of GDP, so the decline in the deficit was
mainly thanks to better-than-expected resource revenues.2 The true deficit may be larger given
delays in settling payments to suppliers.



To finance the deficit, the government relied upon domestic borrowing and accumulated savings.
Recourse to statutory advances from the BEAC equivalent (1.8 percent of GDP in 2015),
contributed to a rapid rise in total public debt to 14 percent of GDP at end-2015. The
government’s deposit buffer declined by 1.9 percent of GDP in 2015. As a result, the trend
decline in government deposits continued, which have fallen from 24 percent of GDP in 2011 to
10.6 percent in 2015.

Higher-than-expected resource revenue stems from deep spending cuts by oil companies, which buttressed income
tax revenue.

7.
The terms-of-trade deterioration resulted in a widening of the current account deficit
to 16.8 percent of GDP. The drawdown of usable external reserves was faster-than-expected,
declining by some 40 percent since end-2014. Including the government’s offshore deposits, the
useable external resources are equivalent to 6.4 months of projected imports, down from 6.9 months
the previous year. Inflation is very low at 0.6 percent during the second quarter of 2016, down from
over 4 percent in 2014. Despite weak economic activity and bank asset quality, private credit growth
decelerated only slightly to 14 percent, indicating possible “evergreening” of loans to the badly-hit
construction sector.

VERY CHALLENGING OUTLOOK AND RISING RISKS
8.
The near-term outlook is very challenging (Figure 2). The baseline scenario assumes
depressed energy prices and a deeper near-term decline in hydrocarbon production than previously
projected, as oil companies continue to minimize operating expenditures (Text Figure 3). In 2016,
weak oil revenues and limited buffers will require further cuts to public investment, leading to a deep
contraction of the large construction sector and public administration. As such, overall economic
activity is expected to decline by nearly 10 percent. Beyond the near-term, investment in current and
new hydrocarbon facilities is expected to recover, suggesting a return to production declines of
around 5 percent annually.3 Ongoing fiscal

9.
Substantial risks to the outlook highlight the need for proactive policy measures
(Annex III: Risk Assessment Matrix). The key short- to medium-term downside risk is an insufficient
fiscal adjustment to prolonged weakness in the oil market. This could lead to a faster depletion of
available deposits, risking a rapid accumulation of arrears and public debt. Further domestic risks
concern a faster-than-expected decline of oil production, uncertain prospects for a rebound in nonhydrocarbon growth, and a slow improvement in the reorientation of public investment.

An upside risk for future hydrocarbon production concerns the Fortuna Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG)
project, for which the final investment decision is expected by end 2016. The FLNG project could increase biogenic
gas production by as much as half over from the end of the forecast period.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: CHARTING AN ECONOMIC
RESET AND A PATH TO RECOVERY
10.
The over-arching theme of the consultation was to accelerate an economic reset driven
by the non-resource economy. A slow consolidation invites a growing risk of a disorderly adjustment
and macroeconomic instability. Fiscal retrenchment is also essential to support the CFA franc, which
has served the country well as a pillar of economic stability. The effort should be bolstered by
implementing highly visible structural reforms, containing macro-financial spillovers, and improving
statistical capacity.

A. Sustaining the Path of Fiscal Adjustment
11.
Fiscal performance in recent years has
suffered from weaknesses in budget
management. Issues identified by previous FAD
TA include incomplete and poor quality data, ad
hoc procedures, fragmented decision-making, and
extra-budgetary spending. As a result, expenditure
and revenue deviations relative to budget targets
have been large, ranging from 5–10 percent of
GDP on the large capital expenditure budget
(Text Figure 4).

Text Figure 4. Equatorial Guinea: Deviation of Budget
and Actual
(Percent of GDP)

12.
Fiscal adjustment is under way, but
progress is slow. The authorities are dealing with

a serious shock to hydrocarbon revenues
(accounting for 90 percent of total revenue through 2014). With the forecast of continued low oil
prices and no scope for further central bank credit, remaining fiscal buffers are at risk without
substantial additional consolidation. The broad lines of the authorities’ adjustment strategy have been
in place since mid-2015, and it was enhanced with the adoption of a presidential decree in
November 2015, focusing on mobilizing non-hydrocarbon revenue and progressively reducing the
public investment budget. However, key revenue measures remain in early stages of implementation,
including the audit and rollback of ad hoc VAT and income tax exemptions, and customs
modernization. On expenditure, the authorities have succeeded in containing current spending, and
have imposed a freeze on new public investment projects, but action plans are still being developed to
reform the public investment plan (PIP) and review ongoing projects.
13.
To illustrate the risks posed by a slow unwinding and reform of the PIP, a passive
scenario posits gradual expenditure consolidation and weaker growth due to a slow
improvement of investment efficiency. Under this scenario, fiscal buffers are depleted and financing
requirements would push indicative public debt to about 50 percent of GDP over the medium term
(Text Table 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Text Table 2. Equatorial Guinea: Active vs. Passive Scenario, 2015–21
(Percent of GDP, unless otherwise specified)

14.
Staff recommended accelerating fiscal policy reforms with a view to forestalling the
depletion of buffers. Fiscal policy should be anchored on a non-resource primary deficit of less
than 20 percent of GDP over the medium term.4 This target is consistent with a gradual increase in
non-resource revenue and sustained spending adjustment around 2 percent of GDP per year over the
medium term, and would safeguard a minimal level of government deposits (Tables 1–5).
15.
Equatorial Guinea’s debt would remain manageable if fiscal adjustment is continued over
the medium term, but would grow rapidly in the absence of additional adjustment (DSA). This
underscores the importance of accelerated fiscal policy reforms. The debt trajectory is vulnerable to
unfavorable shocks from real GDP growth and the primary balance.
16.

In line with this scenario, the mission made the following recommendations:



Ensure continued fiscal consolidation with a revised 2016 budget. The 2016 budget as adopted
applies an optimistic oil price assumption and makes no provision for arrears clearance. A
new 2016 budget should be based on conservative oil price assumptions and revised expenditure
projections with adequate allocations for maintenance and social development.



Implement priority non-hydrocarbon revenue mobilization measures. Equatorial Guinea
generates minimal tax revenue that is not directly linked to hydrocarbon activity. Despite a threefold increase in imports since 2005, customs taxes generate revenue of 0.2 percent GDP, well below
Gabon (4.2 percent) and the Republic of Congo (3.7 percent). This underperformance stems from
evasion, ad hoc exemptions, and poor administrative practices. Immediate priorities for reform
include: operationalization of the Large Taxpayer Unit, which will help focus collection efforts on

4

The active scenario is based on the authorities’ established policies, and policies likely to be implemented. The level
of the fiscal anchor is now significantly higher than past estimates, due to the upward revision of GDP.
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

the biggest tax payers, introduction of a single taxpayer identification number; streamline tax filing
procedures; and better tracking of exemptions. Exemptions should be vigorously eliminated when
not established by law. The authorities should also advance the reorganization of the customs
services, notably by finalizing customs clearance procedures for the installation of ASYCUDA World
software.


The authorities should embark on a comprehensive review of tax policy, including nonresource tax revenues; reform efforts to date have focused on tax administration measures. A
well-designed tax system would increase the non-resource tax base and avoid distortionary fees
that partly explain the increase in non-resource revenues in 2015. The IMF stands ready to provide
technical assistance.



Accelerate public financial management (PFM) reforms focusing on the public investment
program (PIP) and domestic arrears. The targeted fiscal adjustment requires that the PIP be
halved over three years. The authorities should develop action plans with the World Bank to
strengthen public investment management, focusing on centralized project selection and
monitoring, aligning it with priorities identified by the national development plan, and developing
expenditure projections integrated with the medium-term fiscal framework. With regard to
ongoing projects, the authorities should avoid inefficient across-the-board spending cuts, which
could harm the poor disproportionately. Clear criteria should be developed to prioritize efficient
investment projects based on expected economic and social impact, emphasizing state of
completion, service delivery, and maintenance requirements.



Support inclusive growth by increasing the share of spending on social programs and public
service delivery. Expenditure composition is currently 2:1 in favor of capital spending, whereas it is
the inverse in other CEMAC countries, contributing to low provisions for health and education
service delivery. Budget allocations should be better aligned with the national development
program’s social priorities.



Given widespread payment delays, the authorities should proceed quickly on an audit of the
stock and preparation of a clearance strategy. To underpin confidence in the strategy, the
annual budget should transparently provision for retiring these debts—which may require
additional recourse to the regional debt market. PFM measures to avoid the emergence of new
arrears should include more frequent National Payments Committee5 meetings and an action plan
to bring budget classification and reporting in line with CEMAC directives by end 2016.



Develop debt management capacity. In 2015, Equatorial Guinea entered the regional T-bill
market with a successful test issuance of CFAF 15 billion at an interest rate of around 1 percent. In
order to further develop this potential source of financing, the authorities should strengthen
capacity and develop a sound debt management strategy, as recommended by previous World
Bank and IMF technical assistance.

Although the National Payments Committee is scheduled to meet quarterly, the schedule of meetings is not always
maintained due to capacity constraints.

Advocate for a tighter region wide policy stance. Given its contribution to the regional reserves
pool, the Equatorial Guinean authorities should seek to contain monetary financing of the budget,
and work with regional bodies to rein in fiscal dominance and safeguard external reserves.



Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed that, given the unfavorable outlook for hydrocarbon revenue,
ongoing fiscal adjustment would be needed to regain fiscal sustainability. They concurred that,
absent active policy measures, debt levels would rapidly rise, as shown in the DSA. They underscored
their commitment to fiscal consolidation by pointing to the wide-ranging measures in the
presidential decree of November 2015, foremost being the elimination of ad hoc tax exemptions, and
noted that sizeable fiscal adjustment had been achieved in 2015. The authorities were optimistic
about the potential for tax administration measures to raise revenue in the short-term especially in
customs. They also argued that the planned tax amnesty program would incentivize taxpayer
registration. Nevertheless, they agreed that an IMF-supported comprehensive tax policy review could
help identify potential reforms. On public investment, the authorities’ stressed the recent success in
reducing the PIP budget by 30 percent since 2014, and that substantial efforts have been made, with
World Bank assistance, to construct an open platform to actively monitor and manage the PIP. Work
is underway on prioritization criteria for ongoing projects, and the government is in discussion with
contractors on the scope to delay or curtail elements. A strategy for rescheduling unpaid bills is also
being discussed with service providers and commercial banks.

B. A Decisive Move to Promote Nonoil Growth
18.
Horizonte 2020 has enhanced infrastructure, but the impact on non-oil growth has
been limited.6 The first phase (2008–12) of the development plan focused on road networks, energy,
water, and ports. The second phase of the plan, which was launched in 2014, emphasizes improving
governance and fighting corruption, the business climate, and human capital formation. To date,
there has been limited movement on structural reforms, and weak governance and corruption
remain a serious impediment (Figure 3). However, large-scale prestige projects are still ongoing,
including the new capital city at Oyala. As a result, non-oil activity and exports have remained
stagnant.
19.
The authorities’ efforts are now focused on promoting agriculture, fisheries, tourism,
and financial services. To foster private sector activity in strategic sectors, the authorities: (i) intend
to establish a national committee composed of chambers of commerce, educational institutions,
banks and several members of the government by end-2016 to spearhead reforms; (ii) are placing
emphasis on education, including building eight vocational schools to train youth; and (iii) are
developing a tourism sector policy to leverage recently constructed hotel facilities, building on the
expertise of foreign professionals.

20.
Despite significant data limitations on the external sector, existing evidence suggest
that the real exchange rate is significantly overvalued. The real effective exchange rate has
appreciated in past years considerably more than in other CEMAC countries due to consistently
higher CPI inflation (Annex IV: External Stability Analysis). The Araujo et al. (2013) and the BemsCarvalho (2009) methodologies suggest an overvaluation of the real exchange rate of 8–33 percent.
This underlines the urgent need to implement wide-ranging structural reforms that reduce factor
costs, including through fiscal consolidation, as well as to foster human capital development and
address significant weaknesses in the investment climate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA

21.
Discussions with the authorities focused on measures to improve the nonoil sector’s
competitiveness and facilitate export diversification:


Address current real exchange rate overvaluation, a fundamental prerequisite to promote
non-oil growth. Beyond fiscal consolidation, it requires reducing costs and productivity-boosting
structural reforms. The government wage bill is relatively small and the ongoing retrenchment in
the construction sector means that wages will remain depressed. Therefore, measures to reduce
factor costs, such as external trade facilitation, easing barriers to FDI inflows and lowering
telecommunication charges, should be a priority.



Improve the business climate and efficiency of public services to foster private sector
development. While staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to establish a “one-stop shop” for
investors, it underscored that in itself this was insufficient to address the weak business climate.
As an initial step, they could finalize discussions on business climate diagnostics and reforms with
the World Bank.



Advocate further integration with CEMAC by lowering trade policy barriers through
behind-the-border measures. Equatorial Guinea could tap into economies of scale by
encouraging regional integration.



Promote tourism by leveraging existing infrastructure. Hotel occupancy rates are very low.
This is in part due to visa entry requirements to Equatorial Guinea that are onerous and
unpredictable, and need to be streamlined.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations. They concurred with the
need for structural reforms, made more urgent in light of oil price and output declines. In addition to
vocational training for construction workers, the authorities stressed the catalytic potential of a
CFAF 100 billion Co-investment Fund to support small- and medium-enterprises in these sectors,
although no suitable projects have been identified to date. They noted that external advisers had
been contracted for the establishment of the “one-stop-shop” to facilitate investor entry, which
could be operational by 2017. On tourist visa requirements, while acknowledging the problem, they
noted that any streamlining would need to balance the need to ensure national security.

C. Containing the Macro-financial Spillovers from the Oil Shock
23.
BEAC’s accommodative monetary policy has temporarily eased the government and
banks’ difficulties, but there is little additional room given the CEMAC currency peg. The use of
BEAC statutory advances at end-2015 reached CFAF 518 billion (over 6 percent of GDP), the
maximum allowable. This puts a premium on fiscal adjustment.
24.
While banks appear well capitalized and liquid, profitability is in decline. Capital and
liquidity appear relatively unaffected by the oil price shock so far, and remain adequate
(Text Figure 6). Stress tests of CEMAC countries’ banks show Equatorial Guinea as relatively resilient
to solvency and liquidity shocks7 (SIP: Macro-financial Linkages). However, return on equity

25.
The high level of nonperforming loans threatens financial sector stability. Amid
disorderly adjustment of the PIP and slowing economic activity, nonperforming loans increased
to 20 percent of total loans in 2013 (Text Figure 6). Nonetheless, credit growth has averaged more
than 20 percent over the same period, suggesting potential distortions due to evergreening of
loans—mostly in the form of overdrafts for some of the construction companies—that could
undermine bank asset quality in the future. NPLs have remained high, sustained by the 2014 oil price
shock. Financial sector weakness stems from fiscal-financial linkages, as fiscal consolidation and
government arrears to suppliers and contractors affect firms’ ability to service loans, as well as
possibly lax loan classification. An additional concern is the potential for under provisioning;
although the ratio of provisioning is stable around 50 percent of NPLs, it does not cover loans
guaranteed by the government.8 Amplifying the shock is highly concentrated bank lending, with
around 80 percent of loans extended to large enterprises and construction firms depending on
government contracts.9

8

The latest regulation on provisioning and loans classification was effective from January 2015.

Besides concentrated loans, the negative effects of oil-price shocks on financial stability in commodity-exporters
tend to be more pronounced for countries with undiversified export base, weak governance, low fiscal buffers, shallow
financial systems, and weak macro-prudential framework (Kinda, Mlachila and Ouedraogo, 2016; Gabon SIP, 2016).

The 2015 regional FSSA report notes a need to continue to strengthen the quality of
supervision and enforcement.10 The crisis resolution mechanism is improving, giving the supervisor
(COBAC) the power to intervene, notably by appointing administrators without prior approval of the
BEAC Board. Furthermore, BEAC’s monetary policy committee has increased the frequency of its
monitoring of liquidity developments to a quarterly basis, as has the frequency of on-site commercial
bank inspections to prevent under provisioning. Even so, bank supervision is constrained by limited
capacity, and complicated by banks exposed to spillovers from potentially distressed parents in the
CEMAC region.11

GDP ratios, is less than a third of the EM average. Limited information on potential borrowers’ credit
history and high collateral requirements remain significant bottlenecks to financial development. In
addition, high volatility of banks’ deposits—mostly driven by large and irregular government

underway. Internal regulations and reporting standard have been finalized. The ANIF has started
processing suspicious transaction reports, and has referred files to the State Attorney General’s office
for possible prosecution. A regional peer review of Equatorial Guinea’s AML/CFT legal framework
against the 2003 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard is being conducted.
29.

The mission made the following recommendations:



Promptly tackle domestic arrears to avoid negative repercussions on financial stability
through default by government contractors and suppliers on bank loans.



Maintain adequate financial buffers in the banking sector, critical to mitigating exposure
to weak economic activity. Stress tests show that liquidity and solvency are highly sensitive to
macroeconomic shocks. Given the protracted oil shock, Equatorial Guinea should encourage the
regional supervisor to put in place action plans to ensure continued bank compliance with
prudential norms and provisioning against accumulated NPLs, and cooperate with the COBAC on
an asset quality review and in closely monitoring government-guaranteed loans.



Advocate a coordinated regional approach for developing bank supervision on a
consolidated basis. The COBAC and the BEAC should improve the quality and timeliness of
financial stability indicators, and develop a regional strategy to better monitor and tackle macrofinancial spillovers through parent-subsidiary linkages.



Implement crosscutting financial sector structural reforms to close the financial
development gap, which would allow banks to play a supportive role in economic growth. Given
limited capacity, high priorities are establishing credit bureaus and upgrading collateral registries.
Other recommended policies to boost financial inclusion include greater promotion of
microfinance notably by increasing financial literacy and facilitating mobile banking.



Strengthen the AML/CFT regime in line with the 2012 FATF standard, notably by
implementing at the national level CEMAC’s AML/CFT framework, providing the ANIF with
adequate resources to carry its mandate autonomously and independently, and ensuring a riskbased implementation of AML/CFT measures by regulated institutions.

13

The national payment committee meets infrequently, which leads to large payments when they occur.

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis of macro-financial linkages. They noted that
recent efforts by COBAC to increase staffing have increased its effectiveness and would underpin
higher frequency monitoring. While acknowledging the vulnerability of the banks to cross-border
spillovers, the authorities also noted that regulations adopted in 2015 on cross-border supervision
would strengthen regional surveillance on a consolidated basis in line with Basel II protocols.
Although the oil shock would likely hinder financial development, they stressed the importance
underlying structural impediments, notably weak entrepreneurial skills and a lack of bankable
projects.

D. Accelerating Statistical Data Reforms
31.
To address the lack of data and weaknesses in the statistical system, the authorities
have undertaken a number of measures, with the notable assistance of the World Bank and
AFRITAC, including:


Operationalization of the National Institute of Statistics (INEGE), aimed at significantly improving
the statistical institutional infrastructure and data collection, compilation, and dissemination. A
high quality National Statistical Development strategy has been developed.



National accounts compiled using a new base year (2006) and improved methodology.



Completion of a legislative package that defines the legal framework of the statistical system.



Completion of a population census in 2015. The preliminary results have been published, and the
size of the population is estimated at 1.2 million persons.

32.
The authorities have also subscribed to the e-GDDS of the IMF. To assist the authorities,
a mission from the IMF’s Statistics Department recently visited the country to: (i) undertake a
stocktaking exercise of current data production practices; (ii) identify categories of data currently
being produced; (iii) prepare an action plan to align current statistics production and dissemination
practices in line with best international practices; and (iv) initiate the preparation of metadata.
33.
Nonetheless, continued shortcomings hamper effective surveillance and seriously
impede policy formulation. In the current economic context, the cost of poorly informed decisions
is quite high, requiring that efforts to strengthen the quality and availability of statistical data. Staff
made the following recommendations:


Accelerate the INEGE capacity-building program, drawing on the findings of the June 2016
IMF Statistics Department mission.



Address capacity weaknesses in the compilation and reporting of International Investment
Position data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA



Create metadata for each type of data currently being produced based on samples provided by
the mission, and submit to the IMF Statistics Department existing data (e.g., national accounts,
CPI, public debt, etc.) even before the completion of the e-GDDS process.



Undertake economic and socio-demographic surveys aimed at assessing economic activity,
giving priority to the planned integrated household survey.



Develop statistical tools for systematically monitoring the national development strategy,
notably by establishing statistical units in each government ministry.



Step up the deployment of SYDONIA World software for processing international trade
transactions at customs.

Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment and recommendations. They have
committed to improving the quality and dissemination of data, including through the nomination of
the national coordinator of the e-GDDS initiative at INEGE. They underscored the challenges of
improving the timely production of data at source and increasing cooperation with producers of
data. They also emphasized the continued need for Fund TA and training, which could take the form
of custom-made courses in Spanish.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Equatorial Guinea’s economy is in the midst of a protracted contraction, calling for a
significant and sustained adjustment from the authorities. Abundant hydrocarbon resources and
massive infrastructure investment propelled the country to one of the highest average per capita
incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa, although the incidence of poverty remained a challenge and key
social indicators continued to lag regional averages. However, the economy is undiversified, so the
twin shocks of declining resource production from mature fields and depressed commodities prices
are resulting in a deep and long economic contraction. Given limited buffers, sustained policy
adjustment is needed to restore fiscal sustainability and promote new drivers of non-resource
growth building on the existing stock of infrastructure. At the same time, the authorities will need to
invest a lot more in human resources and service delivery to boost social indicators in areas where
progress has been limited, both to support non-oil sector growth and ensure that future growth is
inclusive.
36.
Fiscal adjustment is underway, but progress has been slow. The authorities have taken
significant steps to contain current spending and freeze new public investment projects. However,
key planks of the adjustment strategy are still being developed, for example to mobilize nonresource revenues by eliminating ad hoc tax exemptions, or to rationalize ongoing investment
projects and improve investment efficiency. The authorities should accelerate development of the
requisite implementation plans to underpin medium-term fiscal adjustment. These efforts should be
further buttressed by a comprehensive review of tax policy, and a strategy to develop debt
management capacity, supported, as needed, by IMF technical assistance.
20

37.
Decisive actions are also needed to engender growth in the non-resource economy.
Equatorial Guinea has the opportunity to leverage its considerable investment in infrastructure, but
launching new sectors that could drive non-resource growth will require a broad array of structural
reforms that address significant weaknesses in the investment climate, foster human capital
development, and reduce factor costs, including through fiscal consolidation. Decisive actions to
tackle corruption and improve governance, in line with Horizonte 2020’s objectives, will be important
to realize the country’s full economic potential. A business climate diagnostic in cooperation with the
World Bank would help establish a comprehensive agenda for pro-growth structural reforms. The
evidence suggests that the real effective exchange rate is significantly overvalued, and underlines the
urgent need to implement far-reaching structural reforms.
38.
While Equatorial Guinea’s banks appear well capitalized and liquid, NPLs are high, and
profitability is in decline. Financial sector vulnerabilities stem from fiscal-financial linkages, as fiscal
consolidation and government arrears to suppliers and contractors affect firms’ ability to service
loans. The authorities should adopt a repayment strategy for accumulated arrears, which threaten
the credibility of the fiscal adjustment and financial sector stability. In the context of overall weak
economic activity, it is critical to maintain adequate capital buffers in the banking sector, and work
toward consolidated regional bank supervision to better monitor potential financial spillovers.
Implementing critical financial sector structural reforms will also boost resilience to shocks, while
promoting financial inclusion and supporting private sector development.
39.
The government has undertaken laudable steps to improve statistical production and
dissemination. Noteworthy achievements over the last year include the adoption of legislation and a
development strategy for the national statistical system, the rebasing of the national accounts, a
population census, and the application to join the enhanced General Data Dissemination System
(e-GDDS) of the IMF. Nonetheless, continued efforts are required, as significant data gaps hamper
effective surveillance and seriously impede policy formulation. Near-term priorities include capacity
building and the preparation of metadata, with IMF support, as well as the integrated household
survey and the deployment of ASYCUDA World software at customs.
40.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. National Accounts Rebasing1
On July 19, 2016, Equatorial Guinea officially adopted a new series of national accounts2 based on: (i) a
change in the base year from 1986 to 20063; (ii) many features of the 1993 Systems of National
Accounts (SNA93) compilation methodology; and (iii) a larger number of sources and surveys. These
sources include the 2006 household survey and recent enterprise surveys. As a result, the new national
accounts statistics better capture the structure of the economy, especially the production of public
administration and the informal sector, leading to an increase of about 30 percent in the size of the
economy.
1.
Real GDP’s level increased by about 30 percent, as a result of improved methodology.
This methodology takes into account many recommendations of the 1993 System of National
Accounts (SNA93), and departs from the previous SNA68 methodology, by incorporating a better
estimate of public administrations’ output by including the associated costs of wages, goods and
services, and the consumption of fixed capital. Estimates of public education, health and social work
were also updated in line with the SNA93 recommendations. This methodology leads to a better
measurement of non-hydrocarbon activity, which more than doubled over 2006–14, compared with
previous estimates (Figure 1). In contrast, the estimate for the value of hydrocarbon production only
increased by about 5 percent. As a result, in 2014, the contribution of hydrocarbon GDP to the
overall GDP was revalued at 60 percent from 75 percent before the rebasing.

The new series of National Accounts statistics were produced by INEGE, the National Statistical Institute, with the
support the World Bank and AFRITAC Central.

The year 2006 was used as the base year, due to the availability of household consumption data from the first
household survey completed that year. The base year is also compatible with the practices of other CEMAC countries.

2.
The larger number of sources than previously used helped improve the accuracy of the
national accounts (NA) series. The data used in computations is collected from a variety of sources on
sectors and industries including the regional central bank (BEAC) as well as various agencies, ministries,
and the 2006 household survey.4 Economic activity also relied on tax declaration5 information, and on
surveys of public and private companies operating in all sectors. As opposed to previous
methodologies, most sectors’ output also includes estimates of the activities of service companies, in
addition to producing companies (e.g., oil sector), which leads to improved estimates. Nevertheless,
information gaps remain, and the accuracy of the new series is expected to increase, with a better
coverage of surveys, notably after the number of companies in Equatorial Guinea is established by a
new enterprise census.6
3.
Measurement improvements were more prominent in the tertiary sector, as informal
activity is now better captured. Three sectors experienced a substantial increase in the measure of
their shares of non-hydrocarbon activity (Figure 2). Indeed, in 2014, trade and commerce increased
6 fold to 19.7 percent of non-hydrocarbon activity; public administration’s measure increased 13 times
to 26.1 percent; and transport and communication increased 20 fold to 12 percent.

While the new NA series does not substantially change per capita income, the result
reinforces the need for greater efforts on non-resource revenue mobilization. The increased
GDP did not translate into an upward revision of the country’s per-capita income, since the recent
census resulted in a similar increase in the estimate of the size of the overall population. The revision
does suggest a more favorable view of the debt and non-resource primary deficit ratios, which were
both revised downward by about 28 percent in 2014. Conversely, the non-resource revenue as
a percentage of nominal GDP is now estimated at 3.3 percent in 2014. This weak indicator points to
the urgency to accelerate the structural reforms needed to boost revenue mobilization in the nonhydrocarbon sector.

The sources were cross-checked for consistency, and the sensitivity to alternative sources were tested. For example,
estimates in many sectors were developed to achieve a balance of supply and demand.

Trade statistics estimates were based on BEAC bank survey data, given that customs data are likely to be highly

The accuracy was also constrained by the limited relatively limited participation of known companies to surveys.

Annex II. Progress on Social Indicators1
Resource wealth has helped considerably improve social indicators over the past 15 years, but progress
has been uneven. Social indicators, which depend on infrastructure such as access to water and
electricity, have improved significantly. However, other indicators such as vaccination and primary
school completion rates still remain low. The government has built schools, technical colleges, and
healthcare centers under the Horizonte 2020 plan—drastically improving maternal and infant
mortality rates and primary school enrollment—but health and education spending still remain
relatively small components of annual public investment plan spending. In the face of significantly
reduced oil revenues, the authorities need to shift limited resources to the health and education sectors,
particularly towards prevention and outreach programs, in order to make progress towards their social
development goals.
1.
Equatorial Guinea’s national development plan—Horizonte 2020 launched in 2007—
focuses on two overarching objectives. First, it aims to help the country transition from a
predominantly hydrocarbon based economy to

compared to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. However, it also included a number of projects with

The second ‘Emergence Phase’ of
Horizonte 2020 is focused on generating
employment, promoting economic
diversification, and improving inclusive
growth. Significant results have been achieved
in terms of social infrastructure, including the
construction and rehabilitation of 40 health
centers, 18 hospitals, 7 neo-natal clinics, and
62 primary schools since 2007. Nonetheless, the
reprioritization of public investment spending
has occurred slowly, and as of 2015, only

14 percent of investment was allocated to social sectors such as jobs, education and health
(Text Figure 2).
3.
Equatorial Guinea has established various institutional mechanisms to track its social
and economic progress. A National Agency for Equatorial Guinea 2020 (ANGE 2020) has been
established with a mandate to track progress on the National Plan 2020 for Economic and Social
Development (NESDP), supported by the national statistical office (INEGE) and the National Institute
for the Promotion of Agricultural Technology in Equatorial Guinea (INPAGE). It recently published a
progress report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), prepared in collaboration with the
United Nations.2 The publication is part of a broader effort to assess the social impact of
Horizonte 2020.
4.
The country has made significant improvements in social indicators, one of the
strategic goals of Horizonte 2020. The number of people living in poverty has declined from
77 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 2011 (Figure 1). The percentage of people living under extreme
poverty also declined sharply from 33 percent in 2006 to 14 percent in 2011. Human capital
development is also evident as Equatorial Guinea has one of the highest literacy rates in sub-Saharan
Africa. In 2002, 89 percent of the population was literate, which increased to 97 percent in 2011
(Figure 1).3 However, total net enrolment in primary education has only marginally improved from
56 percent in 2006 to 62 percent in 2012. Moreover, the drop-out/repeat rate among primary school
students appears high based on a longitudinal sample that found only 53 percent of children
enrolled in the first grade in the 2005/06 academic year reached the sixth grade in 2010/11.
5.
Equatorial Guinea has also made significant progress towards achieving the millennium
development goal of reducing maternal mortality, but the child mortality rate, though in
sharp decline, remains very high. In 1990, maternal mortality rate was 1,600 deaths per 100,000
live births. This number had already declined sharply reaching 290 by 2013, well below the
government’s goal of 400 by 2015 (Figure 2). Similarly, child mortality rate declined in this time
period from 182 per 1,000 births in 1990 to 113 in 2011. In 2015, the authorities estimate that child
mortality was roughly 100 per 1,000, well short of the goal of 60.
6.
The country needs to significantly improve its immunization coverage and its fight
against serious diseases, like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The country has one of the lowest rates
of vaccination in the world. In 2014 only 42 percent of 1-year olds were vaccinated against measles,
which is well below the government’s 2015 goal of vaccinating 85 percent of children (Statistics
Expanded Program on Immunization, WHO, 2014). In comparison, the 2013 global measles
immunization coverage was 84 percent among children aged 12–23 months.4 The incidence of
tuberculosis has been increasing rapidly from 443 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2003 to
1,220 in 2014. The prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS has also been increasing, and is currently one of the
highest rates in the region. Among 15–24 years old, the prevalence rate increased from 1.2 percent
in 2004 to 3.1 percent in 2011. The prevalence rate is much higher for women, which is 5 percent
in 2011 among 15–24 age group.

The authorities expressed their commitment to improving development indicators, and
improve their monitoring. They noted very good performance for indicators where there is a heavy
reliance on infrastructure, such as access to water and telecommunications. They agreed with staff
that there is need to invest more in human resources and capacity development in areas where
progress has been uneven, notably in the fields of education and health. The authorities also
emphasized their commitment to improving statistical capacity to better capture social development
indicators.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).
The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks
and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term”
and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize with 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex IV. External Stability Assessment1
Equatorial Guinea’s external position in 2015 is assessed to be substantially weaker than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Much of the deterioration is
due to the large terms-of-trade shock from the decline in oil and gas prices. Assuming no change in
current policies, the real exchange rate assessments indicate it is significantly overvalued. However,
very serious data weaknesses affect the accuracy of the quantitative assessment of the real effective
exchange rate in Equatorial Guinea.
1.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated rapidly since 2000 considerably
more than in most CEMAC countries (Figure 1). REER appreciation has reflected relatively high CPI
inflation. However, there has been a significant reversal in both the REER and the nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) since mid-2014 mainly as a result of the depreciation of the euro, to which the
CFA franc is pegged (Figure 2).
2.
The current account deficit is projected
to decrease gradually over the medium term.
The decline in oil prices and higher imports of
capital and consumer goods sharply widened
Equatorial Guinea’s current account deficit from
6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 17 percent of GDP
in 2015. Given the forecast for slow recovery in oil
prices and REER appreciation, the current account
would remain in a deficit position until 2021. In the
medium term, the current account deficit will
gradually continue to decline as public sector
imports decline, offsetting the expected decline in
oil exports.

Figure 1: CEMAC: Real Effective Exchange Rates
(2000 = 100)

3.
Although very serious data weaknesses
affect the accuracy of a quantitative assessment
of the REER in Equatorial Guinea, there are some
indications that the real exchange rate is
significantly overvalued.2,3 Both the BemsCarvalho Filho (2009) and Araujo et al. (2013)
methodologies suggest that the real exchange rate

It is worth noting that there have been significant changes in major balance of payments estimates that affect the
composition of the current account and therefore, affect the current account projections used by exchange rate
assessment methodologies. These changes incorporate statistics provided by the authorities, but given the still
significant weaknesses in official balance of payments estimates (described in the Informational Annex), the
conclusions in this exchange rate assessment should be taken with caution.

is significantly overvalued (Table 1). The overvaluation would be greater in the absence of
adjustment policies. (Table 2). This underscores the urgent need for far-reaching structural reforms
that can substantially reduce factor costs and leverage the existing infrastructure base to boost
nonoil growth.
4.
The methodology of Bems and Carvalho Filho (2009) suggests a significant
overvaluation of the REER.4 The Bems and
Carvalho Filho methodology derives a desired

current account to the real exchange
rate (Table 1). Note that this methodology does not account for future returns of public investment
on future productivity growth and hence produces current account norms that would be above
Equatorial Guinea’s medium-term current account path if public investment has a significant payoff.
Given only moderate non-hydrocarbon GDP growth and almost negligible growth in nonhydrocarbon exports, it appears that the sizeable public investment in past years has not improved
productivity growth significantly.
5.
The methodology of Araujo et al. (2013) suggests that the real effective exchange rate
is moderately overvalued.6 This methodology takes into account absorptive capacity constraints in
investment, since ambitious public and private investment programs in developing countries are
often impacted by weak planning, coordination, and oversight contributing to large cost overruns.7
Results from this methodology suggest a moderate overvaluation of 8 or 14 percent depending on
the assumed elasticity of the current account to changes in the real exchange rate (Table 1).

Annex V. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public sector gross debt increased from 6 percent to 14 percent of GDP over the past two years, driven
mainly by statutory advances from the central bank. Under staff’s baseline projections and projected oil
prices, Equatorial Guinea’s central government debt is rising but remains manageable, provided that
the recommended fiscal adjustment is in place. Gross financing needs are projected to decrease from
7.5 percent of GDP in 2016 to 5.2 percent in 2021. However, there are sizable downside risks, including
delays in the scope and timing of fiscal adjustment, and recognition and servicing of contingent
liabilities and stock of arrears. The baseline debt path remains vulnerable to unfavorable shocks to real
GDP growth and the primary balance.
1.
Central Government debt has more than doubled in the last two years. The debt-to-GDP
ratio increased from 6 percent in 2013 to 14 percent in 2015. Figures 1 and 2 show that debt to
external bilateral creditors constitute the largest share of total debt (51 percent), notably large
disbursements under bilateral loan agreements with China to finance infrastructure projects linked to
the national development plan. Most of the new debt drawings have been from domestic sources,
mainly statutory advances from the central bank, which now constitutes the second largest
component (46 percent, Text Figure 1).
2.
Staff’s baseline scenario anticipates fiscal deficits widening in 2016–17 and declining
thereafter (Figure 1). They are expected to be financed by drawing on externally-held deposits and
new external debt accumulation. The central government debt-to-GDP ratio is therefore projected to
rise from 14 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2021. Debt dynamics are driven unfavorably by the
primary deficits, the decline in economic activity and high real interest rates. These developments
underscore the need for stronger fiscal adjustment, deeper efforts to improve the business
environment and public resource allocation so as to raise economic growth.

3.
Gross financing needs would increase from 4 percent of GDP in 2015 to about
7.5 percent in 2016, before subsiding over time to5.2 percent of GDP in 2021. The estimated
debt-stabilizing primary balance is 2.2 percent of GDP. Under the baseline scenario, the primary
balance is expected to remain negative during 2014–21. An alternative scenario shows that the debt
path and financing needs would be worse if the primary balance were to remain constant at its 2015
level (Figure 2). Significant risks remain, including the following: (i) possible delays in the scope and
timing of fiscal adjustment; (ii) higher-than-expected increases in regional and domestic interest
rates; and (iii) recognition and servicing of contingent liabilities and the stock of arrears, which are
not well recorded and could be sizeable. Most importantly, the central bank has limited scope to
finance the government given the fixed exchange rate regime and the low level of reserves.
4.
The stress test scenarios confirm the high vulnerability of debt and financing needs to
shocks to real GDP growth and the primary balance, with the greatest sensitivity to shocks
coming from real GDP growth. With the exception of the real exchange rate shock, all other stress
tests would push the debt-to-GDP ratio above 45 percent by 2021, with shocks to real GDP growth
alone pushing it to about 55 percent by 2021, and shocks to the primary balance to 49 percent
by 2021. Shocks to the exchange rate would worsen the debt path moderately. That the central
government’s debt is mostly held by non-residents increases the risks from external shocks, although
this is partly mitigated by the CFA franc peg.
External Debt
5.
Equatorial Guinea’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has increased in recent years but is still
low level. As a share of GDP, external debt was 7.6 percent at end-2015, up from a low of
4.8 percent at end 2014 (Figure 5 and Table 1). The main reason for the increase has been a rise in
central government borrowing from China.
6.
External debt is projected to increase in the medium term. Under the baseline scenario,
external debt would continue to steadily rise to 26 percent of GDP by 2021 before stabilizing as
government financing needs abate. External debt may increase above the current baseline if the
government increases reliance on external financing (including multilateral loans) to help fund
infrastructure projects.
7.
External sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more sensitive
to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 5). A 30 percent real depreciation in 2017
would almost double the external debt-to- GDP ratio to about 22 percent in 2017 and would reach
40 percent in 2021. A further deterioration in the current account balance from the current level
would have the largest impact—a ¼ standard deviation shock would introduce debt dynamics such
that the external debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 63 percent by 2021 and increases beyond the 5-year
projection period. However, an adverse shock of this size would almost certainly require a significant
(in U.S. dollar terms) drop in energy prices from their already current low levels.

Authorities’ Views
8.
The authorities broadly concurred that debt levels have been rising rapidly, and that
there is need to undertake fiscal consolidation to avoid unsustainable debt dynamics While
recognizing the magnitude of the external shock that they are facing, they pointed to their efforts to
bring down the deficit during 2015 and the fiscal measures that they are undertaking to increase
non-resource revenue and curb spending.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government
2/ Based on available data.
3/ The continuous decline of GDP deflator is driven by a decreasing trend of oil and gas prices.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP
deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency
value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae (1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last
projection year.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR): Not Applicable
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the Catastrophe
Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.

Safeguard Assessments: The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank
of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). For the BEAC, governance
challenges and control failures, which emerged in 2009, led to close engagement subsequently
through annual IMF monitoring of safeguards “rolling measures.” A safeguards staff visit to the
BEAC conducted in April 2016 found that although the BEAC’s own Reform and Modernization Plan
was nearing completion, the IMF’s two priority recommendations on governance-focused law
reform and the transition to an internationally recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS) were
outstanding. However, following the April 2016 visit, the BEAC’s Board of Directors mandated that
the institution take steps to initiate work on the priority recommendations. Staff has now revised the
road map for implementation with an envisaged conclusion of the law reform in early 2017 and
adoption of IFRS beginning with the financial statements for 2018. Staff will maintain close
engagement with the BEAC to monitor the implementation of the remaining safeguards measures
going forward, and progress on the latter will remain a condition for new program requests and
reviews for CEMAC member countries.
Exchange System: The regional currency is the CFA franc, which has been pegged to the euro at
the rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro, since the euro was introduced in 1999.
Equatorial Guinea has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3 and 4 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Article IV Consultations: Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation
cycle. The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by the Executive Board
on July 20, 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
EQUATORIAL GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 26, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (continued)
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. National
accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of payments data are all deficient in quality,
timing, and coverage. Poor centralization of information between the island and continental regions is
also an issue.
National Accounts: On July 21, 2016 the National Statistics Institute (INEGE) released a new series of
national accounts for the period 2006–13. The new series was prepared with the assistance of the
World Bank, AFRISTAT, and AFRITAC Central, using the System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA)
methodology. Data sources still need to be improved for more reliable and comprehensive GDP
estimates. A housing and population census coupled with an agricultural census, and an enterprise
census were conducted in 2015. Household survey and employment survey are also planned.
Price statistics: Compilation of the official CPI resumed in January 2009, with data collected in five
major cities. However, a number of deficiencies remain, including outdated weights and composition
of the basket of goods and services, and gaps in the time series corresponding to the period for which
data was not collected (2008). Imputations for missing data do not always reflect underlying trends.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide budget execution data to the Fund, but these
are limited in detail (with, for example, a poor delineation between capital and current spending and
no functional classification) and are not fully reconciled with the monetary accounts. The fiscal data are
not subject to any internal process of verification because weak audit capability. The authorities have
yet to appoint additional residential advisors for public finance, budgeting, and accounting following
advice from the Fiscal Affairs Department. Gains in transparency were made temporarily through the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative process, with a reconciliation report posted on the World
Bank website in March 2010 that included hydrocarbon revenue data and information on state owned
oil companies, but no subsequent information has been published.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics for the central bank and other depository corporations are
reported to the Fund by the Banque des États de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the
format of the standardized report forms (SRFs). The depository corporation survey does not include
data from deposit-taking microfinance institutions. It is hoped to include data in the future on interest
rates offered by the financial institutions sector to non-financial entities on deposits and loans.
Financial sector surveillance: In March 2016, Equatorial Guinea began reporting financial soundness
indicators for deposit taking institutions.

Balance of payments: The National Directorate of the Bank of Central African States is responsible
for the compilation of the balance of payments statistics of Equatorial Guinea. The BEAC produces
balance of payments data for its monetary programming exercise, but these largely rely on
estimations. Trade transactions processing and data compilation are complicated by the fact that
customs authorities do not use a computerized system. For example, no data on merchandise imports
are made available. The balance of payments statistics mission of March 2013 noted the severe
capacity constraints at the National Directorate and the need for staff training as well as the
improvement of institutional arrangements in the country to support the production of external
sector statistics.

II. Data Standards and Quality
An STA mission visited Equatorial Guinea in
June 2016 to assist the country’s preparation to
participate in the e-GDDS.

Equatorial Guinea has not yet received a mission
to produce the data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (data ROSC).

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Real sector statistics are reported to STA for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
with a long lag and are limited to GDP (without breakdown by sector or expenditure category), and
exports, and imports. The authorities agreed to submit CPI data for the IFS publication and STA is
communicating with the authorities regarding the procedure. The BEAC reports monetary, interest
rates, and exchange rate statistics for publication in the IFS, but delays are persistent (currently the lag
is about three months). Due to capacity constraints, balance of payments data are not submitted to
STA for publication in the IFS or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The latest year for which
balance of payments data are available is 1996. Equatorial Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA
for publication in the IFS or the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
August 29, 2016
Our Equatorial Guinean authorities would like to thank staff for the productive discussions
during the 2016 Article IV consultation in Malabo. The authorities highly appreciate the
advice, and the valuable technical assistance provided by the Fund and they have taken steps
to implement a number of IMF policy recommendations, as indicated in the staff report.
Equatorial Guinea has made significant progress in fostering economic development and
improving social indicators over the past decade under the National Development Plan Horizonte 2020. As a result, the country is among those that enjoy the highest average per
capita incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Major inroads have been made toward the Millennium
Development Goals, notably those related to the rate of literacy, infant mortality, and
maternal deaths. In this light, the incidence of poverty has declined substantially from 77
percent in 2006 to an estimated level of less than 50 percent in 2011. Moreover, improved
and scaled up infrastructure all over the country has also enhanced the long term prospects of
the economy.
However, the sharp decline in oil prices and production coupled with weak global economic
growth have complicated achievement of the authorities’ ambitious development and
structural transformation objectives by putting the medium-term prospects at risk. To address
the country’s high dependence on hydrocarbon revenues and falling fiscal buffers, the
authorities have adjusted their development program and have taken several policy actions to
ensure fiscal sustainability and increase non-hydrocarbon revenues. They broadly concur
with staff’s analysis and the main policy recommendations to address the challenges facing
the economy and bring it back on the path of recovery.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Real GDP in 2015 is estimated to have declined by 7.4 percent, mainly due to decline in oil
revenues, owing both to drop in prices and production. Inflation is estimated to have declined
to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 4 percent in 2014. Activity in the
non-hydrocarbon sector was also weak as public investment and activity in the construction
sector declined. Given the continued decline in the hydrocarbon sector and lower public
investment since the beginning of this year, real GDP is projected to contract by about 10
percent in 2016, and would remain negative over the medium term. However, the authorities
expect to reverse the pace of contraction through the implementation of the second phase of
the National Development Program, which focuses on the non-hydrocarbon sector and the
development of the private sector and human resources.
The overall fiscal deficit was reduced to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 reflecting the fiscal
adjustment efforts made by the authorities notably through measures aimed at mobilizing

2
non-resource revenues and freezing new capital spending. Public sector debt rose slightly at
the end-2015, while the deposit buffer was reduced by 1.9 percent of GDP due to the
government needs to finance the deficit.
The external current account deficit increased to about 17 percent of GDP in 2015 driven by
the decline in the hydrocarbon sector and higher imports related to the public investment
program, with reserves covering 6.4 months of prospective imports. It is expected that the
current account deficit will be reduced to 11.8 percent of GDP in 2016 with further
improvements over the medium term.
II. OUTLOOK AND POLICIES
The Equatorial Guinean authorities are cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead and the
need to address the continued decline in oil prices. In this regard, they are taking further steps
to sustain the fiscal adjustment efforts while preserving pro social development, and speed up
reforms aimed at developing the non-hydro carbon sector and improving the business climate
and strengthening human capital.
A. Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain committed to fiscal consolidation and have stepped up efforts to
tackle the adverse impact of the oil price shock. In this regard, a wide range of measures are
being implemented.
On the revenue side, the authorities are taking necessary steps to accelerate the
implementation of key measures to boost non-oil revenue collection, including the
operationalization of the Large Taxpayer Unit, introduction of a single taxpayer identification
number, streamlining tax filing procedures and exemptions, and boosting customs collection.
They are finalizing customs clearance procedures for the installation of ASYCUDA World
software. They are also considering a comprehensive tax policy review as recommended by
staff, and for which IMF technical assistance will be useful.
On the expenditure front, further measures to sustain spending adjustment of around 2
percent of GDP per year will be taken. The authorities agree with staff that reforms should
focus on the Public Investment Program (PIP) with the aim of curbing the PIP by half over
three years. Already, since 2014, the PIP budget has been reduced by 30 percent and the
authorities are working closely with the World Bank to actively monitor and manage the PIP.
In spite of the shocks to the economy, and the recent increase in public debt, Equatorial
Guinea’s debt remains manageable. The fiscal consolidation measures being undertaken will
help to contain further the debt ratio. Moreover, the ongoing efforts to restructure the
economy away from hydrocarbons will also serve the same purpose by bringing in additional

3
revenue over the medium term. The authorities are also addressing the issue of arrears, and
are currently discussing a plan with suppliers and commercial banks to address them. Going
forward the authorities stand ready to take necessary measures to preserve debt sustainability.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector
Equatorial Guinea forms part of the Central African Monetary Union and monetary policy is
implemented at the regional level through the BEAC, the regional central bank. The
currency union exchange rate, which is pegged to the Euro, continues to serve Equatorial
Guinea well, and has been an important source of macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the
accommodative monetary policy of the regional bank has also been very helpful to the
Equatorial Guinean economy as it has contributed to the authorities’ efforts to adjust to the
hydrocarbon revenues’ shock.
Despite the oil price shock, Equatorial Guinea’s financial sector remains well-capitalized,
liquid and resilient to solvency and liquidity shocks. However, given the slowing economic
activity, nonperforming loans remain high and profit has declined.
The Equatorial Guinean authorities are working on a plan to make the country a regional
financial hub. In this regard, they are undertaking key structural reforms in the financial
sector that will boost the sector’s resilience to shocks, while promoting financial inclusion
and supporting private sector development. Measures already implemented, include, staff
capacity building, finalization of internal regulations and reporting standards. In addition, a
regional peer review of Equatorial Guinea’s AML/CFT legal framework against the 2003
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard is being conducted, and the authorities are
working towards full implementation of CEMAC’s AML/CFT framework.
Going forward, the authorities will continue to pursue efforts to maintain adequate capital
buffers and deepen the banking sector at the same time, they will continue to collaborate
closely with regional authorities to strengthen bank supervision and closely monitor potential
adverse spillovers.
C. Structural and Data Reforms
The authorities will continue their efforts to diversify the economy and make it less
dependent on the hydrocarbon sector. In this regard, they are focusing their efforts on
promoting agriculture, fisheries, and the financial sectors. The authorities are implementing
measures aimed at improving the nonoil sector’s competitiveness and fostering private sector
activity. In this regard, the authorities: (i) intend to establish a national committee composed
of representatives of the chambers of commerce, educational institutions, banks and several
members of the government by end-2016 to spearhead reforms, (ii) build eight vocational
schools to train youth and foster technical education, and (iii) develop a tourism sector policy

4
to leverage recently constructed hotel facilities, building on the expertise of foreign
professionals.
To improve the business climate, the authorities are working closely with the World Bank to
conclude discussions on business climate diagnostics and reforms. They also plan to launch a
“one-stop-shop” by 2017 to facilitate investor entry. in addition, the authorities plan to
establish a CFAF 100 billion Co-investment Fund to support small and medium enterprises
in non-oil sectors.
The authorities have also made significant efforts to establish and strengthen the capacity of
the National Statistical Institute, which is starting to bear fruits. A high quality National
Statistical Development strategy has been developed. With the assistance of the World Bank
and AFRITAC, the authorities have compiled national accounts using a new base year (2006)
and improved the methodology. This will go a long way toward addressing staff’s call for
improving statistical data. They have also completed a legislative package that defines the
legal framework of the statistical system, and completed a population census in 2015.
Furthermore, Equatorial Guinea has subscribed to the enhanced General Data Dissemination
System (e-GDDS) of the IMF.
The authorities value the TA support from its partners, specifically or especially the IMF and
will continue efforts to address remaining data issues, notably, the acceleration of INEGE
capacity building program, compilation and reporting of International Investment Position
data, creation of metadata, and development of SYDONIA World software.
III. CONCLUSION
The decline in oil prices has added to the challenges facing Equatorial Guinea, and the
authorities are implementing wide-ranging measures to address them. In particular, they are
strengthening the fiscal adjustment efforts and are putting in place a strategy to diversify the
economy away from hydrocarbons, and strengthening the private sector. In this endeavor,
they will continue to rely on the advice and assistance of the Fund and development partners.
