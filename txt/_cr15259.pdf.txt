IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
with St. Vincent and the Grenadines

On February 6, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and considered and endorsed
the staff appraisal without a meeting2.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ economic recovery from the global economic crisis has been
curbed by a series of significant natural disasters. These, combined with the economic downturn
following the global financial crisis, have prevented the economy from returning to its long-run
potential real GDP growth. Although a modest recovery had begun in 2011, it has been virtually
halted by severe flooding and landslides in December 2013 that caused massive damage to
infrastructure, housing and agriculture, and a severe drought in the second quarter of 2014. After
an estimated 1.1 percent growth rate in 2014, growth is projected to pick up modestly to 2.1
percent in 2015 on improvements in tourism and agriculture and enhanced implementation of
much-needed rehabilitation and reconstruction projects.
The overall fiscal balance is estimated to have narrowed to 4.75 percent of GDP in 2014. Part of
the reason is revenue outperformance due to improvements in tax collection and significant oneoff revenues. However, most of the deficit reduction is due to under-execution of the capital
budget, apart from rebuilding houses for those most impacted by the floods. Domestic arrears are
rising amid a tightening of domestic financing conditions, which may pose a serious headwind to
economic activity.
Risks to short term growth are to the downside due to uncertainty about the authorities’ capacity
to implement fully the needed development projects. In the medium term, growth has upside
potential as the completion of the new international airport may have a larger-than-projected
impact on tourism, although significantly larger than average natural disasters are a downside
risk.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials and private sector
participants the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a proposal can be
considered without convening formal discussions.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 23, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Economic outlook: St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ economic recovery from the global
economic crisis has been curbed by a series of significant natural disasters, while
rehabilitation and reconstruction costs have pushed current account and fiscal deficits
higher. After an estimated 1.1 percent growth rate in 2014, growth is projected to pick
up modestly to 2.1 percent in 2015 on a pickup in tourism, agriculture and enhanced
implementation of much-needed rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. Risks to
short term growth are to the downside due to uncertainty about the authorities’ capacity
to implement fully the needed development projects. In the medium term, growth has
upside potential as the completion of the new international airport may have a largerthan-projected impact on tourism, with significantly larger than average natural disasters
a downside risk.
Policy Challenges: A stronger medium-term fiscal consolidation effort will be critical to
build much needed fiscal space, not least in case of future natural disasters. Measures to
ensure fiscal sustainability include improving the efficiency of revenue collection,
eliminating domestic arrears, and reducing current spending as a share of GDP.
Structural reforms, to ease the costs of doing business and increase agricultural
productivity, are critical to improving competitiveness and ensuring medium-term
growth and current account sustainability. Improving resilience to adverse weather
events will help reduce tail risks to growth and fiscal sustainability.
Policy response to past advice: The authorities have made some progress in
implementing policies previously outlined. Tax compliance has improved significantly
and an arrears monitoring and management system has been developed. Progress has
been limited on rationalizing tax exemptions and limiting transfers to state-owned
enterprises.

CONTEXT
1.
A series of weather shocks has severely impaired St Vincent and the Grenadines’
economic recovery. These, combined with the economic downturn following the global financial
crisis, have prevented the economy from returning to robust growth. Although a modest
recovery had begun in 2011, it has been virtually halted by severe flooding and landslides in
December 2013 that caused massive damage to infrastructure, housing and agriculture, and a
severe drought in the second quarter of 2014.
2.
The Fund has provided significant emergency assistance to address the resultant
balance of payments needs. Most recently, in August 2014, the IMF’s Executive Board approved
a disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 4.15 million (US$6.4 million), drawn equally from
the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) at SDR 2.075 million
(US$3.2 million each).1
3.
Imbalances have widened due to the shocks as well as the construction of an
international airport. Imports for building the airport and for disaster reconstruction have led to
a widening of fiscal and current account deficits. Combined with weak growth, this increased the
public sector debt to GDP ratio by more than 20 percentage points from 2007, to 75.1 percent in
2014.

reconstruction projects has pushed some capital
expenditures into the future, constraining the public sector’s contribution to growth in 2014.

In May 2009, St. Vincent and the Grenadines received assistance under the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF-RAC)
in an amount equal to 45 percent of quota (SDR 3.74 million) to help mitigate the adverse impact of the global
slowdown on the economy. In February 2011, the IMF’s Executive Board approved a request from the authorities
for emergency assistance under the RCF for SDR2.075 million (25 percent of quota) after Hurricane Tomas. In July
2011, the Board approved a request for emergency assistance under the RCF for SDR1.245 million (15 percent of
quota), following torrential rains, flooding and landslides in April 2011 (IMF Country Report No. 14/360).

Moreover, uncertainty surrounding the timing of the completion of the new airport has delayed
complementary private sector investment. Risks to the GDP estimate are to the downside and
hinge mainly on airport construction. These construction plans were heavily back-loaded into the
fourth quarter (consistent with the phasing in 2012), but if it turns out fourth quarter
construction fell short then growth could be considerably lower. Average inflation is estimated to
have fallen to 0.2 percent (from 0.8 percent in 2013) despite the supply-side impact of the floods.
5.
The overall fiscal balance is estimated
to have narrowed to 4¾ percent of GDP in
2014 on higher-than-anticipated revenues
and under-execution of the capital budget.
The revenue outperformance is due to
improvements in tax collection and significant
one-off revenues, such as increased import duty
concessions for rebuilding. However, most of the
deficit reduction is due to under-execution of
the capital budget, apart from rebuilding houses
for those most impacted by the floods (Text
table). Capital spending is now estimated at EC$
147 million compared to a budgeted EC$330
million (including a supplementary budget
following the floods).

Financial soundness indicators deteriorated slightly, with the erosion concentrated
in smaller banks. Non-performing loans (NPLs) rose to nearly 9 percent of total loans in 2014,
Q2, although the ratio has been fairly low and stable for indigenous banks, it remains high for
one foreign bank. Provisioning has declined from 34.8 percent of NPLs in 2013 to 27.2 percent in
2014 Q2. The tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio was 17.8 percent (2014 Q2), well above
regulatory requirements, although this masks some variation, with one bank just marginally
above the minimum.

9.
The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has closely monitored the non-bank financial
sector and stabilized the Building and Loan Association (BLA) through active management
of NPLs and recapitalization.3 The recapitalization entailed the conversion of matured and
delinquent redeemable shares into permanent shares and the purchase of additional permanent
shares by existing shareholders, so that all costs were borne by shareholders. Moreover, deposit
maturities were rescheduled to improve the liquidity situation of the BLA. In 2013, the BLA made
a profit, albeit modest, for the first time in several years. It remains under the enhanced
supervision of the FSA. In addition, the FSA has conducted onsite examinations of all credit
unions over the last two years, which has led to re-capitalization plans for three of them and to a
successful process of consolidation.

2

The sector is fairly concentrated, with the largest credit union having a 54 percent market share.

The Financial Services Authority took control of the Building and Loan Association (BLA) on February 1, 2013
due to runs on the BLA’s deposits following a media rumor about its imminent collapse.

Progress has been made to limit the adverse consequences of the failures of the
insurance companies CLICO and BAICO on local savers, but negative spillovers persist. The
third and final phase of the ECCU Policyholders’ Relief Program started in November 2013 and is
expected to be concluded with the full receipt of funds committed by the government of
Trinidad and Tobago.4 Despite the financial assistance provided by the ECCU governments, the
magnitude of the shock on local wealth has been regarded as a significant cause of the
slowdown of local private investment.
11.
The current account deficit is estimated to have declined slightly in 2014 to
29.4 percent of GDP, but remains high (Box 1). The decline is due primarily to a fall in imports
given lower international food and fuel prices and lower than expected implementation of capital
expenditure projects. FDI inflows have fallen in parallel, resulting in lower imports of construction
materials.
Box 1. Why is the Current Account Deficit So High?
The current account deficit in St. Vincent has increased considerably since the early 2000s, averaging
about 30 percent of GDP. However, most of the
Current Account Deficit and Sources of Finance
deficit is financed with non-debt creating flows that
(In percent of GDP)

cumulating so far to some EC$100 million (2008 through October 2014), and accounting for about 1.5
percent of GDP over the last two years. Once the airport is complete, imports should decline accordingly,
and the consequent expected boost to tourism and related industry exports should also help narrow the
current account deficit over the medium term.

4 The ECCU Policyholders Relief Program was established by ECCU Governments to provide some financial
assistance for individuals holding annuities issued by BAICO in exchange for the termination of their policies and
the extinguishment of their relative rights. The first two phases, now completed, covered policies of EC$30,000 or
less and cost EC$23.4 million (1.2 percent of GDP). The third phase compensates policy holders with balances
over EC$ 30,000.

Box 1. Why is the Current Account Deficit So High? (Concluded)
The increase in international oil prices until the recent swoon also played a role, contributing a third of
the current account deficit since 2000, with the fuel import bill more than doubling from 2000 to 2013 to
over 8 percent of GDP. The projected fuel price decline (to an average of about US$51 per barrel) will lower
the current account deficit by about 1.6 percent of

Repatriation of profits abroad has declined
significantly since the onset of the global
recession. Between 1993 and 2008 the return on
FDI averaged 3.3 percent of GDP, but has since
declined steadily to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013.
This is a consequence of the lack of recovery in the
tourism sector. However, with gradual recovery in
the main tourism source markets (the US, the UK,
and Canada) and the opening of the new airport,
the return on FDI is expected to return to historical
levels by 2019.

Between 2010 and 2012 a significant portion of the current account deficit was financed by government long
term loans (in 2010) and other investments (in 2011-12).

FDI in St. Vincent, compared to other countries, is lumpy relative to the size of the economy. The standard
deviation of the FDI to GDP ratio in St. Vincent is 6.6, while the average in the world is 3.6, in other small states is
4.2 and in the ECCU is 5.4.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Economic activity is expected to recover over the medium term, in particular as the
new airport becomes operational. After an estimated 1.1 percent growth rate in 2014, growth
is projected to pick up modestly to 2.1 percent in 2015 on a pickup in tourism, agriculture and
enhanced implementation of much-needed rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. The
baseline scenario is predicated on the authorities’ intention to reach a primary surplus of 2
percent of GDP by 2019. The expected recovery in tourist arrivals, in particular from North
America, will help the economy to converge to a higher level of output. Investment related to
tourism is expected to pick up once there is a greater degree of confidence on the timing of the
airport coming into operation, currently expected by 2016 under the staff’s baseline scenario.
Tourism should also be boosted by an upgrading of existing tourism facilities and declining
energy prices. Agriculture should also pick up, notably the banana sector as the cultivated area is
expanded and mandatory certification standards for export to the UK are implemented.
13.
Risks to growth are to the downside in the short term but to the upside over the
medium term. In the short term, weak implementation could slow the airport and other public
capital projects, although debt levels would be lower than projected. There is also a significant
increase in the domestic financing requirement for 2015 that could constitute a challenge in view

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

of recent indicators of a reduction in appetite for domestic longer-term securities.5 Persistent
weakness in external demand could also slow growth, as could the potential for a reduction of
concessional financing associated with Venezuela’s PetroCaribe arrangement. Natural disasters
remain a critical source of potential shocks, but staff’s baseline builds in some conservatism by
incorporating past natural disasters in calculating potential output.6 Staff also sees its
assumptions regarding the airport’s impact on growth as relatively cautious.
14.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that St. Vincent’s risk of external
debt distress remains moderate under the baseline.7 The baseline assumes that the authorities
generate primary surpluses averaging 2 percent of GDP over the medium term, in accordance
with their policy intentions under the RCF/RFI. Capital expenditure gradually falls from 7 percent
of GDP in 2015 to 5 percent in 2017 as flood rehabilitation and reconstruction winds down.
Domestic arrears (which are included in domestic debt figures) gradually decline and are
assumed fully eliminated by 2018. The baseline also assumes significant external and domestic
financing in 2015 and 2016 to finalize the airport. Under these assumptions, public sector debt
would fall to 75 percent of GDP by 2020, down from a peak of 79.1 percent in 2017 (Tables 9 and
10). This would bring St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the ECCU debt-to-GDP target of 60
percent only by 2031.

recommended consolidation that would yield a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP by 2018.

be greater enforcement of existing tax laws,
including ensuring that institutions that benefit from tax exempt status receive those exemptions
only on those activities specifically granted under the law. Additional fiscal consolidation would
be needed if a new natural disaster were to hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Staff and the
authorities discussed a scenario in which a somewhat larger than average-sized natural disaster
hits in 2016. Based on an emergency policy response in line with past experience, and an
additional 0.5 percent of GDP fiscal effort, staff projected that the public debt-to-GDP ratio
would reach 60 percent of GDP by 2026 instead of 2025.9
18.
The authorities broadly agreed on the need to build fiscal buffers and were open to
considering a range of fiscal measures to do so, although they did not commit to specific
timetables for adoption:


Reducing tax exemptions: There is scope to eliminate tax exemptions on non-wage sources
of income, such as rents. In addition, credit unions’ exemption from corporate taxation
could be limited to their core activities as originally intended, rather than being given
blanket exemptions even as they expand into commercial bank-like activities.



Increasing customs charges: Customs charges could be increased from 4 percent to
6 percent, generating an estimated EC$ 16 million annually.

9

The probability of at least one damaging natural disaster over the next 5 years is estimated at 52.3 percent, with
average damages calculated at 3.5 percent of GDP. However, in the context of a risk analysis, staff modeled an
event that would have damages of 5.1 percent of GDP. Such a scenario assumes the government responds to the
disaster with increases in capital expenditures and in transfers, subsidies and tax exemptions for affected
households, in line with past experience. It also assumes donors increase grants by 0.4 percent of GDP in 2016
and 2017. The immediate impact on GDP growth would be a reduction from 3.1 percent to 2.2 percent. Under
this scenario, the Government would need additional consolidation measures starting in 2018 to reach a primary
surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2019. These could include additional efforts beyond the active policies scenario to
reduce the wage bill by a further 0.3 percent of GDP and increase taxes on licenses and stamp duties by an extra
0.2 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES



Imposing a broad hiring freeze: The authorities intend to keep the size of the civil service
unchanged in 2015, with the exception of creating a small number of additional positions in
the customs service and police. Wage rates are intended to remain virtually flat.



Increase information sharing between IRD and CED: Upgrading IRD’s IT system is required in
order to be able to share taxpayers’ information with the CED. This is expected to enhance
VAT receipts.



Enhancing the legal capacity of revenue agencies and the National Insurance Service (NIS):
Revenue agencies lack the legal capacities to enforce payment of fines and judgments, while
the NIS lacks the legal capacity to enforce the collection of contributions. The authorities
intend to support capacity development in these agencies.



Making self-employed contributions to the NIS compulsory: Risks to the NIS’s long-term
sustainability include declining contributions, a falling number of contributors and limited
investment opportunities. Staff emphasized that such contributions of the self-employed
should be compulsory, to recover contributors lost since the global financial crisis as more
self-employed move into the informal sector. While the authorities agreed in principle, they
argued that enhancing the legal capacity of the NIS was a higher priority in the short-term, to
recover past-due contributions.



Settling arrears: Clearing arrears would likely improve the culture of tax compliance in the
long run. In view of arrears owed by the private sector on their tax obligations, the authorities
are considering a systematic netting of obligations via exchanges of checks. Where arrears
will not be cleared expeditiously in cash, the authorities would issue debt securities, as they
did in 2013 and 2014.

19.
Staff urged the authorities to implement recent TA recommendations to formulate
a well-specified medium-term framework to anchor fiscal adjustment. While the authorities
produce multiyear budget estimates, estimates for the outer years are mere incremental
adjustments to current budget year figures. Staff also encouraged the authorities to explicitly
incorporate the risk of future natural disasters in their framework. While the authorities agreed in
principle, they did not indicate a timeframe for the implementation.
20.
While welcoming the recently implemented parametric reforms of the NIS pension
system, staff advocated further reforms. In particular, a separate public service pension system
needs to be merged into the NIS to ease the long-term burden on public finances. The
authorities agreed and intend to go forward with the reform, but noted that existing participants
need to be grandfathered.

B. Improving Competitiveness and Sustaining Growth
21.
The real effective exchange rate shows signs of overvaluation, but the fact that
tourism is lagging behind neighboring countries in the ECCU currency union suggests
other factors are at play in the country’s competitiveness (Box 2). A combination of
measures is needed to improve competitiveness and growth.
Box 2. Competitiveness and External Sustainability
CGER-type methodologies show signs of overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate (REER). The
macro-balance (MB) approach shows overvaluation of 63 percent, and the external sustainability (ES)
approach indicates that stabilizing the net foreign asset position of St. Vincent would require a real
depreciation of 30 percent. On the other hand, the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests there
is no misalignment. At the ECCU level, the various CGERtype methodologies indicate the real exchange rate is
overvalued by 4 to 32 percent.

22.
The authorities’ growth strategy is three pronged. First, while the new airport is the
linchpin of the tourism strategy (Box 3), other elements include the development of a Maritime
and Hospitality Institute and the introduction of minimum standards for tourism sector
operators. Second, educational services for export are being developed, including offshore
medical schools (there are currently four, with a total of over 600 students) and a new
Community College program to teach English as a Second Language. Third, agriculture is being
revived after the recent string of natural disasters. Staff welcomed the overall strategy, further
advocating fostering closer collaboration between tourism and agriculture to reduce the import
needs of hotels and restaurants.
23.
Staff recommended keeping labor costs in line with productivity gains to enhance
competitiveness. In this context, staff welcomed the introduction of annual labor surveys
starting in 2015 to track unit labor costs and productivity and inform policy decisions. Given the
influence of the public sector collective bargaining agreements on private sector wages, it will be
important for the government to contain wage increases.

Box 3. Estimated Economic Impact of the International Airport
The coming into operation of Argyle International Airport is likely to constitute a turning point for
the Vincentian economy. Construction commenced in August 2008 and the authorities expect the airport
to become operational by mid-2015. The total cost is estimated at EC$700 million (US$260 million), about ⅓
of 2014 GDP. The airport is expected to affect potential output directly (via higher stay-over arrivals and new
tourism-related investment) and indirectly (via spillovers to construction, financial intermediation, agriculture
and manufacturing).
Recent studies suggest tourist arrivals from advanced economies to small islands increase
dramatically in response to the addition of direct flights. The literature (see e.g. Culiuc, 2014) shows that
economic development in peripheral regions benefits extensively from direct connections to main global
economic hubs. This is particularly true for small island states since the high level of competition in the
tourism industry makes these countries very sensitive to the introduction of direct flights.
Staff estimates that a 1 percent growth in tourist stay-over arrivals would lead to a 0.4 percent
increase in real GDP. This is despite the relatively low direct contribution of tourism to total GDP (6.2
percent of GDP in 2013), since the total economic contribution of tourism to GDP is estimated to be
considerably higher (26.2 percent). This is consistent with estimated results for other Caribbean islands (see
Croes, 2011, and Ridderstaat, Croes and Peter, 2013). In turn, staff estimated in a simple regression model
that a 1 percent change in tourist arrivals would lead to a 1.6 percent increase in tourism value added. The
results are robust to different econometric specifications.
Staff anticipates that the airport could increase tourist arrivals by 10 percent yearly over the three
years following its completion, with a cumulative impact on real GDP up to 4.2 percent. Based on
discussions with air carriers, the authorities expect to add up to eight direct flights: six from North America
and two from Europe. In order to account for downside risks, staff’s assumption was considerably more
conservative, with one direct weekly flight added in each of 2015, 2016, and 2017. While growth in stay-over
arrivals may be curbed by a limited supply of rooms and delays in construction projects, historical data
suggest there is potential to accommodate up to a 38 percent increase in tourist arrivals with the current
room capacity.

It is important to reduce the cost of energy to maintain competitiveness. The high
cost of energy is related primarily to the difficulties of achieving economies of scale in power
generation, particularly in a multi-island context. For the most part, the full costs of imported
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

energy are passed on to consumers so that price signals are effectively transmitted to end users,
and the plant and equipment used to generate electricity is reportedly fairly modern and
efficient. Thus, the main prospect for reducing the cost of energy appears to be the development
of alternative energy sources, most notably geothermal, which is currently under active study
(hydroelectricity is expected to remain an important part of the energy generation mix). At the
moment, the scope for solar power and natural gas appears to be limited until more cost
effective methods of production are developed, while staff agreed with the authorities’ view that
the potential for switching to liquefied natural gas (LNG) for electricity generation is currently
limited, given the lack of infrastructure in the region. Staff welcomed the authorities’ actions to
explore geothermal generation and promote the use of solar energy, and anticipate that, if
implemented, the authorities’ energy action plan could cut electricity prices by almost ½ in the
medium term.
25.
Staff welcomed initiatives to ease the costs of doing business and increase training
for small and medium-sized enterprises. The customs department has implemented the
ASYCUDA World platform to adopt a risk-based management system. This should help reduce
clearance times and reduce costs of enforcement. However, staff urged the authorities’ to
continue streamlining clearance times as they increased during the transition period. In addition,
there is need for legislation to codify and unify procurement procedures, in order to give
businesses greater certainty and a more level playing field.
26.
The authorities agreed with staff on an urgent need to speed up the execution of
the Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) project to significantly increase productivity in
the agricultural sector. The program, sponsored by the EU, focuses on increasing banana, fruit,
vegetable and livestock production by improving the agricultural infrastructure, promoting
commercial production and marketing activities, expanding access to credit, promoting good
land use practices and environmental management, developing agro-business incubators and
strengthening public-private partnerships in the agro-business value chain. Implementation has
been very slow (only EC$2 m have been spent out of EC$35 m) because of procurement delays.

C. Building Climate Resilience
27.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is likely to experience more natural disasters due to
climate change. Small island states are more vulnerable to natural disasters than other
countries. Moreover, the effects of climate change will be felt more strongly in small islands such
as St. Vincent and the Grenadines that have large portions of their populations and
infrastructures on the coastline.
28.
Accordingly, staff welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on measure to mitigate and
adapt to climate change, and urged them to increase insurance coverage (Box 4). In addition
to ongoing programs supported by the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, the
authorities are developing programs to improve emergency response capabilities and enhance
the robustness of physical infrastructure (e.g. bridges, coastal and river defenses and slope
stabilization). Also, the government is relocating houses where necessary, enforcing compliance
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

with building codes and rezoning areas found to be at risk. The authorities purchased additional
insurance from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF).10 However, they
expressed some reservations about purchasing further insurance, noting that the parametric
nature of the insurance means that some potentially devastating events might not be covered.11
Box 4. The Economic Impact of Climate Change in St. Vincent and the Grenadines
On current trends, average global temperatures are expected to increase by over 2C by the end of
this century, leading to rising sea levels, higher intensity and devastation of hurricanes, and more
severe droughts and floods. These changes are of particular concern for small islands that have most of
their population and infrastructure on the coastline.
The likely increase in hurricane intensities will exacerbate the impacts of disasters, resulting in lower
growth rates, and higher debt levels. On average, a severe natural disaster in the ECCU (defined as one
that affects more than 1 percent of the population) is estimated to reduce growth by close to 2 percent of
GDP the year the disaster strikes, and increase debt by about 5 percentage points over 5 years (Acevedo
2014).
Coastal erosion is already a significant issue in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and will get worse
with rising sea levels. It is estimated that in parts of the country as much as 1.5 meters per year are already
lost to the sea. Much of the road network and population, and an estimated 90 percent of buildings are near
the coastline, as are tourism facilities, which are vulnerable to rapid beach erosion. The costs of relocation to
safer areas are likely prohibitive.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines derives many economic benefits from its forests and mountains;
however, there have been no systematic efforts to measure them.12 These include that mountain
catchments are used to store water and to distribute it using gravity, resulting in the lowest water tariffs in
the ECCU. Additionally, about 20 percent of electricity generation is from hydroelectricity. However, these
benefits are being impaired by changing weather patterns, with a longer dry season and a rainy season with
fewer rainy days but of higher intensity. Furthermore, the higher frequency of natural disasters has slowed
forest regeneration, negatively impacting the water cycle.
Although it is difficult to quantify the current benefits of the ecosystem, and the potential costs of
disrupting it, it is clear that climate change could impose a significant cost on St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. Hence, adaptation and mitigation measures, and building physical resilience, are vitally
important for growth and development.

CCRIF only recently started offering coverage for excessive rainfall events, which the authorities purchased in
2014. However, the coverage would have fallen far short of the actual damages in December 2013, with the
maximum payout in case of excessive rain being only US$0.8 million.
For example, a slow-moving tropical storm would probably not be covered, even though it might cause
considerably more damage than a fast-moving level one hurricane.

D. Supporting Financial Sector Development
29.
The FSA has played a critical role in stabilizing the Building and Loan Association
(BLA), but continued vigilance is needed. The authorities point to initial successes in the
unfreezing of deposits and the turning of a profit by the BLA as significant steps on the path to
its full regularization. Nonetheless, they recognize that NPLs remain high at EC$61 million (as of
November 2014) out of EC$280 million of total assets, and that there is an urgent need to
improve the credit administration process.
30.
Staff welcomes the consolidation of the credit union sector and encourages the FSA
to enhance supervision. Credit unions perform meaningful social roles for their members, as
demonstrated by their high rate of penetration in St Vincent and the Grenadines. The FSA has
actively promoted consolidation of the credit union sector in order to improve efficiency and
stability through economies of scale and diversification of the deposit base. On the other hand,
the expansion of the credit unions’ role in financial intermediation, often at the expense of banks,
requires improvements in risk-based supervision to adequately address credit unions’ risk
profiles and minimize systemic financial risk. In particular, the FSA should evaluate whether it is
appropriate for credit unions to engage in noncore activities such as business lending, given that
they are afforded certain benefits vis-à-vis commercial banks, notably, exemption from corporate
income taxes.13 The FSA noted that it has been paying closer attention to credit unions,
conducting onsite examinations on all of them over the last two years as input into the
recapitalization and consolidation process.
31.
Staff welcomed the Authorities’ intention to fully support the creation of the
Eastern Caribbean Finance Service Authority (ECFSA). The regional authority, which is
expected to become fully operational in 2015, will supervise insurance companies and pension
funds within the region. In addition, staff advocated the formation of a credit bureau to reduce
lending institutions’ costs of due diligence, thereby facilitating access to credit.
32.
The authorities have reiterated their support for the regional bank resolution and
restructuring strategy. They also concurred with staff that potential risks to financial stability
from banking sector challenges in other ECCU members should be closely monitored.

OTHER ISSUES
33.
Exchange Rate Regime: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank and a common currency
and operates as a currency board. Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged
to the US dollar at the rate of EC$2.7 per US dollar. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted

13

Credit unions were given this exemption because they were often the sole source of financing for
disadvantaged communities whose members had few assets and were unable to prove their creditworthiness.
However, they increasingly are competing with banks in a wider array of activities.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
34.
Data provision and quality needs to be improved. Data provision has significant
shortcomings in some areas, although it is broadly adequate for surveillance. Data relating to
central government accounts is generally adequate and available on a monthly basis. However,
there is a lack of timely and adequate data on the operations of state-owned enterprises that
hampers the compilation of consolidated general government accounts. Monetary data and
banking sector soundness indicators are available but with long lags and there are significant
gaps in data for the nonbank financial sector. There are also significant lags in the availability of
national accounts data and there is no systematic reporting of labor market indicators, which
hampers an assessment of real sector developments. Balance of payments data suffer from
significant weaknesses, especially capital account data, and data on the international investment
position, which is critical given the large external liabilities, is not available.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
After three years of modest recovery, growth is estimated to have been sluggish in
2014, with downside risks to the estimate. High debt levels and the currency board
arrangement limit the scope for stimulative policy responses, which, combined with weaknesses
in financial sector balance sheets, continue to weigh on growth in the near term. However,
growth should pick up over the medium term, reflecting both an increase in demand from
tourism source countries and an alleviation of the supply constraint upon the completion of the
airport. That said, a greater sense of urgency is needed with actual pro-active fiscal policy
measures to bolster confidence, and structural reforms aimed at improving competitiveness, will
be critical to support sustainable growth.
36.
The fiscal balance is estimated to be better than expected for 2014, but will remain
in deficit for a longer period than anticipated. The 2014 improvement is due in part to higherthan-anticipated revenues, but mostly to under-execution of flood-related capital projects for
which implementation will now be pushed into the outer years.
37.
Progress continues in implementing the government’s policies outlined at the time
of the RCF/RFI, disbursed in August. Tax compliance has improved significantly while an
arrears monitoring and management system has been developed. The wage bill as a percent of
GDP is intended to begin to decline in 2015. Given uncertainties about the degree to which tax
compliance will improve, the authorities should twin their intent to virtually freeze the size of the
civil service with tight wage constraints. Progress to date has been limited in rationalizing tax
exemptions and limiting transfers to state-owned enterprises. If fully implemented, staff projects
that these sets of measures would yield a primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP by 2019.
38.
A stronger medium-term fiscal consolidation effort would be critical to build much
needed fiscal space and bring forward the achievement of the ECCU’s debt-to-GDP target.
While there is considerable scope for the new airport to raise growth, it would be imprudent to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

place too much reliance on such a growth boost as the primary strategy for reducing debt ratios.
Additional fiscal measures relative to the baseline that include bringing down the wage bill by an
additional one percent of GDP, reducing transfers and subventions to public corporations by
one-half percent of GDP, and better enforcing existing tax laws should be implemented to yield a
primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP by 2018. Under this scenario, the ECCU debt target would be
met by 2025, instead of 2031 in the authorities’ baseline scenario. There is also a need for a more
credible and well specified medium-term fiscal framework to serve as an anchor for fiscal
adjustment efforts.
39.
Further reforms to the NIS are necessary. Contributions from the self-employed
should be compulsory, a reform that is already in process. In addition, government employees
receiving pension benefits in both the NIS and the government employees’ pension plan is
unsustainable and reforms will be needed, although current participants should be
grandfathered.
40.
Ongoing efforts to improve the business and investment climate should be
complemented with reforms aimed at promoting economic diversification. Efforts to foster
entrepreneurship through training and facilitating the availability of finance should be
complemented with the formation of a credit bureau to facilitate lending institutions’ credit
decisions by reducing the costs of their due diligence. Additional structural reforms could help
diversify the economy by strengthening links between tourism and other sectors, for instance
through efforts to improve the marketing of agricultural produce. In addition, procurement
legislation is needed to assure businesses of a more level playing field.
41.
A key challenge is to alleviate the high cost of energy in St. Vincent and
Grenadines. While energy pricing policy appears broadly appropriate and electricity generation
efficient given the difficulties of achieving economies of scale in a small, multi-island country, the
authorities should actively explore the potential for expanding the scope of alternative energies,
notably geothermal.
42.
Building resilience against natural disasters is an imperative given that their
intensity is likely to increase due to climate change. The authorities’ development and
implementation of programs to improve emergency response capabilities, and to enhance the
robustness of physical infrastructure, must be prioritized (and accelerated where possible) to
build up resilience in those areas most subject to setbacks from future natural disasters. In
addition, further insurance coverage should be considered.
43.
The FSA has taken steps to improve financial sector soundness, but high NPLs
remain a concern. Staff encourages the authorities to support the regional efforts to resolve
banking problems within the ECCU.
44.
The quality of data should be improved. This will require a greater focus on
institutional strengthening of the central statistical office, as well as greater enforcement of its

20

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

legal authority to collect data and greater accountability of reporting agencies. The IMF stands
ready to provide further technical assistance in this area.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

Exchange Rate Assessment: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank) and currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar
has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The exchange rate
arrangement is classified as a currency board. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), of which St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member, is subject to a full
safeguards assessment under a four-year cycle. The most recent assessment was completed on
April 16, 2012 and did not identify any significant safeguards risks. The assessment made some
recommendations to sustain and advance the ECCB’s safeguards framework going forward. The
authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations and have commenced implementation.
Article IV consultation: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is currently on a 12-month cycle. The
last Article IV consultation was concluded on February 6, 2013 by the Executive Board; the
relevant document is Country Report 14/251.
Technical Assistance: Technical assistance: Several missions from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), the Support of
Economic Management for the Caribbean (SEMCAR), and the Legal Department (LEG) have
visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of 2006 to assist the authorities. In the
area of public finance, CARTAC/LEG assisted with the introduction of the VAT and excise taxes at
all different stages. CARTAC also assisted to monitor the central government’s fiscal performance
relative to its annual targets presented in the budget. A workshop for Permanent Secretaries on
strategic budgeting reforms together with general public finance training has also been
delivered. CARTAC has provided technical assistance in statistics to develop export and import
prices, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. CARTAC has also provided technical
assistance in the areas of collection, enforcement, and projections of public finance and GDP. On
the financial front CARTAC provided technical assistance to review and upgrade the International
Insurance Act, and to develop regulations for Credit Unions. CARTAC also provided technical
assistance in conducting off-site and on-site examinations on banks in international financial
services industry. FAD provided technical assistance in improving tax administration, including
reform and modernization of both inland revenue and customs and excise tax. FAD also provided
advice on selected tax policy issues and expenditure rationalization. In CY 2011/2012, CARTAC
delivered technical assistance to review the revenue performance of the Value Added Tax and
recommended measures to enhance and safeguard VAT revenues. CARTAC also supported a
capacity building program in audit and assisted with the development of Inland Revenue
Department’s revised function-based organizational structure that resulted in a full integration of
VAT administration into mainstream IRD. In Customs, CARTAC focused on modernization of the
operations by strengthening risk management and post clearance (PCA) programs. In 2011/2012
SEMCAR assisted the authorities in introducing a performance orientation in the budget of three

ministries, reviewed the treasury and modernized the budget execution process. In addition
SEMCAR helped setting up a cash management unit and introduced cash flow forecasting. In
2013/2014, progress has been made in tax and customs administration and the authorities
already have started to implement some recommendations of the Tax Administration and the
Tax and Customs Administration missions delivered by CARTAC. Some progress has also been
made in budgeting framework after the CARTAC mission and the new 2015 Budget is set to be a
pilot. A medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) has been developed by the authorities
and is awaiting publication, after a joint IMF/World Bank mission (in collaboration with the ECCB).
Progress in supervision of non-bank financial institutions has advanced with the legislation for
the Single Regulatory Unit (SRU) passed by Parliament and its establishment already completed.
In Statistics, work on constructing expenditure based GDP has been completed but the
authorities have not yet published the new data.
FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCU, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20–31, 2003. The
missions assisted the authorities in assessing the development needs and opportunities for the
financial sector, identifying potential vulnerabilities of financial institutions and markets to
macroeconomic shocks, as well as assessing risks to macroeconomic stability from weaknesses in
the financial sector. The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) was discussed by the
Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on the IMF’s external website,
including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on Banking Supervision.
AML/CFT: With support from LEG, the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) conducted
an on-site assessment of the AML/CFT regime of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009, and
published the detailed mutual evaluation report in 2010. The country was placed under CFATF’s
enhanced follow-up process in 2013, owing to outstanding deficiencies in its AML/CFT regime.
Authorities were requested to report to the CFATF Plenary in May 2015 on progress made in
implementing its action plan to address the deficiencies.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(December 23, 2014)
World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy: On November 13, 2014, the Board of
the Executive Directors of the World Bank Group has endorsed the new OECS Regional
Partnership Strategy ((RPS) which will cover the period FY15-19. The high-level objective of the
new RPS is to contribute to lay the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth, in line with the
OECS governments’ priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the program is planned to be
organized around three main areas of engagement. Under the first one, the WBG is planning to
support “competitiveness”. Growth and job creation in the private sector will be supported both
horizontally – by improving the business environment– and vertically – by focusing on specific
sectors with a high potential to generate inclusive sustainable growth (particularly tourism,
agribusiness and their respective linkages). The second area of engagement is “public sector

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

modernization”, with particular focus on public financial management (PFM) and institutional
capacity, including for statistics and public private partnerships (PPPs), to better leverage private
investment in infrastructure and service provision. The third area is “resilience”, with the objective
to address both social vulnerabilities (in education, health and social protection), and exposure to
natural disasters.
Constrained in general by the small size of investments in the OECS, the IFC and MIGA will
contribute to the RPS objectives through selective investment support, depending on
opportunities. The IFC will focus on crisis response; job creation and inclusive growth; innovation,
competitiveness, and integration; and climate change. MIGA faces limited opportunities for
engagement because of the small market size of the OECS countries.
The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS countries is expected to be around
US$120 million, or up to a maximum of US$20 million for each OECS country for the period of
the RPS (FY15-19), subject to country and program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and
exposure management parameters. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries
(Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA
national allocation. The IDA17 (FY15-17) allocation for the OECS is equal to SDR61.3 million, an
increase of around 22 percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3 million)
World Bank Group engagement
Comprehensive Debt Framework - At the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM,
the Bank put together a Comprehensive Debt Framework that proposes a strategy for addressing
the high debt challenge faced in the OECS in a sustainable way. This Framework proposes a
holistic approach around four interdependent pillars (Supporting private sector led growth,
including private sector development and financial sector stability; Enhancing fiscal sustainability;
Improving climate change resilience and Disaster Risk Management; and Debt resolution). The
Framework is being rolled out in the OECS, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The
Government expressed interest in principle, in continue to work with the World Bank and other
development partners to develop policy measures that could help stimulate growth and reduce
debt in the country.
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF)
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multi-stakeholder platform designed to identify,
prioritize and implement a set of activities to improve the growth enabling environment in the
Caribbean, while promoting participatory public policy making. It has so far engaged more than
2,500 representatives from business associations, civil society organizations, Government, private
sector, media, indigenous groups, and international development agencies on themes such as
Logistics and Connectivity; Investment Climate; and, Skills and Productivity.
Low growth, high unemployment, especially for youth and women, high debt ratios (eight of the
top twelve most indebted countries in the world are in Caribbean), high incidence of crime, and,
growing vulnerability to external shocks characterize the region. In the wake of the global
financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative
approach to the growth challenge in the region. A suggestion was made to launch a genuinely
participatory growth initiative. Following consultations and some preparatory work, the program
started in mid-2012 with a regional launch event in Jamaica. The process is supported and
facilitated by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean
Development Bank, Compete Caribbean and the European Union.
Key Outcomes
Positive outcomes are tangible: twelve countries formally joined the process by establishing their
national CGF chapter and have completed the first phase of national dialogue. This effort has led
to the prioritization of concrete and actionable activities and draft action plans are now available,
with details on each activity’ implementation plan (e.g., accountabilities, milestones, timeline,
funding).
The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at a regional forum in The Bahamas in
June 2013. This allowed national stakeholders from government, private sector and civil society
to compare notes on each other’s’ priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to each identified
challenges with technical specialists and peers. The Bahamas Communiqué issued by the
Government of The Bahamas during the event on behalf of CGF participating countries, attested
to the commitment of all parties to inclusive and participatory policy-making, accountability and
transparency in policy implementation as well as the CGF reform process itself.
By then, each government also committed to follow-up on implementation of the reform
agenda, to report back periodically on progress (every 4-5 months) and to enable independent
monitoring of the reforms by private sector and civil society representatives.
As of June 2014, six countries have completed their First Accountability Workshop (Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada).
Projects
The Caribbean Regional Communication Infrastructure Project (CARCIP) – Phase 1, was
approved by the WB Board in May 2012 with Grenada (US$10 million IDA), St. Lucia (US$6million
IDA) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (US$6 million IDA) as participating countries. The
Dominican Republic is preparing its inclusion to CARCIP ($30m IDA), while other Caribbean
islands have formally expressed interest in joining. CARCIP is a broad umbrella program to
include all interested CARIFORUM countries. It offers a menu of choices with specific
components to be tailored to each country's priorities. The menu of options are: (a) ICT
Connectivity, to increase access and affordability of broadband communications networks within
region and countries; (b) e-Government, to contribute to improved Government efficiency and
transparency through the delivery of e-services, including e-government and e-society
applications; and (c) IT Industry, to contribute to the development of the regional and national IT
industry. The sources of financing are a mix of World Bank, CDB, IDB lending, donor grant
funding, the government's own resources and substantial amounts of private sector investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

The instrument chose for this program (APL) allows countries to join on a readiness basis. Phase
1 of CARCIP was declared effective in December 2012.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project was approved in June 2011. St. Vincent and
the Grenadines will receive a total of US$20.92 million, including a US$10.92 million zero-interest
credit from IDA repayable in 35 years with a 10-year grace period; a US$7 million grant from the
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR); and a US$3 million zero-interest loan from the PPCR
repayable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. The project aims to create understanding of
the vulnerability of key structures and increase resilience of critical public infrastructure, which
will complement the work and goals of the PPCR. Component 1 will implement a broad spectrum
of interventions aimed at building resilience in public buildings and infrastructure. Component 2
will support regional efforts in the Eastern Caribbean to build capacity to conduct assessment of
natural risks and integrate such knowledge into policy- and decision-making for development
investments, disaster risk mitigation, climate change adaptation, and disaster response planning
across sectors. Component 3 will re-categorize financing or provide additional financing to cover
early recovery and rehabilitation costs following an adverse natural event, and subject to a
Government’s declaration of emergency in accordance with national law and the submission of a
recovery action plan satisfactory to the Association. Component 4 will strengthen and develop
the institutional capacity for project management and implementation. An Additional Financing
(AF) operation of US$40.6 million was approved for St. Vincent and the Grenadines in May 2014,
increasing the Project envelope from US$20.92 million to US $61.52 million and extending the
closing date to December 31, 2018. The additional funds will scale up project activities and cover
a cost overrun, the AF would: (i) support emergency recovery and construction activities; (ii)
enhance development impact; (iii) increase the number of beneficiaries, including women; (iv)
meet an unanticipated financing gap in the Parent Project; (v) replenish the Emergency Response
Component; and (vi) allocate strengthen project management and implementation support
capacity. About 50 percent of project proceeds would be used to support the Government of St.
Vincent’s emergency recovery efforts.
Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal and
debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management
and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument
for policy dialogue with the OECS governments, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
In the context of the Support of Economic Management for the Caribbean (SEMCAR) program, a
team is working with the authorities on an Action Plan for Customs improvements and has
assessed the system by using the Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit (CATT). The CATT
assessment measures 120 high level indicators which are combined and aggregated into seven
intuitive dimensions: Process orientation, Strategic thinking, Transparency, Control, Efficiency,
Effectiveness and Facilitation. The distinctive feature of the CATT is that it is evidence base
framed by a set of international best practices which are compared against the practice that
currently is used.

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (CDB)
(As of 9 January, 2015)
In March 2014, CDB approved its latest 5-year country strategy for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines (2014-18), with a portfolio of projects estimated to cost US$86.72million with the
possibility of an additional US$14.8million. The assistance program gives priority to providing
support to: (i) accelerated, sustainable and inclusive growth; (ii) inclusive social development; and
(iii) enhanced environmental sustainability and disaster risk management. The portfolio consists
of US$21million in grants and concessionary loan resources and US$65.72 million in ordinary
capital resources.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is particularly vulnerable to economic shocks and natural hazards.
The adverse impacts of shocks continued to be felt during 2014 with major floods at the end of
December 2013 causing widespread damage to physical and economic infrastructure. In the
aftermath of this event, CDB’s assistance has focused on providing grant and loan funding to
assist with the emergency relief, recovery and rehabilitation process.
During 2014, the Bank approved loans amounting to US$9.79million to aid the Government of
St. Vincent and the Grenadines in its rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in addition to a
grant of US$0.225million to finance the cost of equipment for rainfall and stream flow
measurement, and training of hydrological technicians. Approximately 40% of the loan
(US$3.6million) is in the form of soft resources. The financing is to be used for the restoration of
critical infrastructure along the Windward and Vigie Highways; road embankment and slope
improvement; construction and rehabilitation of river defenses; the rehabilitation of sections of
the feeder road network; and for enhancing institutional capacity for planning, design and risk
reduction.
The disbursement of loans and grants to St Vincent during 2014 amounted to US$7.61 million.
Of this amount, US$6.88 million was disbursed as loans comprising US$4.518 million to the
Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to finance the South Leeward Highway road
upgrade; the rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure damaged by Hurricane
Tomas in 2011; and technical and vocational educational development, while US$2.36 million was
provided through lines of credit to the Bank of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to on-lend for

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings in
national accounts and balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: A new rebased GDP series (using 2006 as the base year instead of 1990) was
released in January 2011 with assistance from CARTAC. The new series improved coverage, data
sources, and methodology. The revision disaggregated some industries previously classified
under government into separate sectors that now include private sector activity; these are health,
education, and social development. The new series also improved the level of detail by
estimating value added for business services, computer and related services, and private
households with employed persons which were not accounted for in the previous series. A
CARTAC Mission assisted the authorities to revise the estimates of GDP by expenditure at
constant and current prices in 2013. However, improvements are needed in the coverage of
national accounts (especially expenditure based national accounts) and on data used to monitor
labor markets.
Price statistics: A new CPI index series (with January 2010 as the base) was introduced in June
2011 with assistance from CARTAC. The new index introduced updated methods and procedures
used for compiling the CPI in accordance with international standards and allows comparisons
among the ECCU member states. The new index uses a Household Budget and Expenditure
Survey (HBES) that took place in 2008, replacing the old HBES conducted in 1996, to construct an
updated CPI basket. As part of the CARTAC’s assistance with the new CPI index it helped link the
2001 based to the 2010-based CPI series.
Government finance statistics: Due to delays in reporting capital expenditures by some
ministries, monthly revenue and expenditure data for the central government are provided to the
Fund with some lag. Discrepancies exist between the fiscal and monetary accounts, between
above and below the line for budget data, and between financing and debt data. The financial
reports of public enterprises are not timely, with about a two-year lag.

Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics have been compiled and reported to the Fund by the
ECCB on a monthly basis based on a standardized report form since July 2006. The institutional
coverage of monetary statistics needs to be improved by including the accounts of nonbank
deposit takers licensed by the ECCB, credit unions, and other financial corporations. In this
respect, close coordination between the ECCB and the Financial Services Authority (which is
supervising financial institutions not licensed by the ECCB under the Banking Act) is crucial. While
noting some improvements, the 2014 MFS technical assistance mission identified the following
main shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics: (i) the methodological soundness of
monetary statistics can be improved by expanding institutional coverage (particularly of the ODC
sector), and revising the classifications of some financial instruments and sectors to align the
reporting to international standards; (ii) transparency can be improved by adopting a single
monetary survey for publication on the ECCB website and in IFS, to be released to all users at the
same time; (iii) the timeliness of the dissemination of data on broad money and credit
aggregates can be improved to meet best international practices; and (iv) the access to officially
disseminated data and metadata can be improved.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for the ECCU area are not published.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual
basis. Data reported to STA are becoming more timely, although quality, frequency and coverage
need to be improved. Quarterly estimates and the international investment position statement
are not compiled. The estimates lack sufficient detail due to the unavailability of source data, and
the statistical techniques used to estimate some components are weak. In particular, no
estimates are available on transportation services by type or mode of transport and of travel by
purpose. Further, a breakdown of portfolio and other investment by instrument or sector is not
available. There is a need to compile quarterly balance of payments estimates and the annual
international investment position statement; however, developing these new statistics will have
to be undertaken in conjunction with the ECCB, which coordinates the compilation of the
external sector statistics for all its member countries.
The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed external loans
that provides detailed and current information on disbursements, debt service, and debt stocks.
The Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two databases as well as
information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) need to be further consolidated to
produce timely debt stock data.

B. Data Standards and Quality
St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in the General Data Dissemination System since
September 2000. The metadata for the financial sector was updated in 2012, and for the real,
fiscal, external, and socio-demographic sectors – in 2011. The 2007 regional data ROSC on
monetary statistics provides an assessment of the ECCB’s monetary statistics. No data ROSC is
available for other sectors.
