EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Despite a background of civil conflict and major political upheavals,
macroeconomic performance over the past several years has been stable. Growth
has been maintained albeit at low levels, inflation has remained stable, the budget
stance has been cautious, and foreign exchange reserves are ample.

•

However, progress on structural reforms has been held back by the fragile
political environment. Vulnerabilities in the financial sector remain and could be
growing, with rapid credit growth, loose monetary conditions, and weak central bank
supervision persisting. The losses of the state oil company are mounting.

•

Unsettled political circumstances pose the most immediate risk to
macroeconomic stability and growth. Structural reform progress during the political
transition will be slow and risks from the political situation will remain significant.
The demands of the peace process could result in pressures for greater public
spending. In this environment undertaking needed structural reforms and maintaining
budget discipline will be challenging.

Key Policy Issues
•

Budget discipline is a necessary condition for preserving macroeconomic
stability. In balancing the need to increase spending in some areas while maintaining
domestic borrowing at sustainable levels, further improvements in revenue collection
are necessary. A key short-run priority is to limit and eventually eliminate the losses
of the state oil company.

•

Nepal’s peg to the Indian rupee continues to be appropriate in the near term.
While a widening productivity gap with India could present some challenges over
time for exchange rate management, now would not be the right time to consider
changing the rate or the regime.

•

The authorities should take a more active role in reaching and maintaining a
tighter monetary policy, as an overall bias toward excess liquidity has led to
negative real interest rates, rapid credit growth, potentially destabilizing asset price
increases, and some capital flight.

•

Renewed impetus should be given to strengthening supervision and regulatory
enforcement to maintain financial stability in the face of rapid banking sector
growth. The legal framework is improving, but stronger efforts are needed in
enforcement. The application of the stricter licensing requirements will be an
important signal of the authorities’ willingness to tighten enforcement going forward.

I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Background
1.
Nepal is undergoing a major political transition. The end of the decade-long civil
conflict in April 2006, the interim government takeover from the monarchy, and the
comprehensive peace agreement between the government and the Maoist party in November
2006 set the stage for a transition to a new democratic governance structure.
2.
The next step in this process, the writing of a new constitution, will be carried
out by the Constituent Assembly. After several delays the elections to determine this
assembly were held on April 10, 2008. Despite pre-election violence the elections themselves
were considered by and large free and fair by international observers, and the results appear
to be broadly accepted. While the final results are still not known, the Maoist party is
emerging as the clear victor. A new government has yet to be formed and the policy agenda
that will emerge is still uncertain.
3.
Despite recent progress, however, the political situation is highly fragile.
Relations among major parties remain contentious. The situation in the Terai (the southern
plains bordering India) remains tense as militants have increasingly agitated for more
regional autonomy and a greater stake in national politics, and violence and strikes have been
widespread. Given these obstacles there is a risk that the political transition will stall, with
fundamental tensions remaining unresolved.
4.
Nepal’s history of civil conflict, political instability, poor governance, and weak
structural reform has retarded economic growth. Per capita GDP in Nepal has barely
risen in the last decade and the country remains one of the poorest in the world. Nepal has
largely been left behind in the region’s recent growth boom (Figure 1).

B. Economic Developments

Macroeconomic performance under the recent PRGF-supported program,
which ended last November, has been stable (Tables 1-4). Despite a background of civil
conflict and major political upheavals during the program period:
•

•

Growth has been maintained, albeit at low
levels—output growth has averaged 3 percent
since 2002. However, domestic unrest has
harmed private sector activity and created an
unfavorable investment climate, keeping
growth below the average of the last decade.
Structural impediments including poor
infrastructure, input supply disruptions, and
unstable labor relations have also retarded
growth.

The budget stance has been cautious—over
the last several years domestic budget
financing has been held to about 1-2 percent
of GDP. Revenue growth has been strong,
averaging 15 percent per year. Limited foreign borrowing and more recently the
weakness of the U.S. dollar have reduced public debt to below 50 percent of GDP.

The real exchange rate has appreciated by
20 percent over the last three years in large
part driven by the decline in the dollar
against the Indian rupee. With 70 percent of
exports going to India, however, this
measure may overstate the impact of the
dollar’s decline on Nepal’s export
competitiveness. 1

The outlook for 2007/08 remains
stable. The agricultural recovery, favorable
service sector performance, and a significant increase in tourist arrivals could boost real GDP
growth to 3½–4 percent in 2007/08. The authorities were somewhat more optimistic, arguing
that growth could reach 4½ percent. Anchored by the exchange rate peg, inflation is
projected to remain broadly stable around 6½ percent to 7 percent, although higher food
prices and any adjustments to the administered prices of fuel could add upward pressure. On
the external side, rising oil imports and stagnant exports have led to a further deterioration in
the trade deficit, but this will be more than offset by workers’ remittances, which are
expected to grow by 20 percent over last year.
7.
While the macroeconomic performance has been stable, progress on structural
reforms has been held back by the fragile political circumstances. In particular, little
progress has been made to address institutional weaknesses in the financial sector and in
public financial management.

Vulnerabilities in Nepal’s financial sector remain, and could be growing.
Loose monetary conditions have led to
negative real interest rates, rapid and
potentially destabilizing stock market and
property price increases, and some capital
flight to India seeking higher returns. Credit
growth has been high, with aggressive
lending by many banks pushing their creditto-deposit ratios to levels above 100 percent.

Supervisory capability and regulatory
compliance remain weak. In recent years the
legal framework for supervision has been overhauled, but enforcement within this
framework remains a concern—decision making is slow and there has been significant
and visible supervisory forbearance. Efforts to collect sizeable overdue loans from willful
defaulters have yielded few results. A stricter licensing policy approved in April 2007 has
been undermined by the recent proliferation of licenses granted to banking institutions
whose applications had been submitted under the old licensing regime.

•

Reforms of the two large public banks have stalled. With World Bank help, progress has
been made in placing their lending on a more commercial basis, operations have been
restructured and modernized, and losses have been reduced or eliminated. However, the
banks are still insolvent and the lack of a clear strategy on how to move forward prevents
the gains of reform from becoming permanent.

9.
Limited progress has been made in addressing Nepal’s structural weaknesses in
tax administration and public financial management. Overall, the accounting, auditing,
and reporting of public sector operations are inadequate. The budget coverage is confined to
only the central budget with no information on quasi-fiscal activities, internal control
procedures are not fully effective, and the management of spending is weak. Specifically:
•

While impressive progress has been made on improving tax administration through the
operations of the Large Taxpayer Office, reforms are needed to modernize customs, a
significant source of revenue in Nepal.

•

Around one-third of government expenditure takes place outside the budget framework in
extrabudgetary funds and autonomous bodies, in part to channel spending by donors
lacking trust in the transparency and accountability of the central government budget.

10.
Public enterprises, and the Nepal Oil Corporation in particular, pursue quasifiscal activities involving significant subsidies. At current crude prices, the oil company is

8
running an annualized deficit of about 1½ percent to 2 percent of GDP. In general the
accountability and transparency of public enterprises are weak.
C. Outlook and Risks
11.
Nepal’s growth prospects depend most importantly on a peaceful political
transition. Steady but low growth could continue in the near term. However, insecurity,
violence in the Terai region, input supply disruptions, and structural barriers continue to
discourage investment, limit exports, and hamper transition to a higher growth path. With
Nepal located between two of the fastest growing economies in the world, an easing of these
constraints, steady progress on the political front, and the development of Nepal’s vast
untapped hydropower resources could lift growth to levels of 5−5½ percent over the medium
term (Table 5).
12.
The unsettled political environment poses the most immediate risk to
macroeconomic stability and growth. Structural reform progress during the political
transition will be slow, and political risks will remain significant, even if the results of the
constituent assembly elections are broadly accepted. The demands of the peace process—a
sense of entitlement among stakeholder groups, and the call to address the grievances built
up over decades, particularly for the underdeveloped and politically underrepresented
population of the Terai—could result in pressures for greater public spending. In this
environment undertaking needed structural reforms and maintaining budget discipline will be
challenging.
II. POLICIES TO PROMOTE EXTERNAL STABILITY
In the last several years the government’s policies under the PRGF-supported program, in
particular fiscal restraint and the peg to the Indian rupee, have been critical in supporting
macroeconomic stability and growth despite political turmoil and civil conflict. The
authorities agreed that now that the program has expired, relaxing these policies would
undermine the prospects for economic recovery at a critical point in the political transition.
A. Maintaining the Favorable Macroeconomic Environment
Fiscal Policy
13.
The authorities recognized the critical role that maintaining budget discipline
will play in preserving macroeconomic stability. It is essential to support the robustness of
the pegged exchange rate regime and maintain Nepal’s debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path
from still high levels. 2 Budget discipline is also needed as a safeguard against a slowdown in
2

The debt dynamics in the revised DSA are broadly consistent with those of the previous assessment in 2007
(Appendix I, Country Report No. 07/204). At the same time the initial net present value of debt has fallen
slightly with the appreciation of the Nepalese rupee and lower-than-projected loan disbursements in the interim.

9
revenue growth, or if higher unforeseen expenditures become necessary to absorb losses by
public enterprises or to address the financial weaknesses of the public banks.
14.
Despite the strong revenue performance, Nepal’s budget deficit could rise this
year to about 3½ percent of GDP, reflecting in part the one-off costs of the elections and
the clearance of most of the Nepal Oil Corporation’s arrears. While these additional costs can
be absorbed this year, the authorities agreed that this is not a sustainable fiscal policy position
going forward. Excessive reliance on domestic financing could ultimately threaten budget
solvency as a growing interest bill generates additional fiscal pressure. For this reason, the
authorities aim to limit domestic borrowing in the next budget to a more sustainable level of
1-2 percent of GDP.
15.
Further improvement in revenue collection is essential in ensuring the
sustainability of the budget. Staff recognize that in planning the next budget, there may be a
need to increase spending in some areas to improve the provision of public goods and
address the legacy of the civil conflict. Given this, staff urged that the impressive progress
achieved by the Large Taxpayer Office with the help of FAD technical assistance be
broadened to other areas of revenue administration. On the spending side, the focus should be
on allowing needed increases in post-conflict and infrastructure spending, particularly where
donor financing is available, while keeping recurrent spending at sustainable levels.
16.
The key short-run priority is to limit and eventually eliminate the losses of the
state oil company, a frequent and, at times, large drain on the budget. The setting of prices
of petroleum products remains highly politicized. As a result, the government’s ability to
address the company’s losses through ad hoc price increases has been limited, and the
piecemeal approach taken so far has disrupted supplies for extended periods. There is broad
agreement within the government that the current situation is not sustainable and the
authorities were hopeful that price adjustments could be made as soon as political conditions
permit following the elections. The staff argued that a permanent solution is required, with
the preferred option being the introduction of an automatic pricing mechanism to bring about
a phased convergence in domestic prices to world levels in a depoliticized manner. In the
meantime, the staff urged that all the company’s flow losses be covered by the budget in a
timely and transparent manner and any lending to the company for this purpose be reflected
in public debt.
17.
The staff encouraged the authorities to accelerate reforms aimed at increasing
accountability, transparency, and credibility of public expenditure. Through Fund and
donor technical assistance, a range of measures have been proposed to improve the coverage
In view of the improved debt indicators, Nepal’s external debt dynamics are now technically assessed to be
subject to a moderate risk of debt distress. This is a change from the previous DSA which classified Nepal as at

10
of financial information and the accounting system which would strengthen the government’s
ability to conduct fiscal policy, monitor expenditure, and coordinate donor activity. The
authorities agreed on several areas where further technical assistance would be particularly
useful, including developing a chart of accounts and laying the groundwork for establishing a
treasury single account.
Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
18.
The exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee has been instrumental in anchoring
inflation over the last several years. This arrangement, in place since 1993, has served
Nepal well given close and increasing economic integration between the two countries.
19.
In assessing whether the current level of Nepal’s peg remains appropriate,
analysis must extend beyond the narrow trade balance. The merchandise trade deficit is
large and has clearly trended upward over the last several years. However, a major factor
driving balance of payments developments is workers’ remittances inflows, which at over
$1½ billion are more important than exports

as a source of foreign exchange. Since most of

combined with remittances is much more
stable than the merchandise trade balance
alone. While the supply and demand factors driving remittances are in many cases different
from merchandise exports, excluding remittances and focusing only on the trade balance
would be misleading in any analysis of the appropriate level of the exchange rate (Box 1).
20.
Taking the balance of payments as a whole, the current level of the exchange
rate appears broadly consistent with its equilibrium level. The overall external balance
has been and remains in surplus, with the trade deficit largely offset by remittance inflows.
Remittances are likely to persist, and will continue to provide a large sustainable source of
inflows to the balance of payments. In terms of the underlying savings-investment balance, a
country at Nepal’s level of development should be running a modest current account deficit

11

Box 1. The Role of Remittances in Nepal’s Balance of Payments
Nepal’s persistent balance of payments surplus is a
key factor in assessing whether the exchange rate is
near equilibrium. The balance of payments has been
in surplus for the last decade, with an annual reserve
accumulation of around $150 million over the last five
years. This surplus continues despite the deteriorating
trade balance, primarily owing to Nepal’s unique role
as a major exporter of labor services. Remittances
from workers’ earnings abroad have been a dominant
flow of foreign exchange, with annual flows now
exceeding 15 percent of GDP.

Increasingly however, demand for Nepalese
workers is being fueled by large infrastructure
programs in oil-rich Persian Gulf states, as well as in several Asian countries. These workers tend to
earn significantly higher wages than in India.
Remittances have played a major role in boosting Nepal’s imports. Although higher world oil
prices have contributed somewhat, the main factor behind rapid import growth in recent years has
been higher consumption as remittances raise disposable income and demand for durable goods.
At the same time exports have experienced a number of shocks. While exports to India have
overall been stable (and account for about 70 percent of total exports), the growth rate of exports to
other destinations has fallen. Driving this has been the decline in the textiles industry, the main
Nepalese export to countries other than India. This industry has faced persistent unrest in the Terai,
electricity supply shortages, poor labor relations, campaigns against child labor, and the expiration of
the multi-fiber agreement in 2005.
On balance, however, growth in remittances has consistently produced balance of payments
surpluses. Nepalese workers finding employment abroad has been a fortunate development given the
problems facing the domestic economy—indeed, the World Bank estimates that remittances have
been the main factor behind Nepal’s declining poverty rate over the last decade. But employment
abroad is also likely to have significant social costs, and is not contributing to Nepal’s long-term
development. Bringing production to within Nepal’s borders will require establishing political
stability, reducing civil unrest, and resolving the country’s structural problems.

12
financed by official grants and loans, which it is at present. 3 Under these circumstances,
attempts to offset the recent real appreciation through a step devaluation are unlikely to be
effective, and could be quickly eroded by a period of higher inflation both from direct passthrough effects and indirectly as inflows enter the economy adding to already high domestic
liquidity.
21.
Regarding the exchange rate regime, maintaining the peg to the Indian rupee
would continue to be appropriate for Nepal’s macroeconomic stability and development
in the near term.
•

There are obvious advantages of the pegged regime. It provides a highly credible and
simple nominal anchor by importing macroeconomic policy discipline from India,
particularly important in a country like Nepal with limited central bank independence and
weak institutions. Pegging to the Indian rupee is the natural choice given the extensive
and growing commercial ties with India, keeping business uncertainty and transactions
costs low and promoting integration with one of the world’s fastest growing economies.

•

At the same time, the advantages of a floating regime are fairly limited in Nepal at
present. While it gives some monetary policy autonomy and flexibility in responding to
external shocks, a successful floating rate regime has extensive institutional and
operational requirements. The NRB is a long way from having the independence and
discipline to conduct policy using an alternative anchor and successfully keep inflation
low. The process of building the NRB’s credibility would be very costly in the current
economic circumstances, and without a very strong political mandate, would not succeed.

22.
While the regime remains appropriate at present, maintaining the peg could
present some challenges over time if productivity in India continues to grow more
rapidly than in Nepal. The peg would provide clear benefits in terms of fostering
integration with a rapidly growing economy, but it would also require domestic factor
markets to be sufficiently flexible to allow the real exchange rate to adjust at a different pace
than India. Until now this has largely been the case, particularly through labor mobility, but
going forward the productivity differential is expected to grow. In these circumstances, other
more flexible regimes, including a basket peg, could help smooth domestic adjustment to a
possible further appreciation of the Indian rupee.
23.
Staff discussed these challenges with the authorities. The authorities agreed with
the staff’s assessment of the implications of higher productivity growth in India, but
3

For a country like Nepal, assessing an “equilibrium” exchange rate presents considerable challenges. Data
quality is poor, the political and security situation is evolving rapidly, and donor flows are uneven. The
unusually important role of remittances complicates comparisons with other countries. In these circumstances,
and as in many low-income countries, a more mechanical econometric approach would yield little information
about the appropriate level of the exchange rate level.

13
underscored that they are currently not considering any alternatives to the existing pegged
arrangement, arguing that any marginal benefits of a move away from the peg were
outweighed by the costs of a regime change in the prevailing political and economic
environment. Moreover, they maintained that the simplicity, predictability, and transparency
of the current peg will continue to be a critical anchor for the economy in the period ahead,
and feared that a move to a basket-like arrangement would add uncertainty and fuel
speculation. They emphasized that the current regime, by allowing for changes in the parity
when needed, would be robust to future external shocks. Staff agreed with the authorities’
assessment that although the regime could face challenges in the future, now would not be
the right time to change the rate or the regime.
24.
The staff argued that there is a clear need to tighten monetary conditions. A
relatively passive monetary policy has allowed foreseeable exogenous events, such as
changes in government spending, to lead to potentially disruptive swings in liquidity
conditions, with an overall bias toward excess liquidity and negative real interest rates. Loose
monetary conditions have fueled a credit and asset price boom, and some capital flight. The
staff encouraged the authorities to take an active role in reaching and maintaining a tighter
monetary policy. Better liquidity management and forecasting is needed, and will require
foremost a separation of the formulation and execution of monetary policy from public debt
management. The staff argued that the temporary credit squeeze in January underscored this
need, and illustrated how the highly uneven distribution of liquidity among banks could
undermine monetary policy, particularly with a relatively shallow interbank credit market.
The authorities agreed in principle that monetary conditions could be tightened, and the NRB
has the tools to do so, including through the increased use of open market operations.
B. Strengthening the Financial Sector
25.
Nepal’s fast growing financial sector presents a challenge to financial stability in
the near term and beyond. Some of the growth in the banking sector is expected and
reflects a natural deepening of the financial system in Nepal. However, the rapid proliferation
of financial institutions and credit growth has coincided with a sharp rise in stock market and
property prices, and adds to the already large regulatory burden of the NRB (Box 2).
26.
To address this, staff urged the authorities to give renewed impetus to recent
efforts to strengthen supervision and regulatory enforcement. Much depends on the
enforcement efforts backing the Banking and Financial Institutions Act once this Act is
approved by parliament, which in principle should improve the legal framework for
supervision and bank consolidation. High and rising credit-to-deposit ratios, weak loan
classification standards, and poor asset quality at some banks call for greater vigilance on the
part of supervisors. Staff urged action against those private banks which continue to operate

14
Box 2. The State of Nepal’s Financial Sector
Nepal’s financial system is underdeveloped but sizeable
relative to countries in the region. The total assets of the
banking system to GDP stood at 81 percent in July 2007.1
Public banks account for about one third of banking sector
assets. The Nepal stock market has historically played
only a marginal role, although the doubling of the stock
price index between end 2006 and 2007 has increased
market capitalization (90 percent of which is accounted for
by banking institutions).

The banking sector is characterized by a large and
growing number of deposit-taking institutions. The
numbers of licensed commercial banks increased from 17 to 23 in the last three years. There has also been a
rapid proliferation of the number of deposit-taking nonbank financial institutions, nearly doubling in 2007 to
139 institutions.

The increase in institutions has been accompanied by rapid credit growth, currently around 25 percent.
Lending by private commercial banks is particularly rapid at 36 percent, corresponding to a decline in lending
growth by the two main state-owned commercial banks. While some of the lending growth reflects a natural
deepening of the financial system, loose monetary conditions, competitive pressures, and intermediation of
worker remittances to housing and consumer credit have also played a role. While the overall NPL ratio has
been declining, this is a lagging indicator of asset quality, and the impact of the recent increase in lending
growth on the health of banks’ balance sheets is not yet known. High exposure to single borrowers remains a
concern.
Credit growth is increasingly driven by the aggressive lending behavior of many smaller banking
institutions. System-wide, the average credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio for the banking system has increased from
60 percent over 2000–2006 to 78 percent by end-2007.

While banks’ direct exposure to the real estate and
stock market is modest, the indirect exposure could be quite large. Nearly 60 percent of bank loans are
secured by real estate assets, making banks vulnerable to a sharp drop in real estate prices. In contrast to
international practice, Nepalese banks can lend against stocks as collateral. While this lending remains small
(about 3 percent of the loan portfolio of banks), its recent growth, likely backing additional stock purchases, is
regarded as a key factor behind the recent stock market boom.

The banking sector includes commercial banks, which account for 84 percent of total financial assets,
development banks, and deposit-taking financial institutions.

despite violating capital adequacy requirements to prevent them from undermining the
credibility of the regulatory framework. Staff also stressed that particular attention should be
paid to compliance with single-borrower limits, and to assessing and monitoring the financial
sector’s indirect exposure to the property and stock markets. In this regard, the staff
welcomed the recent NRB directive to restrict margin lending by banking institutions using
stocks as collateral. The application of the stricter licensing requirements approved in April
2007, in particular the “fit and proper” test, will be a signal of the authorities’ willingness to
enforce the new regime going forward. The mission noted the NRB’s progress in moving
toward risk-based supervision and implementing Basel II beginning July 2008, and
encouraged further efforts to this end.
27.
In addition, staff encouraged the authorities to adopt a clear strategy for
completing the process of commercializing the two large public banks. Although most of
the politically-motivated lending appears, for the moment, to have been limited under new
management teams, a strategy is needed for bringing these banks to solvency and ensuring
that they will operate on a commercial basis going forward. The authorities agreed with this
assessment, but observed that there is currently no political consensus on how to resolve
these banks, either through privatization or other methods. They hoped a new effort to
address these issues would emerge sometime after the April elections.
28.
Finally, staff expressed concern that lack of progress on debt collection could be
seen as signaling a lack of will to enforce existing regulations. While the debts of the
willful defaulters do not represent a systemic risk, staff urged ongoing government action,
including through the Debt Recovery Tribunal, to shore up the credibility of the regulatory
regime.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Over the past several years Nepal has maintained moderate inflation and budget
discipline. Although output growth has been low, the preservation of macroeconomic
stability despite the civil conflict and major political upheavals is a remarkable achievement
for which the government deserves much credit.
30.
Nepal is now at a critical juncture, and continued stability is a key condition for
allowing the political transformation currently taking place to result in higher, broadbased economic growth. In addition to addressing structural impediments such as poor
infrastructure and input supply disruptions, a prerequisite for higher growth will be
maintaining budget discipline and ensuring the soundness of the banking sector during the
challenging period ahead.
31.
Maintaining budget discipline is a necessary condition for preserving
macroeconomic stability. In balancing the need to increase spending in some areas to
improve the provision of public goods and address the legacy of the civil conflict while

16
maintaining domestic borrowing at sustainable levels, further improvement in revenue
collection will remain a priority.
32.
A key short-run priority is to limit and eventually eliminate the losses of the
Nepal Oil Corporation. The introduction of an automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum
products to ensure the depoliticization of pricing is the preferred permanent solution. Going
forward, all the company’s flow losses should be covered by the budget in a transparent
manner.
33.
Nepal’s peg to the Indian rupee has served the country well, and maintaining
this arrangement would continue to be appropriate in the near term for Nepal’s
macroeconomic stability and development. With the overall balance in surplus and the
reserve position strong and stable, there appears to be little sign of misalignment at present.
The peg provides a highly credible, simple, and predictable nominal anchor, and is a natural
choice given the extensive commercial ties with India. While a widening productivity gap
with India could present some challenges over time for exchange rate management, now
would not be the right time to consider changing the rate or the regime.
34.
The authorities should take a more active role in reaching and maintaining a
tighter monetary policy, as an overall bias toward excess liquidity has led to negative real
interest rates, rapid credit growth, potentially destabilizing asset price increases, and some
capital flight. Better liquidity management and forecasting is needed, and will require
separation of the formulation and execution of monetary policy from public debt
management.
35.
Renewed impetus should be given to strengthening supervision and regulatory
enforcement to maintain financial stability in the face of rapid banking sector growth.
Parliament approval of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act should further strengthen
the regulatory framework, but significant improvements are needed in enforcement. The
application of the stricter licensing requirements will be an important signal of the
authorities’ willingness to tighten enforcement going forward.
36.
A clear strategy is needed for completing the process of commercializing the two
large public banks. Although progress has been made under new management teams in
restructuring these banks, a strategy is needed for bringing them to solvency and ensuring
that they will be operated on a commercial basis going forward.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

In February 1993, Nepal unified its exchange rate and eliminated the multiple currency
practice associated with the previous dual exchange rate arrangement. In October 1997, the
exchange arrangement of Nepal was reclassified as that pegged to a single currency unit from
pegged to a currency composite. Currently, all merchandise imports (except for a few goods
restricted for security or related reasons) are freely available through an open general license
system, with foreign exchange provided through the banking system at the market exchange
rate. Nepal’s exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions. As of July 31, 2007, the exchange rate for the Nepalese
rupee (Nr) was US$1=Nrs. 65.2.
VIII. Safeguards Assessments
A safeguards assessment of the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) was completed on
September 2, 2002. The assessment concluded that substantial risks exist in the area of
external and internal audits, and the internal control system of the NRB. A safeguards
monitoring assessment was completed in October 2004. Staff findings and recommendations

3
were reported in IMF Country Report No. 02/205. The NRB has made limited progress in the
implementation of these recommendations, particularly with respect to the use of
international standards in financial reporting and external audit and strengthening of internal
controls in the NRB.
IX.

2005 Article IV Consultation

The Executive Board discussed the staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation (IMF
Country Report No. 06/44) on January 18, 2006. Until 2008, Nepal was on a 24-month
consultation cycle, subject to the provisions of the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation
cycles (Decision No. 129794-(02/76) as amended). It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation take place on the 12-month cycle.

ANNEX II. NEPAL—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of April 30, 2008)
I. PARTNERSHIP IN NEPAL’S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Since the late 1990s, Nepal’s poverty reduction agenda was held back by formidable
challenges—that is, persistent political instability, the escalation of the Maoist insurgency
and the global economic slowdown. Nevertheless, amidst the turbulence, a group of
committed, reform-minded government officials and technocrats began implementing
reforms in earnest in late 2001. These initiatives formed the basis for the first Immediate
Action Plan (IAP) adopted by the Government in June 2002. For a while, reform efforts
flourished in a number of areas, including the financial sector, public expenditures, the fight
against corruption, infrastructure regulatory environment, and decentralized delivery of
public services.
The reform group had been building on the successful experience with the IAP in moving the
reform process forward. In developing the 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)—
formally sent to the World Bank and IMF in July 2003—the scope of reform was broadened
and a more integrated approach was adopted within a medium-term perspective. 1 The PRS
spells out specific development targets, foremost among which is the reduction of the overall
poverty ratio from about 40 percent to 30 percent by the end of FY07. 2 The PRS contains
four pillars: (i) achieving sustainable and broad-based economic growth with an emphasis on
the rural economy; (ii) accelerating human development through improved delivery of basic
social services and economic infrastructure; (iii) ensuring social and economic inclusion of
the poor, marginalized groups and less developed regions; and (iv) pursuing good
governance to achieve better development results, and ensure social and economic justice.
The technical elements of the government are trying to set their own development framework
(Three-Year Interim Plan) and take back the development agenda from donors. Despite an
extremely adverse political and economic environment, a PRS progress report by the
National Planning Commission (NPC) prepared over a year ago notes that implementation of
the PRS has been broadly satisfactory and measurable results are being achieved.
With the successful Constituent Assembly elections on April 10, 2008, the Bank is preparing
policy note presentations on key issues to present to the new government.

1

The PRS was discussed by the Boards in November 2003 following a joint staff assessment carried out by the
two institutions. Subsequently, four PRS Progress Reports have been issued by the authorities.
2

This target has nearly been met with recent analysis showing that the incidence of poverty in Nepal fell from
42 percent (1995–96) to 31 percent (2003–04), with urban areas experiencing greater reductions than rural areas
in the depth and severity of poverty.

5
II. IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS
A. Areas in Which the Bank Leads and There is No Direct IMF Involvement
The areas in which the Bank leads the policy dialogue and there is no direct IMF
involvement are the social sectors, infrastructure, and environment. In the social sphere, the
Bank provided technical assistance (TA) in conducting the Nepal Living Standards Survey II
(NLSS II) during 2003/04 that updated household level information on trends in
consumption, poverty, and their determinants. The TA also helped to strengthen the
country’s capacity to undertake regular household surveys that will facilitate poverty
comparisons over time and to conduct social impact analyses. The NLSS II has been a key
input into the three annual PRS progress reports, as well as the Bank’s comprehensive
poverty report—Nepal: Resilience Amidst Conflict—An Assessment of Poverty in
Nepal, 1995–96 and 2003–04.
In education, the Bank and numerous other donors are actively supporting Nepal’s
well-formulated, ten-year primary education reform program. IDA along with Denmark,
Finland, Norway, EC, ADB, UNICEF and the United Kingdom have established a joint
financing arrangement whereby donor funds are pooled with public sector budgetary
resources to support implementation of the program. IDA resources are provided through the
Education for All project—which employs a sector-wide approach (“SWAp”)—and the
Second Higher Education.
The Bank has encouraged Nepal’s decentralization efforts to achieve more effective delivery
of public services and is playing a pivotal role in supporting the transfer of public schools to
community management. The Community School Support Learning and Innovation Loan
(LIL) aims to improve accountability of primary schools, build capacity of communities to
manage schools and develop the roles of teachers, local officials, and education offices
within the devolved framework.
In health, the Bank has been supporting the devolution of sub-health posts to local
communities, and the development of a sector-wide reform strategy. A Health Sector
Operation supports the program. Key reform priorities include addressing the problems of
inadequate financing and inefficient public spending, weak institutional capacity, and overcentralized planning and management, weak delivery mechanisms and inequitable access to
services. To support both human health and animal health, an Avian Influenza Control
Project is under operation.
To support broad-based growth, the Bank supports investments in several key infrastructure
sectors. The Power Development Project (PDP) is helping to develop the country’s
hydropower potential to meet electricity demand, improve access of rural areas to electricity
services and promote private sector participation. The Telecommunications Sector Reform
Project supports sectoral policy reforms in addition to the provision of greater rural access to
telecommunications services through the introduction of a private operator. The Road Sector
Development Project provides all-season road access in select hill districts.
To support rural development, the Nepal Irrigation and Water Resources Management
Project aims to improve irrigated agriculture productivity and management of selected
irrigation schemes, and enhance institutional capacity for integrated water resources

6
management. At the same time, project finance is supporting decentralization to improve
service delivery by promoting grassroots-driven, bottom-up planning and community-based
management. The Rural Access Improvement and Decentralization Project (RAIDP) helps
to improve governance and service delivery for rural infrastructure, while at the same time
promoting agricultural and rural economic growth, and generating employment through
direct project investments in rural transport infrastructure.
While many of the Bank’s investment/sector operations mentioned above also support social
inclusion, a more direct initiative in this area that received Bank support is the Poverty
Alleviation Fund (PAF I and II). PAF channels resources to the poorest groups in rural
communities by creating infrastructure, employment and income-generating opportunities.
Bank financing through the PAF project supports implementation of the fund in 75 districts.
In addition, the Bank – with DFID funding – is assisting Nepal in gaining a better
understanding of the institutional underpinnings of caste, ethnic and gender-based social and
economic exclusion and how these affect poverty outcomes and the options for policy and
institutional reform through a completed social and gender analysis: Unequal Citizens:
Gender, Caste and Ethnic Exclusion in Nepal.
In responding to environmental management, Bank assistance is focused on helping Nepal
articulate an effective strategy for environmental conservation, management and capacity
building. A Country Environmental Analysis was completed in FY07 and a study is
underway on Adapting to Climate Change.
B. Areas in Which the Bank Leads and Its Analysis Serves as Input into the IMF
Program
The Bank takes the lead in assisting Nepal with public expenditure analysis. The Bank’s
FY00 Public Expenditure Review (PER) provided analytical support for developing the
strategy on public expenditure reform. Together with DfID, the Bank’s intensive dialogue
and technical assistance have been supporting the reforms, including the development of a
credible Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This framework has applied since
FY04 to the prioritization of the development budget to ensure efficient budget allocations
for priority projects. As Nepal implements its PRS, the MTEF will help the public sector
translate the PRS priorities into fiscal realities.
Public expenditure analysis remains an integral part of the Bank’s analytical and advisory
(AAA) work program, consisting of (i) PER that focuses on evaluating the implementation of
the MTEF; (ii) Public Finance Management (PFM) Review that examined the fiscal space for
development activities and cross-sectoral allocation of public spending and service delivery;
and (iii) Public Expenditure Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment was recently
completed and has established PFM benchmarks using the PEFA framework. The
government is now seeking the continued cooperation of the WB and other development
partners to implement the Action Plan to improve PFM.
To complement the economic analysis, studies on the public sector’s framework for financial
accountability and procurement—the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)—were conducted jointly by the
Bank and the Government. Additionally, in response to technical assistance and training
needs on public expenditure management, decentralization and enhancement of financial

7
accountability, the Bank is providing support through Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) grants or other sources.
In the future, the Bank could provide additional support through development policy lending
linked to (i) financing of a post-conflict program; (ii) supporting the transition to a more
stable environment; and (iii) supporting reform implementation. In the meantime, to assist in
the reform efforts the Economic Reform Technical Assistance (ERTA) Project is providing
TA to help implement aspects of all the PRS pillars. The Bank’s AAA program places
emphasis on the need to address the challenges and bottlenecks to broad-based growth.
With respect to governance, in implementing both the 1998 and 2003 CASes, the Bank has
consistently and firmly focused on helping Nepal address its fundamental constraint to
development—poor governance. Albeit accompanied by intensive dialogue, the Bank’s
strong limited lending stance during FY99–FY02 (less than US$25 million per year) may
have provided some impetus to the wave of reforms initiated in the early 2000s. The public
expenditure reform program which has benefited from the Bank’s analytical work and policy
dialogue is facing up to the challenge of improving not only efficiency but also governance.
The program includes measures to fight corruption, ensure civil service accountability, and
enhance transparency of public financial management and the procurement framework. Bank
support for decentralization includes analytical assistance on the fiscal decentralization
framework and promotion of the expanded roles of local bodies. Following the completion of
the CPAR and CFAA, IDF grants are providing the means for strengthening relevant public
sector institutions and implementing main policy recommendations. Nepal has been selected
as a pilot country for the Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption Plan (CGAC) and a
Governance Assessment Note is under preparation.
C. Areas of Shared Responsibility
The Bank and the IMF—together with other external development partners—provided
assistance during the preparation of the PRS and the subsequent PRS Progress Reports. In
addressing the PRS pillar on good governance, the Bank and the IMF are assisting in the area
of civil service reform through policy dialogue and TA towards ensuring an autonomous and
professional civil service as well as fiscal sustainability.
The Bank and the IMF are partners in providing analytical support to Nepal on international
trade, which is key to attaining broad-based growth. The Bank led the work with a Trade and
Competitiveness Study which helped identify major constraints to further integrating the
country into the multilateral trading system in a manner that is supportive of the PRS. The
IMF contributed to the study by assessing macroeconomic policy and its potential impact on
trade performance. In turn, the study is helping the IMF design its technical assistance
program on tax policy, including import tariffs taking into account Nepal’s WTO accession.
Financial sector reform is a fundamental area for Bank/IMF involvement. Since the
mismanagement of key financial institutions was a major element of poor governance,
progress in implementing financial sector reform has been the litmus test of political
commitment to governance reform. The Bank and the IMF are helping to strengthen the
central bank’s authority and regulatory capacity, improve the financial health and restructure
of the two largest state banks, and upgrade the legislative and institutional framework for the
financial sector. Building on a comprehensive Financial Sector Study carried out in 2002, the

8
Financial Sector Technical Assistance project supports (i) the restructuring and
reengineering of the Central Bank; (ii) introduction of professional management teams into
the two large ailing commercial banks (the first step toward eventual restructuring);
(iii) capacity building towards enhanced credit information; and (iv) upgrading of staff
training in financial institutions. The Financial Sector Restructuring project supports further
strengthening of the Central Bank and deepening the reform process within the two banks. In
FY05, a Legal Financial Review was completed providing a snapshot of the legal and
judicial environment for financial sector growth and development. In addition, a recently
completed study on Access to Finance helps to gain a better understanding of (i) the financial
performance of the microfinance sector; and (ii) whether the current legal and regulatory
framework is an obstacle to the sector’s growth. Another study, Technology in Microfinance,
is underway to examine how the use of technology in microfinance can improve access to
financial services to the Nepalese majority. An Investment Climate Assessment is underway
and will be completed in late FY09.
III. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND LENDING OPERATIONS
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): In November 2003, a CAS was presented to the
Bank’s Board of Directors, which discussed the rationale for implementing a ‘base case’
lending program equivalent to approximately US$190 million annually. Given the nature of
the country’s ongoing reforms, the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) prepared in 2002 had
already presented the justification for moving to a base case scenario that included
implementing a programmatic approach to financial assistance. An Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) was presented to the Board in February 2007 and a note on the implementation of the
ISN was circulated in August 2007. A new CAS will be prepared and presented to the Board
in late FY09.
The Lending Program: So far, in FY08, four projects (of which one is for additional
financing) have been approved for US$252.6 million and three more projects are scheduled
to be presented to the Board on May 6 for another US$127 million, bringing the total FY08
lending to US$379.6 million.
Bank Assistance Program in Nepal: As of March 31, 2008, IDA’s lending portfolio
consisted of sixteen projects with a total commitment of US$782.8 million and a total
undisbursed balance of US$583 million (Table II.1).
Economic and Sector Work: The 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (Report
No. 26509−NEP, 11/24/2003) was discussed by the Bank’s Board in November 2003.
Recently completed economic and sector work includes Nepal Development Policy Review:
Restarting Growth and Poverty Reduction (June 2004), Unequal Citizens: Gender, Caste and
Ethnic Exclusion in Nepal (June 2005), Nepal Decentralized Organizations Study
(March 2004), Urbanization and Service Delivery in the Context of Decentralization: A
Review of the Issues for the Kathmandu Valley (December 2004), Legal Financial Review
(February 2005), North South Transport Corridor Options (August 2004), Nepal: Resilience
Amidst Conflict: An Assessment of Poverty in Nepal, 1995–96 and 2003–04 (June 2006) and

A. Activities of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Nepal
Investment Services: As of end January 2008, the IFC’s outstanding balance portfolio in
Nepal is US$39.93 million in two power generation projects, one tourism project, and one
leasing company. Given the security situation, opportunities for new investments had been
limited. More recently, as the peace process continues and the security situation improves,
IFC is considering new investment opportunities in cement, hydropower and the financial
sector. In 2005, IFC launched the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) which offers
confirming banks partial or full guarantees on issuing banks’ payment risk. In FY07, IFC
signed two Nepali Banks, Bank of Kathmandu and Nepal Industrial and Commercial Bank,
to the Global Trade Finance Program (US$2 million each). IFC is in discussion with
Himalayan Bank for participation in the GTFP. The IFC is also considering equity
investments with Bank of Kathmandu and Himalayan Bank.
B. IFC Advisory Services
Privatization/Corporate Advisory Services: IFC has initiated discussions with the GoN on
providing advisory services for a possible privatization/restructuring of Nepal Airlines and
Nepal Telecom. IFC’s main delivery mechanism for technical assistance for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nepal is through the Dhaka-based South Asia Enterprise
Development Facility (IFC-SEDF). This facility—funded by IFC in partnership with Canada,
Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, Asian Development Bank, and the European
Union—delivers TA programs to increase access for SMEs to financing and business

10
development services, improve the business environment for SMEs and develop linkages
with larger enterprises.
Access to Finance: IFC-SEDF has signed a Partner Financial Institution MOU with the
Himalayan Bank and the Bank of Katmandu and hopes to sign another MOU with the NIC
Bank very shortly. The MOUs outline specific programs to assist the banks with institutional
capacity building that will help enhance the quality of service to the bank’s SME clients. By
comparing the FIs to best practice banks in this sector, the diagnostics provide a needs-gap
analysis of the Banks’ strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats within the overall
structure of the bank. The road-map for future interventions is based on these findings.
Diagnostic of NIC Bank is scheduled for mid-June. Future work will include a Credit Bureau
Strengthening Project aimed at making the newly privatized Credit Bureaus commercially
viable.
Future Advisory Services (AS) to the banks will include developing appropriate SME
banking products and services and building their institutional capacity through training.
These activities will involve assisting the Bank to transition to a more industrialized form of
banking and would involve a cultural change in mindset from traditional corporate banking.
AS will be provided to develop more standardized products, streamlined processes and for
effective use of technologies to derive more cost-effective delivery channels. Targeted AS
will be provided to assist the banks formulate a holistic SME strategy, including human
resources policy, and implementing this strategy in an effective manner.
Business Enabling Environment: At the request of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce,
and Supplies (MoICS), IFC-SEDF and FIAS jointly undertook a detailed review of the draft
Special Economic Zone (SEZ) legislation in September 2006. This was followed by an
Investment Climate Mini Diagnostic (February-March 2007) which uncovered constraints to
investment in terms of excessively rigid labor regulations, inefficient customs administration,
non-transparent and inconsistent tax administration, inappropriate and uncoordinated
licensing and certification regimes, lack of inspections capacity, and barriers to exit.
The proposed SEZ regime presents an important opportunity for Nepal to offer a stable and
efficient environment for investors to do business in the short term while building up the
support for scaling up reforms to the national level through demonstration effects. FIAS and
IFC-SEDF are currently developing a four year US$6 million Nepal Investment Climate
Reform Program (NICRP) – focused on helping the SEZs meet international best practice.
Questions on IDA may be referred to Ms. Paralkar (458-9050) or on the IFC to Mr. Paul
Barbour (473−7349).

Technical Assistance
Since 1968, AsDB has provided Nepal with technical assistance in most sectors. As of
31 December 2007, ADB approved 270 technical assistance projects totaling $127.8 million.
There are currently 33 ongoing TAs, including 2 JFPR projects

12
Private Sector Operations
•

Developing a strong and dynamic private sector is essential to the long-term economic
growth of Nepal. AsDB aims to strengthen the role of the private sector in Nepal through
prudent investments in its infrastructure sector. The AsDB’s public sector lending and
technical assistance program have also been helping Nepal to create a more conducive
policy and legal environment for private sector development. At the end of 2007,
cumulative approvals for 4 private sector projects in Nepal amounted to $58.64 million
while ADB’s outstanding exposure to non-sovereign projects totaled $24.4 million,
representing 1.4 percent of ADB’s total non-sovereign portfolio.

•

Currently AsDB is looking into the possibility of financing the proposed 750 MW West
Seti Hydropower project.

13
ANNEX IV. NEPAL—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data are generally adequate for surveillance, with scope for
improvement, in particular in the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, and in balance of
payments compilation of remittances, and official and private financial flows. Nepal provides
core data to the Fund and releases data in government and central bank publications. It has
been a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2001.
Metadata were initially posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in May 2001
and last updated in January 2007. A multisector statistics mission visited Kathmandu in
January 2001.
Real Sector Statistics
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) compiles national accounts using the dated
methodology of the 1968 SNA. Key estimates include GDP by industry (in current and
constant prices) and by expenditure categories (current prices), and gross national income
and savings. There are shortcomings due to lack of comprehensive and regular data sources.
The limited source data suffer from inconsistencies, lags in availability, and insufficient
detail. There are also shortcomings in record keeping by agencies, and access to records is
not timely due to processing lags. Reflecting source data problems, compilation methods rely
heavily on fixed ratios derived from surveys or ad hoc assumptions—for example, household
consumption expenditure estimates are based on extrapolations of the 1995/96 benchmark
living standard survey. STA missions in April 2005 and July 2006 provided support to the
development of quarterly national accounts (QNA) and the rebasing of the annual national
accounts to 2000/01 from 1994/95. These missions and other developments are within the
context of a broader Asian Development Bank (AsDB) project aimed at strengthening the
national accounts. A STA expert is scheduled to provide further assistance with development
of QNA later in 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) offers limited coverage based on dated expenditure weights
derived from a 1995/96 household expenditure survey. Coverage is limited to urban areas
while the consumption basket refers to a subset of the population, excluding the upper and
lower two income deciles; single person households; households with more than eight
persons; and households obtaining more than 50 percent of their consumption from own
production or less than 50 percent of their income in cash. The national index aggregates
regional indices using population weights rather than recommended expenditure weights.
The wholesale price index (WPI) was developed by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and first
published in July 2001. The weights for the WPI, based on 1999/2000 data, are derived using
a commodity flow approach with prices related to the first commercial transaction point.
CBS compilation methods need improvement to implement weekly or bi-weekly price
collection; the number of price quotations should be increased; and procedures for adjusting
for quality differences require implementation. The CBS, with STA assistance, is developing
a monthly producer price index (PPI) series, to replace the manufacturing price index,
which is based on unit values rather than actual transaction prices. The PPI is expected to

14
more accurately measure industrial sector inflation and improve deflation in the national
accounts..
Government Finance Statistics
A revised budget classification system, introduced in 1996/97 and subsequently refined, has
substantially improved fiscal statistics, in particular the division between current and capital
spending. However, fiscal data by functional and economic classification are provided on an
irregular basis with varying degrees of coverage. In addition, large amounts are still allocated
to the contingency account, and monthly reporting of development spending excludes
amounts directly paid by donors. Moreover, a number of fees collected outside the budget
and the operations of local governments are not reported in the annual budget.
More timely data on revenue and expenditure are needed for effective fiscal control. A
financial management project is underway and a system of ‘flash’ reporting covering selected
districts that account for the bulk of expenditure is being developed. Further improvement of
fiscal data collected by the Financial Comptroller General’s Office would permit the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) to monitor more effectively actual revenue collections and expenditures,
and to provide assessments during the course of the fiscal year. Such improvements will
require further computerization in MoF regional offices, as well as donor financing and
additional TA.
Consolidated accounts for the public enterprise sector are not compiled on a regular basis,
and financial reporting by many individual enterprises is subject to long delays. Fund staff
has assisted the authorities in processing surveys of public enterprises.
Government finance statistics are regularly reported for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, but not the International Finance Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary data provided to the Fund by the NRB have been subject to revisions with lags of
up to 12 months, complicating program monitoring. Monetary and financial statistics are
compiled under the methodology of the IMF’s 1984 Guide to Monetary and Financial
Statistics. To update the NRB’s compilation methods to the framework of Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM), a 2008 STA mission recommended to
(i) include development banks and finance companies in the institutional coverage of
monthly monetary statistics 1 and, based on this expanded coverage, compile a monthly broad
money/depository corporations survey; (ii) adopt center of economic interest criteria for
classifying residents and nonresidents and for distinguishing resident/nonresident positions of
the financial institutions, instead of the currently used criteria based on citizenship and

Data provided to the mission indicate that the ratio of deposits at development banks and finance companies
relative to total deposits at deposit-taking institutions was approximately 13 percent at end-2006/2007.

15
currency of denomination; (iii) adopt the principle of effective control for distinguishing
between public and private nonfinancial corporations; (iv) ensure that the IMF-related
accounts are fully reflected in the NRB’s balance sheet in accordance with the IMF Finance
Department’s instructions; (v) value monetary gold, SDR holdings, securities, and holdings
of shares/equities based on the end-period fair value/market price; (vi) incorporate accruals in
the outstanding amount of financial asset or liability instead of maintaining them on separate
accounts; (vii) monitor activities of other, smaller deposit-taking institutions (namely, Postal
Savings Bank, Micro Credit Development Banks, Savings and Credit Cooperatives, Citizens’
Investment Trust) and include them in the institutional coverage of broad money/depository
corporations survey when their deposit-taking activities become more significant; (viii) use
Statement of Assets and Liabilities (Form No. 1), instead of the more aggregated set of data
currently used, as the basis for compiling monetary accounts for commercial banks,
development banks and finance companies; and (ix) start regular monthly reporting of
monetary data in the SRF format for the NRB (SRF-1SR) and other depository corporations
(SRF-2SR) based on the compilation system agreed with the mission.
External Sector Statistics
The NRB compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics in conformity with the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manuel (BPM5), but does not compile
statistics on the international investment position. Nepal has benefited from five STA balance
of payments missions since the multisector statistics mission of 2001. Staffing has been
increased and in September 2003, the authorities began disseminating balance of payments in
BPM5 format. Nevertheless, other STA recommendations have not yet been fully
implemented and net errors and omissions remain large. Work is still underway to improve
the estimation of workers’ remittances and the source data for private capital flows, but
further work is needed to improve the recording of oil transactions, grants, foreign direct
investment, short-term inflows, and other private capital flows.
Trade data compiled separately by the NRB, the Customs Department, and the Trade
Promotion Center (overseas trade only) exhibit discrepancies. Export and import price
indices are not compiled.
Incomplete and conflicting data on government external grants and loans complicate the
estimation of foreign financing. The NRB monitors cash disbursements and repayments, but
most commodity aid and direct payment are excluded. MoF reporting is also incomplete and
not timely. With technical assistance from the United Kingdom’s DFID, a new database with
comprehensive data on disbursements, repayments, and the stock of outstanding government
debt has been developed and is currently being refined. However, reporting of direct external
grants remains problematic.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
NEPAL
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Steven Dunaway and Matthew Fisher (IMF)
and Ernesto May and Carlos Braga (World Bank)
May 5, 2008
Public debt dynamics are assessed using the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability
Analysis (LIC-DSA) framework, which was jointly prepared by the IMF and the World Bank.
The baseline macroeconomic scenario is broadly the same as in the previous DSA. The
initial net present value of debt has improved compared to the previous DSA due to the
appreciation of the Nepalese rupee and lower than projected loan disbursements in the
interim. In view of the improved debt indicators, Nepal’s external debt dynamics are
assessed to be subject to a moderate risk of debt distress. This is a change from the previous
DSA, which classified Nepal as at high risk of debt distress.
A. Recent Debt Developments
1.
Nepal’s public debt stock is estimated at 47 percent of GDP in 2007 (in nominal
terms). Public external debt is estimated at US$3.2 billion (33 percent of GDP) of which
about US$3 billion was owed to multilateral institutions, mostly IDA and the AsDB.
Bilateral debt stock is estimated at about US$270 million, with Japan as the largest creditor
accounting for more than half of the bilateral debt. After remaining fairly constant at around
50 percent of GDP since 1995, the external debt stock dropped by about 17 percent during
2004-2007 as a result of relatively low external loan disbursements and the appreciation of
the Nepalese rupee. The domestic debt stock accounts for around 14 percent of GDP and
constitutes an increasing share of total public debt.
B. Assumptions
2.
Baseline projections of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt are based on
the following key assumptions:
•

Real sector: Real GDP growth is projected to rise gradually from 3.8 percent in
2007/08 as the peace process takes hold and stabilize at 5½ percent after 2010/11, in
line with growth rates observed in the 1990s—a period of relative stability—and
supported by structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policies. In the longer

2
term, Nepal’s vast untapped hydropower potential is expected to contribute
significantly to growth. The exchange rate is projected to depreciate against the
dollar, in line with projected movements in the Indian rupee to which the Nepalese
rupee is pegged. Inflation is assumed to decline from around 6.5 percent in 2007/08 to
an average of about 5 percent in the medium term in line with projected inflation
developments in India and as supply bottlenecks are gradually alleviated.
•

Fiscal sector: The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected at 13½ percent in 2007/08 and
projected to average 14.3 percent in 2014-28 owing to gradual improvements in
revenue mobilization. The expenditure-to-GDP ratio is projected around 19½ percent
in 2007/08 and assumed to be maintained at this level thereafter. 1 Official grants are
assumed to average 3 percent of GDP in 2007/08–2012/13 as donors are expected to
support the peace process; from 2013/14 onwards official grants are projected to
decline as a share of GDP.

•

External sector: Exports of goods and services are projected to grow at an average of
about 8 percent over the projection period, supported by tourism and growth in
partner countries. Imports of goods and services (in dollar terms) are expected to
grow by an average of 11 percent in the medium term, fuelled by remittances and in
line with economic activity. Import growth during 2013/14-2027/28 is assumed to
average 6.6 percent. The current account balance is projected to deteriorate from a
surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to a moderate deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP
by 2027/28 driven by the development needs, with remittances declining gradually as
a share of GDP. New financing is assumed to rise from about US$200 million in
2007/08 to US$450 million by 2012/13; from 2013/14 onwards official disbursements
are expected to gradually decline as a share of GDP. The grant element of new
borrowing is assumed to gradually decline during the projection period, with an
average of 46 percent.
C. Baseline

PPG External Debt
3.
A key feature of the LIC−DSA framework is that it compares debt burden
indicators to indicative policy-based thresholds. The thresholds are based on the empirical
finding that low-income countries with stronger policies and institutions tend to have a
higher debt carrying capacity. Nepal is classified as a medium performer based on its three
year average CPIA score during 2004-06. At end-2007, Nepal’s NPV of public debt-toexports ratio is estimated at 148 percent (the relevant policy based indicative threshold is

The projected increase in the fiscal spending in 2007/08 is driven mainly by pre-election and election
spending, higher costs associated with clearing Nepal Oil Corporation’s arrears, and increased donor flows.

150 percent). The ratio is projected to fall to 87 percent by 2027/28. Other indicators remain
below the policy-based indicative thresholds throughout the projection period. 2
4.
In the baseline scenario, debt burden ratios are projected to fall between 2007/08
and 2027/28 (Table 1). The NPV of external public debt-to-GDP is projected to decline from
20 percent to around 12 percent; the NPV of external public debt-to-exports is projected to
fall from 148 percent to 87 percent; and the external public debt service-to-exports ratio is
projected to decline from 9 percent to 6 percent. 3

Total Public Debt
5.
Domestic debt accounts for about 30 percent of total public debt at end-2007. For
the baseline scenario, the NPV of public debt-to-GDP ratio declines from 35 percent at end
2007/08 to 26 percent by 2027/28 (Table 4, Figure 2). Over the same period, the NPV of
public debt to-revenue ratio falls from 216 percent to 157 percent, and the public debt
service-to revenue ratio decreases from 17 percent to 12 percent.

2

The baseline projections expect the current account, which has been historically a surplus in Nepal, to unwind
gradually into a deficit, as spending and higher growth result in more imports of goods and services and the
surge in remittances stabilizes. The average current account deficit over the projection period 2008-28 is a little
over 1 percent of GDP relative to the historical average of a surplus current account of 3.4 percent. The results
of the historical scenario, where the current account surplus of 3.4 percent of GDP continues into the projection
period, suggests negative borrowing and thereby steady declines in debt. In view of this, debt is constrained
to zero in 2018.

3

Given the high concessionality of external debt, the debt service-to-exports ratio is low, and at levels similar or
lower than to most HIPCs after full HIPC debt relief. The ratio reflects debt service on existing debt and debt
service on projected disbursements.

4
D. Sensitivity Analysis
6.

Stress tests and alternative scenarios suggest vulnerability to shocks.

•

Total public debt: A shock modeled as real GDP growth at historical average minus
one standard deviations in 2009-10 results in the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
increasing from 35 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in 2028; the NPV of Debt-toRevenues-and-Grants ratio increases from 215 to 250 percent; and the debt service to
revenue ratio increases from 17 to 23 percent. This scenario illustrates the importance
of the peace dividend as reflected in stronger real GDP growth. Alternative scenarios
reveal vulnerabilities from maintaining the 2008 fiscal stance (primary balance),
which could result in the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio increasing from 35 in 2008 to 44
percent in 2028.

•

External debt: Bound tests indicate that the NPV of debt-to-export ratio is sensitive
to shocks. Following a combined, half-standard deviation shock to export growth,
GDP deflator, and net non-debt creating flows, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
increases significantly, peaking at near 300 percent in 2010, and stays above the
threshold for most of the projection period. Other bound tests (e.g. shocks to exports
and non-debt creating flows) also cause the NPV of debt-to-exports to break the
thresholds. These results are partly driven by Nepal’s volatile export performance in
the past decade. Shocks to other debt indicators such as the NPV of debt-to-GDP and
debt service-to-revenue, result in trajectories below threshold values.
E. Staff Assessment

7.
Based on the LIC-DSA, staffs conclude that Nepal’s external debt dynamics are
subject to a moderate risk of distress. Since the last DSA in 2007, the initial net present
value of debt has improved due to the appreciation of the Nepalese rupee and lower than
projected loan disbursements in the interim. In contrast to the previous DSA, the baseline
scenario does not indicate a protracted breach of debt thresholds. In view of this, Nepal’s
external debt dynamics are assessed to be subject to a moderate risk of debt distress. This
said, bound tests reflecting shocks to export growth and non-debt creating flows could result
in protracted breach of the debt thresholds. The sensitivity analyses underscore the need to
implement sound macroeconomic policies and reforms, including through raising the real
GDP growth rate and achieving higher export growth. Stronger and more stable growth in

5
exports contributing to higher GDP growth, combined with foreign financing at favorable
terms—preferably through grants—would help Nepal make progress toward achieving its
MDG targets while containing risks to debt sustainability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. Owing to the debt dynamics based
on the historical period, the NPV of debt turns negative and is therefore set to zero.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 27, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Nepal
On May 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Nepal. 10
Background
Years of protracted political turmoil and conflict have retarded Nepal’s economic growth. Per
capita GDP has barely risen in the last decade and the country remains one of the poorest in
the world. However, Nepal is now undergoing a major political transition. The next step in this
process, the writing of a new constitution, will be carried out by the Constituent Assembly
emerging from the elections held on April 10, 2008. Despite some pre-election violence, these
elections were considered largely free and fair by international observers.
Despite civil conflict and political upheavals, macroeconomic performance under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-supported program that ended last November has
been stable: growth has been maintained, albeit at relatively low levels; the peg to the Indian
rupee has helped keep inflation below 8 percent during the program period; the budget stance
has been cautious; and foreign exchange reserves have doubled since 2002, boosted by a
strong inflow of remittances.

10

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The macroeconomic outlook for 2007/08 11 remains stable. The agricultural recovery, a
favorable service sector performance, and a significant increase in tourist arrivals could boost
real GDP growth to 3½ –4 percent in 2007/08. Anchored by the exchange rate peg, inflation is
projected to remain at around 6½ percent to 7 percent. On the external side, rising oil imports
and stagnant exports have led to a further deterioration in the trade deficit, but this will be more
than offset by higher workers’ remittances. Despite a strong revenue performance, the budget
deficit could rise this year to about 3½ percent of GDP, reflecting in part the one-off costs of
the elections and the clearance of most of the state oil company’s arrears. However, the
company continues to accumulate sizable losses as high crude prices are only partially
reflected in domestic prices for petroleum products.
While the macroeconomic performance has been stable, progress on structural reforms has
been held back by the fragile political circumstances. In particular, little progress has been
made to address institutional weaknesses in the financial sector and public financial
management.
Vulnerabilities in Nepal’s financial sector remain. Loose monetary conditions have led to
negative real interest rates, rapid and potentially destabilizing stock market and property price
increases, and some capital flight to India. Credit growth has been high, with aggressive
lending by many private banks pushing their credit-to-deposit ratios to levels above
100 percent. Other vulnerabilities include weak supervisory capability and regulatory
compliance, and stalled reforms of the two large public banks.
Limited progress has been made in addressing Nepal’s structural weaknesses in tax
administration and public financial management. Overall, the accounting, auditing, and
reporting of public sector operations remain inadequate. The budget coverage is confined to
only the central budget with limited information on quasi-fiscal activities, internal control
procedures are not fully effective, and the management of spending is weak.
Looking ahead, Nepal’s growth prospects depend most importantly on a peaceful political
transition. Steady but low growth could continue in the near term. However, insecurity,
violence in the Terai region, input supply disruptions, and structural barriers continue to
discourage investment, limit exports, and hamper transition to a higher growth path. With
Nepal located between two of the fastest growing economies in the world, an easing of these
constraints, steady progress on the political front, and the development of Nepal’s vast
untapped hydropower resources could lift growth to levels of 5−5½ percent over the medium
term.

11

Fiscal year begins mid-July.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Nepalese authorities for maintaining budget discipline
and macroeconomic stability over the past several years despite civil conflict and major
political upheavals. Inflation has remained stable, public debt pressures have lessened, and
foreign exchange reserves have grown significantly owing to strong worker remittance inflows.
At the same time, economic growth has been slow.
Directors welcomed the recent successful conclusion of the election for the Constituent
Assembly. They emphasized that Nepal is now at a critical juncture, and that continued
stability is a key condition for allowing the current political transformation to result in higher,
broad-based economic growth. Prerequisites for faster growth—in addition to improving
infrastructure and reducing supply disruptions—include maintaining budget discipline and
ensuring the soundness of the banking sector.
Directors noted that increased spending in some areas to improve the provision of public
goods and address the legacy of the civil conflict should be balanced carefully against the
need to keep domestic borrowing at sustainable levels. Further improvements in revenue
collection will remain a priority, as will continued efforts by the authorities to secure external
grants and concessional assistance. Directors considered that a key short-run fiscal priority will
be to limit—and eventually eliminate—the losses of the Nepal Oil Corporation. They suggested
that the authorities consider introducing an automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum
products, which would depoliticize price setting.
While acknowledging recent efforts to manage liquidity through open market operations,
Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue a more active monetary policy. They
considered that a bias toward liquidity had led to negative real interest rates, rapid credit
growth, potentially destabilizing asset price increases, and some capital flight, suggesting that
some monetary tightening is in order. Directors called for further improvements in liquidity
management and forecasting, and for the separation of the formulation and execution of
monetary policy from public debt management.
Directors agreed that the pegging of Nepal’s currency to the Indian rupee has served the
country well given its extensive commercial ties to India, and that maintaining the peg in the
near term will provide a credible nominal anchor and support Nepal’s macroeconomic stability
and development. With the overall balance of payments in surplus and the reserve position
strong and stable, Directors saw little sign of exchange rate misalignment. However, a
widening productivity gap with India could, over time, present exchange rate management
challenges.
Directors urged the authorities to give renewed impetus to strengthening financial sector
supervision and regulatory enforcement to maintain stability in the face of rapid banking sector
growth. They looked forward to parliamentary approval of the Banking and Financial
Institutions Act, which should further strengthen the regulatory framework, but stressed that

4
significant improvements are needed in enforcement. The application of stricter licensing
requirements will be an important signal of the authorities’ willingness to tighten enforcement
going forward. Directors called for a clearer strategy for completing the restructuring and
commercialization of the two large public banks.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Perry Warjiyo, Executive Director for Nepal
and Sushil Mathema, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 16, 2008
1.
On behalf of the Nepalese authorities, we wish to express our sincere gratitude and
appreciation to Mr. Brian Aitken and his able team for the fruitful dialogue during the Article IV
Consultation held in Kathmandu on March 1-14, 2008. The authorities also find the staff reports a
fair and balanced reflection of the discussions and are in broad agreement with the thrust of staff’s
appraisal.
2.
The macroeconomic performance of Nepalese economy since the fifth and final review
of the three-year PRGF-supported program on November 9, 2007 has remained stable. The growth
momentum has been maintained with considerable level of both internal and external stability.
Going forward, with an election internationally acknowledged as free and fair on April 10, 2008,
Nepal has now entered into a new phase of peace and democracy, which is expected to result in
greater macroeconomic stability and strengthen growth prospects. The continuation of the Fund
program will further cement the success of these challenging political and economic transitions.
Recent Political Developments
3.
On April 10, 2008, Nepal successfully held the Constituent Assembly (CA) election.
The historic People’s Movement of April 2006 ended the decade-long civil conflict. The CA
election was a part of comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) reached among the seven-party
alliance (SPA), in which the Maoist party has emerged as the largest party in the CA, with a
simple majority. With this, one phase of political transition in Nepal has ended and the second
phase has begun.
4.
The CA elections have paved the way for the drafting of a new constitution. The
political parties are making concerted efforts to reach an understanding to form a new government.
It will take place following the first meeting of CA, slated within 21 days of the final
announcement of the CA election results. The political parties have expressed their commitment to
peace process and stressed the need for political consensus going forward. Furthermore, they are
united in stressing the need for accelerating economic growth through improving the investment
climate and initiating the necessary reforms.
Macroeconomic Developments
5.
Despite the difficult political situation, Nepal managed to maintain stable
macroeconomic conditions. Under the PRGF-supported program, annual economic growth
averaged 3.4 percent. The growth in real GDP decelerated somewhat to 2.5 percent in 2006/07
compared to 2.8 percent in 2005/06. The slowdown was largely on account of adverse weather
conditions, though a number of impediments relating to the political transition also constrained the
growth.
6.
The fiscal discipline, prudent monetary policy and, on top of that, the exchange rate peg
helped to keep inflation at a moderate level. Consumer price-based inflation remained at a

2
moderate level of 5.5 percent on average during the last five years. Inflation rates accelerated to 8
percent in 2005/06 and 6.4 percent in 2006/07 on account of the rise in energy prices and food
prices.
7.
Nepal's overall balance of payments (BOP) remained in surplus. The performance of
merchandise exports has been less than satisfactory, mainly due to the removal of the multi-fiber
agreement in 2005, poor labor relations, electricity shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks. The
main driving factor behind the surplus was the elevated level of workers' remittances. In recent
months, the growth in remittances accelerated further. As a result, Nepal's international reserves
remained at the comfortable level. As of mid-March 2008, the accumulation of official
international reserves stood at US$ 2.2 billion, sufficient to cover 7.1 months' imports of goods
and services.
Macroeconomic Outlook
8.
Going forward, the authorities expect a higher rate of economic growth in 2007/08 and
beyond. They believe the growth will be on the upper end of the staff's projection of 3.5–4 percent
in 2007/08 compared to a growth of 2.5 percent in 2006/07. Notwithstanding weaker performance
of merchandise exports and in the manufacturing sector, a satisfactory rate of growth in
agriculture, an encouraging increase in tourist arrivals and some improvements in services sector
underpin the growth outlook for 2007/08. Improvements in the investment climate and a
continuation of structural reforms are expected to pave the way for more robust economic
performance over the medium term.
9.
Although risks to the inflation outlook exist, the authorities expect inflation to stabilize
at around 7 percent in 2007/08. As in other countries, inflationary pressures emanate from higher
energy, commodities and food prices. Of these, the greatest impact on headline inflation is likely
to be the result of an overdue adjustment in oil prices. The authorities also note that the exchange
rate peg plays a crucial role in anchoring prices in Nepal.
10.
On the external front, the trade deficit is expected to widen with the higher growth of
merchandise imports relative to exports. However, workers’ remittances are expected to sustain
the recent growth of 28 percent. This is likely to more than offset the trade deficit, leading to a
modest surplus in the BOP.
Fiscal Policy
11.
The Nepalese authorities continue to adopt fiscal discipline as they have shown during
the PRGF program period. The net fiscal deficit remained at a lower level of 1.4 percent of GDP
in 2006/07, on account of a pick up in revenue growth and a controlled expansion in government
spending. The net domestic financing of budget deficit was lower at 0.9 percent of GDP in
2006/07. The government finance data as of May 2, 2008 showed a significant amount of
cumulative cash balances maintained by the government with the NRB. As the revenue is showing
an encouraging growth of 25.3 percent, the government’s domestic borrowing is expected to
remain within the budgeted limit, ensuring macroeconomic stability.

3
12.
Going forward, the authorities concur with the staff that maintaining fiscal discipline is
likely to be a key policy issue in the face of rising public expectations. The threat to fiscal
imbalance may arise from the growing public aspirations and the increasing demand for public
expenditure on rehabilitation, relief measures and reconstruction of infrastructures. The significant
risk to the fiscal accounts also comes from the persistent losses from Nepal Oil Corporation
(NOC). The authorities had made an attempt to recoup the losses in recently by adjusting in oil
prices upwards. However, the proposed increase was aborted in the face of strong public protest.
In the current fiscal year alone, the government extended loans of 4 billion rupees to NOC to help
maintain the domestic supply of petroleum products. The reform in oil sector remains a key policy
challenge.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
13.
The Nepalese authorities concur with staff’s assessment that the level of Nepalese real
exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, thus supporting the external stability. In particular,
given the specific nature of Nepalese workers abroad, they note that it is paramount to take into
account the worker remittances in judging the current account norm for assessing the real
exchange rate. The public debt-to-GDP ratio has also dropped significantly in recent years,
contributing further to external stability. The ratio declined from 61.7 percent in 2002/03 to 43.9
percent in 2006/07. Likewise, total foreign debt has fallen from 45.4 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to
30.1 percent in 2006/07. As pointed out in the staff report, limited foreign borrowing and the
nominal appreciation of Nepalese rupee against the U.S. dollar contributed to a significant drop in
the public debt.
14.
The authorities believe that the exchange rate peg has been an anchor that has
contributed significantly in sustaining macroeconomic stability in Nepal. With the continued
appreciation of Indian Currency (IC) vis-à-vis U.S. dollar, the nominal appreciation of Nepalese
currency (NC) against US dollar has attracted public attention over the past year. The authorities
have taken note of the staff's views in the selected issue paper that this is not the appropriate time
to change the level and the regime of exchange rate. They are also of the view that risks to
macroeconomic stability outweigh any potential benefits from a regime change.
15.
With the exchange rate peg, the authorities concur with the staff on the need to
maintain monetary policy discipline. Nonetheless, they would like to make a number of points
with regard to staff's analysis. It is true that monetary growth has been in excess of what was
initially projected. With the establishment of new banks, commercial banks in Nepal have
expanded their activities in a more competitive environment. As some these commercial banks
were recently established, there is an uneven distribution of liquidity. Given the political transition
and fragile financial situation, a cautious monetary policy stance has been put in place. As stated
in the staff report, the NRB intervened in the case of margin lending for investment in share
market by the financial institutions. On January 22, 2008, the NRB issued a directive to banks and
financial institutions to manage margin lending in an effective manner, which has ensured an
orderly development in the stock market. The current thrust of monetary policy has also been to
facilitate the orderly development of the financial sector.

4
16.
The NRB is also focusing on open market operations to manage the liquidity of the
system. Open market instruments such as outright sale auctions, outright purchase auctions, repo
auctions and reverse repo auctions are being used for this purpose. The liquidity monitoring and
forecasting framework (LMFF) based on the weekly balance sheet of the NRB is employed to
guide the open market operations. Besides this, the authorities are monitoring the banking sector
liquidity on a daily basis and necessary interventions are being made accordingly. The authorities
are committed to take appropriate policy actions to modulate the liquidity.
Structural Reforms
17.
Our authorities are also of the view that continuation of structural reforms and
maintaining financial sector stability are the keys in accelerating economic growth and thereby in
helping alleviate poverty. A number of structural reforms relating to government finances, public
enterprises and the financial sector were introduced during the recently-concluded PRGF program
period. The establishment of a large tax office (LTO), wide area network (WAN) between
headquarters and regional customs offices and expansion of the ASYCUDA system are some
examples of fiscal sector reforms. In addition, a new custom act was enacted in September 2007,
which includes a variety of broader reforms such as the implementation of an improved valuation
system according to GATT principles, provision and permission for offsite declaration and
clearance, declaration before the arrival of goods, provision of import return on re-export, special
provision for Special Economic Zone (SEZ), post clearance audit, and risk-based audit.
18.
The authorities have made a number of commendable efforts to increase fiscal
transparency and accountability in the program period. The major steps taken by the government
to improve transparency were the creation of CIAA (Commission for Investigation of Abuse of
Authority), a National Vigilance Centre (NVC) to enforce accountability of politicians and
bureaucrats, published guidance material for tax payers and organized public hearings in the tax
and customs administrations, reclassification of expenditures into recurrent and capital,
formulation and implementation of budget in line with MTEF, the publication of annual and midterm review of the budget and the publication of financial performance of public enterprises.
19.
The authorities have also taken a number of measures aimed at maintaining financial
sector stability in the face of the growth in the number of banks and financial institutions in recent
years. The NRB doubled the minimum paid-up capital required for the establishment of new banks
and financial institutions in April 2007. Similarly, a number of measures relating to fit and proper
test for promoters, board of directors and chief executive officers of banks and financial
institutions have been issued. With a view to remove distortions created by the system of crosslending of shares by the financial institutions, the NRB has issued a directive asking all the banks
and financial institutions to divest promoter shares in other banks and financial institutions by
mid-July 2008. As a measure to enforce regulatory capital, the NRB has issued recently a directive
relating to prompt corrective actions to be effective from October 16, 2008. The Cabinet has
already approved a revised draft of the Banks and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA),
incorporating 25 core principles of bank supervision, clear guidelines for mergers and acquisitions,
and procedures for voluntary and involuntary liquidation. As a step forward to move to a Basel II
framework by July 2008, the NRB has announced the parallel implementation of Basel II for the
current fiscal year, and a trial reporting under the new system has been initiated.

5
20.
On bank restructuring, the authorities have resorted to operational and financial
restructuring the two largest public banks under a World Bank FSRP. During the five-year
restructuring period in both banks, substantial progress has been achieved. The banks have
registered operational profits, a significant proportion of the NPAs have been reduced and
80 percent of the banks’ operations are now computerized and incorporate a more modern
approach. The authorities are of the opinion that the restructuring process should be continued
further for an additional three years at the minimum, and that this process will be carried out by
local professional bankers under the control of the NRB with concurrence from the World Bank.
21.
In an effort to stem the losses of the NOC, the authorities made upward revisions in the
price of petroleum products twice in the year. In the wake of the continuous rise in global oil
prices, the authorities feel that the adjustment is still inadequate. Given that the country is passing
through a political transition and the issue of energy price is politically sensitive, the authorities
are considering a different approaches that allows gradual but steady price adjustments be made by
introducing an automatic pricing mechanism, and will seek the private sector’s participation both
in the importation and distribution of oil.
Conclusion
22.
Nepal’s macroeconomic performance remains stable. The authorities acknowledge the
important role played by the recently-concluded PRGF program in maintaining macroeconomic
stability even under difficult political conditions. They are committed to safeguarding
macroeconomic stability. As Nepal is in a critical juncture in its history, our authorities continue to
solicit the support from the donor community to take the country forward to the path of
sustainable peace and stable economic growth. A successor to the PRGF program would play
another key role in anchoring the overall macroeconomic policy going forward. The authorities
would like to thank the Executive Board and staff for their continued support and constructive
advice.
23.
Finally, we are pleased to inform the Board that the Nepalese authorities have
consented to the publication of the staff report.
