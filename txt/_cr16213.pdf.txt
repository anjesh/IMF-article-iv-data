IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Czech Republic
On June, 24, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic has been growing fast on account of a favorable external environment,
high EU funds utilization, and accommodative macroeconomic policies. Strong efforts to
absorb EU funds supported a sharp pickup in investment, while higher employment and
wages, and improving consumer sentiment benefitted private consumption. Unemployment
has fallen significantly to the lowest level in the EU. The current account surplus widened in
2015, on account of an improvement in the income account mainly due to stronger EU
transfers. Headline inflation remained subdued in 2015, as positive domestic developments
were offset by external disinflationary factors.
Fiscal performance was better than expected in 2015, on account of robust tax revenues and
spending discipline. But, the main driver was a significant shift in the structure of funding of
public investment during the transition between EU fund cycles. To maximize EU fund
absorption, government units shifted its focus to EU-funded investments, postponing
domestically-financed investments.
Monetary policy has remained accommodative. In November 2013, constrained by the zero
lower bound, the Czech National Bank decided to use the exchange rate as an additional
inflation targeting instrument to fight deflationary pressures. Appreciation pressures started
building up in mid-2015 prompting the CNB to intervene and defend the floor. In February
2016, the CNB Board extended its commitment to the floor until end-2016.
The banking sector is stable and credit growth remains robust. Czech banks have high capital
buffers and profitability, strong asset quality, and low non-performing loans. Credit growth
has been driven by corporate sector demand for long-term investment loans and household

demand for mortgages and consumer credit. Low mortgage rates have boosted lending,
putting upward pressure on prices. Moreover, some deterioration in the affordability-ofhousing indicators has taken place recently.
Economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2016. Higher disposable income and
employment will boost private consumption, but growth will be affected by the slow start of
investment projects financed by EU funds. As base effects from the oil price shock fade and
domestic demand pressures build-up, inflation is expected to reach the 2-percent target in
mid-2017. Over the medium-term, output growth is set to stabilize at around slightly above
2 percent in line with economy’s potential.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Czech Republic’s favorable economic performance—
including strong economic growth and a steady decline in unemployment—which has been
underpinned by its solid fundamentals, a favorable external environment, positive growth
impact from high EU fund utilization, and supportive macroeconomic policies. At the same
time, Directors noted that potential growth is insufficient to achieve fast convergence toward
the income levels of other advanced European countries. Accordingly, they encouraged the
authorities to maintain their prudent macroeconomic management, while implementing
structural reforms to boost potential growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued fiscal discipline, and deemed their mediumterm fiscal deficit objective appropriate. They noted that, with the structural deficit already
below this objective, there is space for increasing public spending on much-needed
infrastructure to support higher medium-term potential growth. Directors urged the
authorities to resist pressures to reduce taxes and increase current spending in the run up to
next year’s elections, and to avoid changes in the pension system that could jeopardize its
long-term sustainability. They emphasized that a speedy adoption of fiscal framework
legislation would help anchor fiscal policy, guard against pro-cyclicality, and enhance
predictability.
Directors concurred that the balance of risks to inflation is tilted to the downside and, thus,
saw merit in maintaining the currently accommodative monetary policy stance until the
inflation forecast and inflation expectations become entrenched around the inflation target.
They called on the central bank to continue to focus on inflation targeting and to prepare the
modalities for an eventual exit from the exchange rate floor to a floating exchange rate once
conditions allow. Directors agreed that, if downside risks to inflation were to materialize, the
central bank could employ other tools to counter an undesirable tightening of monetary

conditions. These could include using negative interest rates to help mitigate speculative
capital inflows as well as discretionary interventions in case market conditions became
disorderly. Nevertheless, a number of Directors called on the authorities to exercise caution
in using negative interest rates, noting that they could have negative implications for bank
profitability and financial stability.
Directors welcomed the progress in strengthening the financial supervisory and regulatory
frameworks. They concurred that the financial system is sound and resilient to shocks, with a
low, system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio as well as strong capital and liquidity buffers. Noting
that a strong housing market could become a potential source of risk, Directors welcomed the
steps already taken to tighten mortgage lending standards, and encouraged the authorities to
remain vigilant to prevent a buildup of vulnerabilities and to further tighten the
macroprudential stance if current trends continue. In this regard, they recommended giving
the central bank the authority to issue binding macroprudential regulations.
Directors welcomed the recently adopted 2016 National Reform Program, and stressed the
importance of its steadfast implementation to raise potential growth, noting that priority
should be given to enhancing investment in physical and human capital and to promoting
innovation. Directors also called for efforts to boost the effectiveness and efficiency of
infrastructure spending; reform the education system to prevent skill shortages from
becoming binding in the future and, thus, help attract more knowledge-intensive industries;
and improve the coordination and prioritization of spending on research and development.
Directors underscored the need for more predictable policy and regulation and for a reduction
in the administrative burden, which will help boost the business environment, competiveness,
and investment.

CZECH REPUBLIC
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 10, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. A favorable external environment, high utilization of EU funds, and supportive
macroeconomic policies have boosted economic growth. The authorities’ medium-term
fiscal objective is appropriate, but fiscal framework legislation that would anchor policy
is yet to be approved by parliament. The central bank’s use of an exchange rate floor to
achieve its inflation target has helped stem deflationary pressures, but inflation is still
well below target. The financial system is sound and resilient to shocks.
Policy recommendations. Policies should aim at comprehensively addressing obstacles
to strong and sustained growth, while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
 Fiscal policy. Support the economy in light of the expected growth slowdown using
available space to increase capital spending, while remaining within the medium-term
deficit objective (MTO). Anchor fiscal policy in a medium-term framework enshrined in
legislation and consistent with the MTO, to avoid pro-cyclicality and enhance
predictability. In tandem with efforts to reduce tax avoidance, improvements in the
efficiency of public spending would create room for public investment.
 Monetary policy. Continue to focus on inflation targeting in policymaking and
communication, and prepare the modalities for an eventual exit from the exchange rate
floor to a floating exchange rate that should commence once the inflation forecast and
inflation expectations become entrenched around the inflation target. If downside risks
for inflation materialize, stand ready to employ other tools to counter an undesirable
tightening of monetary conditions.
 Financial sector. Remain vigilant and be ready to address possible risks to financial
stability.
 Structural reforms. Boost potential growth by increasing labor market participation
of certain population groups, and enhancing investment in human and physical capital.
Efficient utilization of EU funds is also important to maximize their growth impact.

Czech economic performance has been impressive recently, but challenges remain.
A favorable external environment, high EU fund utilization, and accommodative macroeconomic
policies have contributed to a strong growth performance, with output having surpassed its
pre-crisis level, and a sharp decline in unemployment. This performance along with solid
fundamentals has enhanced market confidence, as reflected in record-low bond yields and credit

Labor market performance has been strong. Solid private sector-led employment
growth of 2 percent y-o-y in 2016:Q1 helped reduce the unemployment rate to 4.1 percent in
April. Labor participation reached 75 percent and hours worked continued to grow steadily. Real
wage growth accelerated to 3.9 percent in 2016:Q1, boosted by an improving labor market, and
increases in public sector wages and the minimum wage. Following the post-crisis freeze, the
minimum wage has been increased by a cumulative 24 percent during 2014–16, thus bringing it
to 35 percent of the average economy-wide wage compared with an EU average of 42 percent.

inflation expectations of financial markets
(at 1.7 percent in May 2016) have recovered
from their historic lows a year ago, while three-year inflation expectations remain well-anchored
at 2 percent.
5.
Fiscal performance was better than budgeted in 2015. The fiscal deficit narrowed
from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.4 percent—against the 1.9 percent target—on account of
robust tax revenues and spending discipline, implying a 0.5 percentage point tightening of the
fiscal stance.1 But, the main driver was a significant shift in the structure of funding of public
investment during the transition between EU fund cycles. To maximize absorption, government
units shifted their focus to EU-funded investments, postponing domestically-financed
investments.2 Public debt declined to 41 percent of GDP, as the government continued to
economize on cash balances in the Single Treasury Account, by extending the scope of the State
treasury system.

Stripping net EU revenues out of the structural balance offers another measure of fiscal stimulus. The resulting
structural deficit widened by 1 percentage point in 2015, capturing the impetus of EU-fund utilization.
1

2015 was the last year that capital expenditures could be financed from the 2007-13 EU fund allocation. Such
spending has a much lower impact on the deficit than domestically-financed investment, as up to 85 percent of
the projects is EU funded.

0.05 percent since November 2012. In November 2013 amid mounting disinflationary pressures,

2016, the CNB extended its commitment to the
floor until end-2016.
7.
The banking sector is stable and credit growth continues to strengthen. Czech banks
are mainly self-financed with deposits that grew by 8 percent y-o-y in 2016:Q1. They continue to
enjoy high capital buffers and profitability, and strong asset quality. The deleveraging process
bottomed out at end-2014, and credit to the private sector has been growing at around
8-9 percent since August 2015, driven by demand for both corporate and household loans.
8.
Czech Republic’s external position is strong. The current account surplus widened to
0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, on account of an improvement in the income account due to
stronger EU transfers and lower dividend payouts. The trade balance deteriorated slightly relative
to GDP, owing to the higher import component of investment, which boomed in the transition
between EU-fund cycles. Higher EU-fund absorption also boosted the capital account. Foreign
direct investment was weaker than in previous years, while portfolio inflows increased
significantly. The net international investment position improved to –31 percent of GDP, on the
back of higher official reserves.

Staff’s assessment is that the external position is broadly in line with fundamentals
and desirable policies. The EBA methodology yields mixed results for the Czech Republic in

terms of the current account and the real effective exchange rate, with a negative current
account norm (Box 1). Other considerations also point to the absence of evident imbalances in
the external position, or of significant shortcomings in non-price indicators.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2016. Private consumption will remain
robust on the heels of higher disposable income and employment, but the projected slowdown
in EU-fund absorption will weigh on growth. Over the medium-term, output growth is set to
stabilize at slightly above 2 percent in line with the economy’s potential (Box 2). Inflation is
expected to reach the 2 percent target in 2017, as base effects from the oil price shock fade and
domestic demand pressures pull inflation up. The current account is projected to remain in a
small but declining surplus, before moving toward a deficit on account of improving investment
and in line with fundamentals.

The balance of risks to the outlook—highlighted in the Risk Assessment Matrix—
appears to be tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-projected external demand, notably from
the euro area but also indirectly from China and other emerging markets would weigh on
exports, especially given the role of the Czech industry in the Germany-Central European supply
chain. An escalation of the refugee crisis in Europe or a decision by UK voters to leave the EU
could increase market uncertainty, and affect trade and economic activity. Moreover, global
financial market turbulence could generate safe-haven capital inflows that would contribute to
appreciation pressures, while a prolonged period of low interest rates could—absent effective
macro prudential measures—lead to overvaluation of real estate and other asset prices that
could threaten financial stability. On the upside, the positive effects from supportive
macroeconomic policies, lower oil prices, improved economic sentiment, and the ECB’s
quantitative easing could be larger than currently forecast.
Authorities’ views
12.
There was broad agreement on the economic outlook and the balance of risks. The
authorities shared the view that economic growth would slow this year on account of a decline in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

CZECH REPUBLIC

public investment, and they broadly agreed on the medium-term prospects. They saw mostly
externally-driven risks as tilted primarily to the downside, notably the possible slowdown in the
euro area and emerging markets, and intensification of geopolitical tensions which could have a
negative impact on market sentiment in the region. All in all, the authorities saw these risks as a
reason to sustain or even strengthen policies supportive of domestic demand. Finally, they
agreed on the need to boost potential growth as a key element for the convergence process.

POLICY AGENDA
Discussions focused on the need to anchor fiscal policy in a medium-term setting, conditions and
modalities of monetary policy normalization, and policies to boost potential growth.

A. Fiscal Policy
13.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline and a continued
reduction in public debt. However, the near-term fiscal outlook carries some uncertainty.


In their 2016 Convergence Program (CP) the authorities are targeting headline fiscal deficits
of 0.6 and 0.5 percent of GDP for 2016 and 2017, respectively. According to staff’s baseline
scenario, this would imply a slight widening in the structural fiscal deficit to 0.8 percent of
GDP in 2017 against the 1 percent medium-term deficit objective (MTO). This near-term
policy stance is appropriate, in light of the expected growth slowdown and with inflation
projected to remain below target well into 2017.



Measures to fight tax evasion—e.g., electronic VAT reporting and the gradual rollout of
electronic evidence of sales—are expected to begin bearing fruit in the near term. However,
projected revenue gains would be more than offset by increases in public wages and child
tax credits, new hires in education and police, and the topping-up of the automatic pension
indexation. Staff acknowledged that the increases in the public wage bill and social security
benefits incorporated in the CP reflected a welcome catching-up with the cost of living,
following a prolonged wage and benefit freeze or even some decreases after the 2008 crisis.
However, staff urged the authorities to resist pressures for additional wage and benefit hikes
in the run-up to next year’s elections, until the effectiveness of the strengthening of tax
collection becomes firmly established. Similarly, the authorities should resist shifting more
items to the reduced VAT rate—following the cut in VAT on meals and non-alcoholic drinks
that are served in restaurants—and other tax reductions. Future tax cuts should be part of a
broader review of the tax system.

14.
The envisaged medium-term fiscal deficit objective is appropriate, but needs to be
accompanied by a clear medium-term strategy. Staff’s baseline scenario projects that on
current policies the structural deficit would decline to ½ percent of GDP over the medium term,
which is below the 1 percent medium-term deficit objective. This, along with potentially sizeable
tax administration gains still to be realized, provides the authorities space for maneuver and for

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

accommodating fiscal priorities, including higher public investment on much-needed
infrastructure. Nevertheless, staff reiterated its recommendation for speedy adoption of fiscal
framework legislation—currently under consideration by Parliament—to anchor fiscal policy,
reduce pro-cyclicality, and enhance predictability.
15.
Government decisions and plans for the pension system could undermine its
long-run sustainability. Recently-approved legislation creates the possibility for discretionary
increases of pensions—in certain cases and up to a limit—beyond what would be indicated by
the automatic indexation formula. In addition, plans are under way to cap the statutory
retirement age, which is being increased by two months every year, but which will remain below
the EU average over the medium-term. Moreover, the granting of early retirement benefits to
miners employed by the now bankrupt mining company goes against the objective of improving
the system’s efficiency. Staff therefore urged the authorities to refrain from ad hoc pension
adjustments beyond what is implied by the standard indexation formula, and from putting an
ex-ante limit on the maximum retirement age.

16.
The authorities’ focus on reducing tax avoidance needs to be complemented by
other structural fiscal reforms. The challenge of rising health-care costs calls for further policy
actions aimed at raising the efficiency of spending and improving health outcomes. Measures
should aim at putting in place incentives for

better planning and prioritization of such investments. Addressing weaknesses in public
procurement likewise remains a priority.
17.
The level of public debt is moderate but consideration could be given to increasing
its average maturity. Under current policies, public debt is expected to decline to around
36 percent of GDP by 2021, and would remain sustainable under alternative scenarios
incorporating negative shocks to the debt-servicing capacity (Annex VII). The Ministry of Finance
has carried out buybacks of limited amounts of bonds with short remaining maturities, financed
by issuance of long-term bonds. However, the average maturity of public debt has decreased
following the sizable issuance of two- and three-year bonds with negative auction yields. Going
forward, public debt management could take advantage of the current low interest rate
environment to increase the average maturity of debt and lower debt service.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

18.
Strengthening the capacity to absorb EU funds is a key priority. Weaknesses in
national management and control systems resulted in significant delays in absorption of funds
from the 2007–13 program period, and the highest rate of financial accounting corrections in the
EU (Annex III). The Ministry of Regional Development was recently given the powers to carry out
centralized management and coordination of Operational Programs, resulting in significant
improvement in outcomes. The absorption rate rose sharply in 2014–15, but there are concerns
about a possible increase in the incidence of irregularities, as control systems had come under
strain. Despite better planning for the 2014–20 program period, the start of projects has been
slower than in the previous period. This is in part due to the incompatibility of Environmental
Impact Assessments (EIA) with revised EU-wide standards. Staff urged the authorities to take all
necessary measures to ensure compliance with EU requirements, with a view to launching large
transport infrastructure projects as soon as possible. Furthermore, there is a need to
systematically follow up and correct the systemic shortcomings identified in the Supreme Audit
Office’s audits of utilization of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities re-affirmed their commitment to fiscal discipline. They pointed to
their strong efforts to further reduce the deficit and noted that the structural deficit was already
well below the medium-term objective. They considered the slightly expansionary near-term
stance necessary to support the economy, also given the moderate level of public debt and its
projected decline, and noted that in their view the structural deficit would reach the MTO already
in 2017, on account of the larger than Fund staff’s estimates of the output gap, and remain at
that level over the medium term. At the same time, they admitted that pressures for higher
current expenditures and lower taxes would probably increase in the run-up to the elections, but
were committed to adhere to the fiscal deficit targets of the Convergence Program. Moreover,
they were hopeful that approval of fiscal responsibility legislation would take place expeditiously.
The authorities agreed on the need to narrow the labor tax wedge and address the rise in health
care costs. A number of measures were taken in the area of health care, including the
introduction of centralized public procurement for selected pharmaceuticals, while the envisaged
changes in the allocation of health premiums among insurance funds would better reflect the
cost profile of patients. The authorities have been discussing with the European Commission
ways to resolve the issue of incompatibility of existing EIA with revised EU-wide standards so that
large transport EU-financed infrastructure projects could start soon. Finally, they were optimistic
that the new Public Procurement Act would increase transparency and reduce administrative
requirements.

B.

Monetary Policy

20.
With the balance of risks remaining on the downside, there was agreement on the
need to maintain the current supportive monetary conditions for now. In recent years, the
role of the output gap in explaining headline inflation dynamics has been reduced, whereas
external factors, including spillovers from euro area inflation, commodity price changes, and
exchange rate movements, have played a larger role. The positive dynamics of the real economy
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

and labor markets suggest that a scenario that involves damaging second-round effects of low
inflation has become less likely. However, the positive price impetus from domestic demand and
the tight labor market continues to face anti-inflationary headwinds including from declining
import prices. There was thus agreement on the need to maintain the current accommodative
monetary conditions until the inflation forecast and inflation expectations become entrenched
around the inflation target. Against this backdrop and with current policies remaining in place
through end-2016 (including the exchange rate floor), inflation is projected to reach the central
bank’s 2-percent target in mid-2017.3

21.

Staff urged the authorities to maintain their focus on inflation targeting and to
begin laying the groundwork for monetary policy normalization. The exchange rate floor
was introduced as a temporary instrument in the inflation targeting regime and has provided a
clear and credible signal of the CNB’s commitment to the inflation target. Moreover, staff
analysis suggests that it has been successful in mitigating deflationary pressures (Annex IV).
However, the CNB should begin to prepare for the eventual exit from the floor to a floating
exchange rate. If downside risks for inflation materialize, the bank could employ other tools to
counter an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions. To this end, the bank should be ready
to use discretionary interventions in case FX market conditions became disorderly, and to be
prepared to reduce interest rates to a negative level. Clear communication about CNB’s focus on
inflation targeting would be important for guiding expectations and reinforcing the credibility of
the framework during the normalization process.

Negative interest rates would help in the event that downside risks for inflation
materialize. Since mid-2015, appreciation pressures on the koruna have intensified and reserve

and appreciation pressures, and following
lessons from international experience (Annex V). In particular, given the reliance of Czech banks
on domestic deposits as a funding source and the sizable excess liquidity at the central bank,
3

According to both CNB’s and staff’s projections, absent the envisaged monetary accommodation until
end-2016, inflation would fall short of the 2-percent target within the monetary policy horizon.

11

CZECH REPUBLIC

negative rates could have a substantial impact on net margins for banks. To mitigate this,
negative deposit interest rates could be applied in tiers, thus excluding certain parts of the
deposit base.
Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities agreed on the need for monetary policy to remain accommodative
in light of the current anti-inflationary balance of risks. They shared staff’s view that
underlying inflationary pressures should be building on account of strong domestic demand and
tight labor market conditions. However, they noted that wages were growing more moderately
than hoped, and were concerned that a prolonged period of very low inflation could start
affecting wage agreements. In this connection, they emphasized the need to maintain the
exchange rate floor till end-2016 and their readiness to raise it further if disinflationary pressures
increase sharply. Nevertheless, they repeated their commitment to inflation targeting and the
floating exchange rate regime as soon as conditions allow normalization of monetary policy.
Regarding additional monetary policy tools, the authorities noted that the CNB board had been
discussing the pros and cons of negative interest rates, and that the bank and commercial banks
were operationally ready for their introduction. To this end, they did not see significant risks to
the banking sector from the introduction of mildly negative policy rates. At the current juncture
though, they did not consider the interest rate differential with the euro as the main driver of
capital inflows. Finally, they assessed the koruna to be broadly in line with the long-term
fundamentals, and thus they foresaw a smooth exit to a fully floating exchange rate but noted
their readiness to intervene in the FX market to smooth excessive volatility.

C. Financial Sector
24.
The financial system is stable and resilient to shocks. Recent stress tests suggest that
banks are sufficiently resilient against substantial shocks. The sector has a large capital buffer (a
capital adequacy ratio of 16.7 percent in 2015), which should enable it to absorb significant
adverse shocks.4 Bank profitability remains strong, notwithstanding the low interest rate
environment, as the impact of the decline in net interest margins has been offset by strong credit
growth and cost reduction. However, persistently low interest rates could negatively affect bank
profitability going forward. The NPL ratio remained low at 5.5 percent in 2015, and the banking
sector has long been self-financed with deposits, which have continued to increase, keeping the
loan-to-deposit ratio below 80 percent.

Capital buffers would remain sufficiently above the 8 percent regulatory minimum under an adverse scenario
that includes a W-shaped recession, quantitatively similar to the 2009 and 2012 downturns.

Continued vigilance will be needed to prevent a buildup of vulnerabilities in the
housing market. Staff welcomed CNB’s recommendations to tighten mortgage lending
standards, but for them to be effective, they need to become legally binding. More broadly, the
authorities should consider giving the CNB the authority to issue binding macroprudential
regulations. Going forward, continued vigilance will be needed and, if current trends in the
mortgages segment continue in the coming months, the macroprudential stance should be
further tightened. Preference should given to targeted measures, including raising risk weights
on mortgages, lowering LTV limits with possible regional differentiation, and issuing clear
guidance on maximum debt-to income limits.
28.
Staff welcomed progress on improving the regulatory and supervisory framework.
The authorities have largely implemented the 2012 FSAP recommendations. (Annex II). Moreover,
the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) was transposed into local law, making the
CNB a designated resolution authority. The Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive has been
transposed via a change in the Act on Banks effective January 2016, in parallel with the BRRD
transposition. The new harmonized resolution framework should allow the authorities to
minimize taxpayer exposure to loss from solvency support when resolving financial institutions
while maintaining financial stability. Finally, the Consumer Credit Act transposing the Mortgage
Credit Directive that aims to create a Union-wide mortgage credit market with a high level of
consumer protection is currently in the Parliament.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment and emphasized their readiness
to address potential risks to financial stability. They noted that overall banking sector risks
remained low, and pointed to recently-completed stress tests suggesting that banks have
sufficient capital to cover two-year losses. They admitted though that potential systemic risk had
increased, a fact they attributed to growing risk appetite of economic agents due to positive
macroeconomic developments, expectations of low interest rates for a prolonged period, and a
strong housing market. To mitigate this risk, they had increased the countercyclical capital buffer
to 0.5 percent effective 2017, and they stood ready to increase it further if credit growth turned
out to be faster than currently foreseen. As for the housing market, the authorities noted the risk
from the potential feedback loop between real estate developments and mortgage lending, and
pointed to strong credit growth in buy-to-let mortgages and to some estimates suggesting a
mild overvaluation of apartments. To this end, the CNB has been monitoring developments
closely, had started to collect data on a loan-by-loan basis, and was currently reviewing the need
for and modalities of tighter prudential measures, including ways to make them binding.

D. Structural Reforms
30.
Higher potential growth will be necessary for speedy convergence with other
advanced economies. The gap between Czech per capita income and the EU average has
ceased falling, largely due to a sharp slowdown in Czech growth from an annual average of
4.5 percent during 2000–07 to 0.9 percent during 2010–14. Besides cyclical factors, structural

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

factors could also be at play: the rapid initial convergence was underpinned by higher trade
integration, technology transfer, and an inexpensive labor force, and contributed to a strong
export-oriented manufacturing sector.

Ambitious structural reforms remain essential for increasing potential growth.
Consideration should be given to measures to enhance investment in physical and human
capital, and promote innovation.


Labor market. Although overall labor force participation has increased, it remains low in
some segments of the population; especially among the low-skilled. Moreover, the labor
force is projected to decline due to demographic factors, and skill shortages could become
binding, thus making it difficult to attract more knowledge-intensive industries and raise
productivity. To this end, improving tertiary education and vocational training is important,
while consideration should be given to the introduction of a dual vocational education
system, more flexible immigration policies, and providing incentives to boost labor mobility.



Investment. Staff analysis suggests that the average post-crisis investment rate has been
near its optimal value (Annex VI). However, this outcome has been partly driven by the
extraordinary EU-fund drawdown, which will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, the Czech
economy faces the challenge of filling the void through higher private and public investment,
and more efficient EU-fund utilization.



Innovation. R&D expenditure has increased significantly, reaching the EU average in 2014,
but outcomes remain weak (see: EC country report 2016). The National Research,
Development and Innovation Policy for 2016–20 includes important measures to address
weaknesses, improve the coordination and prioritization of R&D spending, and increase
cooperation between research centers and business. Steadfast implementation would help
the Czech Republic move up the value chain.



Business environment. Czech Republic ranks highly overall in business climate indicators. It
advanced from 53rd to 37th place in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index
in 2015. This was due to changes to public procurement rules and adoption of legislation
requiring proof of property origin. The country slipped from 33rd to 36th place in Doing
Business Indicators in 2015, which highlighted high labor taxation and difficulties dealing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CZECH REPUBLIC

with construction permits. Other institutional-quality indicators show that the Czech Republic
lags behind competitors in business regulation and quality of institutions (Figure 4). Staff
thus underscored the need to address remaining weaknesses, and to improve the
predictability of policy and regulation, reduce the administrative burden, and increase the
efficiency of judicial procedures, including the framework for formation; restructuring and
liquidation of firms.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities were confident that their reform agenda—as elaborated in the
recently-approved National Reform Program—boded well for higher medium-term
potential growth. They noted the need to jump start large infrastructure projects and believed
that the new construction law (currently in Parliament) that unifies multiple approval procedures
and the new public procurement law would help increase infrastructure spending, enhance the
efficiency of use of EU funds, and increase their absorption. Better infrastructure could also
increase labor mobility. Moreover, measures to help parents and women returning from
maternity leave, namely increasing the tax allowance starting from the second child, and
continued improvement in the availability of childcare services, should help boost labor
participation further. The authorities pointed to policies to support the integration of
immigrants—a Fast Track project and a Welcome Package—and their cooperation with the
industry to identify potential jobs that could be filled by immigrants, although noting their
gradual approach to integration. Finally, a number of measures were under way, including
improvements in electronic points of single contact for entrepreneurs and regular evaluation of
the administrative tax burden, to enhance the business environment and reduce the
administrative burden.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The Czech economy has been performing very well. Supportive macroeconomic policies
over the past three years, along with a favorable external environment, and high utilization of EU
funds have contributed to strong output growth and a steady decline in unemployment. This
performance, along with solid fundamentals, has enhanced market confidence.
34.
But challenges remain. The central bank’s exchange rate floor has helped keep inflation
in positive territory, but inflation is currently still below target. In addition, potential growth is
below the level necessary to facilitate fast convergence toward the income levels of other
advanced European countries. Thus, the challenge for the authorities is to create the conditions
for a sustained increase in potential growth and to maintain macroeconomic stability.
35.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal deficit objective is appropriate, but needs to be
anchored in fiscal framework legislation. The projected slight widening in the structural fiscal
deficit over the near term is warranted by the expected growth slowdown and with inflation well
below target. Moreover, with the structural deficit already below the medium-term deficit
objective, there is space for maneuver and for increasing much-needed public infrastructure to

support faster medium-term potential growth. However, it is important to resist pressures to
reduce taxes and increase current spending in the run-up to next year’s elections, and to eschew
changes in the pension system that could jeopardize its long-term sustainability. Finally, a speedy
adoption of fiscal framework legislation would help anchor fiscal policy and guard against
pro-cyclical tendencies.
36.
The central bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting and set the stage
for monetary policy normalization. With the balance of risks for inflation remaining on the
downside, monetary policy should remain accommodative until the inflation forecast and
inflation expectations become entrenched around the inflation target. However, the central bank
should begin to prepare for the eventual exit from the exchange rate floor to a floating exchange
rate. If downside risks for inflation materialize, the CNB could employ other tools to counter an
undesirable tightening of monetary conditions. To this end, the bank should be ready to use
negative interest rates to help mitigate speculative capital inflows and discretionary interventions
in case market conditions became disorderly. Finally, clear communication about CNB’s focus on
inflation targeting would be important for guiding expectations and reinforcing the credibility of
the framework.
37.
Continued vigilance will be needed to safeguard financial stability. The banking
sector is self-financed with a low system-wide loan-to-deposit ratio and strong capital and
liquidity buffers, which make it resilient to shocks. Recent trends in the mortgage segment
suggest an increase in potential vulnerabilities and the CNB has issued recommendations to
tighten mortgage lending standards. However, for them to be effective, they would need to
become legally binding. Going forward, continued vigilance will be needed and if current trends
in the mortgage segment continue in the coming months, the macroprudential stance should be
further strengthened. The authorities have made further progress in strengthening the
supervisory and regulatory framework and have largely completed the implementation of the
2012 FSAP recommendations, including the transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive into local law.
38.
Ambitious structural reforms are key to raising Czech Republic’s growth potential.
Priority should be given to enhancing investment in physical and human capital, and promoting
innovation. Strong efforts would be needed to ensure compliance with EU environmental
regulations for large infrastructure projects and to boost the effectiveness and efficiency of
infrastructure spending. Priority should also be given to reforms of tertiary education and
vocational training to help attract more knowledge-intensive industries and prevent skill
shortages from becoming binding. Steadfast implementation of measures aimed at improving
the coordination and prioritization of R&D spending, as well as cooperation between research
centers and business would help the Czech Republic move up the value chain. Finally, an
improvement in the predictability of policy and regulation, a reduction in the administrative
burden, and enhanced efficiency of judicial procedures are essential for higher investment.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Impact if Realized
Low
Czech sovereign and banks are not
reliant on external borrowing to
any significant extent.

High
A non-cooperative outcome of the
refugee crisis could weigh on
economic activity through trade and
confidence channels.

Low
Border closures and restrictions on
the free movement of goods,
services, and labor weigh on trade.
Failure to agree on an EU-level
solution could weigh on
confidence and economic activity.

High/Medium
In the euro area, weak demand and
persistently low inflation leads to “new
mediocre” growth rate. Significant
China slowdown, triggered by
corporate distress precipitating
deleveraging, uncertainty and capital
outflows.
High
Domestic demand would accelerate
supporting growth, while inflation
would decline, complicating the
conduct of monetary policy. The
current account surplus would widen.

Medium
External demand would wane,
weighing on Czech Republic’s
exports and growth.

High
Subsequent renegotiation of crossborder trade, financial, and migration
relationships could elevate financial
volatility and uncertainty. Long-run
economic performance could diminish.

Medium/Low
The direct trade impact should be
moderate. The UK is the 4th export
partner of the Czech Republic,
accounting for 5 percent of total
export. Rising uncertainty could
lead to higher volatility in financial
markets.
Medium
A prolonged period of low growth
can lead to long-term output
losses. Structural reforms could be
delayed due to lack of political
appetite.
Low
Overall household indebtedness
and price-to-income ratios while
rising are relatively low by
international standards. Banks are
well-capitalized to absorb potential
losses.

Medium
If the growth momentum falls sharply,
hysteresis effects can reduce potential
growth further.

Medium
A protracted period of low interest
rates could lead to increased leverage
and housing price overvaluation,
exposing banks and households to
adverse interest, price, and income
shocks.

Medium
Household real incomes would be
boosted and lower production
costs would support growth. Lower
inflation would pose challenges for
monetary policy.

Policy Response
Maintaining accommodative
monetary conditions, while
loosening the fiscal stance
would allow for absorption of
shocks.

An easing bias would be
appropriate provided supply
constraints do not become
binding.

Policies supporting domestic
demand, as well as diversifying

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and "high" a probability
of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks at the time of discussions with the authorities.

Box 1. External Sustainability and Competitiveness
Staff’s assessment is that Czech Republic’s external position is
broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies. The EBA
current account methodology suggests a current account gap of
2 percentage points of GDP, pointing to a stronger external position
than the norm in the long run. This indicates a moderate
undervaluation of 4 percent in 2015. This result is in line with the
estimates of the External Sustainability approach that points to an
undervaluation of 4.4 percent. In contrast, the REER methodology
suggests a 10 percent overvaluation, based on fundamentals. In
staff’s view, this result is inconsistent with the recent increase in
the share of world imports and the good export performance.
Current account. The level of the current account does not raise
major competitiveness concerns. The current account turned
positive in 2014–15 driven by an improving trade balance on the
back of strong exports and low oil prices and benefitting from a
depreciating currency. Large historical FDI flows give rise to a
high negative primary income balance, due to profit repatriation.

Foreign assets and liabilities. The IIP improved to –31 percent
of GDP in 2015. External debt increased from 68.8 percent of
GDP in 2014 to 70.8 percent in 2015.
Foreign reserves. Official foreign exchange reserves have been
increasing and are adequate. The foreign exchange interventions
by the CNB (to defend its exchange rate floor) along with strong
EU fund inflows resulted in a significant increase in reserves in
2015. However, their level as a share of GDP (36 percent) remains
moderate and the reserve adequacy metric falls within the
suggested adequacy range (reserves stand at about 123 percent
of the IMF composite reserve adequacy metric). Staff sees further
inflows of EU funds and a persistent current account surplus
contributing to a further reserve accumulation in the near term.

are also reflected in the increase in

At the same time, according to non-price competitiveness indicators, the Czech Republic is lagging behind other
OECD countries in the areas of business regulation and institutions (Figure 4). Good performance is recorded for
indicators measuring the quality of trading across the border and credit market rigidities. With respect to peers, the
CPI-based real exchange rate also shows a more marked downward trend.

Potential growth is recovering from post-crisis lows
but is projected to remain subdued at about 2–2½ percent.1 It decelerated sharply during the crisis
coming to a standstill in 2012–13. Since then it has been growing reaching an average of 2½ percent in
2015 (according to all estimates, with the exception of the production function). It is projected to remain at
well below pre-crisis levels and thus would be insufficient to speed up income convergence with other
advanced EU economies.
The deceleration of potential growth was largely due to a decline in contribution of TFP and labor
force reduction. Negative TFP growth remained a drag on potential output since 2010, while the
contribution of capital declined but remained positive. The increase in potential growth since 2013 was
driven by recovering contribution of labor reflecting higher labor force participation that more than
compensated the decline in working age population.
All estimates suggest that the output gap closed in mid-2015. It is expected to turn into a positive range
of 0.3-0.7 percent in 2016 (consistent with the staff’s baseline estimate of 0.2 percent) and move to zero in
the following years. However, it is important to bear in mind that significant uncertainty surrounds these
estimates.

CZECH REPUBLIC

Annex I. Response to Past Fund Policy Advice
Policy implementation has been broadly consistent with IMF advice.
Key recommendations
Adopt a growth-friendly fiscal strategy
entailing a slight relaxation of the fiscal stance
in the near term to support the economic
recovery and a commitment to a mediumterm objective of a 1 percent of GDP structural
deficit.

Implemented policies
Implemented. The fiscal stance is projected to ease
slightly in 2016–17, but the structural deficit is expected
to stay below the medium-term deficit objective of
1 percent of GDP—recently confirmed in the 2016
Convergence Program.

Adopt a fiscal rule which has wide coverage, is
easy to monitor, incorporates a debt brake,
and is monitored by an independent Fiscal
Council.

Not yet implemented. A government proposal, broadly
in line with these recommendations, is under discussion
in parliament.

Maintain the focus on inflation targeting, while
continuing to evaluate the conditions that
would trigger a normalization of monetary
policy and the mechanics of its
implementation.

Implemented. The Czech National Bank has committed
to maintaining the exchange rate floor through end2016, while emphasizing in its communication the
temporary nature of the floor and the exit horizon.

Continue to strengthen the supervisory
architecture, transpose the Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive into domestic law.

Implemented. The Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive was transposed into local law, making the CNB
a designated resolution authority. The CNB largely
completed the implementation of 2012 FSAP
recommendations (Annex II).

Give priority to structural reforms aimed at
promoting research and innovation, enhancing
apprenticeship programs, simplifying tax
compliance and other administrative
procedures, and improving infrastructure.

In progress. The 2016 National Reform Program
envisages a number of actions, including on Research
and Development policy. The new public procurement
law and construction law are expected to help speed up
infrastructure investment.

Annex II. FSAP Recommendations and Implementation
Recommendations
Macroprudential Framework
Elevate financial stability to a policy
objective in the CNB law
Improve the decision-making
mechanisms within the CNB to take
timely action to address systemic
risk

Upgrade the stress testing
framework for banks, focusing on
group-wide risk monitoring

Status
Implemented.
Implemented. Regular meetings on financial stability have been
instituted. Capital reserves according to the CRDI IV/CRR have been
introduced and regularly re-assessed (counter-cyclical buffer quarterly,
DSIB buffers annually). Regular monitoring of risks associated with
lending to real estate sector was introduced and the results serve as the
input to decision-making process (biannually).
Implemented.

Regulation and Supervision
Increase the number of supervisory
staff to strengthen the intrusiveness
of supervision

Implemented. Significant increase of prudential on-site and off-site
examination staff enabled to increase the frequency and the scope of
inspections, to focus more intensively on problem credit institutions and
to shorten significantly the AML/CFT on-site supervisory cycle across all
the financial sectors.

Introduce a “prompt corrective
action” framework

Implemented. Supervisory off-site manual has been updated. Manual
contains supervisory actions for particular level of capital adequacy
thresholds considering capital requirements arising from Pillar 1 as well
as Pillar 2. Manual also reflects new rules arising from CRDIV/CRR
including capital buffers and consequent supervisory actions in case of
breach of these buffers.

Set large exposure limits in line
with the globally agreed levels

Partially implemented. Large exposure limits are currently stipulated in
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions
and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.

Continue closely monitoring
significant transactions between
subsidiaries and their parents, and
take action, if necessary

Implemented. In addition to the standard regulatory reporting, the CNB
imposed extraordinary reporting duty on selected credit institutions
which have to provide information about transactions with significant
effect on exposure to parent company or other institutions from the
group. Any extraordinary reporting duty could be extended by any
indicator and imposed to any vulnerable institution.

Strengthen the framework for
supervising financial conglomerate

Implemented. The Financial Conglomerates Directive (FICOD I) has been
implemented. The legal framework for financial conglomerates in the
Czech Republic is thus fully compliant with relevant EU regulation and we
consider this recommendation implemented.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

CZECH REPUBLIC
Strengthen the CU sector by
restructuring the existing
institutions

Implemented. Legislation (in line with IMF recommendations) has been
effective since 2015. Big credit unions need to convert into banks or scale
down, new rules include increase of contributions to the reserve fund, to
the Czech DIF and loans to a CU member limitation, enhances
involvement of CU members. The amount of credit a union can provide
to its member (or connected members) is set to CZK 30 000 000. The
postponed rule will introduce a minimum ratio between the deposits and
the member interests (10:1), with some qualifications for deposits
accepted before the amendment became effective. CNB started to
monitor in detail liquidity and other aspects of credit unions, discuss the
plans for conversion with eligible credit unions and provide guidance on
the new rules to credit unions, their members and auditors.

Crisis Management and Resolution Frameworks
Operationalize the framework for
providing public support to banks;
Adjust the threshold for imposing
conservatorship

Enhance governance of the Deposit
Insurance Fund (DIF), increase its
target size and strengthen the
provisions for budgetary financing
of possible shortfalls, clarify the
trigger for payout of insured
deposits, and allow the DIF to fund
the transfer of deposits via
purchase & assumption
agreements

34

Partially implemented. Public support to banks is covered both by the
BRRD (transposed with effect on 1 January 2016) and the Commission
"Banking" Communication from 30 July 2013 (not reflected in legislation
yet). Public support can be used as last resort after possibility of other
resolution tools has been assessed and exploited to the maximum extent
practicable whilst maintaining financial stability. In line with BRRD, the
institute of conservatorship has been replaced by new tools - (i)
temporary administration for the early intervention phase and (ii) special
management for the resolution phase. Triggers and purposes of both
these tools are clearly determined by the BRRD. According to BRRD,
respective authorities may appoint a special manager to replace the
management body of the institution which is under resolution. Through
the transposition of BRRD the conditions for appointing a special
manager are softer in comparison to the preceding legal framework for
conservatorship. CNB has been assigned as the National Resolution
Authority.
Implemented. DGSD has been transposed via a change in the Act on
Banks valid from 1 January 2016, parallel with the BRRD transposition.
Both the ex-ante funded Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and the National
Resolution Fund (NRF) are operational. The DIF is fully funded (already
exceeding the target level of 0.8% covered deposits) and continues to
collect maintenance-level contributions. The NRF starts from zero and
will reach the target level of 1.0% covered deposits in 2024, in 9
installments. The combined level of DIF and NRF contributions have no
systemic impact on banking sector profitability, as the increase in NRF
contributions have been matched by a decrease in DGS contributions.
Both DIF and NRF contributions are risk-weighted. Preferential treatment
of insured deposits in resolution is guaranteed. Trigger to pay out
insured deposits is clearly stated in the DGSD transposition and from July
2016 will be shortened to 7 days. DIF assets can be used in resolution in
certain instances. Governance of DIF and NRF is strengthened through
the creation of the Financial Market Guarantee System (FMGS). FMGS
manages money of both the DIF and the NRF and provides for the paybox function of the DIF. The Minister of Finance appoints 5 supervisory
board members, of which 2 are from the MoF, 2 from the CNB and one
from banking industry, subject to conflict-of-interest rules. Budgetary
financing of potential shortfalls in DIF and NRF is part of the new
legislative framework, but has not been tested.

The expedited spending of EU funds could, however, compromise their efficacy and
adversely affect the fiscal position.4 In many cases, the selection of the projects was reportedly
driven by a need to spend the allocated budget rather than by the quality of the projects. And
while EU funds supported growth in the short term, by focusing on “shovel-ready” projects, their
impact on potential output could have likely been higher, with better prioritization. Hastened

Efficient use of EU funds has for long remained a challenge for EU member states. See, for instance, Fiscal
Transfers and Economic Convergence in the EU: An Analysis of Absorption Problems and an Evaluation of the
Literature by Yves Hervé and Robert Holzmann, 1998, Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft, Baden-Baden.

absorption could have also led to errors in project implementation, resulting in potential
additional fiscal costs, since the EC will not reimburse such costs.5
5.
The absorption rate is projected to slow down significantly in 2016. The Czech
Ministry of Finance projects that EU grants (without agricultural subsidies) would decline by
€2 billion (about 1.3 percent of GDP) in 2016. This is in line with the observed slower pace of
absorption in the first two years of the 2007–13 program period and is explained by the time it
takes to move from planning to implementation stage of investment projects.
6.
Maximizing the growth impact of EU funds would require more effective and
efficient utilization. Measures could include: better planning of public investment, costing and
prioritization of public investment plans, employing a standard methodology for cost-benefit
analysis and project appraisal, taking account of potential risks to the project, and having a
central review process of major projects, and more efficient and open procurement process.6
Box 1. Audit Findings and Recommendations in the Area of Management of EU Funds
During 2007–13, the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) carried out a number of audits of utilization of
EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. Results from these audits point to systemic shortcomings in several
key areas (classified by frequency of occurrence):



High—shortcomings in control work by entities in the implementation structure and in the
legislative field.



Medium—shortcomings in the assessment and selection of projects, financial shortcomings,
shortcomings in contracts and decisions on the provision of support, and shortcomings in
administrative work.



Low—breaches of contractual duties by beneficiaries, deficiencies in public procurement, badly
designed assessment criteria and unsatisfactory program outcomes.

The SAO made a number of recommendations for the new programming period 2014–20 that include:










Simplify implementation systems and subsidy provision processes
Simplify the rules and regulations for the provision of subsidies and reduce the paperwork involved
Correctly define the overarching development strategies
Analyze the needs for more precise targeting of support
Define better specific and measurable goals reflecting the necessity of support
Focus more on efficiency and effectiveness when selecting and financing projects
Improve control systems; target control work at verifying benefits and necessity and
simultaneously on compliance with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness
Put in place more effective monitoring systems focusing on assessment of outcomes and impacts

In some cases, however, these grants could be re-directed to other projects. Irregularities of absorption of EU
funds are in many EU countries related to poor procurement practices.

Annex IV. Impact of the Exchange Rate Floor on Inflation1
1.
This note analyzes the extent to which the introduction of the exchange rate floor by the
Czech National Bank (CNB) had an impact on Czech inflation. Since the counterfactual for the
Czech inflation in the absence of policy intervention cannot be observed, the note attempts to
create such a counterfactual for the level of Czech inflation if the CNB had not introduced the
exchange rate floor. Three different empirical strategies are implemented to build a suitable
counterfactual:


An event study that exploits the pre-intervention sample to build a model to forecast
inflation in absence of the FX floor.



Difference-in-difference regression analysis that compares the evolution of inflation for the
Czech Republic with a control group of similar countries.



A synthetic control method that exploits the statistical properties of the data to choose a
control group that best matches the “pre-treatment” characteristics of the “treated” country.

Event study approach
2.
An event study is implemented based on an open-economy New Keynesian Phillips
curve. A standard Phillips curve model for Czech Republic is estimated on the pre-event sample
(2008:Q1–2013:Q3) and then the forecasts
are used to measure the “abnormal”
behavior of inflation due to the
intervention.2 The predicted values for
inflation describe the behavior of inflation
in the absence of the policy change.
3.
The results suggest that the
introduction of the floor has helped keep
inflation above zero. As can be seen in the
text figure, which plots the actual and
predicted series for headline inflation,
after the introduction of the floor the two
series diverge, with the forecast trending

towards the beginning of 2015 (with a 95 percent confidence interval).3

after 2013:Q4 (the date of the introduction
of the exchange rate floor). This finding also supports the hypothesis that the introduction of the
floor has probably helped prevent inflation from going into negative territory.

interventions in Brazil: a synthetic control approach”, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro Working
Paper. No. 630, 2015.

6.
Across all model specifications, the interaction term is positive and significant, suggesting
that the exchange rate floor worked in the desired direction against deflation. As shown in the
text Figure, the magnitude of the effect varies across specifications, but in the preferred model,
the coefficient on the interaction term indicates that the introduction of the floor brought Czech
inflation up by 0.5 percentage points compared with the control group. An important caveat, that
should be stressed at this point, is that the analysis is complicated by the non-randomness of the
treatment. As such, it cannot be argued that the introduction of the exchange rate floor was
randomly assigned to the Czech Republic. This, however, is a common problem in
macroeconomics given the lack of experimental data. Still, caution is needed in interpreting the
causality in these results.

The synthetic control group
method is a semi-parametric approach
to choose the right control group.
Given the difficulties of building a
good control group, the methodology
developed by Abadie et al. (2010)5 is
adopted in order to build a synthetic
control group as a weighted average of
other unaffected countries.6 The
synthetic control method focuses on
the construction of the synthetic
control group by searching for a
combination of other units that are
selected to match as close as possible
the characteristics of the country
affected by the treatment. 7

Conclusions
10.
The results of the empirical analysis support the idea that the exchange rate floor
achieved the objective of alleviating deflationary pressures in the Czech Republic. Despite the
lack of a causal interpretation, given by the very nature of the treatment, the results of all three
employed methods showed that the introduction of the exchange rate floor as an additional
instrument for achieving the inflation objective prevented Czech inflation from entering negative
territory.

California dropped significantly relative to a comparable synthetic control region. Suppose we observe

the outcome of the treated unit 𝑖 after the treatment at 𝑡 ≥ 𝑇0 . 𝑌𝑖𝑡𝑁 is the potential outcome we would
observe for region 𝑖 at time 𝑡 if region 1 never receives the treatment. The problem is that we do not
observe 𝑌𝑖𝑡𝑁 (the counterfactual). If we assume that the treatment has no impact before period 𝑇0 + 1,
then the average effect on the treated unit is 𝛼𝑖𝑡 = 𝑌𝑖𝑡𝐼 − 𝑌𝑖𝑡𝑁 . We aim to estimate 𝛼1𝑇0+1 , … , 𝛼1𝑇 . Since 𝑌1𝑡𝐼

Where Zi is a vector of observed covariates (not affected by the intervention). Let 𝑊 = (𝑤2 , … , 𝑤𝑗+1 )′ be

real economy. Encouraging more spending and
less saving, and making more investment projects profitable, negative interest rates shift
aggregate demand up with the overall effect depending on investment opportunities (TFP
growth), confidence, and the health of domestic balance sheets.2 By discouraging capital inflows,
negative rates put downward pressure on the currency supporting external demand and helping
close the output gap.
3.
However, deeply negative interest rates can lead to cash hoarding and damage the
monetary transmission mechanism. At a certain level of negative deposit rates it becomes
more profitable for economic agents to hold physical cash. Estimates of this threshold range
from 0.2–1 percent costs of storing cash3 to 2–3 percent convenience fees associated with the
use of credit and debit cards4. So far evidence shows that the cash ratios in the countries that
introduced negative rates were not unusually high, and the analysis indicates that negative rates
of around 2 percent are possible without causing large scale shift to cash. Additionally, central
banks can recourse to a number of measures to make cash operations less attractive.
4.
Negative deposit rates could hurt bank profitability. The extent to which profitability
is affected will depend on the degree to which the banks’ funding costs fall as well as the
elasticity of credit demand to potential cuts in lending rates. Additionally, there is a risk that
banks reluctant to impose negative interest rates on depositors will instead raise lending rates in
order to maintain sufficient margins. While the current experience indeed shows that banks are

not charging negative deposit rates to individuals,5 average lending rates have declined and
credit standards were relaxed following the introduction of negative rates.
5.
Further monetary easing poses risks for financial stability. Aggressive search for yield
by investors could lead to asset price bubbles and loose credit standards. Insurance companies
and pension funds are particularly hurt by the decline in long-term interest rates, and might
move to more risky assets with possible negative consequences for long-term financial stability.
6.
Recent international experience with negative policy rates has been broadly
positive.6 They help deliver additional monetary stimulus and easier financial conditions, thus
supporting demand and price stability. So far there is no evidence of cash hoarding or money
market impaired functioning in any of the economies with negative policy rates. The transmission
mechanism seems to work but the pass-through to the real economy has been partial and
smaller than a symmetric interest rate cut at positive levels. And while lending rates declined in
most countries, there was only little impact on inflation expectations.

bank profitability, negative rates could be applied in tiers, thus excluding certain parts of
deposits and targeting the marginal rate on excess reserves.7

7.
Negative interest rates could discourage capital inflows and reduce appreciation
pressures. The experience of Denmark suggests that negative interest rates could be very
effective against speculative inflows. In the aftermath of the SNB exit, Denmark witnessed a sharp
increase in demand for the kroner prompting heavy FX intervention. The central bank cut the
deposit rate from just below zero to –0.75 percent. The inflow of funds ceased and over the
course of 2015, Denmark sold part of the foreign exchange it had acquired back into the market.

There are examples of negative deposit rates introduced for corporate clients in Switzerland and Denmark.

In Denmark, the adverse impact on bank profits was mitigated by actively varying the cap on the deposit facility.
Each bank can deposit a certain maximum amount at the current account to limit scope for speculation against
the peg. This implies that two tiers of interest rates are applied on bank deposits. The Danish example provides
little evidence of severe adverse effects on lending rates to the real economy from moving central bank policy
rates further into negative territory (at least up to -0.75 percent).

unsustainable for many borrowers. The resulting push
for deleveraging led to further declines in investment and higher saving rates. Despite the
subsequent gradual recovery and recent notable easing of financial conditions, private investment
rates remain below pre-crisis levels across the EU.

3.
The persistent weakness of investment rates raises the question of whether they have
overshot the equilibrium response to changing fundamentals. The optimality of investment rates
across EU CEE can be judged against the predictions of theoretical growth models—either based on
regression analysis informed by first-order optimality conditions or calibration of the fundamental
parameters of the utility and production functions. The analysis presented below takes the latter
approach, using as benchmark the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans neo-classical growth model (Box 1). This
is an adaptation of the Miranda (1995) analysis of the optimality of Japan’s postwar saving behavior

Prepared by Plamen Iossifov.

Investment rates in CEE EU began to accelerate in the run-up to EU accession. This occurred later in countries that
were part of the second wave of EU accession in 2007 (Bulgaria and Romania). To ensure comparability of the
average, pre-crisis investment rates across all CEE EU, the sample starts in 2004.

The pre-crisis investment booms, generally, far outpaced the mobilization of national savings, resulting in large
current account deficits, largely financed by euro area banks through local subsidiaries and direct cross-border
lending.

to the question of optimality of pre- and post-crisis investment rates in the EU.4 The main advantage
of the calibration approach is that it provides a benchmark that is invariant with respect to countries’
initial conditions (i.e., it is not sample-dependent as is the case with the regression approach). Its
main disadvantage is that analytic tractability requires an abstraction from important characteristics
of the economy.

Analytical framework
4.
The neo-classical “golden-rule” of capital accumulation can be seen as a lower bound
for investment rates during CEE EU’s convergence to euro area income levels. In the RamseyCass-Koopmans neo-classical growth model, an economy that satisfies the optimality and
transversality conditions converges to a steady-state equilibrium, in which consumption is maximized
and the saving/investment rate is constant and follows the “golden-rule” of capital accumulation
(Box 1). Under typical calibration of the parameters, the model implies that the investment rate
would fall monotonically as the economy converges to its steady state.5 As such, the closedeconomy, “golden rule” saving/investment can be interpreted as a lower bound for the investment
rate along the CEE EU’s convergence to euro area income levels. The interpretation of the “golden
rule” as a lower bound of the optimal investment rate also holds in the case of a similar open
economy, for which the world interest rate is lower or equal to the value in the steady state of the
closed economy.
5.
In our analysis, the “golden-rule” of capital accumulation is calculated for most EU
countries over two, nine-year periods (2000–08 and 2011–19). The average pre- and post-crisis
investment rates are estimated over 2004–08 and 2011–15, respectively, and are compared to the
“golden-rule”, long-run benchmarks.
6.
The model is calibrated for most EU countries using data and forecasts for 2000–08 and
2011–19 from Eurostat and the European Commission (EC)’s AMECO database. Countries
excluded from the sample include euro zone members that had programs with the EU and IMF and
Latvia.6 The parameters of the model are estimated with country-specific data for the capital share of
output, productivity and population growth, and the depreciation rate. The unobserved rate of time
preference is assumed to be the same across all CEE EU countries and, separately, across all euro
area countries, and is kept constant in 2000–08 and 2011–19:


The capital share of output is estimated as one minus the labor share of output. The latter is
calculated from national accounts data through 2014 and is assumed to gradually converge to its
2000–15 average value by 2019. In an attempt to correct the well-known problem of

Miranda, Kenneth, 1995, “Does Japan Save too Much?, in Ulrich Baumgartner and Guy Meredith, eds., “Savings
Behavior and the Asset Price “Bubble” in Japan”, IMF Occasional Paper, 124, (Washington: IMF).
4

More generally, the investment rate “…can follow a complicated path that includes rising and falling segments as the
economy develops and approaches the steady state.” (See Barro, Robert and Sala-i-Martin, Xavier, 2004, Economic
Growth, Second Edition, (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press), p. 106).

In the case of Latvia, the AMECO estimates of capital stock translate in unrealistically high depreciation rates of over
20 percent, signaling lack of consistency between the source data and the assumptions used in AMECO.

misclassification of labor income as profits by unincorporated entrepreneurs, the economy-wide
compensation of employees is adjusted upwards by a portion of self-employment income. The
adjustment is carried out in such a way that the share of labor compensation in the value added
generated by the household sector (and non-profit institutions serving households) is made
equal to the observed ratio in the rest of the economy. In the case of the Czech Republic, the
adjustment increases the average labor share in gross value added over 2000–2015 from 44
percent to 53 percent. For the region as a whole, the corresponding correction is by 10
percentage points to around 56.5 percent. Similar adjustments to the raw data are also made in
the Penn World Tables.


Estimates of the capital stocks, depreciation rates, and total factor productivity (TFP) are taken
from the EC’s AMECO database. In the AMECO database, capital stocks are calculated using the
perpetual inventory method, with investment and depreciation data from national accounts and
assuming an initial capital-to-output ratio in 1995 of 3 for the Czech Republic and 2 for all other
CEE EU countries. The depreciation rate is assumed to remain at its last observed value (2014)
over the period 2015–2019. TFP is calculated as a residual, after subtracting the contributions to
GDP growth of capital and labor. In the EC methodology, these contributions are calculated
assuming uniform labor share of output of 0.65 across countries. In calibrating the Ramsey-CassKoopmans growth model, the multifactor TFP growth is converted into a solely laboraugmenting one by dividing the AMECO data series by the uniform labor share of output.



The rate of time preference is assumed to be the same across all CEE EU countries and,
separately, across all euro area countries, and is kept constant throughout the sample period. Its
values for CEE EU and euro area countries are imputed from Equation 6 in Box 1, as the values
that make actual investment rate equal to the “golden rule” on average over 2000–19. The
resulting country-specific estimates are then used to calculate averages for the two groups of
countries: 5 percent for euro area countries and 9 percent for CEE EU. This imputation is more
plausible for euro area economies, which are arguably near their steady-state growth paths. At
the same time, the higher rate of return on capital in CEE EU implies that the rate of time
preference across CEE EU should be higher than in the euro area (see Equation 3 in Box 1), which
is consistent with our estimates.

Main Findings
7.
Results from the analysis suggest that the average investment rate in the Czech
Republic was higher than its closed-economy, steady-state value both pre- and post-crisis. The
most likely explanation is that the Czech economy is converging from above to its steady-state
growth path. Both in the pre- and post-crisis years, the excess investment over the “golden rule” can
be, to a large extent, explained by the utilization of EU Structural and Cohesion funds (figure below).
In the rest of CEE EU, pre-crisis investment rates exceeded by a wider margin their optimality
benchmarks in South-Eastern Europe and were broadly in line across the Baltics and the other
Central European countries (left panel of figure below). The higher than optimal investment rates in
South-Eastern Europe are better explained by overinvestment in residential construction than by

convergence from above to their steady-state values. Such an interpretation is supported by the
post-crisis slump in residential housing prices across the region. At the same time, there are signs of
an investment crunch in the Baltics and the rest of Central Europe in the post-crisis years (right panel
of figure below). The rump-up in utilization of EU Structural and Cohesion funds over the last two
years has helped alleviate the credit crunch.

8.
In the Czech Republic, the post-crisis fall in investment net of EU funds matched
closely the decline in the “golden rule” (left panel of figure below). This is another way of
illustrating the finding that the lower post-crisis investment rate in the Czech Republic appears
optimal in response to the deterioration in fundamentals—lower TFP growth and to a lesser extent
worsening demographics. For the rest of CEE EU, results show that in the vast majority of countries
the post-crisis decline in investment rates occurred alongside a downward correction in the “goldenrule” benchmarks (left panel of figure below). The latter has been driven by lower TFP growth and
worsening demographics, as in the case of the Czech Republic. The investment rates in Croatia and
Estonia have exceeded their optimal values in both pre- and post-crisis years, despite the recorded
decline since 2008. On the other hand, Slovenia has managed to close the gap between actual and
optimal investment rates significantly in the crisis aftermath. Lithuania and Slovakia, and to a smaller
extent Hungary and Slovakia are experiencing sub-optimal investment rates. In these countries, the
post-crisis decline of investment (net of the part exogenously financed by EU funds) has been larger
than the concurrent deterioration in the “golden-rule” benchmark, resulting in a fall of the overall
investment rate bigger than the legacy gap between pre-crisis average investment rate and the
“golden rule” in the crisis aftermath (figure below).

9.
Returning to the path of rapid convergence to the euro area calls for policies to reverse
the slump in TFP and demographics and address institutional weaknesses. In countries that saw
declines in steady-state investment rates—e.g., Bulgaria, Croatia, and the Czech Republic—policies
should focus on raising TFP and human capital. In countries where investment rate declines were
much larger than the deterioration in the “golden-rule” benchmarks—e.g., Estonia, Hungary,
Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia—policy priorities include overcoming credit constraints
and institutional impediments that discourage private investment. Poland is a sole example of a
country that has stayed close to its steady-state equilibrium throughout the whole sample period.

Box 1. Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans Neo-Classical Growth Model
In the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model without population growth, an infinitely-lived representative

capital accumulation constraints, as well as positive initial capital allocation endowment:

s.t.

𝐾𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝛿)𝐾𝑡 + 𝐼𝑡
𝐿 = 1, 𝐾0 > 0, where
p – rate of time preference; I – investment; 𝛿 – depreciation rate.
Households own capital, which they lend to firms for a rental rate (𝑅), and are endowed with one unit of
labor each period that they supply inelastically to production firms, in return for a wage (𝑊). In this case,
the utility function collapses to 𝑈(𝐶𝑡 ).
The first-order optimality conditions for the representative household are:
𝑈 ′ (𝐶𝑡 ) = 𝜆𝑡
𝜆𝑡 =

𝜆 (1

𝜆𝑡 – Lagrange multiplier for the household’s optimization problem. It represents the shadow
value of one extra unit of wealth (i.e., capital).

Box 1. Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans Neo-Classical Growth Model (continued)
In market equilibrium, the economy-wide resource constraint requires aggregate output (𝑌) to equal
demand (𝑌 = 𝐶 + 𝐼). The resource constraint also holds for the representative household. The transversality
condition ensures that the capital stock, when valued in terms of discounted utility, goes to zero as time
goes to infinity:

lim
𝜆𝑡 𝐾𝑡+1 = 0
𝑡⟶∞ (1 + 𝑝)𝑡
A balanced growth path (or steady state) in this model is defined as a solution, in which all variables
(except labor) grow at the same fixed rate. It can be shown that in the unique steady-state of this model,
the balanced growth allocations {𝐶𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 , 𝐼𝑡 , 𝑌𝑡 } each grow at the rate of labor-augmenting technological
progress (1 + 𝑥).
For consumption to grow at a rate of (1+x), equation (1) requires:
(1 + 𝑥) =

(1 + 𝑅 − 𝛿)
1+𝑝

𝑅 ≌ 𝑝 + 𝛿 + 𝑥, for small 𝑝 and 𝑥

For capital to grow at a rate of (1+x) , the capital accumulation constraint and equation (2) require that:

same irrespective of the number of economic agents in each generation, 1 all variables grow at the rate of
(1 + 𝑥) along the balanced growth path, when expressed in per capita terms. Therefore, for small values of
𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑛 the balanced growth allocations {𝐶𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 , 𝐼𝑡 , 𝑌𝑡 } each grow at the rate of (1 + 𝑥 + 𝑛).
The “golden rule” of capital accumulation in a model with population growth then takes the form:
𝐼
𝑌

=

𝛼(𝛿+𝑥+𝑛)
𝑝+𝛿+𝑥+𝑛

Press) presents the derivation in the more general case.

Annex VII. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt declined to 41 percent of GDP in 2015 despite the small headline deficit, as the authorities
used available treasury liquidity to repay debt. Provided the fiscal targets specified in the government’s
convergence program are met, public debt is projected to stay on a downward path, reaching 36
percent of GDP over the medium-term on the back of the economic recovery and strong revenue
collection. Public debt and gross financing needs are relatively immune to a variety of isolated shocks,
including a shock to real GDP growth.

Baseline and Realism of Projections
The baseline scenario assumes a slight relaxation of the structural deficit from 0.3 percent of
GDP in 2015 to 0.6 percent in 2016, with a subsequent decline to 0.5 percent of GDP over the
medium term. The 2016 structural relaxation is mostly due to the switch in the funding of capital
expenditures from EU funds to domestic sources at the start of the new program period for EU funds.
Projections assume sustained growth underpinned by healthy domestic demand, with real GDP
growing close to potential at 2.2 percent over the medium-term. The inflation rate is projected to
gradually move toward the 2 percent target, reaching it in 2017.
The outlook for the fiscal path is benign under the baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP
ratio will decline steadily from 41.1 percent in 2015 to 36.2 percent in 2021. The ratio would also decline
in 2016 despite the expansionary fiscal stance, as nominal growth of GDP is expected to exceed the
contribution of the headline deficit and interest payments to the debt burden. Gross financing needs
are projected to stay below 7 percent of GDP throughout the projection period.

Shock and Stress Tests
A shock to real GDP growth is the main risk over the short term. Assuming that a shock to real
GDP growth occurs with a consequent impact on the primary balance, inflation, and the real interest
rate, public debt would rise to 48 percent of GDP and gross financing needs would increase to
11 percent of GDP by 2018. Thereafter, debt would decline to 47 percent of GDP and gross financing
needs would drop to 8 percent of GDP by 2021.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on February 8, 1993 upon the
dissolution of the currency union with the Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna
as its currency. From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a basket of two
currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996,
the Czech National Bank (CNB) widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent
around the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. Between 2002
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

and 2013, the CNB had not engaged in direct interventions in the foreign exchange market, and the
de facto exchange rate regime was classified as a free float. In November 2013, facing the zero lower
bound for policy rates and a persistent and large undershooting of its inflation target, the CNB
intervened in the market to weaken the currency, and announced its commitment to resist any
appreciation beyond CZK 27 per euro. Since then, the koruna traded between CZK 27.0 and
CZK 28.33 per euro. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified from
other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective November 19, 2013. The de jure exchange rate
arrangement remains floating.
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system
that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The Czech Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on
UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union Regulations that have been
notified to the Fund for approval under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision
No. 144-(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic was concluded on July 15, 2015. The staff
report and the press release were published on July 23, 2015.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in late 2000/ early 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on July 16, 2001, concurrently with the staff report for the
2001 Article IV Consultation. An FSAP update was carried out in 2011. ROSCs on: banking
supervision; data dissemination; fiscal transparency; securities market; and transparency of monetary
and financial policies were published on the Fund’s external website on July 1, 2000.

CZECH REPUBLIC

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:



Data provision is adequate for surveillance.

National Accounts:



National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the small scale
private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data collection on this
sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of unrecorded activity stems
from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates based on the production method
and the expenditure method are large and are subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly
estimates of national accounts are derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys.
The estimates are subject to bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of
bookkeeping accounts is mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping
of several expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. The Czech Republic
adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in September 2014. The
transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) required the revision of national accounts data.

Price Statistics:



The Czech Statistical Office (CSO) compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price
index (CPI) using a weighting structure based on expenditure data collected during 2012.
Weights are updated biannually. A monthly Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is
disseminated according to European regulations. The producer price index is released
monthly with coverage including manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and select
business services (business to business only). The CSO also compiles and releases monthly
import and export price indexes based on data collected directly from establishments
engaged in export and/or import activities.

Government Finance Statistics:



Annual and quarterly fiscal data are compiled on ESA2010 basis by the Czech Statistical
Office, including non-financial accounts, financial accounts, and financial balance sheets. The
Ministry of Finance uses the ESA methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The
ESA 2010 methodology includes a wider coverage of the general government sector,
different classification of some government transactions, and impacts the calculation of
GDP. Government transactions are recorded on an accrual basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

Monetary and Financial Statistics:



Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate for
policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float, especially
at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary developments. The data
published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) are based on monetary accounts
derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also forms the basis for
monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the website, which are thereby
effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics published in IFS, although the
presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.

Financial sector surveillance:



CNB is reporting Financial Soundness Indicators for Deposit Takers on a quarterly basis.

External sector statistics:



Starting in 2014, external sector statistics are compiled according to the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) and in accordance with
legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat. Balance of payments financial account
transactions are generally derived from changes in stock data adjusted by exchange rate,
price, and other changes; they are not directly based on the value of current transactions.
Quarterly external debt statistics are reported to the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
(QEDS) database.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since April 1998. The Czech Republic
meets the SDDS requirements for coverage,
periodicity, timeliness, punctuality and certification for
all data categories. The Czech Republic has completed
the requirements for adherence to the SDDS Plus
since April 2016.

and Miroslav Kollar, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director

Economic developments
The Czech Republic continued to enjoy robust and balanced economic growth in 2015, which
was fueled by a combination of factors. These included easy monetary conditions and increased
growth in government investment, reflecting the effort towards maximal absorption of resources
from the EU structural funds from the EU multi-year programming and budgetary framework
“The Financial Perspective” for the period of 2007-2013. The economy was also stimulated by a
positive supply shock due to low oil prices.
As a result, the economy accelerated considerably in 2015 and real GDP increased by
4.2 percent. Improving household incomes, growing employment with low inflation and
increasing consumer confidence led to an acceleration of household consumption growth. In
2016, the authorities expect a slowdown in real GDP growth to around 2.3 to 2.5 percent, given
the decline in gross fixed capital formation after the expiration of the factor related to the EU
funds. On the other hand, growth in economic activity will continue to be supported by easy
domestic monetary conditions, low oil prices and rising external demand. The strong economic
activity will manifest itself in continued growth in employment.
Consumer price inflation reached 0.3 percent in 2015. The Czech National Bank expects
inflation at 0.4 percent in 2016, and to reach the 2-percent target in mid-2017. Unemployment
has been declining and stood at 5.1 percent in 2015. The authorities expect an unemployment
rate of 4.4 percent in 2016 with a continued downward trend going forward. Average real
monthly wages grew by 3.1 percent in 2015, and are expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2016.
The external position of the Czech economy should remain balanced. The current account
recorded a surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, and is expected to reach a surplus of 2 percent
of GDP in 2016 owing to a very strong trade balance.
Government policies
Fiscal policy
The government is committed to ensuring that the general government deficit will remain at a
safe level below the reference value of 3 percent of GDP. The medium-term budgetary objective
of the government is a structural deficit of no more than 1 percent of GDP. In the area of fiscal
policy, the government’s main objectives include the improved collection of taxes, more

2
effective and transparent government expenditures and an enhanced absorption and drawdown of
resources from EU funds.
For 2015, the general government sector deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP and government debt of
41.1 percent of GDP were notified. In 2015, the Czech Republic over-performed in meeting its
medium-term budgetary objective when the structural balance reached a deficit of 0.3 percent of
GDP. The authorities’ forecast estimates the general government sector deficit at 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2016 with a subsequent decrease to 0.5 percent of GDP in the whole horizon of the
outlook until 2019. The structural balance should decrease to a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in
2016, and stay at a deficit of around 1 percent of GDP, i.e. at the level of the medium-term
budgetary objective, until 2019.
In 2016, the authorities expect a stabilization of the general government debt-to-GDP ratio on the
2015 level and a decrease in general government debt to around 39 percent of GDP by 2019. The
Czech Republic is still one of the least indebted countries in the EU. The debt-to-GDP ratio is at
a safe distance both from the debt reference value given by the Maastricht Convergence Criteria
and the Stability and Growth Pact, and below the limit of the proposal of the national debt rule
included in the government act on budgetary responsibility rules.
The biggest contribution to growth on the revenue side in 2015 stemmed from the accrual of
capital transfers from EU funds, which increased by more than 84 percent compared to 2014.
The development was caused by the successful effort to draw down the remaining resources
from the 2007–2013 Financial Perspective. 2015 was also characterized by a high increase in tax
revenues, including social contributions. The record-low yields on Czech government bonds also
contributed positively to the budget outturn.
Investment activity of the general government sector increased by approximately 30 percent in
2015 and reached the highest value since 1995. In particular, the increase in investment went to
EU projects and it was therefore possible to generate a substantial fiscal impulse for the economy
with relatively small costs for Czech public finances.
For 2017-2019 the authorities expect a systematic increase in investment activity with annual
growth of approximately 4.5 percent due to the expiration of the financial resources provided
under the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective at the end of 2015 and the gradual introduction of the
new Financial Perspective. Aside from the EU funds, the authorities also expect growth in
investment financed from national resources.
Measures in the social area aimed at increased expenditures of health insurance companies and
growth in social benefits. In 2015, the government carried out an extraordinary indexation of

3
pension benefits by 1.8 percent as compensation for the cuts of previous governments. Since
January 1, 2016, the indexation formula has reverted to the total sum of full consumer price
growth and one third of real wages growth. In February 2016, a one-off benefit was paid out to
each pensioner due to the low increase in pensions given by the calculation of the indexation
formula in which the low inflation is reflected. In February 2016, the government further
approved a change in the pension indexation system, partially returning the possibility of
discretion to the government, reacting to the currently very low inflation values and subsequent
low indexations. Now the government will be able to adjust indexation up to 2.7 percent, if the
indexation amount is lower according to the standard rule. Another aspect of the expenditure
policy is an increase in the wage bill in the general government sector, where the government
estimates the salary compensation of employees to increase by approximately 4 percent in 2016.
At present, measures aimed at increasing the effectiveness of tax collection are being introduced.
The electronic VAT reporting came into effect on January 1, 2016, and fiscalization of cash
payments will be implemented at the end of 2016. Both aforementioned measures should result
in an improvement of the revenue side that should enable the financing of government priorities
on the expenditure side or reduce the tax burden in the future. In 2016, revenues should decrease
due to the reduced use of funding from the EU. Nevertheless, the decrease will be mitigated by
incomes from taxes and social security contributions. Indirect tax revenues should increase in
2016, mainly due to VAT collection resulting from the newly introduced electronic VAT
reporting. Work is also under way on the new act on income taxes.
In terms of quality of public finances, the government is focusing on the rationalization and
effectiveness of expenditures in the general government sector. Meeting these objectives is
shown, for example, by the introduction of the central register of contracts or in the draft act on
the monitoring and management of public finances. In the area of tax policy, one of the main
priorities is the fight against tax evasion and increasing tax collection efficiency.
In February 2015, the government approved proposals for regulations in the area of fiscal
responsibility. These proposals are being submitted for approval by the Chamber of Deputies of
the Parliament of the Czech Republic. One of the proposals, the so called “Act on Rules of Fiscal
Responsibility” will introduce among others: (i) an independent expert Committee for Fiscal
Forecasts; (ii) an independent National Budgetary Council; (iii) an expenditure fiscal rule for the
general government; (iv) and debt rules for local governments and the general government. As
an interim measure (before the new Act is implemented), the Ministry of Finance has its
macroeconomic forecasts assessed by independent experts. These assessments are transparently
published and attached to key fiscal and budgetary documents.

Structural policies
The government is committed to enforcing an economic program based on support for business,
an effective labor market, a functioning and transparent state administration, a long-term
sustainable pension scheme, investment in education, science and research. The priority is to
identify and implement growth-supporting measures across different spheres of the economy.
In line with the 2016 National Reform Program, the government will continue its focus on proper
implementation of recently adopted measures aimed at combatting tax evasion and stabilizing
public administration. Ongoing activities are also aimed at further improving the labor market
(including by improving labor mobility and protecting the vulnerable groups), improving the
infrastructure, introducing a new construction law and increasing the quality of primary and
higher education. The government will also continue its efforts to strengthening the cooperation
between research institutions and the business sector, implementing measures to establish a
favorable investment environment, and digitizing the economy.
The measures and reforms to support the government’s structural policy goals that have already
been taken or are being prepared also include a decrease in the tax burden on the labor of
pensioners and families with children, or relaxing the conditions for providing material support
for creating new jobs in the investment incentive system. The Act on Public Procurement which
was approved by the Parliament on April 19, 2016, will increase transparency and reduce the
administrative requirements of the procurement process. A draft long-term budget (until 2021)
for national expenditure on research, development and innovation is currently prepared.
After seeking to address the long-term sustainability of the pay-as-you-go public pension system
by adjusting the parameters of the pension insurance system in 2011, measures have been taken
in the area of pension security and the public health insurance system, primarily aimed at shortor medium-term consolidation of public finances. Also, since 2010, the penalty for early
retirement has been increased, thus reducing the attractiveness of retiring before reaching the
statutory retirement age. The Pillar II of the pension system was cancelled as of January 1, 2016
and the winding up process will last until the end of 2016. The pension insurance system is
regarded as sustainable with respect to stabilization at the end of the forecast horizon 2060. The
government also continues with its efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of the health care
system and its management, including reforms of the public health insurance system.
Monetary policy
The Czech National Bank’s (CNB) monetary policy rate has been at “technical zero” (0.05
percent) since November 2012. Since November 2013, the CNB has been using the exchange

5
rate as an additional instrument within its inflation-targeting framework for easing the monetary
conditions. At its last monetary-policy meeting on May 5, the CNB Bank Board decided
unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to
continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions
and confirmed the CNB’s commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to
weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate is kept close to 27 koruna to the euro. The
asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment, i.e. only to intervene against appreciation
of the Czech koruna below the announced level, remains unchanged.
The latest CNB staff forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current level
and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Consistent
with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates thereafter. According to the forecast,
sustainable fulfilment of the inflation target, which is a condition for a return to conventional
monetary policy, will occur from mid-2017. The Bank Board therefore stated that the CNB will
not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017 and
considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued in mid-2017.
The return to conventional monetary policy will not result in the exchange rate appreciating
sharply to the slightly overvalued level recorded before the CNB started intervening, among
other things because the weaker exchange rate of the koruna is in the meantime passing through
to the price level and other nominal variables. At the same time, the Bank Board stated that
exchange rate appreciation following the discontinuation of the exchange rate commitment
would be dampened by hedging of exchange rate risks by exporters during the existence of the
commitment, by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors and by possible CNB
interventions to mitigate exchange rate volatility.
The Bank Board assessed the risks to the forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being
slightly anti-inflationary. In this context, the Bank Board pointed out that the CNB stands ready
to shift the exchange rate commitment to a weaker level if there were to be a systematic decrease
in inflation expectations manifesting itself in nominal variables, especially wages.
In connection with the need to maintain easy monetary conditions, the Bank Board also
discussed the possibility of introducing negative interest rates, as stated in the published minutes
of the Bank Board meeting on May 5. The prevailing view was that negative rates were not an
appropriate tool for additionally easing monetary conditions and hence for influencing inflation
directly, although negative interest rates could serve effectively as a tool for defending the
exchange rate commitment. However, negative interest rates could be an appropriate
complementary tool if the level of the exchange rate commitment were to be moved.

Financial stability and macroprudential policy
The performance of the banking sector in 2015 was positively affected by the strong economic
recovery. This was reflected in an increase in profitability and sustained high capitalization and
favorable liquidity. Deposits continued to increase despite a continuing decline in deposit interest
rates. The domestic banking sector has long been independent of foreign sources of funding.
Credit risk has decreased. The structure of non-performing loans has also improved. The
provisions created by banks at the aggregate level seem to be sufficient to cover the current
expected loss given default. Insurance companies are well capitalized and most of them are
maintaining stable profitability even in the current period of low interest rates. The pension
management companies sector remains stable.
The Czech economy continues to be in a growth phase of the financial cycle. In December 2015,
the CNB reacted to rapid credit growth, increasing household debt relative to income and growth
in residential property prices by setting the countercyclical buffer rate at 0.5 percent of exposures
located in the Czech Republic with effect from January 2017. As there has been no significant
change in cyclical risks indicating growth in systemic risk this year, the Bank Board decided at
its meeting on financial stability issues in May 2016 to leave the buffer rate at the current level
for the time being. However, if credit growth remains high, credit standards ease further and
investor optimism continues to grow, the CNB will stand ready to increase this buffer rate
further.
The new Financial Stability Report issued on June 14, 2016, pays increased attention to the
property market and the provision of house purchase loans. The CNB does not assess the trends
in the area of house purchase loans as an acute market overheating giving rise to direct risks to
financial stability. However, it considers credit standards to be highly relaxed and has identified
the taking on of higher risks by some institutions.
The combination of exceptionally low interest rates and easy access to house purchase loans is
creating conditions for growth in residential property prices above levels consistent with
fundamentals. Consequently, on June 14, 2016 the CNB announced that it is tightening its
current Recommendation introduced in June 2015 on the management of risks associated with
the provision of retail loans secured by residential property as of October 2016, mainly by
lowering the maximum LTV levels. In particular, the current upper LTV limit of 100 percent
will be reduced to 95 percent as of October 2016 and to 90 percent as of April 2017. The current
recommended limit of 10 percent of new loans with an LTV of 90 percent to 100 percent will
change to a limit of 10 percent of new loans with an LTV of 85 percent to 95 percent as of
October 2016. The limit will be set at 15 percent of new loans with an LTV of 80 percent to
90 percent as of April 2017. The CNB has also issued a new recommendation that institutions

7
should use all available information to determine whether a loan is being used to finance owneroccupied housing or as an investment. If they find that an application for an investment loan
shows a combination of characteristics with a higher risk level, they should apply an LTV of 60
percent at most. If the domestic property market were to show increasing signs of overheating in
the years ahead, the CNB would tighten the conditions further or, where appropriate, use other
instruments defined by law.
In accordance with ESRB recommendations, the CNB will also seek enactment of the power to
set risk parameters for loans for house purchase. They include the option to set binding LTV,
LTI and DSTI limits as well as other risk parameters for loans for house purchase. Such powers
would enable the CNB to respond effectively to emerging risks to financial institutions and
consumers which might arise from excessive softening of credit standards. The alternative would
be strong measures in the area of institutions’ capital, which could be costlier from the
perspective of the national economy.
The latest stress test results demonstrate that the banking sector remains highly resilient to
adverse scenarios. The Adverse Scenario, whose probability is very low, assumes a strong
recession and a fall of the economy into deflation. The banking sector has a large capital buffer
which enables it to withstand highly adverse shocks and maintain its overall capital adequacy
sufficiently above the regulatory threshold of 8 percent even in the Adverse Scenario. The
banking sector is also highly resilient to short-term liquidity risk.
The CNB also conducted a stress test of public finance. Its results indicate that the current fiscal
situation does not represent a threat to the stability of the banking sector, which holds a large part
of the Czech government debt. Consequently, the CNB will not apply additional capital
requirements to credit institutions at the three-year horizon.
Pursuant to the Recovery and Resolution Act, the CNB is the resolution authority in the Czech
Republic. As of January 2016, this law vested the CNB, among other things, with exclusive
power to create plans for resolution of banks, credit unions and some investment firms.
The Czech authorities thank the Article IV team for a constructive exchange of views during its
mission.
