STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 21, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Background. The economy has experienced seven consecutive years of robust growth,
buoyed by high commodity prices, foreign direct investment and expansion of private
sector credit. As part of a strategy to sustain growth, reduce poverty and curtail
dependence on imported oil, the authorities are pursuing the Amaila Falls Hydro-electric
Project (AFHP), entailing investment of about 30 percent of GDP. However, steps by
Parliament that delayed important approvals led the private sector partner to withdraw,
which could delay the project while additional financing is sought. Meanwhile, public
debt remains high—around 60 percent of GDP—limiting the room to finance inclusive
growth.
Focus of consultation. Discussions focused on three key, interrelated objectives: (i) fiscal
sustainability by developing a fiscal consolidation strategy that leaves room for key
investment, in the context of a strengthened medium-term policy framework; (ii) financial
and price stability entailing close monitoring of financial sector risks; and (iii) sustainable
and inclusive growth with poverty reduction. Staff advised the authorities to continue
fiscal consolidation, especially by improving the financial performance of public
enterprises, with a view to reduce the risk of pro-cyclical policy, bolster fiscal and external
reserve buffers, and preserve Guyana’s moderate risk of debt distress. Staff urged the
authorities to ensure that the AFHP is financially and economically viable and
recommended strengthening the project and debt management framework. On the
financial sector, staff advised vigilance against the backdrop of several years of rapid
credit growth and urged the authorities and Parliament to press ahead with addressing
the AML/CFT deficiencies identified by the CFATF. Staff advised maintaining appropriate
nominal exchange rate flexibility and implementing a policy mix of continued fiscal
consolidation and moderate monetary tightening coupled with structural reforms, to
safeguard financial stability, bolster international reserves and contain inflationary
pressures. On growth and poverty reduction, staff recommended modernizing traditional
sectors and further diversifying the economy to spread the benefits of growth across the
wider population, particularly those living in underprivileged areas in extreme poverty.

BACKGROUND
1.
Guyana has experienced seven consecutive years of solid growth buoyed by
agriculture and extractive industries. Still, its per capita GDP is the lowest in the English-speaking
Caribbean and the debt burden, though low by Caribbean standards, remains elevated (Figure 1).
The economy largely depends on the export of six commodities––sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp,
timber, and rice––which represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to
adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices. As a result of the inward-looking,
state-led development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s, Guyana became heavily indebted,
recording a total public debt of 186 percent of GDP at HIPC completion point at end-2003. In March
2007, the IDB, Guyana's principal donor, canceled its debt of nearly US$470 million (21 percent of
GDP), which along with other debt forgiveness brought the debt-to-GDP ratio down to 65 percent
by 2009.1 Nevertheless, the government is still servicing a sizable external debt burden, against the
urgent need for expanded public investment to boost economic capacity and reduce poverty.
2.
Since the completion of the PRGF in 2006, the authorities’ policies have continued to
be broadly in line with Fund advice. A number of first generation technical assistance projects
undertaken with the Fund, including VAT implementation, public financial management and
statistics have been useful to the authorities. These reforms have contributed to the authorities’
fiscal consolidation efforts that have helped to stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio. In recent years
the Fund has recommended further fiscal consolidation to help reduce the debt and rebuild policy
buffers (Box 1). The authorities view the pace of their fiscal consolidation as consistent with their
objective of reducing the country’s significant infrastructure deficit and addressing unmet social
needs.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Macroeconomic developments in
2012 were driven by high commodity
prices, foreign direct investment, and
domestic credit expansion to the private
sector.

Real sector and prices. Real GDP is
projected to grow by around 4.8 percent
this year, the same as the outturn in 2012
(Table 1 and Figure 2). This would reflect
strength in agriculture, mining and
quarrying, manufacturing, engineering
and construction, and services. Inflation is

projected to fall with slowing activity in
major host countries (Table 2 and Figure 3). The financial account surplus is projected to
increase with larger disbursements related to an ambitious public investment program and
resilient FDI despite current political uncertainties and delays in the Amaila Falls Hydroelectric
Project (AFHP). These developments will result in an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP, but
gross international reserves are projected to remain adequate at 3.6 months of imports
compared to 4.2 months in 2012.



Fiscal Sector. In FY2012 the authorities
achieved an overall fiscal deficit of
4.5 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the
2011 deficit (Tables 3a, 3b and 3c and
Figure 4). While growing strongly in
nominal terms (7 percent), central
government revenues net of grants
declined by 0.8 percent of GDP, reflecting
lower intake of income and consumption
taxes.2 Non-interest current expenditures
rose by 1 percent of GDP on a rise in
transfer payments to electricity and sugar
companies, partly offset by a decline in
spending on other goods and services.
Capital expenditures rose by 0.2 percent of
GDP due to the advancement of several key

Lower consumption tax revenues are related to VAT refunds, while income tax shortfalls reflect the lowering of
corporate income tax rates and an increase in the non-taxable threshold for personal income tax. The lowering of the
corporate tax-rate is an effort to improve competitiveness and the increase in the personal income threshold is
aimed at poverty reduction.

of GDP compared to a deficit of 0.6 percent a year ago.

Financial Sector. The overall banking system appears well-capitalized, profitable and liquid
(Figure 5). All banks report capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum requirement. NPLs
have remained between 5 and 6 percent over the last three years and provisioning for bad loans
stands at comfortable levels.

Monetary policy. Monetary policy has been accommodative, but monetary conditions appear
to have tightened somewhat in the first 5 months of 2013 (Table 4 and Figure 6). After
accelerating to about 13 percent in 2012, twelve-month broad money growth has moderated to
about 9 percent as of May 2013. Private credit growth remained high at 15.3 percent on an
annual basis in May, following three years of credit growth close to 20 percent. Liquidity in the
banking system remained at high levels with the ratio of liquid to total assets at 32.4 percent as
of June. As a result, the benchmark 91-day T-bill rate, already negative in real terms for some
years, continued to decline to 1.2 percent as of July. Lower interest rates, however, were not fully
passed on by banks to lending rates, resulting in widening net interest margins.



Exchange rate policy. While the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, it has appreciated sharply and the external current account deficit has widened.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated about 20 percent since 2008. This real appreciation
occurred despite depreciation relative to the US dollar and reflects developments in the value of
the US dollar (which the Guyanese dollar follows closely) against the euro and other major
currencies, as well as higher inflation in Guyana relative to major trading partners. Noteworthy,
the pace of depreciation relative to the US dollar has moderated sharply more recently,
notwithstanding the deficit in the balance of payments and loss of international reserves. At the
same time, adequate international reserves (Box 2) have provided a cushion to intervene in the
foreign exchange market to smooth out exchange rate and price volatility. To avoid excessive
volatility in the exchange rate, the Bank of Guyana intervened in the foreign exchange market in
2012.



Social Sector. GDP per capita has been increasing, and Gini coefficients for Guyana showed
improvement between 1992 and 2006.3 Steady progress has been made in meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
The macroeconomic outlook is generally positive for 2013 and the medium term.
Policy making has become more complicated since the November 2011 elections. The political party
of the President, who is the head of the government, does not control a majority in the Parliament,
requiring lengthier debate to secure legislative approval. Over the medium term, infrastructure
projects led by construction of the AFHP, along with private mining investments should sustain
average growth levels at around 4.4 percent over the next five years, despite the political
uncertainty.4 However, the lack of a Parliamentary majority could add to delays, especially on crucial
policy matters that require legislative approval.5 Nevertheless, relatively high growth along with low
concessional interest rates on external borrowing will help to place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a
firmly declining path, and the large external current account deficit would be mostly financed by
mining-related FDI inflows (Tables 5, 6 and 7).
5.
Against the backdrop of continued global uncertainty, risks are tilted to the downside.
On the upside, Guyana is poised to benefit from sales of climate services, capitalizing on the
country’s vast rainforests. Activity will also be supported by ongoing projects under the Low Carbon
Development Strategy (LCDS), including hydropower to lower energy costs, as well as large private
sector projects underway in oil and mining. However, deteriorating terms of trade, particularly for
gold, and a slowing global economy could adversely impact external stability via shrinking export
volumes and less robust inflows of remittances, increasing the risk of a widening current account
deficit. Financing constraints could exacerbate downside risks if investment projects, portfolio
inflows and official transfers do not materialize as expected. A sharp increase in oil prices could
widen further the external current account deficit as well as result in fiscal slippages, particularly
from the state-owned electricity company (GPL). Rapid credit growth in recent years and rising
house prices warrant continued vigilance to mitigate a potential build-up of financial stability risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
The government continues to balance the need for fiscal prudence to maintain debt
sustainability against the urgent need for expanded public investment to remove critical

from 0.44 to 0.35.

The political uncertainty has led domestic investors to be more cautious in their investment plans, reducing growth
projections.
5

While the Parliament approved the 2013 budget that cut AFHP-related and other spending by about 4 percent of
GDP, given the previous court ruling in 2012 these expenditure cuts are expected to be overturned in the revised
2013 budget.

infrastructure bottlenecks and reduce poverty. The non-financial public sector (NFPS) fiscal
deficit remains relatively large, despite seven consecutive years of solid growth. Since the granting
of debt relief under the HIPC initiative in 2007, public debt remained at around 65 percent of GDP.
The authorities are advancing policies to transform the economy in the context of the LCDS by
implementing large investments under this scheme, including the AFHP, with an aim to reduce
exposure of the fiscal and external position to sharp increases in oil prices. However, the AFHP, in
view of its magnitude and implementation as a PPP, poses potential fiscal risks in the presence of
sovereign guarantees. Against this backdrop, the discussions with the authorities focused on the
authorities’ ongoing efforts at pursuing fiscal consolidation to ensure debt sustainability, mitigating
risks to price and financial stability, and enhancing medium-term sustainable growth, while
advancing gains made in reducing poverty and improving labor market outcomes. The mix of
policies recommended are aimed at building fiscal and external reserves buffers to help cushion the
economy should the shocks to the baseline scenario discussed in the Risk Assessment Matrix
materialize (Table 8).

A. Policy Framework to Contain Fiscal Risks and Protect Debt
Sustainability
Guyana weathered the global financial crisis relatively well and macroeconomic policy buffers
have been broadly maintained. A strong medium-term policy framework is warranted to
safeguard debt sustainability and enhance fiscal and external buffers.

Fiscal Policy
7.
The Parliament imposed expenditure cuts on the 2013 budget. Citing insufficient
information to assess the viability of AFHP, the Parliament approved a budget that cut AFHP-related
and other spending by about 4 percent of GDP. The Parliament also delayed approval of the
increase in the ceiling on government guarantees and amendments to the hydro-electric power bill
which would have facilitated financing agreements. This led Sithe Global, the private sector partner,
to withdraw from the AFHP, which could delay conclusion of the financing arrangement and
eventual start of the project. Given the previous court ruling on the constitutionality of budget cuts
initiated by the Parliament, which overturned expenditure cuts in 2012, fiscal outlays for 2013 are
expected to be in line with this ruling.
8.
Staff estimates that the revised 2013 budget would yield a NFPS deficit of
5.2 percent of GDP, implying a primary deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP. The revised budget
incorporates an increase in central government non-grant revenue of 0.9 percent of GDP
vis-à-vis the 2012 outturn (largely on account of higher VAT and excise tax receipts) and a notable
cut in transfers (0.7 percent of GDP). Central government capital expenditure is projected to rise by
0.4 percent of GDP while the public wage bill as a percent of GDP will remain broadly stable. The
deterioration in the overall fiscal balance is largely related to worsening performance of public
enterprises which are projected to return a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP compared to a surplus of

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

1.3 percent a year ago.6 With the government gradually reducing expenditures on wages, goods and
services, and transfers as a share of GDP, the NFPS fiscal deficit is expected to improve to
3.5 percent of GDP by 2018 (Table 9)7.
9.
The mission cautioned that further delays of the AFHP would increase the costs and
risks associated with the project and postpone development opportunities arising from it.
Should the financing agreements not be completed as planned, Guyana could lose access to GRIF8
funds currently envisaged to finance US$80 million of government’s share of the equity. Negotiating
new funding arrangements from existing or alternative project financers might also result in less
favorable lending terms. Contingent upon financial viability of the AFHP, to avoid further delays and
advance the implementation of the project, staff recommended that the authorities continue to
engage actively with the Parliament and all stakeholders. Staff assumes that the fiscal effects of the
AFHP project would be shifted two years into the future to 2015–18, while the authorities aim to
continue efforts to finalize the project as soon as possible.
10.
The mission also considered that given reduced fiscal space, medium-term risks, and
robust external growth, a more ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy is warranted. Staff is of
the view that a gradual but slightly more front-loaded effort to lower the overall fiscal deficit to
about 2.0–3.0 percent of GDP over the medium term, which is consistent with a primary deficit of
about 1.0–2.0 percent of GDP, would help bolster fiscal and external reserve buffers. Achieving this
primary deficit target would place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firmly declining path reaching
55 percent by 2018, and help preserve Guyana’s moderate risk of debt distress. Over the medium
term, emphasis should be placed on increasing economic resilience within the context of a
strengthened medium-term policy framework anchored on the public debt ratio, providing a
cushion against external shocks as well as for conducting countercyclical policy. This would help to
lower dependence on unpredictable grants, reduce the risk of pro-cyclical policy9 and provide a
cushion against any cost overruns in major infrastructure projects. Agreement on a medium-term
fiscal framework, underpinned by strong policies aimed at safeguarding debt sustainability would
boost credibility and reduce the political uncertainty of the current budgetary process. Maintaining
current tax revenues (around 21 percent of GDP), while reducing transfers and containing
expenditures on central government wages and other goods and services over the medium term
would help provide fiscal space of about 1.2 percent of GDP annually on average in 2014–2018. This
would help sustain capital expenditure at 10.7 percent of GDP on average over the same period to
address Guyana’s significant infrastructure needs and bolster social safety nets.
11.
Advancing far reaching reforms at the SOEs is key to stemming the drag on public
finances. Pursuing policies aimed at ensuring financial viability of the public enterprises, including

This would be achieved by restraining real outlays to grow at a slower rate than real GDP.

While the economy has grown robustly over the last four years, the fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP has also
widened, implying a pro-cyclical fiscal stance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

further strengthening of GPL’s operational and administrative capacity and distribution network is
warranted. Staff recommends reforming electricity tariffs to streamline subsidies and transfers to
public enterprises and replacing them with a more targeted social safety net to address more
directly the needs of the most vulnerable, and helping to reduce social imbalances.
12.
A 2012 actuarial review has recommended a set of urgent parametric reforms to
restore the financial viability of the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). In 2011, the scheme
experienced its first deficit and the fund is expected to be exhausted in less than 10 years if specific
measures are not taken immediately (within 1–2 years) and sustained over the medium term. Among
the most urgent measures the report identified, were increasing the contribution rate and pension
age, raising the insurable earnings ceiling, freezing pension increases, revising pension accrual rates,
and updating the prudential investment framework. Staff welcomes the increase in NIS contribution
rates and looks forward to the planned reforms based on the recommendations of the actuarial
review to avoid the impact of these contingent liabilities on the central government budget and
help put it on a sustainable footing.
Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities expressed confidence that policy efforts over the last decade have
restored a degree of fiscal solvency and bolstered the economy’s resilience to shocks. Over the
medium term, the government proposes to continue its fiscal consolidation efforts by gradually
reducing the NFPS deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2018 which would bring the public debt to about
60 percent of GDP over the same period. The envisioned measures are reducing expenditures on
wages, goods and services, and transfers as a share of GDP. The authorities are determined to
preserve fiscal sustainability but are of a view that a faster fiscal consolidation could jeopardize
achievements made thus far. They consider that the current macro framework strikes the right
balance between fiscal consolidation and addressing Guyana’s developmental agenda.
14.
The authorities intend to keep the current energy pricing policy unchanged, and move
to cost recovery once AFHP is in operation. When the project comes on stream, the average cost
of electricity generation––currently about 19 U.S. cents/kWh––would be reduced to 11 U.S. cents in
the first year of operation and 9 U.S. cents over the 20 year PPA term. Once the company is
transferred to GPL after 20 years, generation cost is expected to drop to less than 2 U.S. cents/kWh,
largely on account of repayment of loans to the IDB and CDB. On completion of the project, fiscal
costs would also be reduced by elimination of subsidies to GPL (US$30 million in 2012), which
currently accounts for about 25 percent of end user tariffs. At the same time, the authorities believe
that the current fuel pricing regime that allows limited pass-through of international prices has
helped keep inflation low while minimizing the impact on the government’s fiscal position10.
10

By adjusting ad valorem excise tax rates in inverse correlation with imported oil prices, the authorities have
contained pass-through of international prices into domestic inflation. Taxes per liter for both diesel and gasoline
have fallen since 2007, with the decline most marked in 2011, particularly for diesel. Excise taxes have varied between
7–60 percent for gasoline and 0–40 percent for diesel. There is no VAT imposed on petroleum products, and
kerosene is not taxed.

15.
On the NIS, some measures have been adopted in response to the deficit. Based on the
recommendations of the 2012 actuarial review, NIS contribution rates have been increased in 2013
and public consultations are ongoing in advance of the implementation of the other measures. The
authorities have also raised their vigilance on the review of benefit expenditures and implemented
measures to reduce fraud. The NIS has also established a debt unit, and has been working with the
Guyana Revenue Authority on sharing information to recover unpaid contributions.

Fiscal Risk and Debt Management
16.
Fiscal risks could result in an increase in public debt. These risks stem from the
economy’s dependence on commodity prices. Regarding exports, volatility in the price of gold and
other key export commodities would dampen growth and tax revenues. On the import side, the
current dependence on oil imports exposes the fiscal position to sharp increases in oil prices which
would depress demand, reduce tax revenues and increase transfers to GPL. In the absence of
alternative energy sources, GPL’s dependence on thermal power generation will continue and its
finances will remain exposed to oil price fluctuations, creating vulnerability for the fiscal accounts.
Implementation of the AFHP reduces these risks; however, a project of this magnitude and
complexity poses its own risks. Going forward, Sithe Global could reengage and the AFHP would
experience a short delay but is fully implemented (staff baseline scenario). This would result in lower
growth, tax receipts, and capital spending in the period of delay. Over the construction phase of the
project, real GDP growth could be higher by projected 1.0–1.5 percent of GDP per year, as well as
higher over the medium term, increasing tax receipts. At the same time, government spending on
subsidies to support GPL’s operations could be reduced over the medium term. Under a worst case
scenario, where the project does not go ahead, the government’s direct liability would be limited to
its contribution to the project in the form of equity amounting to US$100 million (3.5 percent of
2012 GDP). In this case, the government would also continue spending on subsidies (0.1 percent of
GDP) to support GPL’s operations through 2018. The project would also affect Guyana’s external
position–over the construction period driven by large AFHP investment-related imports, the external
current account deficit is projected to be higher on average by about 4.5 percent of GDP, which
would result in lower reserve coverage by about 0.2 months of imports on average over the same
period.
17.
In order to limit public sector borrowing and encourage large scale private investment
in infrastructure, the government is implementing the AFHP as a Private Public Partnership
(PPP). The cost of the project is estimated at US$858 million (about 30 percent of 2012 GDP). The
government’s preferred financing plan now appears to be uncertain with the apparent withdrawal of
Sithe Global which was expected to contribute US$157 million. The remaining financing was
expected from China Development Bank (CDB) and the IDB in the form of loans of US$500.8 million
and US$100 million, respectively, and the government’s investment in equity (US$100 million). It
remains unclear whether Sithe Global will re-engage; if not, the government would face a challenge
in sourcing alternative financing11. Under the draft contract, Guyana Power and Light (GPL) would

purchase the entirety of AFHP’s energy output under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA)
guaranteed by the government. Accordingly, the contingent fiscal liabilities of the guarantees for the
PPA could amount to US$122 million12 (3 percent of projected 2018 GDP) annually during the first
12 years after the construction period (end-2018). At the same time, GPL could save in excess of this
amount on fuel and other power generation costs.
18.
Staff acknowledged the benefits of cheaper and more reliable electricity to help
unlock the full potential of the economy and to realize savings on oil imports. Staff also
commended the authorities for their continued engagement with multilateral partners and
recommended that efforts continue to ensure a viable and successful AFHP. It would be necessary to
strengthen the finances and operations of GPL to enable the company to adequately handle its
responsibilities under the project. It would also be essential to strengthen the project and debt
management framework in view of the risks that PPPs can pose, particularly in the presence of
sovereign guarantees. In this regard, the adoption of international best practices in the management
of PPPs to manage potential risks of contingent fiscal liabilities is warranted, utilizing technical
assistance to design the legal, accounting and fiscal risk management frameworks.
19.
Guyana’s indicators of the risk of debt distress remain comfortably under the relevant
thresholds.13 The results of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggest that the NPV of external
debt to GDP stabilizes at 26 percent of GDP over the medium term while debt service would decline
to less than 5 percent of revenue. However stress tests underscore the vulnerability of the public
debt to standard shocks, including the primary balance and growth as well as contingent liabilities
from the AFHP. Staff and the authorities agreed that the goods-for-debt exchange has had a
beneficial impact on the debt while stimulating agricultural production, although the terms of the
program could change in the future.
Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities are confident that ongoing reforms and investment in the electricity
sector will ensure that the AFHP project remains economically and financially viable. Staff had
comprehensive discussions with the authorities on the AFHP, and the authorities readily shared the
relevant documents associated with the project. The authorities have retained a number of legal,
financial, and electricity sector advisors to ensure the risks associated with the project remain
manageable. While acknowledging that there is room to improve monitoring of public sector
investment projects, they argue that projects go through an extensive consultation and rigorous
vetting process to insure that the outcomes are optimal. Moreover, should Sithe Global re-engage,
the fact that the government’s private partner in the project has extensive experience in hydro
sector projects will further mitigate some of the risks.

Reforms have started at the GPL to improve its efficiency and readiness for the AFHP.
The government has committed to invest US$90 million in GPL for capital expenses and US$15.3
million to cover company’s operating costs over 2013–2017. Reforms also include enhancing the
legal and regulatory structure of the GPL to enable it to reduce its technical and commercial losses
in the distribution of electricity. On this front, a new billing system is being implemented and new
tamper proof meters are supposed to record more accurately the use of electricity. Work has also
started on the network (transmission and distribution) system.

B. A Framework to Anchor Prices and Protect Financial Stability
After several years of accommodative monetary conditions, the authorities should guide
sustainable credit growth to safeguard financial system soundness and monitor closely financial
stability risks.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
The Bank of Guyana conducts monetary policy by targeting monetary aggregates
consistent with output and inflation objectives. The central bank’s principal tool to achieve the
targeted amount of broad money in the system are treasury bill auctions. The Open Market
Operation Committee (OMOC) determines interventions through treasury bills on a weekly basis. In
addition, the central bank deploys other instruments such as reserve requirements, the rediscount
rate and moral suasion to fulfill its statutory objectives of promoting domestic price stability and
growth.

However, these remain within strict prudential exposure limits imposed by the Bank of Guyana.

24.
Staff stressed that greater exchange rate flexibility is needed, in view of the shocks to
the terms of trade from volatile commodity prices. Given wage and price rigidities, a somewhat
greater degree of nominal exchange rate flexibility would help reduce the relatively appreciated real
effective exchange rate. At the same time, the high pass-through of exchange rate changes to
domestic prices along with the volatility of international commodity prices justifies smoothing out
exchange rate and price volatility in the face of external shocks. Smoothing of the exchange rate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

GUYANA

should be limited reducing the effects of temporary volatility in commodity prices while allowing the
exchange rate to absorb permanent shocks. In view of the projected widening current account
deficits and uncertainty about external financing sources, the authorities need to continue to
implement a policy mix that safeguards international reserves and contains inflationary pressures
(see Box 2 for a reserve adequacy assessment). This would also help to cushion the economy against
shocks to the baseline scenario discussed in the Risk Assessment Matrix. Along with appropriate
nominal exchange rate flexibility, the combination of fiscal consolidation, moderate monetary
tightening, and structural reforms, including enhancing the supply of skilled labor and continued
improvements in the business climate, would help to curb inflationary pressures, boost
competitiveness, contain the external current account deficit, and reduce appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities acknowledged the importance of macroeconomic stability to attract
investment and support sustainable growth. In particular, they consider exchange rate stablility
as an important anchor for investment decisions and competitiveness and emphasized that the
currect arrangement has served them well. The authorities noted that the exchange rate is market
determined, but underlined the significance of foreign exchange market intervention to alleviate
shortages of foreign currency and avoid excessive volatility in the exchange rate as was the case in
the second half of 2012. Going forward, the central bank expects the nominal exchange rate to
depreciate on account of the inflation differential between Guyana and its trading partners, thus
enabling it to maintain export competitiveness. However, the authorities pointed out that the high
cost of electricity is a major impediment to improve external competitiveness.
26.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff that there is scope to tighten monetary
policy without constraining growth. Nevertheless, they emphasized the potential tension between
promoting financial deepening and safeguarding financial stability. They stressed that the Bank of
Guyana’s strict financial oversight and regulation has safeguarded financial stability despite rapid
credit growth in recent years.

Financial Sector
27.
The financial sector is dominated by commercial banks. Three foreign banks and three
local banks account for about 65 percent of financial sector assets. Among non-bank financial
institutions, the New Building Society (NBS), a deposit taking institution that focuses primarily on
mortgage loans, is the largest entity accounting for about 8 percent of financial sector assets and
almost a third of non-bank financial institutions’ assets. Other non-bank financial institutions include
two trust companies, six finance companies including two micro-credit lenders, two asset
management companies, a moderately sized insurance sector, and a large number of small credit
unions. The central bank supervises commercial banks and the majority of non-bank financial

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

institutions. Credit unions are supervised by the Ministry of Labor and data to assess risks in this
sector are not currently available.14
28.
Financial sector risks appear contained, but warrant vigilance particularly against the
backdrop of several years of rapid credit growth. The overall banking system appears wellcapitalized, profitable and liquid. All banks report capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum
requirement. NPLs have remained between 5 and 6 percent over the last three years and
provisioning for bad loans stands at comfortable levels. A temporary increase in NPLs at end-2012
to 8.35 from 5.40 a year earlier was related to delays in loan classification at one bank, according to
the authorities. The Bank of Guyana is currently conducting an investigation of the matter. Loan
concentration, a source of potential concern raised in the 2006 FSAP, remains high due to the
limited number of large borrowers. The risk stemming from maturity mismatches on banks’ balance
sheets due to funding with short-term deposits is mitigated by high levels of liquidity, but warrants
close monitoring, in staff’s view.
29.
Foreign exchange and interest rate risks appear limited. Plausible negative exchange rate
shocks actually improve the financial position of the overall banking system since banks in
aggregate carry net long positions in foreign exchange (46 percent of capital and reserves as of June
2013). Interest rate risks are mitigated by banks’ ability to adjust interest rates on existing loans.
30.
Staff welcomed the progress made in enhancing the supervisory framework and data
provision. Since the 2006 FSAP the authorities have brought insurance companies and the NBS
under the central bank’s supervision. In addition to issue-specific ad-hoc inspections of banks,
comprehensive on-site inspections are conducted every two years. The Bank of Guyana conducts
credit, liquidity and foreign exchange exposure stress tests on a quarterly basis. The authorities
make financial soundness data available on the Bank of Guyana’s website, including indicators for
individual institutions. While substantial progress has been made, in staff’s view more frequent
comprehensive on-site inspections are advisable for larger institutions. Improved coordination of
the supervision of insurers and banks that are part of the same business group would enhance
supervision. In addition, staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to bring credit unions under the
supervisory authority of the Bank of Guyana.
31.
Enhancing financial development while safeguarding financial stability remains a
challenge. Banks maintain high levels of liquidity and the ratio of loans to deposits remains below
the level in comparable countries despite rapid credit growth in recent years. Savers face very low
nominal interest rates on deposits, and other savings products, such as mutual funds, are not
available. To address impediments to financial intermediation, staff recommended speeding up the
judicial process of collateral recovery and title registration at the land registry which can take up to
8 months, according to the financial sector. Staff welcomed the establishment of a credit bureau
which could help improve financial intermediation and lower costs.

In 2004, the last available data point, aggregate credit union assets were 0.8 percent of GDP.

32.
The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in its 2011 assessment report has
identified significant strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in Guyana.15 To tackle the legislative
deficiencies identified, government has introduced an amendment bill in the Parliament. However,
passage of the bill has been delayed at the request of the opposition for further deliberations. In
case of insufficient progress by November 2013, the CFATF will call upon its members to consider
implementing counter measures to protect their financial systems from the ongoing money
laundering and terrorist financing risks emanating from Guyana, and will consider referring Guyana
to the Financial Action Task Force International Cooperation Review Group (FATF ICRG).
33.
Staff urged the authorities and Parliament to press ahead with addressing the
AML/CFT deficiencies identified by the CFATF by November 2013. Non-compliance with the
CFATF recommendations by that date could severely curtail the ability of banks and other
companies (including gold exporters) to conduct business internationally. Some banks already
reported losing correspondent accounts at major foreign institutions and a slowdown in foreign
transactions as a result of the delay in enacting the AML/CFT amendment bill.
Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff and emphasized the progress
made since the 2006 FSAP. They stressed the supervisor’s strong track record of maintaining
financial stability. They concurred with staff on the need for financial development and deepening,
while closely monitoring and regulating financial stability risks. Since the 2006 FSAP, the authorities
have brought insurance companies and the NBS under the central bank’s supervision, expanded
staff in the supervision department, introduced a risk-based supervisory framework, and conducted
stress tests of commercial banks on a quarterly basis. A credit bureau, one of the key
recommendations of the FSAP, is expected to be fully operational early next year.
35.
On AML/CFT, the authorities shared staff’s concern about the negative ramifications
should Guyana not meet the CFATF’s deadline to address deficiencies by November 2013.
They stressed that the necessary reforms are in place and the only outstanding issue is the passage
of the amendment bill in Parliament.

C. Agenda for Supporting Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction
Two important policy priorities of the authorities are to: (a) sustain high growth rates with less
volatility than in the past, which will require tackling infrastructure gaps, raising productivity, and
increasing the economy’s resilience to external shocks; and (b) promote more inclusive growth,
better monitoring of MDGs, and targeting of social safety nets.
36.
Guyana has made considerable progress in sustainable growth and poverty reduction.
The country has reduced the poverty rate, one of its MDGs, from 43 percent in 1999 to 35 percent16
15

GUYANA

in 2006. However, growth has been uneven geographically, warranting more efforts to further
diversify the economy to spread the benefits of growth across the wider population, particularly
those living in underprivileged areas, such as the hinterland, and in extreme poverty.
37.
There is a strong positive link between unemployment and poverty. Underemployment,
mostly due to skills mismatch, as well as informal employment appears prevalent. In addition, labor
force participation remains low. Labor market policies that protect workers, such as restrictions on
hiring and firing, paid leave, and severance payments reduce employment flexibility. Nonetheless,
Guyana ranks 47 out of 144 countries in the world Economic Forum’s wage flexibility index, the best
performer in the Caribbean.
38.
Staff supported the authorities’ view that investments to increase productivity in the
traditional sectors, primarily agriculture and mining, should be an integral part of a mediumterm inclusive growth strategy. Major ongoing investments in the agriculture and mining sectors
could support growth and employment and help lift the standard of living of the population in small
villages. Advancing reforms and reducing transfers to public enterprises (averaging 5.6 percent of
GDP in 2008–12) would create fiscal headroom for more efficiently targeted social safety net and
support for small and medium enterprises to create employment, access major export markets, and
maintain business growth in the face of frequent external volatility. Recent announcements of large
investments in the extractive industries suggest major potential to diversify the economy and create
jobs. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to develop an appropriate framework to manage the
associated sovereign wealth should the reserves be proven. In addition, staff noted ongoing efforts
to build capacity, raise productivity and improve competitiveness to help further reduce poverty.
39.
It is important to address the mismatch between the outputs of the educational
system and the skills demanded by the evolving Guyanese economy. In general, the pace of
change in the Guyanese economy has outstripped the pace of adjustment in the educational system.
Secondly, there is potential for improvements in labor market mobility and flexibility which can be
achieved by enhanced training opportunities. To that end, the authorities’ initiatives that include
vocational training in secondary schools, skill training programs, on-the-job training, and social
programs that encourage labor force participation are worthwhile.
40.
To boost job creation, the authorities should continue to improve the business climate
to encourage investment while reducing the cost of doing business, especially energy.
Improving labor productivity is key for job creation in the private sector. Structural reforms, such as
investment in human capital, improvements in healthcare, and enhancements to the technical and
vocational education and training, would help unlock further potential to grow formal private sector
jobs with the pickup in real growth. The agenda should address any shortcomings in regulations to
enhance flexibility and adaptability, as well as strengthen the legal framework for necessary reforms.
Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff on the need to diversify the economy to
spread the benefits of growth, address labor market issues, especially those pertaining to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

skills mismatch with a view to increase labor force participation, and modernize agriculture
and mining. Specifically, steps are needed to encourage labor market participation by the Guyanese
population to take advantage of the emerging opportunities in the expanding mining sector.
42.
The authorities project growth in agriculture, buoyed by expansion in rice production
and stabilization of sugar production. They stressed that innovations in rice production along
with potential new agreements with countries in the region could expand exports. The authorities
also emphasized that improvements in the new sugar factory Skeldon, which has not performed as
expected so far, will boost exports and domestic sales.

D. Measures to Improve Official Data
43.
While data is broadly adequate for surveillance, further efforts are needed, notably on
facilitating timeliness. Although the authorities subscribed to the IMF’s GDDS in early 2011,
coverage of key macroeconomic variables needs improvement in terms of periodicity and timeliness.
Authorities’ views
44.
The authorities acknowledged the existence of long lags in the dissemination of some
data and are committed to resolving this situation immediately. The authorities suggested and
staff agreed to review the data dissemination schedule with a view to increasing the frequency and
timeliness, and reducing the lags of data releases.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Guyana’s macroeconomic outlook remains positive for 2013 and the medium term,
despite current political uncertainty. Over the medium term, FDI financed projects in the mining
sector and infrastructure investments, including the construction of the AFHP, should sustain growth
levels at above trend. Against this backdrop, Guyana’s minority government will be challenged to
maintain the delicate balance between strengthening fiscal consolidation and protecting the budget
from contingent liabilities and future debt distress, while promoting inclusive growth and reducing
poverty on a sustainable basis.
46.
Continued fiscal consolidation within a strengthened medium-term policy framework
is required to help safeguard debt sustainability and bolster fiscal and external reserve
buffers. In particular, gradually lowering the overall fiscal deficit to about 2.0–3.0 percent of GDP
over the medium term would help bolster fiscal and external reserve buffers and provide fiscal space
for capital expenditure to address Guyana’s significant infrastructure and social safety needs. It
would also help reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to around 55 percent by 2018 and preserve Guyana’s
ranking of moderate risk of debt distress. To contain the NFPS deficit, the authorities need to
advance far reaching reforms of SOEs, streamlining subsidies and transfers to public enterprises and
replacing them with a more targeted social safety net.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

47.
While acknowledging the potential benefits of cheaper and more reliable electricity to
help transform the economy, staff urged the authorities to use the delay in implementation of
AFHP to ensure that the project remains financially and economically viable so as not to expose the
budget to undue risks and future debt distress. To avoid further delays and advance the
implementation of the project, the authorities should continue to engage actively with all
stakeholders. Staff recommended that the authorities strengthen the project and debt management
framework in view of the risks that PPPs can pose, particularly in the presence of sovereign
guarantees. In this regard, the adoption of international best practices in the management of PPPs
to manage potential risks of contingent fiscal liabilities is warranted.
48.
While the flexible exchange rate regime remains appropriate, the authorities need to
continue to implement a policy mix that safeguards international reserves and contains
inflationary pressures. Along with appropriate nominal exchange rate flexibility, the combination
of fiscal consolidation and moderate monetary tightening coupled with structural reforms would
help to decrease inflationary pressures, boost competitiveness, contain the external current account
deficit, and reduce appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.
49.
Financial sector risks appear contained, but warrant vigilance particularly against the
backdrop of several years of rapid credit growth. Staff welcomes the progress made in
enhancing the supervisory framework and data provision of the financial sector. More frequent
comprehensive on-site inspections are, however, advisable for larger institutions. Loan
concentration, a source of potential concern raised in the 2006 FSAP, remains high due to the
limited number of large borrowers. Improved coordination of the supervision of insurers and banks
that are part of the same business group would also enhance supervision. Staff also urged the
authorities and Parliament to press ahead with addressing the AML/CFT deficiencies identified by
the CFATF by November 2013 to avoid potential impairment of the financial system.
50.
Sustaining poverty reduction and inclusive growth should remain a high priority.
Although GDP per capita has been steadily rising, greater efforts are needed to ensure a better
geographical distribution, poverty reduction and social equity. In this regard, efforts to lower the
cost of energy, reorienting training to match needed skills in the labor force, and other structural
measures to lower the cost of doing business and improve business environment are well placed.
51.
Finally, the authorities should build on their efforts with the Fund’s GDDS, through
more timely dissemination of economic information. While Guyana subscribed to the Fund’s
GDDS in 2011, periodicity and timeliness of key macroeconomic variables need improvement. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reviewing the data dissemination schedule with a view to
increasing the frequency and timeliness, and reducing the lags of data releases going forward.
52.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 2. Guyana: External Stability Assessment
In real effective terms, Guyana’s real exchange rate
has been on a fast appreciation path. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated about
20 percent since 2008, notwithstanding nominal
depreciation relative to the US dollar. This steady
appreciation in the REER largely reflects developments
in the value of the US dollar (which the Guyanese
dollar follows closely) against the Euro and other
major currencies and higher inflation in Guyana

relative to price inflation in major trading partners.

REER is close to its equilibrium level, but some
depreciation is necessary to contain projected widening current account deficit and build buffers
against potential external shocks. Staff used the external sustainability (ES) and macroeconomic
2
balance (MB) approaches to assess external stability in Guyana. The ES approach suggests that the REER
is 7.4 percent above the level that would stabilize the net foreign asset (NFA) position at its 2012 level
(-107 percent of GDP). The MB approach suggests that the projected external current account deficit of
12.5 percent of GDP over the medium-term is lower than its norm level of 10.8 percent of GDP,
translating into an appreciation of 4.1 percent. The current account norm is estimated based on a set of
3
indicators using the generalized method of moments (GMM). The main determinants of the current
account norm for Guyana include the oil balance, the NFA position, the fiscal balance and the terms-oftrade. The current account deficit will gradually decrease over time—widening due to the AFHP project
and higher imports of intermediate goods, accompanied by an increase in FDI inflows, before declining
once the investment projects are completed. Some depreciation in the real effective exchange rate,
coupled with fiscal consolidation and monetary tightening, would help stem the pace of import growth
and boost export competitiveness to contain a widening current account deficit.

However, foreign reserve coverage will
decline to 3.7 months of imports on average during the construction of the AFHP, falling temporarily
below the adequate coverage. In light of projected widening of the current account deficit and
vulnerability associated with sources of external financing, projected decline of international reserves
could pose a risk to Guyana’s external stability.
The external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that risks to the external stability remain
moderate and debt service manageable. Debt indicators remain well below their respective thresholds
over the projection period in the baseline scenario. The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio increases
moderately over the next 3 years due to large external borrowing in the medium term, before declining
and leveling off at around 27 percent. Sensitivity analysis and bound tests show high vulnerability of debt
to shocks in the case of new loans on less favorable terms and one-time 30 percent depreciation.
Nevertheless, debt service would remain manageable reflecting the high concessionality of public
borrowing, remaining at 6 percent and 9 percent of exports and government revenue, respectively.

Source of Risks
1.

Delay or
termination of
the Amaila Falls
Hydroelectric
Project

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium

High

The ongoing uncertainty with concluding financial

arrangements for the Amaila Falls Hydro-Project could
delay the start or cause termination of the project
before it comes into operation, and failure to
adequately improve the administrative and technical
readiness of GPL for increased power load.

Delay in the start of the AFHP would entail lower growth, tax
receipts, and investment, and likely external instability due to lower
capital inflows. Contingent fiscal liabilities associated with the
power purchase agreement (3 percent of GDP annually) during the
first 12 years after the construction period could be offset by fuel
imports and other power generating costs. In case of termination of
the AFHP during construction phase, the government’s direct

liability would be limited to its contribution into equity (3.5 percent
of GDP).

Low
2.

Further
reduction in
non-oil
commodity
prices.

Global recovery may increase the likelihood of a
decline in gold prices as risk aversion falls. Investor
appetite for gold has recently dimmed in the wake of
uncertainty over the effects of the exit from
unconventional monetary policy.
Guyana would be exposed to a decrease in demand for
mineral resources (e.g. bauxite), but possibly an
increase in the demand for gold.
Medium

5.

Financial stress
in the euro area
re-emerges.

Deterioration in
Banks’ Portfolio.

Global oil shock
triggered by
geopolitical
events.

This could be triggered by stalled or incomplete
delivery of national and euro area policy commitments.

Strengthen the finances and operations of
GPL to enable the company to adequately
handle its responsibilities under the AFHP.
Ensure the project is economically and
financially viable before proceeding.
Strengthen the project and debt
management framework to handle potential
risks of contingent fiscal liabilities. Build
fiscal buffers.

Medium
A fall in commodity prices would dampen foreign exchange
earnings, reduce GDP growth, and increase the fiscal deficit.
The high dependency of Guyana on commodity exports may imply
increased unemployment and an increase in non-performing loans
that would severely hurt banks’ balance sheets.

Put in place a medium-term fiscal
framework to cushion the shock of
commodity price volatility.
Allow greater flexibility in the exchange rate
to absorb terms of trade shocks.

Medium
Direct effects through lower grants (currently 3 percent of GDP)
could hike fiscal deficits and bring about a higher public debt ratio.
Indirect effects through postponement of FDI projects as global
confidence is sapped.

Medium

Medium

NPLs have been very volatile and banks have rapidly
increased lending to the private sector. It is conceivable
that some bad loans are not properly classified in
balance sheets, particularly for domestic banks, and
credit unions.

The recent rapid increase in credit could lead to rising NPLs in the
future, which could in turn impact banks’ balance sheets.

Low

Medium

Heightened geopolitical uncertainties could trigger
sharp oil price increase to $140 per barrel.

Contingent Policy Response

In the short-term allow automatic stabilizers
to work.
Put in place a medium-term expenditure
framework to mitigate the volatility of
grants and rebuild fiscal buffers.

Monetary tightening to reduce rapid rate of
credit growth.
Strengthen monitoring of banks’ prudential
framework.

Given Guyana’s high dependency on oil imports for energy, higher
oil prices could depress demand, and raise the fiscal and external
current account deficit along with inflation.

Maintain a flexible fuel pricing regime along
with social safety nets for the most
vulnerable.
Over the medium term AFHP would help
reduce the dependence on oil.

1/ Including official transfers.
2/ The active scenario assumes fiscal consolidation and tightening of monetary stance over 2014-2018. To this end, the
primary deficit is targeted at 1–2 percent of GDP by reducing current expenditure. Monetary tightening reduces credit
growth and brings inflation gradually down to 3.7 percent by 2018. This policy mix will help reduce imports and improve
export competitiveness, reducing the current account deficit and allowing the accumulation of international reserves. GDP
growth is expected to decline marginally as large infrastructure investments and increased exports will partly offset fiscal
and monetary tightening.

GUYANA

Previous Decisions and Article IV Consultation Cycle:
a.
On December 18, 2003, the Executive Board determined that Guyana had reached the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (IMF Country Report No. 04/123).
b.
On February 27, 2009, the Executive Board concluded the 2008 Article IV consultation.
c.
On March 17, 2010, the Executive Board concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation (IMF
Country Report No. 10/292).
d.
On February 16, 2011, the Executive Board concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation (IMF
Country Report No. 11/152).
e.
On November 9, 2012, the Executive Board concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation
(IMF Country Report No. 12/254). Guyana is on a 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations.
Safeguard Assessments
An updated safeguards assessment of the Bank of Guyana (BoG), related to the then expected
PRGF arrangement, was completed in May 2007. The assessment found that the BoG had taken
steps to improve its safeguards since the previous assessment in 2003. In particular, compliance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the annual financial statements have
improved, although certain disclosures still do not meet requirements, and a new internal audit
charter and associated practices have been adopted. The assessment recommended involvement
of an audit firm with experience in International Standards on Auditing and IFRS in future BoG
external audits to address professional capacity constraints in Guyana, and reconstitution of the
Board of Directors to address governance shortcomings. The latter action was completed in May
2007.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII––Section 2, 3, and 4—and maintains an
exchange system that does not have any multiple currency practices, and is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for international transactions, with the only exception of
certain exchange restrictions for the preservation of national and international security. Guyana’s
de jure exchange rate regime is floating. Guyana’s de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a
stabilized arrangement. The BoG conducts transactions on the basis of the weighted average
quotations of the three largest dealers in the exchange market. The currency of Guyana is the
Guyana dollar. The exchange rate was G$205.50 per U.S. dollar on October 31, 2013.
ROSC, FSAP, EPA Participation
a.
A fiscal ROSC was undertaken in July 2002.
b.
A WB/IMF FSAP took place in November 2005 and concluded in September 2006.
c.
Ex-Post Assessment findings were discussed with the authorities in June 2006 and
concluded on October 23, 2006.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
AND RELATIONS WITH THE BANK
A. Bank-Fund Collaboration Under the JMAP
1.
The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), 2009–2012, compromised a
program to support the Government’s objective of accelerating and sustaining growth. It
was endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in May 2009. The completion report for
the CAS is underway. The current IBRD/IDA1 portfolio is comprised of two projects totaling
US$14.2 million. In addition, the IFC’s committed portfolio in Guyana is $10.4 million (August
2013), up from $7.9 million (FY 09) and includes one project in the financial sector and one
project in the mining sector. In March 2013, IFC extended its 6 year partnership with Guyana
Goldfields Inc. by entering into an agreement that would give IFC an aggregate of 5.5 percent of
the company.
2.

The work of the World Bank is aligned along the two main areas of the CAS:



Environmental resilience and sustainability: During the period of the CAS the Bank
supported two projects. One project supported the reduction of vulnerability of coastal
areas to flooding of coastal areas, the Conservancy Adaption Project (financed through a
grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)). The second project, the Skeldon
Bagasse Cogeneration Project, was aimed at supporting Guyana’s climate mitigation
efforts; however this project was not operational. Additionally, the Bank served as Trustee
for the Guyana REDD + Fund (a US$2.5 million co-financing grant) for the Low-Carbon
Development Strategy whose first project, the Cunha Canal Rehabilitation Project was
approved in November 2011.



Education quality and social safety nets: The Bank is helping Guyana to improve the
quality of education delivered through three projects. The current projects Improving
Teacher Education and University of Guyana Science and Technology Support total
US$14.2 million. The third project, Education for All/ Fast Track Initiative, closed in
December 2012.

1

Financing to Guyana is usually done at concessionary rates and channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest that provides interest-free loans and
grants to low-income countries and through a series of trust funds managed by the Bank. Guyana’s total
indicative IDA 16 allocation for FY12–14 is 14.3 SDR/US$21.48 million. IDA 17 allocation for FY13–14 is
14.3 SDR/US$21.86.

Excludes the loan guarantee

Net loan flows are projected to continue to be positive in 2013, accounted for by the
high level of disbursement (absorptive capacity of GoG). In 2012, actual disbursements
were US$51.4 million, while US$44.9 million is projected to be disbursed in 2013.
However, net cash flow, while remaining positive is expected to fall quickly over the
medium term. As of 13 September 2013, Guyana’s total outstanding debt to the IDB is
US$426.7 million.

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK
(As of September 30, 2013)
1.
CDB remains one of Guyana’s most important development partners, accounting
for over 20% of the country’s multilateral debt stock. Total loans and grants approved for
Guyana from CDB’s inception (January 26, 1970) to September 30, 2013 amounted to
$296.6 million, representing 7.6 percent of CDB’s total approvals for its 18 borrowing members,
making Guyana CDB’s fifth largest borrower. Of the total amount approved, $158.7 million
(53.5%) went toward economic and social infrastructure projects, $82.8 million (27.9%) for
productive sector projects, and $55.1 million (18.6%) for multi-sector projects. The transportation
and communication subsector accounted for $101.4 million of lending for economic and social
infrastructure and agriculture/rural and manufacturing projects for $64.3 million of productive
sector lending.
2.
Of $215.4 million in loans approved for Guyana since 1970, outstanding balances
totalled $139.9 million as of September 30, 2013. As of that date, undisbursed balances
remained of $40.5 million, detailed in the table below.

Reflecting the reduced volume of approvals observed since CDB’s 2002-04 Country
Strategy Paper (CSP) with Guyana expired, only one loan was approved for Guyana in
2012–13. The West Coast Demerara Road Improvement (Fourth Road Project) was approved in
December 2012, in the amount of US$34.2 million, with an additional amount of $0.2 million
applied as a grant toward the project. Other grant funding in 2012–13, which totalled around
$6.4 million, related mainly to the continued implementation of the seventh cycle of the Basic
Needs Trust Fund (BNTF 7) poverty reduction programme in Guyana, as well as a small amount
for a National Workshop on Financial Management Techniques for micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) in Guyana under CDB’s Caribbean Technological Consultancy Services
(CTCS) programme. It is anticipated that approval activity will begin to pick up from the end of
2013, given the pipeline of projects in the recently approved 2013–17 CSP with Guyana.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 31, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although
timeliness, reliability, and coverage of selected data can be improved. Selected data are only
available during missions and by telephone/email contacts by the staff. Monetary statistics,
exchange rates, interest rates, and financial prudential indicators are available with a lag from
the website of the Bank of Guyana (BOG). While specific areas of statistics have received
technical assistance, including from the Fund, some limitations remain in the compiling and
disseminating selected data in certain sectors. Comprehensive macroeconomic statistics and
fiscal data are presented in the Mid Year Report on the annual budget which has been in place
since 2007. Guyana has agreed to subscribe to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

National Accounts: Considerable work has been completed to strengthen the national
accounts. Building on significant structural changes in the economy since the launch of marketoriented reforms, GDP has been rebased with 2006 prices, reflecting more than sixty percent
increase compared to the old GDP, based on 1988 prices. Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Center (CARTAC) missions visited Georgetown in 2003, 2006, and 2007 and have
since provided technical assistance on national accounts, which helped facilitate this exercise
for the production side. Further work could entail reassessing the rebased GDP on the
expenditure side. To this end, the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) could complete its register of
enterprises and secure higher response rates for business surveys. Since January 2010, the BOS
has adopted a new household income and expenditure survey (HIES) and launched a new CPI
series, reflecting more items in the basket and revised weights. The CPI index reflects
movements in prices in the Georgetown area.
Government finance statistics: A government finance statistics (GFS) mission, which visited
Georgetown in May 2005, assisted the authorities in determining the sources of the discrepancy
between the fiscal data and monetary and financial data. The mission recommended
improvements in the compilation of GFS (such as expanding the coverage of central
government operations to include important statutory bodies with their own revenue and
accounts) and improving data on the details of domestic financing. The authorities have made
progress in implementing these recommendations, including the compilation of quarterly data
for the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), and five non-financial public enterprises. Progress on
the medium term objective of adopting the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual (GFSM 2001) is proceeding.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

GUYANA

Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics missions visited Georgetown in
2002, 2003, and 2005. The BOG has made significant progress in improving the quality of
monetary statistics, especially as regards the institutional coverage. The monetary statistics
currently include the BOG, other depositary corporations (commercial banks, the New
Building Society, and trust companies), and other financial corporations (finance
companies, life insurance companies, non-life insurance companies, pension funds, and
asset management companies). The BOG’s monetary statistics provide data for publication
in the IFS Supplement, based on standardized report forms. The BOG publishes financial
prudential indicators in its quarterly report and on its website on a regular basis.

Balance of payments: In 2003, a mission from CARTAC noted several weaknesses in the
compilation of balance of payments statistics, including that external debt arrears were not
recorded in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, and important
financial account transactions were not identified. It recommended that the BOG continue
the development of the new reporting form for direct investment, revise the methodology
for recording arrears, and seek new data sources for improving the coverage of services. At
present, estimates for other services are derived from surveys and an annual survey of
major enterprises is used to collect data on inward direct investment. The BOG maintains
its own in-house capacity for processing customs data. The BOG does not report the
international investment position (IIP) because it currently does not have the capacity to
compile such statistics. This is one of the priority areas identified for technical assistance
from CARTAC.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2011.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are being reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
or in the IFS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Charles Kramer and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF),
J. Humberto Lopez and
Jeffrey D. Lewis (World Bank)

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary
Fund in consultation with the World Bank staff.

An updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) yields results broadly in line with those
reported in the 2012 Article IV.1 Guyana’s risk of debt distress remains moderate and debt
service manageable, but further fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce the vulnerability
of debt sustainability to shocks. Debt indicators remain well below their respective
thresholds over the projection period in the baseline scenario. The PV of external debt-toGDP ratio increases moderately over the next 3 years, before declining and leveling off at
around 27 percent. Sensitivity analysis and bound tests show high vulnerability of
Guyana’s debt to shocks in the case of new loans on less favorable terms and/or a onetime 30 percent depreciation. In light of risks associated with the large Public Private
Partnership (PPP) project, Amaila Falls Hydroelectric Project (AFHP), as well as the
possibility that Venezuela may renegotiate the terms of its Petrocaribe loans to finance
Guyana’s oil imports on less concessional terms, the authorities should advance their
fiscal consolidation efforts, and continue investing in infrastructure and education to
address the economy’s bottlenecks and boost growth and productivity.

See Guyana – Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation – Debt Sustainability Analysis (SM/12/254).

GUYANA

BACKGROUND
1.
Debt relief and fiscal consolidation efforts have helped reduce Guyana’s external debt
burden significantly in recent years. Total public sector debt has declined from 93.1 percent of GDP
in 2006 to 64.3 percent in 2012. Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the Fund, the World
Bank, and the IDB provided debt relief amounting to US$611 million in 2006–07. Paris Club bilateral
creditors and some non-Paris Club creditors granted debt relief as part of the 2004 Paris Club
agreement.2 Negotiations with other non-Paris Club creditors about debt relief are protracted with the
debt in question amounting to around 15 percent of total debt or 7 percent of GDP.3 The non-financial
public sector (NFPS) deficit declined from 8.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011.
2.
Over the last four years, total gross public debt has increased slightly. The debt-to-GDP
ratio increased from 61.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 64.3 percent of GDP in 2012. External debt has
increased over the same period—from 43.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 47.7 percent of GDP in 2012, in
particular due to higher IDB and Venezuelan loans––while domestic debt declined from 17.9 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2012. Multilateral institutions—particularly the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the International Development
Association—are the main external creditors, accounting for 50 percent of total debt, and bilateral
creditors for 49 percent—with China and Venezuela as main creditors. The loan portfolio has a long
maturity profile and low average interest rates (Text Figure 1).
3.
Over the years, Venezuela has become an important donor through Petrocaribe’s
concessional loans to finance Guyana’s oil imports. Although, these loan disbursements are large in
the medium term, a large portion of these funds is deposited in an account at the Central Bank of
Guyana to be used as a ‘sinking fund’, which on a net debt basis has a smaller impact and lowers debt
vulnerabilities as it increases gross reserves available to service external debt. In addition, Guyana has
initiated repayment of its Petrocaribe debt using rice exports and the accumulated savings under the
financing arrangement.
4.
Guyana’s external debt burden thresholds correspond to the ones associated with a
medium policy performance rating. The three-year average of the CPIA (Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment) of Guyana has remained stable at 3.4, corresponding to a medium policy
performance rating. This implies the following thresholds: (i) a PV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent;
(ii) a PV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; (iii) a PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 250 percent; and
(iv) debt service-to-exports and revenue ratios of 20 percent, respectively.

2

Debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative was granted by all multilateral creditors
except one, by Paris Club bilateral creditors, and four non-Paris Club creditors (China, India, Venezuela, and
Cuba). Debt owed to Brazil and North Korea was paid off without relief.

3

These creditors include Argentina, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Libya, United Arab Emirates, and Serbia, as well as a loan
from an Indian commercial entity (Tata). In addition, the situation of the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility
(CMCF) debt has not been resolved yet.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
A. Background
5.
Despite a deteriorating external environment, the Guyanese economy remains resilient,
registering the seventh consecutive year of growth. Real GDP grew by 4.8 percent in 2012 and is
projected to grow at the same pace in 2013. GDP growth is driven by buoyant commodity exports and
services sectors. Inflation is projected to remain at 4.0 percent on average during the medium term and
decline to 3.6 percent on average during the long term. The external current account deficit is expected
to widen to about 18 percent of GDP on average during the medium term, driven by higher oil imports
and large AFHP investment-related imports, before declining to 9.9 percent of GDP on average in the
long term. As a result of this and slightly lower net capital inflows, gross foreign reserves will decline to
just below 3.5 months of imports by 2027.
6.
The fiscal deficit for 2013 will remain over 5 percent of GDP, before declining gradually
over the medium term to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2018. The higher fiscal deficit in 2013 is due to a
worsening performance of public enterprises. At the same time, despite large disbursements in 2013,

public debt is expected to remain at about the same level as in 2012, reflecting in part a rice-for-debt
agreement with Venezuela that provides for debt reduction in exchange for rice exports.4

B. Baseline Scenario: Projections and Assumptions
7.
The medium term outlook remains positive (Text Table). The construction of the AFHP and
investments in the mining sector accompanied by robust growth in the service sectors will raise growth
rates to 4.4 percent on average in 2013–2018.5 The construction of AFHP is estimated to add between
1 and 1.5 percentage points per year to growth during its construction phase. Compared to the 2012
Article IV Consultation, the growth path is similar, but due to the protracted negotiations around the
project, construction is now assumed to start in the second half of 2015 and last until the second half of
2018. Subsequently, GDP growth will slowly converge back to about 3 percent over the long term
(2019–2033).
8.
Over the medium term, the external current account deficit will widen as large
investment projects will increase imports. Imports associated with AFHP and mining sector projects
will lead to a widening of the current account deficit to 18 percent of GDP on average in 2013–2018. In
particular, imports of capital goods are projected to surge. While exports of gold and bauxite are
expected to increase strongly over the medium term, in line with significant investments in the mining
sector, import growth will outpace export growth.6 As capital goods imports wind down after AFHP
construction, oil imports decline due to shifting power production from oil to hydropower, and export
growth remains strong, the external current account deficit is projected to decrease to around
9.7 percent of GDP on average over the long term (2019–2033). These developments, along with
slightly lower net capital inflows, will result in international reserves decreasing to just over 3 months of
imports in the long term.
9.
The external current account deficit is projected to be fully financed by foreign capital
inflows. FDI inflows will peak at around 17 percent of GDP in 2016, mostly driven by investments in the
mining and power generation sectors, before declining to around 6 percent of GDP in the long term.
Net official transfers are assumed to decrease from around 2 percent of GDP in the medium term to
about 1 percent of GDP in the long term. Net official borrowing will remain high over the next 4 years,
at 5.5 percent of GDP, before declining to around 1 percent of GDP over the medium and long term.
10.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to be insufficient to reduce debt ratios more rapidly in
the long term. The fiscal deficit will remain high over the medium term, as capital spending associated
with infrastructure needs in the context of the AFHP project remains high, before gradually narrowing

In addition, Russia agreed to cancel its outstanding debt of US$0.276 million in 2012.

5

The projection includes two advanced investment projects in the gold and bauxite industry. It is likely that other
investments in the mining sector (gold and manganese) will come on stream over the medium term. However,
they are not accounted for as they are in an early preparatory stage.

Bauxite and gold exports are expected to surge due to additional capacity in existing bauxite mines and the
production start of a new large scale gold mine in 2014.

to 3.5 percent by 2018. Over the long term, gradual fiscal consolidation efforts will bring the fiscal deficit
to an average 1 percent of GDP. Gross public debt is projected to remain above 64 percent of GDP over
the medium, before declining to 48 percent of GDP in the long term. At the same time, the composition
of debt will change with external debt increasing and domestic debt decreasing from around
17 percent of GDP in 2012 to around 9 percent of GDP in the long term.

ASSESSMENT OF THE BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS
EXTERNAL DEBT
11.
The analysis suggests that Guyana’s external debt remains sustainable under the baseline
scenario and the country faces a moderate risk of debt distress, but external debt ratios are
vulnerable to shocks (Table 1, Figure 1). All sustainability indicators remain comfortably below their
thresholds. The PV of gross external debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 33 percent in 2015 because of large
projected external borrowing in the medium term and levels off at around 27 percent in the long term.
Most of the improvement in the PV of gross external debt-to-GDP ratio compared to the previous DSA
was due to the increase in the discount rate as well as lower projected disbursements in the long term.7
External debt remains manageable given the government’s policy of borrowing on highly concessional
terms: The debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios remain well below their
respective thresholds, reflecting the concessionality of outstanding debt and new external borrowing in
the near-term. In addition, the authorities have embarked on repaying Petrocaribe debt via rice exports.
If this program continues over next few years, it could have positive effects on Guyana’s foreign debt
levels.
12.
Bound tests and alternative scenarios show that Guyana’s external debt is vulnerable to
large shocks and a deteriorated economic environment (Table 2, Figure 1). In particular, the PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the threshold in the most extreme combination of shocks (Figure 1) and a
low probability one-time 30 percent depreciation (Table 2, B6). Stress tests provide some comfort about
the repayment capacity of Guyana as they do not suggest any breach of the relevant thresholds for the
PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-to-revenue, even under the most extreme combination of
shocks.

7

The discount rate used for calculating PV of debt was 5 percent compared to 3 percent used in the previous
DSA. The Executive Boards of the Fund and the Bank approved on October 11 the reform of the discount rate
(SM/13/271) setting a unique discount rate at 5 percent, which will be used to (a) calculate the present value of
the external debt of low-income countries in the DSF and (b) for purposes of assessing the concessionality of
individual loans.

ASSESSMENT OF THE BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS
PUBLIC DEBT
13.
The analysis implies that Guyana’s total gross public debt is sustainable and remains
manageable (Tables 3 and 4). Nominal public sector debt is projected to decline gradually over the
projection period from 64 percent of GDP in 2013 to 48 percent of GDP in 2033. Further fiscal
consolidation would be desirable to reduce debt ratios faster and place the debt on a downward
trajectory. The PV of the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to decline from 46 percent of GDP
in 2013 to 36 percent in 2033.
14.
Total public debt is vulnerable to standard shocks underlining the importance of further
fiscal consolidation and closer monitoring of Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) projects
to ensure they are financially viable and increase the economy’s productivity, especially in high
profile projects (Table 4, Figure 2). The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is most vulnerable to a growth shock,
assuming real GDP growth at -0.1 percent, its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2013–
2014 (Table 4, B1). In this case, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 51 percent during the
medium term and 63 percent in 2033, which is 28 percentage points higher than the baseline scenario.
Debt service payments would remain manageable reflecting the high concessionality of the public debt.
Nevertheless, in some scenarios debt service could increase to as much as a third of revenues, which
could limit significantly resources for public investment and social spending.
15.
Risks associated with AFHP may affect debt sustainability. The illustrative AFHP scenario
considers only the main risk resulting from the guarantee on the payment of the power purchase
agreement (PPA). In the event the public electricity company Guyana Power and Light (GPL) is unable to
pay the PPA payment of US$120 million a year,8 the government would have to meet these obligations.
In an illustrative scenario (Table 4, A4), we have assumed that the government has to take on the entire
PPA payment over the 20 year contract period, which would increase public expenditure by the amount
of the PPA payment. This is a worst case scenario, as part of GPL costs of oil imports would be greatly
reduced by the electricity production from AFHP, allowing the government to reduce its financial
support to GPL and consequently offset part of the PPA payments. We assume that the higher fiscal
deficit in this case would be entirely financed by domestic debt. To separate the effects of the PPA
guarantee on debt, this scenario makes the same assumptions as in the baseline scenario. This scenario
would imply a sharp increase of the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 76 percent by 2033 compared to
35 percent in the baseline (Table 4, Figure 2). At the same time, debt service could increase up to
14 percent of revenues compared to 8 percent in the baseline, cutting significantly resources for public
investment and social spending.

8

PPA payment of US$120 million is provisional, and the actual number can be higher or lower depending on the
terms of the financial closure.

CONCLUSION
16.
Guyana’s risk of debt distress remains moderate and debt service manageable, but
further fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce the vulnerability of debt sustainability to shocks.
Debt indicators remain well below their respective thresholds over the projection period in the baseline
scenario. The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio increases moderately over the next 3 years due to large
external borrowing in the medium term, before declining and leveling off at around 27 percent.
Sensitivity analysis and bound tests show high vulnerability of Guyana’s debt to shocks, in particular, in
the case of new loans on less favorable terms and one-time 30 percent depreciation. Nevertheless, debt
service would remain manageable reflecting the high concessionality of public borrowing. However,
under some scenarios and bound tests debt service could increase significantly, reducing the room to
allocate resources for public investment and social spending. In light of additional risks stemming from
the AFHP project and the possibility that Petrocaribe may renegotiate the terms of its loans to finance
Guyana’s oil imports on less concessional terms, the authorities should advance its fiscal consolidation
efforts and continue to seize the opportunity of the debt-for-rice program with Venezuela to keep the
debt ratio at a lower level.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Guyana
On December 9, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Guyana.
During the last decade, Guyana’s strong macroeconomic performance has contributed to a
reduction in public debt levels and sustained poverty reduction. The economy has experienced
seven years of uninterrupted growth averaging about 4 percent annually. The key pillars of the
macroeconomic resurgence have been sustained reforms, in particular the implementation of
VAT, favorable commodity prices, significant inflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and debt
relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) initiatives.
Real economic activity expanded by 4.8 percent in 2012 on the back of broad-based growth in
agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construction and other services. Twelve-moth inflation
remained low at 3.4 percent, notwithstanding higher energy and food prices. In FY2012, the
overall fiscal deficit was 4.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), virtually unchanged from
the 2011 outturn. Central government revenues net of grants declined by 0.8 percent of GDP,
reflecting lower income and consumption tax receipts, and non-interest current expenditures
rose by 1 percent of GDP mainly on account of higher transfer payments to electricity and sugar
companies. The deterioration in the central government balance was offset by improved
performance of state-owned enterprises whose financial position shifted from deficit to surplus.
The external current account balance was broadly unchanged from 2011 and gross international
reserves stood at 4.2 months of imports at end-2012. Meanwhile, the banking soundness
indicators have remained strong, with capital adequacy ratios well above the regulatory
minimum requirement, non performing loans (NPLs) between 5 and 6 percent over the last three
years and provisioning for bad loans at comfortable levels.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The macroeconomic outlook is generally positive for 2013 and the medium term. Growth is
projected at 4.8 percent in 2013, continuing the broad-based robust expansion in economic
activity. Twelve-month inflation is expected to remain low at around 3.5 percent by year-end. The
revised 2013 budget envisages an overall fiscal deficit of 5.2 percent of GDP, largely related to
worsening performance of public enterprises which are projected to return a deficit of
0.4 percent of GDP compared to a surplus of 1.3 percent in 2012. Higher VAT receipts are
projected to raise central government non-grant revenue by 0.9 percent of GDP. Meanwhile,
central government capital expenditure is projected to rise by 0.4 percent of GDP, while the
public wage bill as a percent of GDP will remain broadly stable and transfers will decline by
0.7 percent of GDP. The current account deficit is expected to widen to 16.8 percent of GDP in
2013, driven by higher fuel imports, lower commodity prices, and lower remittances, which are
projected to fall with slowing activity in major host countries. At the same time, with larger
disbursements related to an ambitious public investment program and resilient FDI, gross
international reserves are projected to remain adequate at 3.6 months of imports.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Guyana’s strong growth over the past several years, underpinned
by favorable commodity prices and robust foreign direct investment. While the medium-term
economic outlook remains positive, Directors encouraged the authorities to persevere in their
commitment to sound policies and reforms to strengthen policy buffers, promote more inclusive
growth, and further reduce poverty.
Directors underscored the importance of prudent fiscal consolidation anchored in a mediumterm policy framework that safeguards debt sustainability, bolsters fiscal and external buffers,
and addresses unmet development needs. Priority should continue to be given to implementing
reforms to boost the efficiency of public enterprises and replacing universal subsidies with
better-targeted social assistance.
Acknowledging the potential benefits of a more stable and reliable source of energy, Directors
encouraged the authorities to ensure that the large hydroelectric project under consideration
remains financially and economically viable to curb fiscal risks. In this context, they saw merit in
strengthening the project and debt management framework, and pursuing international best
practices as regard public-private partnerships.
Directors considered that a modestly tighter stance of monetary policy and continued exchange
rate flexibility would help safeguard international reserves, contain inflationary pressures, and
reduce the current account deficit.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Although risks appear generally limited, Directors recommended continued vigilance over the
financial sector. In light of rapid credit growth in recent years and high loan concentration, they
advised frequent on-site inspections for larger banks and a better integrated supervision of
financial business groups. It is urgent to address remaining gaps in the regime to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress so far in poverty reduction. However, they
considered that further efforts are needed to ensure a more even distribution of the benefits
from economic growth. In this regard, efforts to lower the cost of energy, address skill
mismatches, and improve the business environment represent important policy initiatives. Steps
to increase productivity in traditional sectors, such as agriculture and mining, should also be part
of a strategy to foster more inclusive growth. Directors also encouraged further improvements in
data provision and dissemination.
