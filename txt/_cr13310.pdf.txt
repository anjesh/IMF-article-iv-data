STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 5, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth has slowed amidst weak investment and external demand, while the
output gap appears to be at or near zero and inflation is elevated. Activity is currently
weak, but is expected to accelerate somewhat later this year. However, structural factors
constrain medium-term prospects. The introduction of a new oil price-based fiscal rule, a
more flexible exchange rate, and operational improvements in monetary policy have
strengthened the macroeconomic policy framework. Financial sector reform has
progressed, though sector indicators are mixed and rapid growth in unsecured retail
credit is of some concern. Risks remain tilted to the downside, including on account of
possible external (e.g., oil price) and domestic (e.g., investor sentiment) shocks.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. Calls for policy stimulus are testing Russia’s
newly strengthened macroeconomic anchors. But absent a widening output gap,
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies would at best provide only a modest and
unsustainable increase in GDP, while generating overheating and greater policy
uncertainty. So far, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) has kept its main
policy interest rate on hold. Fiscal policy is appropriately neutral this year but is under
threat from off-budget spending plans. To contain inflation and reduce risks, the
authorities should keep monetary policy on hold with a tightening bias, resist additional
fiscal stimulus, and consider further measures to dampen excessive retail credit growth.
Medium-term policy challenges. To reach higher sustainable growth, Russia needs to
further strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework and implement supply-side
reforms. The authorities should gradually tighten the fiscal rule to rebuild fiscal buffers
and save more of the nation’s exhaustible oil income. The CBR should complete its
transition to a flexible exchange rate and inflation targeting (IT) by end-2014 as planned,
which, combined with fiscal policy changes, would help anchor inflation expectations. To
mitigate supply-side growth constraints, Russia should reduce the regulatory burden to
facilitate more private sector activity in key sectors, strengthen the financial sector to
improve its ability to channel savings into productive investment projects, increase
transparency, and enhance the business climate. Further global integration, including
completing OECD accession, would support and broaden these efforts.

CONTEXT
1.
In recent years, Russia has narrowed the income gap, strengthened key
macroeconomic policy anchors, and taken some important structural measures. Since 2000,
Russia has increased its per capita income from 33 to 51 percent of the OECD average. Fiscal and
external buffers are being rebuilt. Unemployment has declined to near historic lows. Inflation has
been in single digits since 2009. A new oil price-based fiscal rule, increased exchange rate flexibility,

2.
However, Russia’s growth is slowing and medium-term prospects are increasingly
dampened by supply-side constraints. The activation of spare capacity and rising oil prices that
drove a decade of average annual growth in excess of 5 percent are not replicable. The economy is
now likely at or near full capacity (Box 1), the 2000s oil price rise is unlikely to be repeated, and
negative demographics and a weak business climate present a drag on growth (Figure 1). The
government’s increased presence in key sectors such as energy and banking has dampened private
investment and competition (Figure 2).

Achieving higher sustainable growth hinges on Russia’s ability to adopt a new growth
model. The government has emphasized strengthening institutions and overcoming supply side
constraints (Box 2), much of which dovetails with past Fund policy advice (Box 3). But
implementation has lagged. Given Russia’s regional importance, its progress in tackling these issues
also has growth and spillover implications for other CIS countries and the Baltic countries (Box 4).

Box 2. Government Growth Strategy
Key elements of the authorities’ growth strategy include:
Lowering the cost of doing business. The government is targeting a top 20 Doing Business (World Bank)
rating by 2018, and has implemented a number of reforms in pursuit of this goal (Russia moved up six
places to 112 in the most recent ranking). Public-private action plans for resolving bottlenecks in key areas—
such as customs, regulatory environment, construction permits, and access to electricity—are in various
stages of preparation and implementation, with frequent updates, specific key performance indicators, and
survey-based assessments. Federal and regional ombudsmen for entrepreneur’s rights have been appointed
and the authorities report that over 80 disputes have been resolved by the federal ombudsman. The
government has submitted a draft law to Duma proposing amnesty for individuals who committed
economic crimes.
Increasing the financial sector’s contribution to growth. The government seeks to reduce the cost of
borrowing by reducing administrative burdens on banks, strengthening creditor rights, enhancing
competition in the banking sector, and granting limited state guarantees for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). It is also aiming to develop Moscow as an international financial center.
Increasing public sector efficiency and investment. The government wants to improve the efficiency of
government spending and increase public and private investment, including through Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs). To support this, the government: (1) implemented the new fiscal rule; (2) is drafting new
PPP legislation; (3) is taking steps to strengthen the business environment; (4) is shifting to program-based
budgeting; (5) plans to introduce compulsory public audits of costs and technologies for all large investment
projects with state participation (this had been planned to begin in 2013); (6) is gradually privatizing state
corporations; and (7) is planning to support PPP infrastructure projects through loans from the National
Wealth Fund (NWF)—the intergenerational oil savings fund.

Box 3. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
During the 2012 Article IV consultation, Directors underscored the need to strengthen the fiscal framework,
tighten the policy stance, improve monetary operations, implement 2011 FSAP recommendations, and
implement structural reforms (including strengthening the business environment). Since then, the
authorities have implemented a new fiscal rule, tightened monetary policy, improved monetary operations,
and strengthened financial sector supervision. Progress on pension reform and broader structural reforms
to improve the business environment has been slow.
Key recommendations

Implemented policies

Fiscal policy
Ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation;
rebuild Reserve Fund.

Non-oil deficit remains high; Reserve Fund is higher
but still below the government target.

Anchor public finances with rule to decouple fiscal
stance from oil price fluctuations and ensure savings
of exhaustible oil revenues.

New oil price-based fiscal rule implemented; delinks
fiscal stance from short-run oil price fluctuations but
does not allow for sufficient fiscal adjustment and
oil revenue savings.

Pension reform in light of adverse demographic
trends.

Pension reform is still under consideration.

Monetary policy
Tighten monetary stance to keep underlying
inflation on downward path.

Monetary stance tightened in September 2012 but
underlying inflation remains elevated.

Formally make the repo rate the primary CBR policy
rate; consolidate array of refinancing instruments,

The CBR is gradually aligning refinancing
instruments.

Publish inflation expectation surveys and inflation
forecasts.

The first inflation expectation survey was published
earlier this year.

Financial sector
Monitor rapid household credit growth and possibly
take prudential actions.

The CBR implemented prudential measures to
moderate household credit growth.

Implement legislative changes to address
weaknesses in the supervisory framework in line
with the 2011 FSAP.

Amendments to Banking Law consistent with
the 2011 FSAP recommendations have been
adopted (See Annex II).

Equip the Federal Service for Financial Markets
(FSFM) with basic supervisory powers for the
nonbank financial sector.

Plan to create mega-supervisor by merging the
supervisory functions of the FSFM into the CBR is
moving ahead.

Structural policies
Implement broad structural reforms to make the
business environment more predictable and rulesbased, and implement a broad privatization
strategy.

Some improvements in dispute resolution and tax
administration. Little progress regarding SMEs;
governance; infrastructure bottlenecks. Privatization
has been slowed with the focus shifted towards
attracting private capital infusions to state-owned
enterprises (SOES).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Real GDP growth has slowed over the past year, with mixed signs of recovery (Table 1;
Figure 3). Growth began slowing around mid-2012 and fell to 3.4 percent for the year—from about
4½ percent in 2010-11—and weakened further in the first quarter of 2013 to 1.6 percent (y-o-y).
Strong real wage and retail credit growth in the first half of 2013 has supported consumption, but a
weak external environment and faltering investment have been a drag, particularly on
manufacturing and construction which fell m/m (sa) in April/May but then partially rebounded in
June. The drop in investment reflects significant declines in capital expenditures by large energy
companies—several major investment projects ended and cash flows suffered from a retroactive
price adjustment for gas shipments to Europe. Staff estimates suggest the growth slowdown has
erased what had been a small positive output gap in 2012. Short-term indicators are mixed, but on
balance suggest some recovery of activity in recent months and provide a basis for a stronger
growth outlook for the remainder of this year.
6.
Inflation has started to gradually decline. Inflation was driven up from a low of
3.6 percent in May 2012 to 7.4 percent y-o-y in May 2013, mostly by food price shocks and
regulated tariff hikes. With this impact fading, inflation declined to 6.9 percent (y-o-y) in June. Staff’s
measure of core inflation—a good proxy for trend inflation—has remained slightly below headline
inflation since the fourth quarter of 2012, indicating that inflation could ease further in the second
half of this year.
7.
Recent global financial market turbulence has had an impact on Russian financial
markets. The effect of announced possible tapering of unconventional monetary policy in the
U.S. and other external developments have put some pressure on the exchange rate, the local bond
market, and equities, and may have contributed to some acceleration of capital outflows. Events in
Cyprus so far have not had a significant impact on Russia (Box 4). Inward and outward spillover
channels remain primarily via remittances, the trade channel, including oil prices, and to a lesser
extent the financial channel, with outward spillovers concentrated on CIS and Baltic countries.
8.
The exchange rate is increasingly flexible, and Russia’s external position is broadly in
line with medium-term fundamentals (Box 5). In mid-2013, the ruble basket rate depreciated by
6 percent, the highest among emerging European countries, prompting some modest interventions
by the CBR. The ruble subsequently rebounded modestly.1 The Finance Ministry will begin later this
year to purchase foreign exchange in the market on an ongoing basis for deposit into the
government oil savings funds managed by the CBR. This will facilitate the CBR’s liquidity
management by ending the periodic liquidity withdrawal under the previous system of depositing
savings in rubles with the CBR.

The CBR currently utilizes an exchange rate band mechanism (see Informational Annex).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

9.
The current account surplus remains high but is shrinking (Table 2; Figure 4). The current
account surplus declined to $75 billion in 2012 (3.7 percent of GDP), from $97 billion in 2011
(5.1 percent of GDP), despite higher oil prices. This trend continued into the first quarter of 2013,
with the current account surplus falling by $11 billion compared to 2012Q1. This reflects still strong
import growth on the back of robust private consumption, continuing deterioration of service and
income account balances, and more recently a drop in oil prices. Russia’s exports remain heavily
weighted towards energy (which accounted for two thirds of exports in 2012), and overall export
diversification has fallen in recent years. Russia’s entry to the WTO in August 2012 has granted
foreign access to domestic markets in several sectors but there are long transition periods for
important industries, including cars, meat processing, and insurance.
10.
Capital flows have broadly mirrored current account developments. Net private capital
outflows were $54 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) in 2012, driven by the nonbank private sector.
Outflows continued into early 2013 and increased further in May/June, led by depreciation
expectations.

Box 4. Spillovers (and the Cyprus Crisis)
The CIS region is closely interconnected with the
Russian economy, mainly through trade and
remittances channels. The sharp contraction in the
Russian economy during the 2008/09 crisis severely
affected the region, with a significant drop in Russia’s
imports from and individual remittances to the region.
A large depreciation of the ruble during the crisis also
triggered sharp currency devaluations in most CIS
countries, weakening banks’ balance sheets and credit.
Imports and remittances have fully recovered from the
crisis amid Russia’s robust growth in 2010–12. Russia’s
imports from CIS countries have surpassed the precrisis peak. Remittances also continue to increase, and
are particularly important for Moldova, Kyrgyz Republic,
and Tajikistan, where they are a key source of foreign
exchange earnings (15-40 percent of GDP). Given the
strong linkages between Russia and other CIS
countries, the more recent growth slowdown in Russia
has adversely affected the region. The completion of
the labor-intensive large Sochi project at the beginning
of 2014 may temporarily reduce remittances. A
prolonged slowdown of economic activity, especially

Box 4. Spillovers (and the Cyprus Crisis) (Concluded)
in construction, may have a significant impact on remittances from Russia.
Russia is also subject to potential inward spillovers. For example, Russia experienced accelerated
outflows following announcements in May of this year on expected changes in U.S. monetary policy.
Other possible channels are discussed in the context of risks.
Cyprus. Russia’s direct exposure to Cyprus bank restructuring is small relative to the size of the Russian
economy and lost deposits of Russian entities are estimated at about 0.1 percent of Russian GDP.
Private sector representatives indicated that some financial flows have been diverted to other financial
centers but that the crisis and Cypriot capital controls have not been a significant impediment. Cyprus
is Russia’s largest partner for both inward and outward foreign direct investment, though much of this
is round-tripping and covered by netting agreements. Cyprus also continues to be an important
financial center for settling various Russian market transactions (e.g., stock market trades). Cyprus has
been attractive for both the Russian private and publicly owned corporate and financial sectors as a
financial center with favorable tax treatment and a large number of double-taxation treaties with EU
countries and other economies. Under the double taxation treaty with Russia, Russian businesses that
set up and remit dividends to offshore companies in Cyprus pay a withholding tax of only 5 percent,
rather than the Russian tax of 15 percent. Remittances of royalties and interest are tax free, compared
to 20% tax rate within Russia. Better property rights protection by the Cypriot legal framework and
Russia’s shortcomings in the implementation of the anti-money laundering framework may also have
contributed to Cyprus’ attractiveness. The specific nature and volume of transactions through Cyprus
remain unclear, however, and developments in Cyprus may leave some Russian financial activity
exposed to possible disruptions in payments flows, or create further incentive for diversion to other
financial centers.

Box 5. External Sector Assessment for Russia
Staff’s assessment indicates that Russia’s external position in 2012 was broadly in line with the value
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The authorities agreed with
this broad assessment. They noted that the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric for Russia, at
186 percent as of end-2012, was relatively high. This reserve level was, however, appropriate in their
view for addressing volatile oil prices and in part also reflects the need for saving exhaustible oil
income.
Model-based estimates as well as an analysis of demographics and the exhaustibility of natural
resources suggest that the cyclically-adjusted current account surplus in 2012 (estimated at around
3¾ percent of GDP) was 0 to 2 percent of GDP weaker

decline gradually, the oil
price-based fiscal rule envisages a medium-term fiscal adjustment. This will be insufficient, however,
to improve the current account balance under the baseline scenario. The envisaged increase in
flexibility of the exchange rate (supported by the proposed deeper fiscal adjustment) should help
secure appropriate external balances.

11.
The overall fiscal balance is swinging back into deficit this year, while the non-oil fiscal
stance is roughly neutral. (Table 3; Figure 5). The general government balance was in surplus
(0.4 percent of GDP) in 2012, but is turning negative in 2013 as oil prices have weakened. Non-oil
revenue growth has shown weakness—hurt by slowing growth and tax exemptions related to Sochi
Olympics—, notably in VAT and profit taxes, but expenditure restraint has kept the non-oil balance
roughly flat so far relative to last year. The Reserve Fund balance has risen from 3 percent of GDP
in 2012 to 4.1 percent of GDP as of mid-2013—well short of the government’s 7 percent of GDP
medium-term target— following the deposit of 2012 oil savings. The NWF stands at 4.0 percent of
GDP. The Finance Ministry has ruled out major changes to the tax regime, citing the importance of
stability, but a property tax that would boost revenues for regional budgets—and could help pay for
higher wage mandates—is under consideration. Projected privatization receipts for 2013–15 have

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

been scaled back as the government is shifting its focus towards attracting private sector capital
infusions. The average duration of government debt has been extended to 4.5 years, up from
3.5 years, last year.
12.
The new oil-price based fiscal rule is holding, but spending pressures are emerging.
The fiscal rule approved in December 2012 (Annex I) places strict limits on federal spending levels.
However, the government is supporting additional spending via other means, including: (i) a
one percent of GDP increase in loan guarantees in 2013—a portion of which initiates spending to be
paid out of future budgets; (ii) up to R450 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in lending from the NWF to
support planned PPP infrastructure investments in a high-speed railway between Moscow and
Kazan, a new ring road for Moscow, and upgrades to the Trans-Siberian railway; and (iii) Far East
investment incentives involving tax exemptions over 2014-2027. Government budgets are also
under pressure from mandated wage increases and preparations for the 2014 Sochi Olympics and
the 2018 World Cup.
13.
The CBR is targeting an end-2013 inflation rate between 5 and 6 percent. The CBR’s
target range for 2014–15 is 4 to 5 percent. However, the CBR has announced it is considering a
move to a point target of 4.5 percent with a symmetric tolerance band of +/- 1.5 percentage points
beginning 2014–15. The authorities are continuing preparations for adopting full-fledged IT by
end-2014 (Box 6).
14.
Against the backdrop of continued high inflation, the monetary policy stance has
remained on hold. (Table 4; Figure 6). The main policy rate has been on hold since
September 2012. The CBR has gradually lowered some secondary rates on longer-term facilities in
an effort to strengthen monetary policy transmission. Money market rates edged up in 2013:Q2,
reflecting limited direct access of second- and third tier banks to central bank refinancing. Liquidity
conditions have been volatile, driven by the budget cycle and seasonal factors. In July, the CBR
launched a new 12-month floating rate refinancing facility secured by nonmarketable assets and
guarantees, with a minimum interest rate of 25 bps above the standard repo facility. Following the
initial auction in late July, money market rates fell slightly. The CBR indicated in public
communications that this initiative is intended to ease collateral constraints that have hindered
banks’ access to the interbank market and to help strengthen the transmission mechanism. The CBR
now has a dozen facilities for liquidity provision and absorption at its disposal; including fixed-rate
standing facilities secured by various collateral classes, and auction-based instruments, both in
various maturities, reaching from overnight to one year.

Box 6. From Targeting Inflation to Inflation Targeting
Progress. Since announcing in 2009 its intention to move from an exchange rate targeting framework to IT,
the CBR has made considerable improvements to the monetary policy framework. The CBR has announced
formal end-year inflation targets since 2010 and has strengthened its implementation capacity through: (1)
narrowing the interest rate corridor; (2) shifting to more active use of open market operations; (3)
increasing exchange rate flexibility; and (4) improving policy transparency and communication.
Challenges. Monetary transmission from policy rates to lending rates remains imperfect and interbank
markets are shallow and segmented. Inflation
volatility remains fairly high owing to the
economy’s commodity dependence and high
share of food products and regulated tariffs in
the CPI basket.
Next steps. To complete the move to fullfledged IT by end-2014 as planned, further
important measures will have to be taken.
Decision-making processes and organizational
arrangements in the CBR will have to be
adapted, including the creation of a separate
forecasting department. To better guide
expectations, the CBR should regularly
publish: inflation expectation surveys (building
on the inaugural survey this year) and its own
forecasts for inflation and other key variables
such as the output gap. Monetary policy
reports should include more forward-looking
analysis. Furthermore, the CBR should
consolidate its vast array of monetary
operations instruments and rates.

15.
Overall credit growth has slowed, but retail lending continues to expand rapidly.
(Figures 7 - 9; Table 5). Real credit growth decelerated to 11.3 percent (y-o-y) in the first quarter
of 2013, down from 15 percent per annum average growth rates during 2011–12. Retail lending
expanded by around 40 percent and uncollateralized retail lending grew by about 55 percent y-o-y
in 2012. Corporate lending was strong in the first half of 2012, but has moderated since then. The
slowdown has been mainly demand-driven—reflecting low investment and greater reliance on
working capital financing—but with some scaling back on the supply-side from tightened bank
capitalization and prudential regulations and widening funding gaps (covered to a large extent by
increased CBR financing). The net effect has been an increase in lending rates. The CBR introduced
higher provisioning requirements for uncollateralized retail loans effective January 2013 and
increased the risk weights for consumer loans effective July 2013, but it is too early to assess the
impact on lending. The NPL ratio has been declining due to rapid credit growth, with NPLs growing
in nominal terms. The FICO Credit Health Index has been declining since 2012 as a result of the rapid
growth in the highest-risk sectors of the credit market (notably unsecured consumer loan and credit
cards) and rising delinquencies in these segments. There are indications that overall asset quality has
deteriorated in 2013H1, and NPLs may increase quickly once credit growth slows. The reported

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

average capital adequacy ratio for the banking system as a whole declined from 18.1 percent at
end-2010 to 13.4 percent in February 2013. According to CBR estimates, two thirds of this decline
was due to the expansion of bank lending, while one third was due to the adoption of more
conservative prudential regulations.
16.
The depth and efficiency of the financial sector remains low. Russia’s credit-to-GDP ratio
of 52 percent is below the average of peer countries. Bank competition is hindered by high
concentration at the top and excessive fragmentation at the bottom of the banking system.
State-owned banks dominate, accounting for more than half of total loans and deposits—due in
part to an implicit state deposit guarantee and easy access to CBR and government financing. The
growth in recent years of publicly-owned banks has exacerbated this situation. In contrast, even the
largest private banks hardly reach retail deposit market shares of 1 to 2 percent. Smaller private
banks, numbering more than 700, have difficulties in accessing the interbank market, report weak
profitability, have high asset and liability concentration risks, and are difficult to supervise. At the
same time, specialized retail banks have driven much of the lending growth.

17.
The authorities have stepped up their efforts to implement the recommendations of
the 2011 FSAP (Annex II). In July, the President approved key amendments to the Banking Law that
grant the CBR authority to more adequately supervise bank holding companies and related entities,
address connected lending, use professional judgment in applying laws and regulations to individual
banks, and share information with other supervisors without restrictions. Later this year, the
authorities plan to merge the supervisory functions of the FSFM into the CBR, creating a
mega-supervisor with broad supervisory authority. This may enhance the capacity to monitor
systemic risks, but current weaknesses in the supervision of nonbanks still need to be addressed.
Amendments to the Central Bank Law authorizing the CBR to appoint its inspectors at large banks
have been passed in the Duma. The CBR is planning to implement Basel III capital frameworks within

the next six months and the internal ratings-based approach for measuring credit risks (IRB) no
earlier than 2015.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
18.
Against a backdrop of elevated uncertainty, staff baseline projections call for
moderate growth and inflation close to the upper end of the CBR’s target range. (Table 6).
Staff projects real GDP growth to accelerate in 2H13—helped by base effects and stronger growth in
industrial production and agricultural output—and to reach 2½ percent in 2013. This is broadly in
line with government and consensus projections. If the global environment improves as expected,
and no downside risks are realized, staff projects growth to pick up to 3¼ percent in 2014—against
the government’s forecast of 3.7 percent. Inflation is projected to come down to about 6 percent
(y-o-y) by end-2013, at the upper point of the CBR’s target range, as the effects of temporary
supply-side shocks fade. However, without further policy adjustment, inflation is expected to be
around 5.5 percent in 2014—just outside the CBR’s target range (the government expects inflation
to drop to 5.3 percent). The current account surplus is projected to continue declining in 2014 amid
slightly weaker energy prices. Capital outflows are expected to continue, albeit at a gradually slower
pace.
19.
Risks continue to be tilted to the downside (Annex III). Russia’s relatively undiversified
economic structure puts it in a vulnerable position to potential external shocks—such as a sharp
decline in oil and natural gas prices (Table 7 and Figure 10). In staff’s adverse scenario, a sharp and
permanent decline in energy prices—for example, due to a shale gas/oil revolution—would cause a
significant drop in Russia’s growth, putting pressures on external and fiscal accounts. The fiscal
buffer (Reserve Fund) would be quickly depleted and growth would return only slowly. Other
external risks include an acceleration of capital outflows, and intensified international banking
problems. The main domestic risks include a deteriorating domestic investment climate—possibly
from heightened political uncertainty and social protests—and slow progress with structural reforms
that could undermine domestic demand and growth and lead to higher capital outflows. Political
pressures for near-term policy stimulus pose a threat to newly-minted macroeconomic anchors and
stability. Materialization of downside risks could have negative spillovers throughout the region,
mainly through remittances and trade.
20.
Russia is better equipped to handle adverse shocks than previously. The more flexible
exchange rate can absorb external shocks, and improved crisis management capacity should
facilitate timely provision of sufficient liquidity needed to mitigate the impact on banks. Higher
international reserves provide a buffer, while reduced balance sheet mismatches should allow for
more flexible policy responses. The new oil price-based fiscal rule provides a guidepost for
short-term fiscal policy responses to oil price shocks. However, with the Reserve Fund below its
target level, the authorities risk procyclical fiscal adjustments in the event of large and lasting oil
price declines. Debt sustainability is not an immediate concern given low public and gross external
debt levels of about 13 and 29 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2012 (Tables 9–11).

21.
Russia’s medium-term economic outlook is limited by supply-side constraints. Unless
more is done to address key structural bottlenecks and reforms, baseline projections see potential
growth at a modest 3½ percent. This is low compared to peer countries at similar income levels—
reflective of Russia’s relatively weak investment climate (Figure 11) and structural barriers to the
efficient use of resources. Inflation will remain elevated at 5½ percent, and the external current
account surplus would gradually decline as oil prices moderate and robust import growth continues.

22.
Under a reform scenario, Russia’s medium-term growth could rise considerably.
(Table 8). Russia could achieve medium-term growth of about 5 percent if supported by stronger
and more growth-friendly fiscal adjustment (and higher oil savings), monetary policy fully focused
on meeting inflation targets, a more competitive financial system, energy sector reform, and more
progress with other structural reforms. In this reform scenario, more efficient resource allocation
through improved financial intermediation and labor market flexibility would boost Russia’s
productivity, while a more favorable business climate and stable macroeconomic environment would
raise investment and potential growth.
23.
The authorities broadly agreed with the risk assessments, but viewed medium-term
growth prospects somewhat more favorably. They viewed external risks as centered on exports,
particularly energy, but also global food prices (inflation). There was some concern about the
potential impact of WTO accession on several sectors, including autos, agriculture, aerospace,
medical equipment, and light industry, but they viewed WTO entry as bringing broader benefits as
well. The authorities pointed out that Russia’s level of integration to global markets remained lower
than many peers’, thus muting external risks. On the domestic side, they viewed inadequate credit
and investment as important weaknesses. The Ministry of Economic Development—which is
responsible for the government’s macroeconomic projections—is more optimistic about the
implementation of reforms and its growth dividends, projecting a medium-term growth rate of
about 4½ percent and inflation of around 5 percent.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on policies to strengthen the policy framework and boost sustainable growth.
They encompassed: the pace of fiscal consolidation and oil revenue savings in the context of the
new fiscal rule; the move to full-fledged IT to anchor inflation expectations and achieve the CBR’s
inflation objectives; financial sector risks and oversight; measures to boost the energy sector; and
supporting structural reforms, particularly to strengthen the business climate.

A. Fiscal Policy: Measured Consolidation, Increase Savings
24.
The authorities should resist pressures for higher government spending in 2013. Given
that Russia’s output gap appears to be at or near zero, additional stimulus would provide at best a
modest and unsustainable increase in growth, but bring adverse consequences such as intensified
inflationary pressures and greater exchange rate volatility. The additional spending implied by
lending NWF funds for PPP infrastructure projects and planned loan guarantees to initiate activity to
be paid out of future budgets should be offset through cuts in lower priority spending or scaled
back to maintain a cyclically neutral fiscal stance this year. More generally, the authorities should
pursue policies consistent with the spirit of the fiscal rule, and resist proposals for circumvention
(Annex I).

25.
More ambitious medium-term fiscal adjustment is needed to generate sufficient
saving of oil revenue and build confidence. Under unchanged policies, staff estimates that the
Reserve Fund will decline to about 2.7 percent of GDP by 2018. The authorities estimate that the
Reserve Fund will reach about 6¼ percent of GDP by that year, with the difference largely
attributable to more optimistic oil price assumptions. Staff urged the authorities to gradually tighten
fiscal policy by an additional 0.4 percent of GDP per year (against the baseline), beginning 2014. This
would rebuild the Reserve Fund to around 7 percent of GDP by 2018—the level that would allow the
authorities to maintain spending consistent with the fiscal rule for two years without resorting to
additional market borrowing, in the event of a sustained drop in oil prices to US$60/barrel. The
authorities should then direct exhaustible oil income to begin rebuilding the NWF. To lock in
savings, these steps should be backed by a strengthening of the fiscal rule—including a lower
benchmark oil price and possibly reduced net borrowing. The authorities should also contain
pressures to circumvent expenditure limits. They should avoid any new loan guarantees to be paid
out of future budgets, and any new spending mandates imposed on regions should be matched
with adequate funding. These actions should also facilitate lower long-term lending rates, by easing
aggregate demand pressures. Without further adjustment, the overall general government deficit
will gradually widen and the Reserve Fund and NWF will gradually erode as a percent of GDP.
26.
Structural fiscal reforms are critical for supporting higher oil savings and enhancing
productive spending. Adjustment should primarily focus on expenditure reductions and improving
the efficiency of spending. The government is facing significant spending pressures that threaten to
eat into oil savings and crowd out investment in infrastructure. Promised public sector wage hikes
and rising pension and health care costs driven by negative demographics threaten to squeeze out
growth-enhancing investment spending. To reconcile competing demands, the government will
need to rebalance its mix of spending and enhance its efficiency. This calls for deeper structural
reforms, including: (i) parametric pension reform

Box 7. Pension Reform in Russia
Pension costs and pension fund shortfalls are expected to rise over the long term as a percent of GDP, and
will put an increasing strain on public expenditures. Staff has advised raising the retirement age and
lengthening the minimum number of years for eligibility. Without such changes, annual public pension
spending is expected to rise by about 3 percent of GDP by 2030.
The authorities have rejected increasing the retirement age in favor of an incentive-based system to
encourage later retirement. They suggested this could be done in the context of a shift to a points-based
pension system, but details will be announced only later this year, followed by public discussion. They have
decided against any changes in social security tax rates for at least the next 2-3 years (the current
contribution is 30 percent of wages up to an income threshold of R0.6 million, above which the tax rate
drops to 10 percent), but may gradually increase the income threshold.
Beginning 2014, the default contribution rate to the fully-funded (Pillar II) pension plan will fall from 6 to
2 percentage points of wages, which could result in increased contributions to the Pillar I (pay-as-you-go)
scheme of up to 0.5 percent of GDP. There are differences of opinion among public and private sector
observers about the eventual shift in contributions (workers can opt to stay in Pillar II), but each ruble
transferred would reduce one-for-one the need for transfers from the federal budget. This ‘space’ under the
budget would likely be filled by other spending, under the fiscal rule. These changes would increase overall
spending, weaken the long-term sustainability of the pension system, and reduce the support for capital
market development from Pillar II-related pension funds.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ Views
27.
The government broadly agreed with staff’s assessment, but did not see scope nor
need for additional fiscal adjustment. They agreed that additional near-term fiscal stimulus most
likely would not be very effective and would bring adverse consequences. However, they viewed
additional infrastructure spending as important for medium-term growth. In this regard, they viewed
PPPs to build infrastructure, backed by lending from the NWF, as important for growth and
confidence—and also viewed such longer term investments as consistent with the NWF mandate.
They agreed on the importance of rebuilding the oil funds, but noted their own projections show a
build-up of the Reserve Fund close to 7 percent by 2018 and viewed the faster pace of fiscal
adjustment and oil savings recommended by staff as politically not possible at this time. The
authorities viewed pension reform as critical to free up space for other spending, but have for now
rejected any increase in the retirement age and instead will focus on incentives to postpone
retirement. They recognized risks of circumvention of the fiscal rule, but would take steps to
minimize such pressures. They argued that greater spending efficiency, combined with gradual
introduction of a property tax over the next five years, will be sufficient to meet medium-term
general government spending commitments without squeezing investment. They intend to support
these efforts with a shift to program budgeting next year and a 2030 fiscal strategy now under
preparation.

B. Monetary Policy: Maintain Stance, Anchor Inflation
28.
The current monetary policy stance is consistent with achieving medium-term inflation
objectives, if the recommended fiscal adjustment proceeds. Staff views the current monetary
policy stance as consistent with bringing inflation down to the CBR’s 5 to 6 percent target range this
year. Despite the slowdown in growth, staff did not see a case for rate cuts—as some senior
government officials have pressed for—as inflation has continued to surprise on the high side
throughout 2013H1, and the output gap is likely close to zero. Moreover, with a still-weak monetary
transmission mechanism, changes in the policy rate will have a limited effect on long-term lending
rates—which are high in real terms for most market segments. Sustainably reducing inflation to
the 2014 target range of 4 to 5 percent will necessitate further policy actions—including a
tightening of monetary policy in the absence of the recommended fiscal adjustment.
29.
Swift adoption of formal IT, and supporting policies, should help anchor inflation
expectations and lower long-term lending rates. Staff urged the authorities to focus on
consolidating the credibility of monetary policy, backed by a modest fiscal tightening to soften
inflationary pressures. Establishing a good track record in the early years of adopting IT will be
paramount for boosting credibility of the policy regime. The envisaged IT framework should be
buttressed through regular inflation expectation surveys, publication of inflation forecasts,
improvements in decision-making and organizational arrangements, and consolidation of the CBR’s
multiple liquidity instruments. Strengthening the transmission mechanism of monetary policy will
require improving the signaling role of the policy rate, including by: (i) deepening the interbank
market and reducing its volatility; and (ii) enhancing the CBR’s capacity to forecast system liquidity

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

and analyze forecasting errors. Staff urged closer coordination between monetary and fiscal
authorities to improve liquidity forecasts. It will also be important to complete the transition to a
fully flexible exchange rate.
30.
The CBR’s new 12-month refinancing facility may contribute to strengthening the
monetary policy transmission mechanism, but should not be used for quantitative easing. The
recently launched facility, combined with Finance Ministry purchases of FX for deposit into oil
savings funds, should help facilitate liquidity management and the functioning of the interbank
market, bringing market rates closer to the CBR’s main policy rate (repo). As far as the new
refinancing instrument is intended to substitute bank funding via the existing repo facility, it may
free up marketable collateral and strengthen monetary transmission. In staff’s view, it should not be
used to expand the total volume of CBR funding support to banks, which would be tantamount to
unwarranted quantitative easing. The CBR should ensure that: (1) eligible collateral is well-specified
and appropriately discounted for risk; (2) recipient banks have adequate risk and liquidity
management practices in place; and (3) there are no underlying solvency concerns with banks
utilizing the facility.
31.
The CBR should not change its inflation targets for 2014-15, but a point target with
wider bands is justified. Staff cautioned that a weakening of already announced targets —such as
that made last year for 2012/13—would be detrimental to credibility. However, the wider band (than
the current 1 pp) proposed by the CBR would be appropriate in Russia due to still high inflation
volatility, and the switch to a point target could facilitate communication. It will be important that
the inflation targets announced for the 2016 to 2018 period do not exceed 4.5 percent, the center of
the target band already announced for 2014 and 2015. The medium-term monetary policy
guidelines should also clarify whether the inflation target for 2016 to 2018 will be another step in a
disinflation path leading subsequently to a lower long-run target or whether it will be the long-run
target itself.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities shared staff’s concerns about inflation pressures and confirmed their
commitment to formally adopt IT by end-2014. They specifically pointed to the potential
negative impact on economic agents’ expectations should inflation remain above the target range
for a prolonged period of time. However, the CBR maintained that the observed pace of inflation
was mainly explained by food prices and regulated tariffs. It viewed the current monetary policy
stance, combined with lower planned utility price hikes and the expected absence of adverse food
prices shocks, as sufficient to bring the rate of inflation within the targeted range by
September 2013 and later to within the 2014 target range. The authorities expect that this trajectory
will provide scope for lower policy rates, although they noted that any policy rate decision will have
to take into account other relevant indicators such as capacity utilization, unemployment, and credit
growth. Regarding the CBR’s announced plan to move from an inflation target range to a point
target with a wider tolerance band, some officials expressed concerns about potential adverse
effects of a wider band on inflation expectations. Other officials argued that a target inflation

21

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

corridor of one percentage point was too narrow for Russia given its volatile headline inflation—with
a high share of food and utility tariffs in the CPI basket—and susceptibility to real shocks. They
stressed that frequently missing a narrow inflation corridor would be more damaging than switching
to a point target with a wider tolerance band. The authorities reiterated their commitment to
completing preparations for and adopting formal IT by end-2014, including greater exchange rate
flexibility. The CBR stated that the main goal of the new one-year facility is to improve liquidity
management and the functioning of the interbank market, and to strengthen the transmission
mechanism.

C. Financial Sector: Contain Risks, Strengthen Intermediation
33.
Additional measures may be needed
to limit vulnerabilities from rapid retail
credit growth. Credit growth has reduced
capital and liquidity cushions; the quality of the
retail loan portfolio is worsening; and the debt
burden is increasing and high by international
comparison. In this context, the CBR’s recent
tightening of capitalization and provisioning
requirements is welcome. Lending growth
should be closely monitored, and further action
taken as needed.

34.
The recently adopted amendments to the Banking Law are welcome, and remaining
FSAP recommendations should be adopted swiftly. The latter includes formally establishing the
leading role of the CBR in macro prudential policy, introducing a unified administration regime for
all banks, and restricting open bank assistance by the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) to systemic
situations. In addition, staff recommended maintaining and enhancing the independence of the CBR,
including through empowering it to issue regulations on nonbanks; and legislation facilitating the
collection and dissemination of borrower information by credit bureaus. Staff also suggested
considering further increasing risk weights and provisions for unsecured lending as needed and
formally introducing ceilings on debt-service-to-income ratios for household lending and
loan-to-value ratios for housing and car loans to limit household debt burdens.
35.
Basel III should be adopted without delay, while IRB should only be implemented only
when both banks and supervisors are ready. The mission supported plans to introduce new
capital requirements exceeding Basel III minimum requirements (e.g., 5.5 percent core capital vs.
4.5 percent under Basel III), given: (i) GDP volatility; (ii) weak creditor rights; and (iii) difficulties in
identifying nonperforming assets and provisioning practices. Staff urged the CBR to resist calls to
advance implementation of the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach before appropriate
supervisory and bank-level internal procedures and controls are in place—as this could result in an
undue reduction of risk-weighted assets and undermine the solvency buffers and resilience of the
banking sector to shocks. Staff recommended: (1) implementing the IRB framework with at least a

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

three year implementation period, as advised under the Basel framework, and introduce floors under
the new capital requirement; and (2) raising minimum nominal capital requirements.
36.
State ownership in banks should be gradually reduced, and banking sector
competition, efficiency, and transparency enhanced. In particular, the authorities should


Gradually divest from dominant banks. The CBR’s combined role as supervisor, regulator, and
main shareholder of Russia’s largest bank (Sberbank) generates implicit costs in terms of system
efficiency and financial sector development. Further divestiture of Sberbank shares is consistent
with the government’s Strategy for Development of the Banking Sector until 2015.



Strengthen corporate governance. Bolstering corporate governance in government-owned
financial institutions could help reduce losses such as those announced earlier this year by the
state-owned development corporation that over 75 percent of its loans for Sochi
Olympics-related projects (about 0.3 percent of GDP) are unlikely to be repaid. Specific steps
could include increasing the number of independent directors.



Promote bank consolidation. This would reduce the burden on supervisory staff and help
diversify and strengthen bank balance sheets; larger banks would also be able to better diversify
geographically and across sectors. In this respect, staff supports the authorities’ plans to raise
minimum capital requirements and tighten related-lending and large-exposure limits.



Strengthen bank competition. Increased banking competition will help enhance banking
sector efficiency, lower lending rates, and improve the efficiency of investment allocation and
funding. Competition could be fostered by reducing banking sector fragmentation through
consolidation and reduced public bank ownership; greater pricing transparency and consumer
protection; and further strengthening the role of credit bureaus and collateral registries to
reduce information asymmetries.



Strengthen transparency. Implementation of anti-money laundering (AML) and fit and proper
measures, along with strengthened financial sector supervision, should help prevent “pocket
banks” from serving as shadow treasury departments to affiliated corporate clients and as
vehicles for capital outflows, including via transfer pricing manipulation.

Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities saw no tangible systemic financial sector risks at present. However, they
broadly shared staff’s concerns about: (1) diminished capital adequacy ratios, including in
connection with the implementation of new capital standards in the context of Basel III; and (2) rapid
consumer lending growth. They also pointed to systemic liquidity risks, with the demand for CBR
refinancing increasing substantially over the past two years. The CBR indicated that its own stress
tests suggest that the banking sector is stable and resilient to a variety of potential shocks—

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

although capitalization in banks representing one-third of banking system assets would drop below
regulatory requirements.2 The authorities were confident that capital needs related to the
implementation of Basel III were not excessive, in line with the view of market analysts that banks
would be able to mobilize the bulk of new capital through retained profits. The authorities assume
that only a limited number of banks will start using the IRB approach to assess credit risk (8 ‘pilot’
banks), and they concurred with staff that floors under capital should be introduced as established
by the Basel framework. They noted that while CBR bank funding was still rising in nominal terms, it
had stabilized in percent of banking system assets. The authorities noted that strengthened
supervisory powers would help them to more fully identify and address possible operational risks
and governance weaknesses in small-to-mid-sized domestic private banks. Furthermore, they were
confident that recently adopted prudential measures would curb risks from rapid unsecured
consumer lending growth, and did not yet see systemic risks from rising household leverage. Yet,
the authorities would consider additional measures such as ceilings on loan-to-value and
debt-service-to-income ratios if necessary.
38.
The authorities acknowledged potential conflicts of interest related to CBR ownership
of Sberbank, but noted important benefits. While aware of the potential distortions in
competition and the need to eventually level the playing field for all banks, they emphasized
Sberbank’s social functions as well as positive externalities from Sberbank’s high ratings for overall
banking system stability. The authorities maintained that Sberbank is well managed, has good
corporate governance structures, and has a social function with its vast network of branches in
remote areas; and assured that administrative pressures on bank management or operations were
absent. They noted that any near-term divestment or break-up of Sberbank could lead to rating
downgrades and higher lending rates. They recognized the need to address the causes of
fragmentation in Russia’s banking system. In this connection, they agreed that improving corporate
governance, access to information, creditor rights, and competition would strengthen the financial
sector’s efficiency and contribution to growth.

D. Structural Policies: Better Business Climate, Comparative Advantages
39.
Structural reforms are key for unleashing Russia’s growth potential. Russia’s weak
business climate remains a key obstacle to investment, diversification, and growth. Staff recognized
that improving the investment climate is a government priority and that some progress has been
made—for example regarding institutions for dispute resolutions (ombudsman) and tax
administration. However, weaknesses remain largely unaddressed in other key areas, including
inadequate infrastructure (transportation and electricity), constraints on the availability of financing,
and a shortage of skilled labor. Recent improvements in the business environment have focused
2

The CBR’s macro stress-testing model suggests that 308 credit institutions (accounting for 1/3 of banking system
assets) may have a capital deficit in a ‘severe’ scenario, amounting to rubles 522bn. The average capital adequacy
ratio of the banking sector would fall to 10.6 percent. The ‘severe’ scenario envisages a real GDP contraction of
5 percent and a fall in oil prices to US60/barrel. This compares to an 8 percent of GDP contraction and US$62/barrel
oil price in 2009.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

mostly on large enterprises, with little progress made regarding SMEs. Further deregulation should
address customs inefficiencies and other red tape—two areas often cited in business surveys. More
decisive implementation of corporate governance reforms and of government privatization plans for
SOEs and state-owned banks is needed to reduce the government footprint in the economy. To
improve transparency, the corporate governance code should be updated, including financial
disclosures and reporting on ultimate owners, and protection of intellectual property rights should
be strengthened.
40.
Deeper global integration, notably through WTO entry, the G20 presidency, and steps
towards OECD accession, present an opportunity to improve the efficiency of the economy.
Reversal of protectionist trade and investment measures (related, among others, to meat and car
imports) and broader deregulation will promote competition, reduce rent-seeking behavior,
strengthen good corporate practices, facilitate entry of foreign companies, and improve
productivity. Large gains could derive from cheaper inputs to businesses because of FDI in the
business service sector and lower customs duties, though the benefits for Russian export companies
is expected to be initially more limited. Domestic import-substitution sectors could suffer initially
because of stronger competition. In this regard, measures to improve cross-regional labor mobility
and reallocation are needed, including better urban infrastructure and supply of housing. Better
targeted social safety nets would also help. The OECD membership bid is bringing commitments in a
range of important areas such as competition policy and governance that are generally consistent
with the authorities’ priorities. Fighting corruption is one of the top priorities for Russia’s G20
presidency, and legal changes recently adopted should contribute to enhancing the business
environment if implemented adequately and in an evenhanded manner.
41.
Russia’s comparative advantages are not sufficiently exploited. Despite Russia’s obvious
further potential for growth in the energy sector, investment has lagged, weakened by a
revenue-based taxation scheme that inhibits more-difficult-to-reach energy reserves. Tax regime
changes, together with strengthened property rights and distribution access, are needed to attract
foreign technical expertise and nimble domestic players. Without such reforms, oil production will
decline. However, diversification is also important. The government has attempted to promote high
technology through the Moscow-based Skolkovo business park, but outcomes have been modest
so far. Some past efforts at regional diversification have generated significant inefficiencies in the
use of capital and labor that need to be gradually unwound.3


In the hydrocarbon sector, staff recommended moving from revenue-based to
profit-based tax instruments. A profit-based and stable tax regime would provide incentives
to tap higher-cost resources, and would extend the economic life of nearly depleted fields. Firms
will also need stronger property right guarantees and access to midstream distribution chains.

See “Bear Traps on Russia’s Road to Modernization” by Clifford Gaddy and Barry Ickes (Brookings Institution, 2013).



Staff urged the authorities to facilitate diversification and reduce the government’s
footprint in the economy. Specific actions should include, for example, gradual divestment
from the banking sector and stronger implementation of the government’s privatization
agenda—which could also free up labor resources for the private sector and allow higher
productivity growth. The government should carefully consider the cost-benefit impact of
regional development initiatives, and adopt measures, such as pension reform, to enhance the
labor force participation rate.4

Authorities’ Views
42.
The authorities generally agreed on the importance of the business climate reforms.
They shared staff’s concerns about infrastructure bottlenecks and ongoing difficulties in assessing
net benefits of large projects, and confirmed plans to step up public investment, including via more
private sector participation (e.g., through PPPs). The authorities concurred with the need to reform
oil taxation to improve incentives for the development of higher-risk Greenfield projects and
investments to improve extraction rates at maturing fields. They expressed concerns about some
aspects of WTO commitments, stressing protective measures for domestic import-substitution
sectors as one possible growth enhancing measure. The authorities acknowledged the slowdown in
privatization, but explained this was designed to garner better returns by attracting and absorbing
new capital and technologies before selling larger shares. They emphasized that the primary goal of
the privatization agenda remains a reduction in the presence of government in the economy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
While growth has slowed, the economy appears to be operating at or near full
capacity and inflation remains high. Monetary and fiscal stimuli would at best provide a modest
and unsustainable boost to growth while bringing adverse consequences. Structural reforms are
necessary to increase potential output growth.
44.
The fiscal stance in 2013 is appropriate but a more ambitious medium-term fiscal
adjustment is needed to generate sufficient saving of oil revenues. The authorities should
tighten the fiscal rule to rebuild fiscal buffers and save more of the exhaustible oil income.
Adjustment should focus on expenditure reductions and improving the mix and efficiency of
spending. Pension reform, centered on increasing the retirement age, and improvements in the
efficiency of publicly-owned enterprises, are key components of fiscal consolidation. The authorities
should resist efforts to increase spending outside the confines of the federal fiscal rule. Further
strengthening budgetary institutions will support these goals.

4

The December 2012 EBRD report on “Diversifying Russia” emphasizes benefits of exploiting regional diversity.
Economic diversification for growth was also highlighted in a study by Hausmann and Hidalgo on “complexity
economics”. They found Russia to be on the low end of economic diversification (and getting worse) relative to peers,
in turn implying the lowest potential per capita growth rate (of only 2.6 percent) among BRICS.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

45.
Monetary policy should remain geared towards achieving inflation objectives.
With 2013 inflation projections close to the CBR target range and uncertainty about the near-term
economic outlook, the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. But sustainably reducing
inflation to the lower 2014 target range calls for a tightening bias. Establishing operational
credibility of the monetary policy framework in the context of the move towards formal IT will be
critical to anchor inflation expectations. Increased exchange rate flexibility has served Russia well, as
the exchange rate is becoming an increasingly effective shock absorber. Further reductions in
foreign exchange market interventions should facilitate the planned transition to a floating
exchange rate regime by 2015.
46.
Recent steps to improve the supervisory framework are welcome. Financial stability risks
are still moderate but rising. The authorities should consider introducing additional prudential
measures should the measures already implemented fail to moderate rapid retail credit growth. Any
push towards earlier adoption of the IRB approach should be resisted. Improving corporate
governance, access to information, creditor rights, and competition will strengthen the financial
sector’s efficiency and contribution to growth. Consolidation of Russia’s fragmented banking system,
as well as tightened large exposure and related party lending limits should enhance banking sector
stability. Further divestiture of state-owned banks should be pursued to enhance competitiveness in
the financial sector.
47.
Ambitious economic policy reforms are necessary to realize the Russian economy's
medium-term potential and reduce its vulnerabilities. The growth model of the pre-crisis years,
based on increasing oil prices, rising use of spare capacity, and reducing the large technology gap, is
not replicable. Growth in the next decade will need to rely on more efficient use of resources and
generating investment.
48.
Raising potential growth will require further supply-side structural measures.
Corporate governance should be strengthened to increase transparency and improve the
investment climate. Deregulation should continue, including steps to address inefficiencies at
customs and other “red tape.” The government’s goal to reduce its footprint in the economy
through privatization is welcome; swift and transparent implementation of plans in this area is of the
essence. Following the WTO accession, the government should resist the pressure to use
protectionist measures. The OECD accession process provides an appropriate venue for furthering
and broadening the reform process. Energy tax regime changes, together with strengthened
property rights and distribution access, are needed to attract foreign technical expertise and nimble
domestic players in the energy sector. Improvement in the efficiency of publicly-owned companies
is also necessary and should help boost productivity.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Sources: Russian authorities; and IMF staff projections.
1/ Assumptions for the three scenarios are as follows:
▪ Baseline scenario assumes a continuation of current policies. Fiscal policy will implement the 2013-15 medium-term budget minimum
expenditure commitments and otherwise follow the new oil price-based fiscal rule (without the tightening recommended by staff). Monetary
policy will allow greater exchange-rate flexibility but inflation will remain above the mid-point of the authorities' target range (4 to 5
percent). There will be no major additional changes in banking sector policies. Policy frameworks will remain largely unreformed.
▪ Adverse scenario assumes a permanent external shock, with oil prices declining to $60 per barrel in 2014 and staying there in nominal
terms for the remainder of the forecast horizon. In 2014-15, fiscal policy will implement expenditure at levels consistent with the oil pricebased fiscal rule, subject to minimum expenditure commitments under the 2013-15 medium-term budget, while monetary policy becomes
more accommodative. In the outer years, the authorities will initiate a smoother fiscal adjustment path than that implied under the fiscal
rule, while monetary policy remains neutral. As in the baseline, no progress is made regarding structural reforms and the strengthening of
policy frameworks. In 2014, when oil prices drop to $60 per barrel, the ruble depreciates significantly, but reserves are used to prevent an
overshooting of the exchange rate.
▪ Reform scenario assumes full implementation of reforms recommended by the staff. Monetary policy will focus on bringing inflation
down to 3 percent over the medium term, amid a fully flexible exchange rate. Fiscal policy will implement a more ambitious and credible
consolidation with the non-oil deficit of the federal government declining to 4.9 percent of GDP by 2018. The supervisory framework will be
strengthened along the lines recommended by the 2011 FSAP. Fundamental structural reforms are put in place to improve the business
climate and competitiveness, and policy frameworks will be strengthened in line with IMF staff recommendations.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Annex I. Assessment of Russia’s New Fiscal Rule
Summary. Russia’s new fiscal rule is a welcome development that sets out a clear
framework for setting expenditure levels, reducing volatility of spending tied to oil price
movements, and the conditions under which oil revenues are saved or spent. Under
current parameters, however, the rule does not generate sufficient savings into oil funds.
There are also several other potential shortcomings that the authorities should address
or guard against.

Background
A new fiscal rule went into effect this year that ex ante caps federal government expenditures at the
ex ante projection of the sum of non-oil revenues, oil and gas (“oil”) revenues calculated at a
benchmark oil price, and net financing of one percent of GDP. The benchmark price is a backward
looking ten-year (initially five-year) average of Urals oil prices (US$/barrel)—a proxy for the longer
term price of oil. For 2013, the benchmark price reflects the five-year (2008-2012) backward looking
average of Ural oil prices, equivalent to US$91/barrel (Table A1).
In principle, when current oil prices are above the benchmark price, the resulting oil savings are
deposited in the oil Reserve Fund, which serves as a macroeconomic stabilization fund. Once the
Reserve Fund reaches seven percent of GDP, 50 percent of any additional oil-related savings are to
be allocated to the National Wealth Fund (NWF)—an intergenerational oil savings fund intended to
support the pension system—and the other 50 percent for infrastructure projects or other projects of
national importance. When current oil prices are below the benchmark price, the Reserve Fund would
be tapped to help maintain expenditures and finance the deficit. To protect against excessive deficits
in the event of a prolonged oil price decline, the benchmark oil price calculation changes when
actual oil prices remain below the benchmark price for the three previous years. In such case, the
benchmark price is reset equal to the 3-year backward-looking average.
At the time of its approval, the authorities indicated that the new rule would be easier to
communicate than the nonoil deficit rule and would allow for a more gradual transition to a stronger
fiscal position. This rule replaced an existing (but suspended since the global financial crisis)
budgetary rule targeting a nonoil deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP.

Assessment
The new rule is a positive step forward. It squarely addresses oil price/revenue-driven volatility in
government spending by delinking the budget from short-term oil price fluctuations. It also provides
a mechanism for saving and drawing down oil savings as oil prices fluctuate. However, there are a
number of important shortcomings.


Insufficient oil savings. The rule generates insufficient savings of oil revenues to rebuild buffers,
save receipts from exhaustible resources, or facilitate growth of the nonoil sector. Under baseline

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

projections, the Reserve Fund will remain below the authorities’ targeted level of 7 percent of
GDP—too low to adequately insulate against a large drop in oil prices. Intergenerational savings
are projected to gradually erode as a percent of GDP. Under the rule, there is little possibility of
higher intergenerational savings unless oil prices continue to rise at pace well in excess of
nominal GDP. However, both the authorities and staff project a gradual fall in oil revenues as
a percent of GDP, though at different paces. The authorities’ projections show the Reserve Fund
would be replenished by 2019, and the NWF would then gradually begin to rise, based on a
significantly higher projected oil price path (relative to staff projections).


Operation of the rule is hindered by minimum expenditure commitments under the medium-term
budget rule. The new rule will not be fully binding until 2016, as Russia’s medium-term budget
law sets minimum expenditure commitments on a rolling three-year basis (the current budget
covers 2013-15). Expenditures in the first year under each three-year budget must be fully
honored, and expenditures in the second and third year cannot be lowered by more than 0.5 and
0.8 percent of GDP, respectively. Under current budget parameters and staff estimates, federal
government expenditures will remain above the level implied by the fiscal rule through 2015.
This inconsistency between the fiscal rule and the medium-term budget law could override
implied expenditure caps in 2016 and beyond as well, depending on the oil price path.



Diversion of the flow of annual oil savings. The amount to be deposited or withdrawn from the
Reserve Fund is prescribed ex ante in the annual Budget Law. Intuitively, this would be equal to
the oil savings (difference in oil revenue calculated at actual and benchmark prices). But even if
oil prices evolve as expected, deposits made into the Reserve Fund can be higher (e.g., financed
by issuing more debt) or lower (by utilizing oil savings to cover the net borrowing of one percent
of GDP under the expenditure rule). ‘Savings’ can also be diverted to cover shortfalls in
privatization or non-oil revenue, should the government elect to do so. For example, the
government decided in April 2013 to cover expected privatization shortfalls by reducing the
amounts deposited into the Reserve Fund.



Non-oil shocks. The mechanism has a limited ability to address non-oil shocks. The basic
structure of the rule is not designed to respond to non-oil shocks, but recent amendments
permit the government to divert flow oil savings to cover non-oil revenue shortfalls (any
diversion would be limited to the amount of oil savings generated in the same year; i.e., the
“principal’ of the Reserve Fund cannot be tapped for this purpose).



Expenditure limits under the rule can be circumvented through various on- or off-budget
mechanisms.


52

Off-budget loan guarantees. Net government loan guarantees are projected to be increased
by up to one percent of GDP this year, with additional increases planned for 2014-5. A
portion of these are for non-revenue generating spending that will be paid for out of future
budgets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION



Pension changes. The planned diversion of contributions from Pillar II to Pillar I reduces the
required amounts from the budget to support the Pillar I system. Under the fiscal rule, this
‘space’ is taken by other expenditures while the future payment obligations under the Pillar I
PAYG pension system rise (weakening the system’s long run viability).



Macroeconomic assumptions. The rule is susceptible to manipulation, for example through
overly optimistic non-oil revenue projections or exchange rate assumptions in the context of
budget planning. Projected GDP is a key factor that drives both the projected ruble level of
non-oil revenues and net financing. The projected exchange rate is also a key element. A
more depreciated rate raises the ruble-denominated projection of oil revenues at the
benchmark price, which raises the expenditure envelope. It also increases nominal GDP and
thus non-oil revenue projections. The exchange rate and nominal GDP are set by the Ministry
of Economic Development. In recent years, the authorities’ projections do not appear to be
systematically biased.



Shifting unfunded spending obligations to regions. A number of large regions have access to
market financing and could finance higher deficits for some time.

Recommendations
It is important for credibility that the authorities maintain the spirit of the rule. They need to
establish, through actions, that this rule will be more binding and successful than the last one.

This strategy would be consistent with past
recommendations to target a non-oil deficit below 5 percent of GDP.



Protect savings. The authorities should remove the option to divert oil savings to cover shortfalls
in privatization or non-oil revenue.



Contain other spending pressures. The authorities should contain pressures to circumvent
expenditure limits. For example, planned loan guarantees to be paid out of future budgets
should be scaled back or spread out, They should avoid any new loan guarantees of this type
(such spending should be brought on budget) and any new spending mandates imposed on
regions should be matched with adequate funding.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION



Sound forecasts. Maintain independent (realistic) forecasts for key macroeconomic parameters,
especially the exchange rate and nominal GDP, used in setting the budget.



Revisit commitments. Remove minimum expenditure commitments in medium-term budgets
(this could be accompanied by contingent spending).



NWF contributions. Eliminate the 50/50 distribution rule in favor of framework that takes into
consideration infrastructure needs and likely net returns, Dutch Disease considerations, and
availability of funding from budget expenditure reforms.

Box A1. How the Oil Savings are Invested and Managed
The two oil savings funds are owned by the government and controlled by the Finance Ministry,
which in turn has the authority to designate the CBR as ‘operational manager’. Deposits have been
made in rubles, generally on an annual basis, by the Finance Ministry into CBR-managed funds,
which are then held largely as foreign exchange deposits. The Finance Ministry recently
announced plans to begin purchasing, later in 2013, foreign exchange in the market and then
deposit these FX funds (rather than ruble funds) into the oil savings funds at the CBR. However,
consistent with current practice, all FX reserves are expected to remain under CBR ownership (with
interest on oil fund-related FX deposits linked to a basket of FX assets). The Funds’ management
guidelines are published, as are monthly data on the balances in each fund. The accumulation,
expenditure, and management of the funds are reviewed quarterly by the Accounts Chamber and
reported to parliament.


The Reserve Fund is held in FX-denominated deposits at the CBR. The FX deposits are linked
to (or can be directly invested in) low-yield highly rated short-term foreign exchange
securities, consistent with the purpose of the (macroeconomic stabilization) Fund. The
currency allocation is currently set at: U.S. dollars (45 percent), euro (45 percent), GB pounds
(10 percent). For more information, see: http://www1.minfin.ru/en/reservefund/



The National Wealth Fund. The NWF is dedicated to support the pension system of the
Russian Federation to guarantee long-term sound functioning of the system. The maximum
amount of NWF assets that can be invested in foreign currency is 100 percent. FX deposits
are linked to (or can be directly invested in) relatively riskier, higher return instruments. The
currency composition of these deposits is currently set at U.S. dollars (45 percent), euro
(45 percent), and GB pounds (10 percent). Up to 40 percent of NWF assets can be invested
in Russian rubles. Currently, NWF holds about 25 percent of its assets (475bn in rubles, and
6.3 billion in U.S. dollars) in medium and long-term deposits at VEB. VEB uses these funds
for subordinated loans to Russian banks (R355bn), loans to SMEs (R30bn), loans to the
Agency for Housing Mortgage Lending (R40bn) and other purposes. For more information
see: http://www1.minfin.ru/en/nationalwealthfund/.

Risk

Overall Level of Concern

Expected Impact if Materialized

1. Sharp oil
price decline

2. Acceleration
of capital
outflows

3. Bank distress

4. Cyprus

Low
A severe international
slowdown (or spillovers
from the shale oil/gas
revolution that could
boost global growth
but lower oil prices)
could lead to a sharp
decline in the price of
energy.
Medium
A spike in global risk
aversion, renewed
domestic political and
social tensions, or
absence of reforms
could cause a further
intensification.
Medium
Intensified international
banking problems
could trigger a further
global liquidity squeeze.

High
Given Russia's dependence on
energy exports, the economy
would enter into recession.
However, exchange rate flexibility
and large international reserves
provide some cushion.

Medium
Cyprus is the main
source of FDI and a
major offshore financial
center for Russia.

Low
Spillovers from Cyprus have been
small, with lost deposits a small
fraction of Russia’s own banking
system and economy. But Cypriot
capital controls could complicate
financial flows involving Russiancontrolled entities via Cyprus.

Medium
The macro framework is more
robust than in 2008. Russia has
experienced capital outflows for
many years without major
problems. Still, outflows would be
a drag on investment and a sign
of worsening business climate.
Low
Foreign funding use is relatively
small. Moreover, given that most
systemically important banks are
publicly-owned, a liquidity crisis
would have limited impact.

Recommended Policy
Response
Rebuild fiscal buffers and
oil savings by tightening
fiscal rule. Structural
reforms to enhance
economic efficiency and
diversification.

Enhance confidence and
resilience by
strengthening core
institutions and policy
frameworks and improve
the investment climate.

Provide foreign exchange
liquidity as needed.
Implement FSAP
recommendations. Take
prudential measures to
reduce financial stability
risks.
The CBR, with support of
the government, should
assess risk factors and
possible solutions. Use
FATF chairmanship to
strengthen the AML
regime.

1/ The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report (which is the scenario
most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of risks and overall
level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Exchange Arrangements: The de jure arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely, a
controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of a bi-currency basket is used as
the operating benchmark for transactions on the domestic foreign exchange market. The basket is
currently composed of €0.45 and US$0.55. The value of the bi-currency basket is determined under
the influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).
Interventions take place both in interbank currency exchanges and on the over-the-counter
interbank market to limit daily fluctuations. The CBR does not set any quantitative limits on the
exchange rate level of the national currency, but its exchange rate policy aims at keeping short-term
fluctuations within an acceptable range, as determined by a floating operating band. Interventions
take place both at the limits of the floating operating band and within it. The CBR distinguishes two
types of intervention. “Planned” interventions are daily purchases of an amount set at the start of
the month according to a formula that is nonpublic but linked to the CBR's estimate of the current
account and expected transfers to the Reserve Fund. “Unplanned” interventions are triggered once
the exchange rate crosses limits set by a nonintervention corridor, with intervention amounts and
intervals established in advance. The limits of the operating bands itself shift by 5 kopecks once a
predetermined cumulative volume of (unplanned) interventions has been reached. Effective October
13, 2010, the CBR eliminated the fixed trading band of Rub 26-41 against the bi-currency basket, in
force since January 2009. Since 2010, the CBR has widened the moving intervention band from 3 to
7 rubles in four installments, and reduced the volume of cumulative interventions triggering a
5 kopeck shift in the operational band from originally $700 million to now $450 million. The range of
permissible fluctuations may be revised further in response to changes in macroeconomic indicators.
The CBR aims at further scaling down its direct interventions and creating conditions for the
transition to a floating exchange rate regime by 2015. After the transition to a floating exchange
rate regime, the CBR intends to abandon exchange rate-based operational indicators of its exchange
rate policy. Owing to the continued control of the CBR over the exchange rate determination, the de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The Russian
Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of
Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last
consultation was concluded on July 27, 2012.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs: Russia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program
during 2002, and the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in May 2003, at the time of the 2003
Article IV discussion (IMF Country Report No. 03/147). An FSAP update took place in the fall of 2007,
and the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in August 2008, at the time of the 2008 Article IV
discussion. An FSAP financial stability assessment took place during April 2011, and the FSSA report
was discussed by the Board in September 2011, at the time of 2011 Article IV Consultation.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The Fund Russia team led by Mr. Spilimbergo (mission chief) spoke with the World Bank
Russia economic policy team led by Mr. Rutkowski (Country Director) on June 17, 2013 to
discuss and reconfirm macro-critical structural reforms and to coordinate the two teams’ work for the
period July 2013–September 2014.
The teams agreed that Russia’s key challenges are to maintain macroeconomic stability and to
improve growth prospects. To meet these challenges, stronger core institutions and a better
regulatory, judicial and administrative environment are needed. This will support private-sector
investment and the creation of more and better jobs.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified five reform areas as macro-critical:


Strengthening the fiscal framework: Key elements of reform include: (i) strengthening the
new fiscal rule to rebuild fiscal buffers and save more of the exhaustible oil income; (ii) avoid
off-budget or other mechanisms for increasing spending outside the federal fiscal rule;
(iii) strengthen fiscal risk assessment and transparency; and (iv) avoid excessive use of
supplemental budgets. These reforms are macro-critical as they will help to reduce fiscal (and
economic) vulnerabilities, and increase the credibility of fiscal policy, which would support
higher growth.



Public expenditure reforms: Key elements of reform include: (i) promoting aggregate fiscal
discipline and strengthening public expenditure efficiency and management;
(ii) strengthening capital budgeting in the road and rail sectors; and (iii) improving the
efficiency of public employment. These reforms are macro-critical as they will help to identify
savings to support fiscal consolidation and reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.



Reforming the pension system: Key objectives of reform include managing long-run fiscal
costs and providing reasonable pension benefits to all pensioners current and future. These
reforms are macro-critical as they will help to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities as well as to tackle
problems related to shadow employment. Reforms are needed to improve the transparency
of the pension system (e.g. the financing of pensions and increased public awareness about
pension products and instruments, etc).



Strengthening the monetary policy framework: Key elements of reform include (i) further
increasing exchange rate flexibility; (ii) streamlining the set of monetary policy instruments;
(iii) establishing a more effective policy rate; (iv) allowing full averaging of reserve
requirements; and (v) further improving policy transparency and communication; and
(vi) completing other steps necessary to adopt inflation targeting by end-2014. These

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

reforms are macro-critical as they will help to improve the effectiveness of the monetary
policy efforts to control inflation, which is key for macroeconomic stability and growth.


Financial sector stability assessment and financial sector development: The banking
sector is stable but regulatory and supervisory deficiencies need to be addressed, specifically:
(i) prompt adoption of pending legislation on consolidated supervision and connected
lending; (ii) promote banking sector consolidation by raising minimum capital requirements
and tightening large-exposure limits; (iii) granting an appropriate degree of supervisory
discretion to the CBR; (iv) closer supervision of systemically important banks to contain moral
hazard and improve systemic risk monitoring, (v) improve the functioning of credit bureaus
and collateral registries to reduce information asymmetries and improve SME access to
financing; and (vi) reduce public ownership in the banking sector. These reforms are
macro-critical as financial sector stability is key for effective intermediation of savings to
promote investment and growth.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:


Strengthening the fiscal framework: The Fund will discuss further reform options with the
authorities during staff technical and Article IV consultations. The Fund expects to continue
its dialogue with the authorities on the best ways to analyze, manage, and disclose
contingent liabilities and fiscal risks, drawing on international best practice in these areas, in
the context of a fiscal transparency assessment, as well as provide (in coordination with the
Bank as needed) technical support on the proposed shift to program budgeting. The Bank is
preparing a new lending project for FY14 to strengthen the fiscal regime to encourage
business investment, streamline the intergovernmental fiscal system and increase oversight
of financial risks through policy advice and capacity building in the Ministry of Finance and
the Federal Tax Service. The Bank is also monitoring fiscal developments, reforms and
policies as part of its regular Russian Economic Reports covering macroeconomic and
structural issues. In addition, the Bank is providing technical assistance on public finance
reforms, including tax policy and administration, inter-budgetary relations, program
budgeting and public expenditure efficiency.



Public expenditure reforms: The Fund will discuss government plans for strengthening
public efficiency in the context of staff technical and Article IV consultations. The Bank has
elaborated reform options in its Public Expenditure Review, which were discussed with the
authorities and published in June 2011. The Bank will further explore cooperation with the
authorities in the areas of improving the business environment and public administration
reform, including in the regions.



Reforming the pension system: The World Bank is actively engaged in the dialogue with
the Ministry of Labor and the Pension Fund on pension reforms. The World Bank is involved
in activities of the intergovernmental working group on nonstate pension funds under the
Ministry of Finance, which supports the preparation of several legislative initiatives to

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

improve nonstate pension funds, supervision and operations. It supports policies related to
balancing sources of pensions from pay-as-you-go and other funded components. The Bank
is also providing pension projections and a discussion of pension system reform options as
part of analytical work on the growth and fiscal impact of aging. The Fund will continue to
consult with the authorities and the Bank regarding progress and the need for additional
technical support and analysis in this area.


Strengthening the monetary policy framework: The Fund has elaborated reform options
and discussed them with the authorities during the 2013 Article IV consultation. Envisaged
follow-up work includes: (i) examining the optimal width of the policy rate corridor;
(ii) coordination between monetary policy and government operations that affect liquidity
conditions; (iii) foreign exchange intervention policy; and (iv) effective communications
policies.



Financial sector stability assessment and financial sector development: The Fund
conducted a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update in March/April 2011 and
discussed reform options with the authorities, along with participation of Bank staff. An IMF
expert at the CBR (resident advisor) is helping the authorities adopt the IRB of Basel II
(internal-ratings based approach for measuring credit risks) and Basel III frameworks and
implement the recommendations of the FSAP Update. The Bank has appointed a new private
sector/financial sector coordinator for Russia, who is stationed in Moscow to coordinate the
work on longer-term developmental issues in the private/financial sector. The Bank board
approved a Microfinance development project which is currently pending signature. The
Bank is also preparing a new lending project to (a) achieve an orderly financial market
expansion and development of domestic capital markets to better serve the needs for
corporate finance, (b) enhance financial market stability through a modernized state-of-theart regulatory framework and the implementation of robust supervisory and enforcement
mechanisms, and (c) reach global best practice standards in the market infrastructure and
regulation, in order to achieve a broader international reach as a center of financing.
However, with the recent changes in the supervisory architecture and recent decision to
create a Mega-Regulator under the Central Bank of Russia, which will absorb the functions of
the FSFM, the project is stalled and may need to be restructured or transformed depending
on the needs of the CBR.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the macro-critical reform areas
under the Bank’s purview and the Bank will provide an assessment of the 2014–16
medium-term budget in the 30th RER edition.



The Bank team requested that the Fund share on a regular basis with the Bank and invite, as
needed, the Bank’s comments on policy notes, draft staff reports, and other relevant
materials; and that Bank staff be invited to attend policy meetings, as has already been the

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in the context of
emerging data demands for assessing external vulnerabilities, the scope for further data
improvements exists.
Russia is an SDDS subscriber, has a range of statistical dissemination formats, and reports data
for the Fund’s statistical publications. These sources inform surveillance.
National Accounts: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there have been concerns
about the reliability and consistency of quarterly GDP estimates among a wide range of users,
including Fund staff. Rebasing GDP estimates to a recent year would close the gap between GDP
estimate and its components. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) started a national
account development plan for 2011–17, which will expedite compilation of quarterly GDP
estimates consistent with the annual GDP estimates.
Following the introduction of methodological changes in the compilation of important indicators,
backward revisions of the series were delayed impairing timely economic analysis. However, a
historical revision of the industrial production index (2008=100) was released in July 2010.
Consistent with the new series, a historical revision of the annual and quarterly GDP series, which
also incorporated the results of the 2006 agriculture census as well as methodological
improvements, was made in the third quarter of 2010.
The Rosstat follows the 1993 SNA in general, although scope exists for methodological
improvements in the calculations of volume measures of the production-based GDP estimates,
including estimates of the output of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM).
The imputed rental services of owner-occupied dwellings are undervalued. Improvements in the
coverage of source data are constrained by an inadequate response to business surveys. The
unavailability of balance sheet data continues to be an obstacle for analyzing balance sheet
vulnerabilities, and work is underway to disseminate the first quarterly sectoral accounts and
balance sheets for 2012–14 by 2016.
Price statistics: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Monthly CPI and PPI, both compiled
using the Two-Stage (Modified) Laspeyres (2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian
Federation. In addition to the general CPI index, Rosstat also publishes indices for foodstuffs,
nonfood products, and services. Since September 2010, the Rosstat has also published monthly
price indices broken down according to the Classification of Individual Consumption According
to Purpose (COICOP). Detailed CPI weight data are available on the Rosstat website beginning in
2006 and detailed consumer expenditure data, used as the basis to develop the CPI weights, are available since the beginning of 1995 in the publication Prices in Russia. Weights are updated
annually and revisions are introduced in January of each year. The weights reflect expenditures in

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

the 12 months ended the previous September. Aggregate price indices are compiled for each
good and service item for the 89 regions, seven federal regions, and the Russian Federation as a
whole. However, population weights, as opposed to expenditure shares are applied to the
individual regional indices possibly biasing the CPI downwards if price increases are higher in
regions with higher per capita expenditures. Detailed PPI weight data are published on the
Rosstat website for 2006–2013: and detailed data on total annual sales, which are used to
develop weights for the PPI, are also published by economic activity on the website under the
Entrepreneurship section, industrial subsection. However, the detailed weights are available only
on the Russian version of the website, making it less accessible by users. Further efforts to
improve the treatment of seasonal items in the core inflation index and a new household budget
survey—which has been under consideration for some time—could significantly strengthen data
quality.
Government finance statistics: Russia participates in the G-20 Data Gap Initiative. The
authorities are in the process of promoting timely and cross-country standardized and
comparable government finance data based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001.
The main data gaps are due to the unavailability of quarterly primary data to compile the general
government operation statement, financial balance sheet, and gross debt (by instrument,
maturity, residency, and currency). Additional gaps remain that affect the data quality for
surveillance, for example the lack of historical quarterly data, unexplained data breaks (for
instance the reclassification of some wage expenses from the budgetary central government
accounts to the regional government accounts (following 2011 reforms ), unavailability of
monthly data on ruble guarantees prior to 2011, no integrated debt monitoring and reporting
system, and the lack of reconciliation between different datasets of fiscal statistics (budget
execution, cash flow statement, economic versus functional classification, SDDS fiscal data). The
links to website where fiscal statistics are disseminated can be made more user friendly. The
authorities are, however, continuing to work on addressing these issues and the
recommendations of the 2010 Data Module ROSC update.
Monetary statistics: Since July 2008, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has reported to the IMF, in
the MFSM-recommended format for the surveys, the summarized data on (i) the Central Bank
Survey, (ii) the Other Depository Corporations Survey (covering credit institutions), (iii) the
Depository Corporations Survey, (iv) the Other Financial Corporation Survey (covering insurance
companies and private pension funds), and (v) the Financial Corporations Survey (data cover the
banking system, insurance companies, and private pension funds). In the context of the recent
global turmoil, analysis of balance sheet effects has been hindered by a lack of comparable data
on the currency and maturity breakdown of banking-sector assets and liabilities. Adoption of
data reporting in the full detail of the framework for Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), as
recommended by an STA mission in 2007 (and re-affirmed by the ROSC mission in 2010), would
provide comprehensive information on the currency and instrument breakdowns of the assets
and liabilities of the central bank, credit institutions, and other financial corporations. Since
March 2011, the Banking System Survey (which is equivalent to the Depository
Corporations/Broad Money Survey) published by the CBR has included a breakdown of positions

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

by national and foreign currency. However, the publication on the website started in March 2011
only for the banking sector.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are broadly adequate for surveillance, and
significant improvements have been made to enhance data quality. The CBR has recently
published the gross capital flow data for the private sector, which would facilitate the analysis of
relatively complex flows. Starting from 2012, the balance of payments is compiled according to
the framework of the Fund’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual,
sixth edition (BPM6) and the CBR has revised historical data (2005–11), consistent with BPM6.
However, the historical revision does not provide the same level of details as previously reported
on the components of the financial account statistics, which makes it difficult to assess various
dimensions of capital flows by sectors.
Partial data from a variety of sources are supplemented by the use of estimates and adjustments
to improve data coverage. In particular, the CBR makes adjustments to merchandise import data
published by the Federal Customs Service to account for “shuttle trade,” smuggling, and
undervaluation. Statistical techniques are also used to estimate transactions and positions of
foreign-owned enterprises with production sharing agreements, and these techniques are
continuously being improved. At the same time, Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile their
data with those of partner countries. Improvements have been made in the coverage and quality
of surveys on direct investment, and the CBR is participating in the Fund’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey.
Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on a weekly basis with a
four-business day lag. Comprehensive information is reported in the Reserves Template with a
lag of 20 days, exceeding SDDS timeliness requirement of one month.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since January 31, 2005. SDDS
flexibility option used for the timeliness of data on central government operations. A data ROSC
prepared in October 2003 was published on the IMF website on May 14, 2004. A data ROSC
reassessment in June-July 2010 was published on the IMF website on February 28, 2011 and
concluded that Russia’s macroeconomic statistics are generally of high quality. It found that
compiling agencies have made significant progress in adopting international statistical
methodologies and best practices.

C. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. Monetary data reported as the basis for publication in IFS are in the format of
summarized surveys rather than in the full detail of the SRFs that present positions by financial

instrument disaggregated by currency (national and foreign) and the economic sector of

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Russian Federation
September 18, 2013
1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Incoming data on economic activity since the completion of the Article IV
consultation in June have surprised on the downside. Growth in 2013Q2 failed to rebound
as expected, dragged down by weak investment and industrial production, possibly due to the
completion of large projects in the energy sector. Seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter
growth is estimated at only 0.1 percent, just a slight improvement over 2013Q1 growth of
0.0 percent. However, high frequency indicators for July/August, survey data, expectations of
higher oil prices, and consensus forecasts point to a pick-up in growth in 2013H2. August
inflation was unchanged over July at 6.5 percent y/y, reflecting higher utility prices and some
evidence of pass-through from exchange rate movements. The 2013H1 federal and general
government nonoil deficit outturns were broadly as expected, but lower spending masked
somewhat lower nonoil revenues.
3.
Financial conditions weakened slightly in Russia during August, and have
improved a bit so far in September. The ruble depreciated about 0.5 percent vis-à-vis the
currency basket in August (and by 8 percent since May 22), and the central bank has
intervened, selling fx, and repeatedly adjusted the basket exchange rate band upward,
consistent with its exchange rate band mechanism. During August, the MICEX stock market
index and Russia’s EMBI+ spread worsened slightly, but MICEX rebounded markedly in
September. Since May 22, spreads have widened by about 55 bps. Despite the worsened
global market conditions in recent months, the authorities successfully placed a four-tranche
USD 7 billion Eurobond issue on September 9 among strong investor interest.
4.
Overall, these data and developments have caused staff to revise its near-term
growth forecast downward, while the substance of staff’s policy advice is broadly
unchanged. Staff is revising down its GDP growth forecast by about 1 percent in 2013 and
around ¼ percent in 2014, to around 1½ percent and 3 percent, respectively—which also
suggests that a small negative output gap is opening up. Staff is now forecasting a wider
federal government nonoil deficit of about 10.6 percent of GDP in 2013, compared with
10.0 percent in the staff report (and a similar shift for general government), to reflect weaker
non-oil revenues. The overall deficit is expected remain broadly unchanged due to upward
revisions in oil prices for the year as a whole and the impact of the weaker ruble. For 2013,
consistent with the fiscal rule, staff advises to maintain expenditures at planned levels,
allowing automatic stabilizers to work. Over the medium term, given the probable temporary
nature of the slowdown, staff continues to urge a gradual fiscal consolidation to generate
higher savings of oil revenues.
5.
Despite the slowdown in growth, staff has marked up its forecast for 2013
year-end inflation slightly from 6.1 to 6.2 percent. This reflects recent inflation data and
expectations of price pressures from the recent ruble depreciation, and slightly exceeds the
central bank’s target range of 5 to 6 percent for end-2013. For 2014, staff has slightly

2
lowered its forecast for year-end inflation from 5.5 to 5.3 percent—to reflect the emerging
small negative output gap—which would still be above the central bank’s target range of 4 to
5 percent. On balance, staff continues to advise that monetary policy remain on hold with a
tightening bias. This, combined with other policy recommendations in 2014, would help
bring inflation firmly on a path toward the mid-point of the CBR’s 4 to 5 percent target
range.
6.
Financial sector reforms have progressed. As expected, the new mega-regulator
became operational on September 1, combining the functions of banking sector oversight and
the dissolved Federal Financial Markets Service under the roof of the central bank. Other
organizational changes at the central bank include establishment of the Department for
Systemic Bank Supervision to oversee Russia’s largest banks.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Russian Federation
On September 18, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Russian Federation.1
Real GDP growth in Russia has slowed, amid weak investment and external demand. Yet,
the economy remains close to full capacity, with unemployment at historic lows and capacity
utilization at pre-crisis highs. Short-term indicators are mixed, but on balance suggest some
recovery of activity in recent months, indicating a stronger growth outlook for the second
half of this year. Inflation has remained above target on the back of food prices and regulated
tariff hikes, but has started to decline gradually since June. Recent global financial market
turbulence has put some pressure on the exchange rate, the local bond market, and equities,
and may have contributed to an acceleration of capital outflows. The current account surplus
has been shrinking, reflecting growing imports and deteriorating service and income account
balances.
The near-term outlook is for moderate growth and inflation at the upper end of the target
range of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR). Staff projects real GDP growth
at 1.5 percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014, assuming that the global environment improves
as expected, and no downside risks are realized. Inflation is projected to abate to 6.2 percent
(year-on-year) by end-2013 as the effects of temporary supply-side shocks fade, but to
remain above the authorities’ target range of 4 to 5 percent next year.
The fiscal policy stance has turned roughly neutral. The general government balance was in
surplus in 2012, but is turning negative in 2013 as revenue growth has shown some
weakness, but expenditure restraint has kept the non-oil balance roughly unchanged from last
year. The Reserve Fund balance has increased following deposit of 2012 oil savings, but
remains well short of the government’s 7 percent of GDP target.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Against the backdrop of continued high inflation, the monetary policy stance has remained
on hold throughout the first half of 2013. The CBR has gradually lowered some secondary
rates on longer-term facilities in an effort to strengthen monetary transmission. Money
market rates edged up in 2013:Q2 and liquidity conditions have been volatile, driven by the
budget cycle and seasonal factors. The increased flexibility of the exchange rate should help
maintain external balances in line with medium-term fundamentals.
Overall credit growth has slowed, but unsecured consumer lending continues to expand at a
rapid pace. The slowdown in corporate credit has been mainly demand-driven, reflecting low
investment and working capital financing, due to slower economic activity, while declining
bank capitalization and tightened prudential regulations beginning to constrain the supply of
credit.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Russia’s macroeconomic policy framework has strengthened
and that the economy appears to be operating at close to full capacity. However, growth is
slowing down and risks are tilted to the downside on account of potential external and
internal shocks. To address the challenges ahead and to increase potential output growth,
Directors saw need for further strengthening of policies and decisive implementation of
structural reforms, particularly supply-side reforms.
Directors considered the 2013 fiscal stance to be broadly appropriate and encouraged the
authorities to resist pressures for higher government spending so as to avoid intensifying
inflationary pressures. Additional spending needed for infrastructure projects should be offset
by cuts in lower-priority expenditures. To rebuild fiscal buffers and to generate sufficient
saving of oil revenue, Directors called for a gradual tightening of fiscal policy in the medium
term. Some Directors saw merit in a cautious approach at the current juncture given the
uncertain global environment. To protect growth-enhancing investment spending, adjustment
efforts should primarily focus on rebalancing the mix of spending and enhancing its
efficiency, and pursuing structural reforms, in particular pension reform. Directors welcomed
the introduction of the new oil-price-based fiscal rule and highlighted the importance of
strengthening it further. They encouraged the authorities to pursue policies consistent with
the spirit of the fiscal rule and resist calls to circumvent expenditure limits.
Directors welcomed the improvements in the monetary policy framework and agreed that the
current stance is consistent with achieving medium-term inflation objectives. However, to

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

secure low and stable inflation, they generally recommended keeping monetary policy on
hold with a tightening bias. Directors noted that completing the transition to a flexible
exchange rate and inflation targeting by end-2014 should help anchor inflation expectations
and long-term lending rates. Taking steps to strengthen the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy will also be important.
Directors welcomed recent improvements in the financial sector supervisory framework.
Against the backdrop of continued high growth in unsecured retail lending and still moderate
but rising financial stability risks, they emphasized the need for additional prudential
measures. Implementation of the past Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
recommendations will help address weaknesses in the supervisory framework. To enhance
the financial sector’s efficiency and its role in supporting economic growth, Directors
advised further strengthening of corporate governance, creditor rights, and competition.
Directors stressed that ambitious supply-side structural reforms are necessary to raise
Russia’s medium-term potential growth and reduce vulnerabilities. Noting that economic
growth going forward will have to rely on more efficient use of resources and higher
investment rather than increasing oil prices and use of spare capacity, Directors called for
policies to boost productivity and improve the investment climate, governance, transparency,
and property rights protection. They encouraged the authorities to draw on the OECD
accession process for advancing and widening the reform agenda.
