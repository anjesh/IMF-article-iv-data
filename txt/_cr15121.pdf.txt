STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Brazil is in a tough spot. Led by weak investment and plummeting confidence,
growth, after slowing markedly since mid-2013, came to a virtual halt in 2014. This
largely reflects the impact of diminished competitiveness, the erosion of policy
credibility, owing to a persistent deterioration of fiscal outcomes and above-target
inflation, and a worsening of external conditions for the country. Ensuring strong and
sustained growth is essential for consolidating impressive gains in social inclusion, and
requires inter alia a rebalancing from consumption toward investment-led growth. The
space for policies to boost demand is limited, and their focus should, in turn, be on
alleviating supply-side constraints and boosting productive capacity. A new economic
policy team is faced with the challenge of restoring policy credibility and bolstering
confidence in economic decision-making, notably in the context of a weakening
domestic and external environment.
Outlook and Risks. Economic activity is expected to contract in the near-term.
Macroeconomic policies are assumed to improve gradually, in line with policy
announcements, with attendant implications for credibility. Economic growth is
projected to rise over the medium term, but its potential will depend critically on the
pursuit of much-needed structural reforms. Risks to the outlook are significantly to the
downside, and include adverse ramifications from the ongoing corruption probe
concerning Petrobras, the possibility that fiscal policy goals may not be fully met, and
energy and water rationing. External downside risks emanate from a tightening of
global financial conditions, geo-political tensions, and contagion from adverse
developments in other emerging economies. These risks could conflate if they were to
combine with domestic policy shortfalls, and would threaten macro and financial
stability.
Policy recommendations. Notwithstanding waning growth, slack and policy space are
limited. The focus of policies should be to bolster credibility and address supply-side
constraints, with a view to enhancing the economy’s productive capacity. Fiscal
consolidation should proceed without delay along the announced lines, while monetary
policy should remain tight to bring inflation to target. At the same time, emphasis
should be placed on strengthening fiscal and monetary policy frameworks and
alleviating structural bottlenecks, to boost investment, productivity and
competitiveness. The exchange rate should remain the main external shock absorber,

BRAZIL

with intervention limited to episodes of excessive volatility. Lending by public banks
should play a complementary role, with a focus on missing markets. Targeted
prudential measures to strengthen the financial system, especially a tightening of
lending standards to preserve asset quality in public banks, are advisable to help deal
with vulnerabilities in the financial system that may emerge in an environment marked
by low growth, tighter financial conditions, and possibly rising unemployment.

CONTEXT: DISAPPOINTING GROWTH
1.
Brazil’s growth has persistently
decelerated in recent years. The impulse
from decade-old reforms, expanding
labor income, and favorable external
conditions, which enabled a consumption
and credit-led growth, has lost steam. A
major expansion in the operations of the
national development bank, BNDES, in
the last few years has failed to boost
investment, which has been sluggish since
2011 because the economy has lost
competitiveness, the business
environment has worsened and commodity prices have fallen from record highs. Moreover,
structural sources of pressure on fiscal spending have necessitated a high tax burden. At the same
time, unwarranted microeconomic interventions have contributed to reduced dynamism and
increased financial stress in key sectors. For instance, in the energy sector, instead of promoting
measures to increase efficiency, the government introduced a policy to subsidize electricity prices in
2012, increasing demand despite early signs of drought and driving electricity companies to borrow
to cover increased generation costs in the expectation of future government compensation.
Likewise, a high regulatory burden slowed implementation of the infrastructure investment program,
especially in its initial phases.
2.
The economy stalled in 2014. Activity contracted in the third quarter of 2013 and in the
first two quarters of 2014. A confluence of external and, more importantly, domestic factors helps
explain the recent moderation in activity.

Consumption has also moderated
notwithstanding strong wage increases, as job
creation has halted and financial conditions have tightened, affecting household income and
consumer confidence, which is now below levels seen during the global financial crisis.



At the margin, additional headwinds in 2014 came from the ongoing drought and the World
Cup—which caused a reduction in working days and provided a space for public demonstrations
which impacted confidence.

3.
Poverty, inequality, and unemployment have been on a declining trend for more than
a decade, thanks in part to effective social policies, but further progress will depend crucially
on strong and sustained economic growth. Over the last 12–15 years, millions of families have
been lifted from poverty owing to social policy interventions and buoyant real increases in the
minimum wage (Box 1). Income inequality has also declined, and access to education and health has
broadened. Over that period, relatively strong growth helped unemployment fall to historically low
levels, although most recent declines are largely explained by declining labor force participation
rather than job creation (Box 2). Further improvements in living standards hinge on securing strong,
balanced, and durable growth, to ensure continuing employment growth and sustained funding for
essential social programs.
Box 1. Bolsa Família and Brasil sem Miséria: The End of Extreme Poverty in Brazil1
Bolsa Família (BF), the conditional cash transfer program created in 2003, is the flagship of Brazil’s
social programs. Eligibility is determined by household income per capita. Conditionality includes
mandatory enrollment and minimum school attendance for children and adolescents, vaccination and good
nutrition for young children, and pre- and postnatal care for women, among others. Building on the success
of BF, the government launched Brasil sem Miséria in 2011 to overcome extreme poverty. This program goes
beyond income transfers and promotes educational qualification, integration in the labor market, and
improved access to public services.
A wide reach at a low fiscal cost. BF has expanded from initially 3.6 to 14.0 million families (end-2014),
reaching nearly 50 million people or ¼ of the population. Despite its wide reach, its fiscal cost is less than
0.6 percent of GDP per year; the average monthly transfer per family was R$169 (US$65) at end-2014.
Poverty mapping and coordination within the government were strengthened concomitantly. The
government has actively worked to identify eligible households. At the same time, a unified registry of
beneficiaries was created for monitoring recipient families.
Social outcomes have improved significantly. An estimated 22 million people were lifted from extreme
income poverty alone since the 2011 expansion of the program, and extreme poverty has reached
historically low levels. The impact of BF on the well-being of beneficiaries goes well beyond income support.
Participants have higher school attendance rates, higher school progression and lower grade repetition.
Concerning health, low birth weight, infant mortality, and malnutrition and diarrhea have fallen among
participants, while breastfeeding and vaccination rates have increased. In addition, by targeting women as
cash recipients, BF strengthened women’s financial independence.

Box 2. Labor Market Dynamics1
Brazil has seen a substantial reduction in unemployment during the past decade; but recent declines
mask a weakening of the labor market. The unemployment rate2 reached a record low of 4.5 percent in
mid-2014, down from 11.7 percent in 2002, and stands currently at 5.4 percent (January 2015). The most
recent declines in unemployment, however, reflect a contraction in the labor force, which masks a halt in
employment growth amidst a slowdown in economic activity.

Labor force participation declined from late 2012, but
has increased again more recently. Labor force
participation rates fell across all age groups. The fall was
especially strong for those aged 18–24 years, as Government
scholarship financing programs (such as FIES and ProUni)
have offered young people the opportunity to access higher
education and therefore delay entrance in the labor market.
Social programs and policies—such as Minha Casa Minha
Vida, and the minimum old age pension—have boosted
household’s cash and non-cash income, which might have
affected reservation wages. However, more recently,
participation started again to increase.

Net Job Creation by Sector

Jan-08

Job creation has slowed sharply. Net employment in the
industry and construction sectors has contracted since
early-2014. The creation of jobs in the service and the
commerce sectors—though still positive—has weakened at
the margin on the back of moderating consumption.

Box 2. Labor Market Dynamics (Concluded)
There is insufficient data to determine whether the most recent movement has cyclical causes, or reflects a
correction of what might have been an excessive reaction of participation to the factors mentioned earlier.
Wage pressures remain strong. Real wages have
continued to expand above productivity, reflecting in
part strong increases in the minimum wage. While
some formal sector workers receive exactly one
minimum wage, others are also affected. More
recently, low labor-force participation has also
contributed to the pressure on wages.

increase in 2014Q3. If the participation rate were to
return to its 2008−2014 average of 56.8 percent, the unemployment rate could rise to 6.5 percent, other
things constant.

4.
Inflation and inflation expectations remain above the central target. For several years,
headline and core inflation have been near the upper-edge of the 2.5 to 6.5 percent inflation
tolerance band, owing in part to sustained wage cost pressures, lingering indexation practices, and,
more recently, the ongoing drought. In turn, longer-term inflation expectations have risen on
average. Moreover, modest increases in regulated energy and fuel prices helped hold back overall
inflation. However, overdue adjustments are underway. In particular, Petrobras raised gasoline and
diesel prices in November 2014, and electricity tariffs increased in January 2015, when a new system
of color “flags” was introduced to signal when generation costs are especially high; tariffs are
expected to increase further. In parallel, tighter financial conditions and the still negative output gap
have led to a moderation in the rate of growth of market-determined prices, although new inflation
pressures are emerging from the nominal depreciation of the currency.
5.
Financial markets have been volatile, contributing to reduce confidence. Brazilian asset
prices were among the hardest hit following the Fed’s “taper” announcement in May 2013. Volatility
rose again in the run-up to the October 2014 elections as well as amidst the Russian ruble
depreciation in November. During 2014, both the Bovespa stock exchange index and the exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar fell by about 7 percent and 14 percent, respectively. The resulting
uncertainty has contributed to lower confidence and higher financing costs, reinforcing other
headwinds for activity.
6.
Petrobras, the state-controlled oil major, faces unprecedented difficulties because of
external and internal factors. Petrobras’ credit rating has been downgraded (one rating agency
now classifies it as high yield) and its share price has recently reached multi-year lows. For several
years, the slide reflected an expensive domestic content policy for its procurement and persistent
delays in domestic product price increases, which amounted to a quasi-fiscal subsidy financed by
the company. These policies reduced cashflow from operations, pushing Petrobras into a debt-

based strategy to finance its expansion plans. In the closing months of 2014, however, Petrobras’
difficulties intensified under the combined pressure of diminished oil price prospects and serious
governance problems that cut the company’s access to external finance (Box 3). Petrobras is at
present relying on its cash buffers to finance its expansion projects, and has announced a
Box 3. Petrobras1
Petrobras’ financial situation has worsened. The
recent sharp decline in international oil prices has
improved the profitability of downstream
operations after several years of losses, but
prospects of a sustained period of lower prices and
the ongoing corruption investigation are casting a
shadow over Petrobras. By end-2014, Petrobras’
equity price had fallen by more than 80 percent in
U.S. dollar terms over 5 years and its debt levels
had increased to be the highest in the industry.

third quarter of 2014 closed access to international
markets in early 2015. Uncertainty over asset write-downs has kept the auditor from signing off Petrobras’
financial statements. Also, opportunities to secure financing from state-owned banks are limited by alreadylarge exposures to the company. Petrobras had a large cash cushion going into 2015 but needs to regain
access to funding to continue expanding beyond 2015.
Adverse spillovers from the corruption probe could be large. The probe involves several of the largest
construction companies in Brazil. At present, 27 such companies have been banned from engaging in new
contracts with Petrobras. As already seen in one case (OAS), these companies may face difficulties securing
financing, possibly impacting their suppliers and creditors (although any impact on banks appears moderate
at this point). Perhaps the most important risk is a prolonged period of insufficient access to markets by
Petrobras. Such a situation could necessitate financial support from the government—directly and/or
indirectly—putting the government’s debt reduction objectives under stress.

cut in its capital expenditure program for 2015 (estimated to be a 20 percent reduction), a decision
that will bear upon the company’s future production and export plans, and for the economy as a
whole because Petrobras accounts for about 10 percent of investment in Brazil. Petrobras, which is
excluded from the definition of the public sector for the purposes of the fiscal responsibility law, has
become a source of fiscal risk.
7.
The central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market, with the aim of
limiting volatility by meeting the demand for hedging. In response to a surge in exchange rate
volatility following the Fed's taper announcement, the central bank launched a program of
pre-announced intervention starting in August 2013. Rather than selling dollars from its reserves in
the spot market, the central bank has been selling hedging instruments settled in local currency (“FX
swaps”). 1 The intervention program has been renewed three times since its inception, and is
currently in effect through end-March 2015; the amount auctioned daily (excluding rollovers) has
been reduced in two steps and is now one fifth of its initial size. Intervention helped tame the real’s
volatility in the second half of 2013 and early 2014. However, the second extension of the program
in June 2014 occurred at a time of relatively low global volatility. The notional amount of
outstanding FX swaps at end-2014 was US$110 billion, exceeding short-term external debt on a
residual maturity basis.
8.
Despite weakening domestic demand, the current account deficit reached 4.2 percent
of GDP in 2014 from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2012.2 The deterioration reflects worsening terms of
trade, a drop in exports to Argentina, and an increase in fuel imports necessitated by the drought.
The recent depreciation against the U.S. dollar, arising in part from general dollar strength, has not
translated one-for-one into gains against competitors in global markets. Moreover, persistently high
unit labor costs continue to dampen competitiveness.

The authorities are in the process of revising external sector statistics in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position manual (BPM6). This movement is consistent with the adoption of
the new methodology of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) in Brazil, due to be published by end March
2015. Revised BOP data are expected to be published in April 2015, with revised external debt data expected in June.
As part of this conversion, at least two important revisions will be made: foreign holdings of domestic debt securities
will be included in external debt statistics, and its income, up to now reflected jointly with principal outflows in the
portfolio account, will be recorded separately in the income account. Staff expects that these changes will lead to
upward revisions of both external debt and the current account deficit.

International reserves are high and capital flows have remained stable. FDI financed
more than 70 percent of the current account deficit in 2014, with intercompany loans accounting for
about 60 percent of total FDI.4 Portfolio inflows have been buoyant since 2013, as the central bank

expansion by public banks, while private bank
credit continued to expand at a moderate pace.

of increased borrowing from banks. The rising proportion of mortgages in household borrowing
has lengthened average maturities, containing the growth in debt service. Corporate bond
issuance has become increasingly important, including overseas borrowing, raising FX exposure
but also allowing firms to access credit at longer maturities and lower rates. Leverage–already
high by international standards–has edged up without translating into higher capital outlays as
firms built cash cushions instead of augmenting their capital stock. In the case of commodity
exporters, the decline in commodities is also contributing to raising leveraging by reducing free
cashflow and equity growth. While FX debt accounts for about 30 percent of the total, it is
largely hedged.6



Against this backdrop, tepid growth, possibly rising unemployment, exchange rate depreciation
and tighter financial conditions ahead will likely put strains on private sector balance sheets.
Indeed, there are emerging signs of balance sheet pressures. While the overall NPL ratio remains
stable at about 3 percent, weak activity has already caused an uptick in NPL ratios for some
segments of consumer and corporate loans, such as overdraft, credit card, working capital, and
SME loans, particularly by public banks (Appendix II). These segments have, however, been the
ones leading the recent deceleration in credit growth in public banks.

12.
The macroeconomic policy mix from mid-2013 through 2014 lacked consistency,
undermining credibility.


The fiscal stance turned expansionary. In 2013, the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) primary
balance declined to 1.9 percent of GDP, undershooting its 2.3 percent target. Coming on top of
tax breaks introduced over 2012 and 2013, slowing revenue and rapid real expenditure growth
(arising in part from structural sources of fiscal pressure such as mandatory minimum spending
and minimum benefit rules, and wide-ranging earmarking) brought the primary fiscal balance of
the NFPS to ‐0.6 percent of GDP in 2014, despite one-off measures of about ½ percent of GDP.
Policy lending to BNDES edged back up in 2014, including a transfer of 0.6 percent of GDP in
December, further raising government borrowing. As a result, gross and net public debt
increased respectively to 71 and 37 percent of GDP. In 2014, the net interest bill of the

Liquidity risk is assessed based on the BCB’s liquidity index, which is the same concept as the liquidity coverage
ratio (LCR)—an index introduced under Basel III. It relates the volume of liquid assets available to the institution to
stressed cash flow (disbursement 30 days out in the stress scenario). As of September 2014, the liquidity index is
190 percent. The LCR will be implemented in October 2015 as a regulation.

nonfinancial public sector was 6 percent of GDP, exceeding the typical volume of spending in
education, for example. Declining growth and poor fiscal performance affected Brazil’s sovereign
credit rating. Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil’s credit rating to BBB- in March 2014, its first
downgrade since July 2002. In September 2014, Moody’s revised Brazil’s sovereign rating
outlook to negative.


Monetary policy has, however, maintained a tightening bias. In view of persistent inflation
pressures, and largely in contrast with the fiscal policy stance, the monetary policy rate (SELIC)
was hiked by 375 basis points to 11 percent between April 2013 and April 2014. Policy
tightening paused from May through September. But between October 2014 and January 2015,
the SELIC was increased by another 125 basis points to prevent second round effects from
currency depreciation and the anticipated increases in regulated prices. At times, lending by
public banks has been at odds with the thrust of monetary policy, diminishing the latter’s
effectiveness.



Macro-prudential policies broadly responded to changes in risks along the credit cycle, but in
some instances seemed to go against the grain of monetary policy. In September 2013, the
central bank introduced limits on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for mortgages to prevent potential
future vulnerabilities.7 In July and August 2014, reserve and capital requirements were selectively
loosened. The first of these actions aimed at containing liquidity risk in some segments of the
banking system. But the second one largely aimed at boosting certain types of consumer loans,
notwithstanding the tightening bias of monetary policy and an uptick in delinquencies of
unsecured personal loans.8

13.
Over December 2014−January 2015, a new economic team was brought on board with
a mandate to strengthen macroeconomic policies and restore credibility. The team announced
an ambitious fiscal adjustment strategy to bring the primary surplus to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015
and to at least 2 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017. This strategy, together with the ending of policy
lending from the treasury to public banks, aims to stabilize and then reduce gross public debt. The
economic team also set the objective of reaching the 4.5 percent inflation target by end-2016. Early
measures and announcements include the 125 bps increase in SELIC mentioned above; an increase
in the interest rate on subsidized loans (known as “TJLP”); a series of adjustment measures on the
fiscal side worth about 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, notably a tightening of eligibility for
unemployment benefits, salary bonuses, and survivor pensions, and the reintroduction of the tax on
fuels (Box 4).9

7

The LTV limits are 90 percent for constant amortization mortgage loans and 80 percent for all other mortgage loans.

8

The relaxation of macroprudential measures includes, inter alia, (i) reducing the risk weights on vehicle and
personal loans; (ii) increasing the fraction of reserve requirements on time deposits that can be met by extending
loans or purchasing loan portfolios from other banks; and (iii) allowing banks to use part of their reserve
requirements to increase working capital loans.

On the other hand, structural impediments to growth remain rampant. In particular, Brazil
remains a relatively closed economy compared to its peers, with limited integration into global
value chains; the tax system is uncommonly complex and unit labor costs are high; despite
recent initiatives, Brazil’s infrastructure and competitiveness indicators have deteriorated in
relation to its competitors; and while Brazil has maintained its average applied Most-Favored
Nation (MFN) tariff at an elevated level of around 10 percent, several of its peers, such as China
and Mexico, have cut taxes on imports and built a large network of preferential trade
agreements (Box 5).
Box 4. Fiscal Policy Measures1
The new economic team has announced several measures to strengthen the fiscal balances; but
additional measures will be needed to ensure the attainment of the primary surplus targets set for
2015 and 201617. On the expenditure side, the government announced (i) reduced benefits and tighter
eligibility criteria for survivor pensions, unemployment and sickness benefits, and salary bonuses for private
employees with low earnings, and (ii) the elimination of electricity subsidies (supported by tariff
adjustments). The government estimates these measures will yield about 0.5 percent of GDP savings in 2015.
In addition, it introduced tight provisional limits on certain discretionary current spending in its continuing
resolution for the initial months of 2015; but this measure will be superseded by the changes to the 2015
budget. On the revenue side, taxes were raised on fuels, household credit operations, car sales, imports, and
cosmetics, and a planned revision of PIT brackets was vetoed by the President (yielding 0.4 percent of GDP
in total). Furthermore, the decision of halting the Treasury transfers to BNDES, tightening the rates of some
subsidized loans, and raising the TJLP will lower the net interest bill. Further efforts are necessary to achieve
the government’s proposed targets for 2015 because the starting point, given by the 2014 fiscal outcome, is
a primary deficit of 0.6 even after some extraordinary revenue is taken into account, and because revenues
in 2015 will tend to weaken as a result of the contraction in activity.2 Possible additional measures are
indicated in the Table below.

4/ Implementation in January 2016.
5/ Achieved through removal of budget rigidities and lower revenue earmarking. Expenditure cuts assumed to be phased in gradually, starting in 2015.

In general, fiscal adjustment should fall preferentially on current spending; on the revenue side, the
rolling-back of temporary tax breaks would be useful. Curtailing expenditures will bring a lower drag on
economic activity than increasing taxes would (see Selected Issues Paper). Given the size of the needed
adjustment, however, revenue effort will also be required. The tax exemptions introduced in 201213
represent a sacrifice of revenues of 2 percent of GDP; however, they have been largely unsuccessful, and
have in fact created new distortions in the treatment of different industries.
A further consideration is to favor adjustment strategies that address sources of long-term fiscal
pressure. Spending related to ageing population groups is expected to rise by 3 percent of GDP in the
coming 15 years. Structural budgetary reforms that reduce the complex structure of revenue earmarking and
mandatory growth requirements for major spending lines, such as health or education, would have long
term benefits in terms of increased policy flexibility. About 90 percent of the budget is predetermined at the
general government level.3 The value of the minimum pension is indexed to the minimum wage, which
grows roughly at the same rate as the tax base; such indexation makes therefore no allowance for the trend
increase in the number of beneficiaries, making this system a permanent source of fiscal pressure.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
The pace of economic activity will remain subdued in the near term. Staff projects real
GDP to contract by 1.0 percent in 2015 and to grow again by 0.9 percent in 2016.


14

This projection assumes that policy implementation is in line with recent pronouncements, the
infrastructure concessions program functions broadly as programmed, and pre-committed
Petrobras’ investment projects in the oil sector—as they stand after the cuts announced in late
January—proceed largely as planned. The cuts in investment by Petrobras enter the projection
with a relatively large multiplier to incorporate collateral effects on Petrobras’ contractors and
suppliers. Following a prolonged period of low rainfall and diminished reservoir levels in key
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

regions, the specter of water and electricity rationing is already affecting business and consumer
confidence.


Staff estimates that the planned fiscal consolidation in 2015 would be a modest drag on growth,
although the adverse impact should be increasingly mitigated by the favorable effect that the
adoption of concrete measures and successful adjustment will have on credibility and
confidence. Judicious deployment of the large transfer of loanable resources to BNDES in
December 2014 should provide some support in 2015; fiscal drag in 2016 is expected to be
lower, as some of the additional consolidation should come the from full-year effect of
measures adopted in 2015, and thus already internalized in economic agents’ decision making.



Consistent with the policy announcements, staff assumes that policy lending will stop. Staff also
expects some moderate additional tightening in the SELIC and the TJLP in 2015, with the
monetary policy stance remaining tight until inflation approaches the 4.5 percent target
(although, with the hump in regulated-price inflation behind, policy could ease at the margin in
2016).



Investment is projected to contract for a second year running in 2015, reaching its lowest point
since 2009, primarily as a result of the change in Petrobras’s expansion plans. Investment growth
is projected to recover gradually, especially in the latter part of 2015 as policy uncertainty abates
and markets gain confidence in the government's reform agenda. The recovery in investment in
2016 also assumes that Petrobras will secure reaccess to financing from capital markets.



Private consumption growth is projected to stay flat in 2015, reflecting tight financial conditions
and some rise in unemployment, while government consumption is assumed to contract as part
of fiscal consolidation. Private consumption is projected to regain some strength in 2016,
including as a result of investment-related employment and improved confidence. Net exports
should make a modest contribution to growth reflecting in part the weaker real, despite a
challenging external environment.

16.
Growth should gradually rise over the medium term, but its long term potential will
depend on addressing structural constraints. Under a scenario of macroeconomic policy
strengthening and implementation of the infrastructure concessions program, but otherwise limited
structural reforms, potential growth is projected to reach 2.5 percent by 2020. Despite some
expected further weakening in commodity prices, the current account is projected to improve
modestly on higher oil production and the more depreciated level of the real, although offshore oil
exploration plans are assumed to be scaled down at the margin given the diminished prospects for
world oil prices.

Box 5. Trade Restrictiveness1

Brazil’s relatively restrictive system of trade taxes partly
explains the low trade integration. As a founding member of
MERCOSUR, Brazil shares a common external tariff with other
members, subject to exceptions. Its applied MFN customs tariff is
entirely ad valorem, with rates ranging from zero to 55 percent. Goods
imports face a weighted average applied MFN tariff of around
10 percent according to the WTO, the highest among LA5 and BRICS
peers. Moreover, Brazil’s network of preferential trade agreements
covers a relatively small share of world trade compared to its peers. 3
Besides customs tariffs, imports are subject to a complex system of
internal taxes.4

Reducing trade barriers and behind-the-border constraints
should be a priority. Reducing the level and complexity of the
system of trade taxes―including by extending the network of

growth, especially when paired with the push towards trade
facilitation. Domestic content restrictions could be eased to promote
Brazil’s inclusion in global value chains.

Risks to the outlook are significantly tilted to the downside (Appendix III).



A key domestic risk to activity is that investment, including in the areas of oil production and
infrastructure concessions, may be further hampered by the probe into corruption at Petrobras,
which involves several of the largest construction companies in the country. Insufficient access
to funding by these companies can result in adverse spillovers to their creditors, although the
impact on banks would likely be moderate. Prolonged insufficient access to markets by
Petrobras itself is a risk to the fiscal adjustment strategy. More generally, there is a risk that the
fiscal targets for 2015−16 may not be met. This could undermine market confidence, with
implications for growth, debt outcomes, and potentially for Brazil's sovereign rating (Brazil is
only one or two downgrades away from losing investment grade, depending on which rating
agency one looks at). In turn, this could result in a sell-off of government debt by nonresidents,
which could also cause stress in those financial institutions with large exposures to government
securities, and affect capital flows to other emerging markets as well. Following a prolonged
period of low rainfall and falling reservoir levels in key regions, water and electricity rationing
has emerged as a key risk to growth in the near term. Continued low rainfall could result in
tightened supply constraints, especially in the Southeast of the country, where a large fraction of
GDP originates.



External downside risks stem from the increase in financial volatility, as well as from further
declines in commodity prices. An abrupt surge in global financial market volatility could increase
Brazil’s risk premium, exert pressure on the real (in addition to that coming from the U.S. dollar
strengthening), and pose a challenge in financing Brazil’s large current account deficit. The
impact on balance sheets should be contained as corporate exposures to foreign exchange risk
are largely hedged. A protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies
could weaken exports. A combination of a weaker real and slow growth would put pressure on
private sector balance sheets. Further declines in export commodity prices—such as iron ore and
soy beans—resulting from a slowdown in China also remains a key vulnerability. A further
decline in oil prices, while a boon in the near term, could affect adversely Petrobras’
development plans of high-cost deep-sea oil, as well as prospects for growth and the current
account over the medium term, when Brazil is expected to become a net oil exporter.
Conversely, a sharp rise in oil prices, as would result from a geopolitical shock, would put
pressure on the current account and on Petrobras’ cashflow in the near term.



Deeper downside risks to growth involve a combination of external shocks that are amplified by
domestic vulnerabilities. In this environment there is a high probability of a sovereign credit
downgrade. Such a scenario would see a larger rise in unemployment, with a likely worsening of
social indicators, a sell-off of government debt, and negative repercussions for the financial
sector, with adverse spillovers for other countries in the region.

19.
Policies implemented in 2014 were partially in line with previous Fund advice. At the
conclusion of the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Brazil, IMF Executive Directors welcomed the
initiation of the monetary tightening cycle and recommended that monetary policy remained
geared at containing inflationary pressures and anchoring inflation expectations. In addition,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

BRAZIL

Directors highlighted the importance of adhering to a primary surplus target that placed public debt
on a downward path, while also recommending a gradual reduction of policy lending. The
continuation of monetary policy tightening since April 2013, with the goal of containing inflation
pressures, took the policy rate to 11.75 percent by December, up from 7.25 percent before the start
of the tightening cycle. However, in the fiscal policy area, performance deteriorated, with the
primary balance slipping into deficit and policy lending edging back up, resulting in an increase in
public debt in 2014.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Brazil is in a very tough spot, and policymakers face difficult policy choices that will test
the grit and determination of the new government. Economic activity continues to
contract with significant downside risks, even as inflation remains above target. There
appears to be a limited role for demand support, both because there are emerging supply
constraints and there is little policy space, underscoring the need to boost the economy's
productivity capacity through supply-side reforms. But this will take time. A key
imperative in the near term is to bolster policy credibility, notably through front-loaded
fiscal adjustment and monetary tightening, since this is important to boost confidence
and, in turn, private demand that would anchor strong and sustainable growth over the
medium-term. Adjustment will not be easy; however, any compromise on policy effort
could jeopardize medium-term prospects without yielding any significant benefit in the
short-term.
Staff Views
Fiscal policy
20.
An ambitious and front-loaded fiscal adjustment effort, embedded in a realistic
medium-term fiscal plan, is imperative for reducing public debt and bolstering policy
credibility. Fiscal policy decisions confront two conflicting objectives: supporting demand and
boosting policy credibility. On the one hand, in the context of weakening activity, fiscal policy could
be used to bolster demand. On the other hand, however, policy drift and the loss of credibility in
policy frameworks in recent years, reflected in plummeting consumer and business confidence,
would put a premium on ambitious and front-loaded fiscal adjustment that would anchor strong
and sustainable growth over the medium-term, notwithstanding the growth dampening effect such
adjustment would have in the near-term. Since current growth woes in Brazil largely reflect
supply-side constraints, as evident from limited slack, inflation being at the top end of the band, and
the growing need to conserve water and energy, staff is of the view that fiscal policy actions should
be geared toward restoring policy credibility.


18

Given the weak underlying fiscal position in 2014, rising public debt and deterioration of fiscal
policy credibility over the last years, the announced fiscal target for 2015 of a primary surplus of
1.2 percent of GDP for the NFPS is appropriate. However, while the measures announced so far

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL

are welcome, additional effort (estimated at 1.2−1.4 percent of GDP, including to offset cyclical
effects on revenue from the contraction in 2015) will be needed to meet the target. Additional
expenditure containment is expected to be included in the revised 2015 budget (Box 4).


Going beyond 2015, the new government’s target of 2.0 percent of GDP for the primary surplus
would begin to reduce public debt in the central macroeconomic scenario; but increasing that
target by ½ percent of GDP would help put public debt on a more firmly downward path by
reducing the interest bill faster and increasing resilience to shocks and potential fiscal risks.



From the perspective of the overall fiscal adjustment strategy, tilting the adjustment towards
expenditure consolidation may help limit the drag on economic activity, but preserving and even
increasing capital spending would be important (Selected Issues Paper). That said, given the size
of the required adjustment, revenue measures are also necessary in the short run. To this end,
beyond the measures already announced, consideration should be given to a fuller rollback of
tax exemptions, as enlarging the tax base this way supports revenues, reduces distortions, and
promotes horizontal equity. Going forward, addressing budget rigidities and ageing-related
spending pressures is crucial to reduce debt and build fiscal space (Box 4). To the extent that
structural fiscal measures that address key sources of long term fiscal pressure can be adopted
early (such as the link between benefits and minimum wages), a more gradual adjustment path
could be compatible with strengthening sustainability and credibility; but absent such reforms,
adherence to the announced primary surplus objectives would remain key.



Furthermore, anchoring fiscal policies and targets in a medium-term framework would improve
fiscal predictability. Staff sees merit in such an institutional framework as well as on publishing a
debt-sustainability analysis. Moreover, an independent fiscal council would provide further
support to transparency and accountability.

21.
The commitment to end policy lending to the development bank and more generally
to correct relative prices and reduce subsidies is welcome, and should bolster fiscal credibility.
The decision to stop policy lending to BNDES starting this year is bold and will alleviate pressures on
the fiscal position, while reducing financial distortions. The discontinuation of general subsidies to
electricity, underpinned by tariff increases, is a positive step both for fiscal and economic efficiency
reasons. The current context of low international oil prices provides a window of opportunity for
recouping the downstream losses incurred by Petrobras in past years, and later for introducing
formula-based mechanisms to adjust domestic prices regularly in line with the evolution of import
parity benchmarks and reasonable domestic margins. More generally, adopting market-related
pricing formulas for administered prices would help preserve the integrity of the balance sheets of
large state-owned enterprises and reduce future fiscal risks.
22.
Improving transparency of the fiscal accounts and reviewing the strength of
governance frameworks in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is critical. Full disclosure of the
underlying fiscal position would boost confidence and help communicate the need for adjustment.
The irregularities uncovered in Petrobras point to the need to review and strengthen internal and
external oversight mechanisms in Petrobras and possibly in other SOEs, a task of the highest priority.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

BRAZIL

The recent appointment of a director for governance in Petrobras is a positive initial step. Strong
governance and close oversight of parastatals is also key for containing fiscal risks.
Monetary and financial sector policies
23.
Bringing inflation to target by 2016 will likely require some further tightening of
monetary policy in 2015. While moderate economic activity and planned fiscal consolidation,
together with recent increases in the SELIC, should help reduce inflation, the required re-alignment
of regulated prices and recent currency depreciation will necessitate monetary policy maintaining a
tightening bias to mitigate the second-round effects on other prices and wages.
24.
The renewed emphasis in communication on the 4.5 percent inflation target and the
readiness to use the policy instruments to prevent second round effects from the ongoing
correction of relative prices will bolster the credibility of the monetary framework.


Beyond the immediate, strengthening the inflation targeting framework would improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, the accountability and autonomy of the central
bank could be enhanced by narrowing the tolerance band around the 4.5 percent target and
giving a specific term of office to the central bank’s top management, as recommended by the
2002 and 2012 FSAPs (Appendix IV).



The widespread use of subsidized lending weakens monetary policy transmission and distorts
credit markets. Introducing a direct link between the policy rate (SELIC) and the subsidized
lending rate (TJLP) would increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. Reducing the gap
between the SELIC and the TJLP—675 bps after the recent 50 bps TLJP hike—would also lower
the recurrent fiscal cost arising from the cumulative stock of policy lending by government.

25.
The exchange rate should remain the main shock absorber in the face of external
shocks, with intervention in foreign exchange market being limited to dealing with excessive
volatility. The pre-announced intervention program has helped reduce volatility and pre-empted
pressures in the spot market at critical times by providing hedging options for economic agents with
exchange rate exposures. However, by reducing the cost of hedging, the program may have
encouraged excessive risk taking by the private sector; and, while the flexible exchange rate has
remained the main shock absorber, prolonged intervention may have slowed the convergence of
the exchange rate needed to restore competitiveness. For these reasons, staff considers the
reduction in size and duration of the intervention program announced in December 2014 as a
positive development. Going forward, the central bank should refrain from extending the
intervention program further and, as conditions permit, continue to use the leeway provided by the
calendar of rollovers of maturing swaps to temper the stock of swaps outstanding, with the goals of
preserving and increasing policy space and supporting convergence of the exchange rate to levels in
line with fundamentals.

Banking system soundness indicators are encouraging, but private sector leverage and
the rapid past expansion of public banks are potential sources of stress requiring vigilance.


The central bank ran stress tests with scenarios constructed by staff, and the overall outcome
was within the parameters of the stress tests published in the central bank’s own September
2014 Financial Stability Report—that is, in a high stress scenario, some banks would become
noncompliant with capital requirements, but the capital shortfall would be small, less than
0.5 percent of regulatory capital, given existing provisions.10

This said, risks could arise from high private sector leverage and growing FX exposure in an
environment of sustained low growth and possibly rising unemployment. The increase in
delinquencies of high-risk loans by public banks could generate a demand for additional capital
if loan defaults increase, but, more importantly, underscores the need for greater vigilance and
close monitoring of the health of bank balance sheets in response to evolving economic
conditions.

Policies to bolster the economy’s productive potential
27.
Broad-ranging structural reforms are critical for improving the economy’s productive
capacity, notably by reducing the cost of doing business and fostering investment, and to
anchor strong, sustained, and balanced growth. Prioritization of these reforms and getting an
early start is essential. Reforms should include:


Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. The infrastructure concessions program is critical for
boosting medium-term growth, and should be implemented with greater vigor, notably by
assessing factors that have impeded greater private sector participation. In particular,
consideration should be given to increasing the program’s scope and size, given the significance
of infrastructure bottlenecks, while observing high standards of governance and program
design, including regarding transfer of risks, to minimize fiscal risks and attract private sector
participation. Tilting the composition of public expenditure away from current spending would
also free resources for public investment, including in infrastructure.



Tax reforms. Brazil’s tax system is extremely complex and burdensome, especially with regard to
distortionary indirect taxes. In particular, a simplification of the State Tax on the Circulation of
Goods and Services (ICMS) would be an important way to reduce the cost of doing business.



Opening the economy. Brazil’s trade to GDP ratio is one of the lowest among emerging markets.
Reducing applied MFN customs tariffs; continuing trade facilitation efforts; lifting domestic
content requirements; and pursuing preferential trade agreements would help increase
competition and the efficiency of the economy.

10

The stress tests indicate that in an extreme scenario designed by staff defaults peak at 5 percent, requiring a
recapitalization less than 0.4 percent of regulatory capital in the system as of March 2016. The scenario, which is
constructed based on cross-country banking crisis experience, assumes that GDP growth, interest rate, foreign
exchange rate, inflation, and unemployment would be -3.1 percent, 14.2 percent, R$3.35/U$, 11.6 percent, and
7.2 percent, respectively, during the 18 months between September 2014 and March 2016.



Improving resource allocation. The banking system’s ability to allocate resources efficiently can
be improved by reducing the share of earmarked credit. Focusing public banks’ activities on
missing markets, such as providing guarantees for concessions, would improve the allocation of
limited financing. Similarly, reducing budget earmarking would release fiscal space and improve
the allocation of limited fiscal resources.
G-20 Saving, Invesment, and Growth, 2011-14



Pension reform. Reforming the pension
system (beyond the announced tightening
of survivor benefits) would mitigate
foreseeable fiscal pressures. It could also
boost savings, much-needed for funding
investment. Revising the indexation of
certain benefits, including pensions, to the
minimum wage would also help raise
public saving.

Revising the minimum wage indexation formula, so that it better reflects productivity gains. The
trade-off between employment and high real wage growth would likely reassert itself in a
low-economic growth environment (see Selected Issues Paper). The large and sustained rise in
unit labor costs has contributed to the erosion of competitiveness. The current formula for
minimum wage, by affecting the growth in pension and other benefits, is also a source of fiscal
pressure. A reform of the minimum wage indexation formula is critical, but will likely require
extensive consultation among stakeholders. Hence, efforts should begin early and in earnest to
develop a broad-based consensus in favor of reform.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities agreed that 2015 will be a difficult transition year, but are determined
to strengthen policies. They expect activity particularly in the first half of the year to be subdued,
but anticipate a recovery in investment in the second half of the year on the premise that a
strengthening of macroeconomic policy will help restore credibility and boost market confidence.
Over the year, they see consumption remaining subdued given the drag from tighter fiscal and
monetary policies. The authorities expressed in strong terms the commitment of the government to
the objectives for fiscal and monetary policy that have been set for the next three years, which they
see as providing the necessary foundation for the government’s actions to continue improving the
living standards of the population. Concerning risks of fallout from the Petrobras probe, the
authorities stressed that the investigation was following its course, and that the police and judicial
authorities were fulfilling their functions within the framework of the law, illustrating the strength of
Brazil’s institutions. They also noted that the company is sound, and that the new management that
took the helm at Petrobras in February is working closely with the independent auditor to find a
prompt resolution to the question of the markdown of assets, which would permit Petrobras to issue
audited accounts.

29.
The authorities, however, do not concur with staff forecasts, which they consider to be
very pessimistic. According to the authorities, staff forecasts for 2015 overstate the impact of fiscal
adjustment on public consumption, which is implicitly expected to decline by 6.9 percent, and hence
on aggregate demand. They note that the worst decline of this aggregate demand component in
more than two decades (1996-2013) was only -1.8 percent in 1996. In addition, contrary to staff’s
forecast for private consumption growth to be flat, the authorities consider that there are still factors
in place that would point to a small positive growth, such as projected real wage and credit growth.
The authorities also note that estimates of the output gap may not be entirely consistent with the
rest of the forecast.
30.
The authorities emphasized their strong commitment to delivering the announced
primary surplus target of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and at least 2.0 percent of GDP in 2016
and 2017, with no new policy lending by government to the development bank. They further
reiterated the link between these fiscal targets and their focus on the stabilization and subsequent
reduction of gross debt. They indicated that their commitment to follow through with the
consolidation process without delay was demonstrated by the measures announced since the turn
of the year.
31.
The authorities indicated that, within the existing constraints, they would seek to
minimize the impact on activity of their fiscal adjustment. They explained that the situation was
not one of crisis, and so they could implement the full adjustment over two years. They further
indicated that fiscal adjustment will have to rely on both expenditure cuts and revenue measures,
taking care to avoid cuts in key spending items (such as high-value capital and social spending) and
increases in distortionary taxes. The authorities reiterated that they do not plan to continue the
Treasury funding for public banks in the form of policy lending. Other costly subsidies are also being
revised, notably those to energy, where revisions are already being implemented.
32.
While authorities agreed that fiscal policies should aim at ensuring long-term
sustainability and be fully transparent, they did not see a strong case for introducing a
medium term fiscal framework beyond that provided by the three-year Budgetary Directives
Law.
33.
The authorities emphasized that ensuring inflation convergence to the 4.5 percent
target by the end of 2016 is the key priority for monetary policy. The central bank noted that
the monetary policy stance had been adjusted over the past year-and-a-half in line with the
evolving inflation outlook, most recently to support a process of relative price adjustment that will
contribute to reduce vulnerabilities, while preventing relative price adjustments from affecting
general inflation. Moreover, they stressed that, although the headline inflation rate had remained
broadly stable during 2014, this masked a gradual improvement in its composition, with a
progressively decelerating rate of inflation in freely determined prices offsetting a rise in the
inflation of monitored prices. The authorities agreed that the TJLP gap relative to SELIC should
narrow over time.

34.
The authorities argued that their foreign exchange intervention program has aimed at,
and has helped preserve, financial stability, and has had no undesirable side-effects. In
particular, they stated that the program had not encouraged overseas borrowing by corporates, and
stressed, instead, that the program had prevented capital outflows during episodes of high volatility.
The central bank argued that, in addition, the FX swaps helped reduce the cost of carrying
international reserves, and that, being settled in local currency, they did not compromise or commit
international reserves. They also remarked that the exchange rate had continued, and would
continue, to move in response to changing fundamentals and external shocks. Taking all of these
factors into account, the authorities indicated that at present the notional value of the hedging
contracts outstanding is broadly in line with the economy’s hedging needs. The latest extension of
the intervention program on a reduced scale and for a shorter period than previous extensions is
consistent with this view. Concerning staff’s assessment of Brazil’s external position, the authorities
saw the current account in 2014 as weaker than expected, reflecting in part the drop in key export
prices; but they noted that it was still mostly FDI-financed, and that the deficit should narrow over
the medium term as a result of ongoing adjustments in relative prices and increases in Brazil’s oil
exports.
35.
The authorities acknowledged staff’s concerns over the recent rapid expansion of
public banks’ balance sheets, but remarked that the pace had moderated significantly and
that the NPL ratios in these institutions had remained low. The authorities stressed, furthermore,
that the asset quality deterioration was mainly concentrated in non-core segments of these banks’
loans, and that the banks were well provisioned for possible loan losses.
36.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to advance the implementation of
financial reforms. The authorities started to phase-in the implementation of Basel III capital
requirement from October 2013.11 Brazilian banks have progressed well towards the fully-fledged
implementation of Basel III, which according to authorities’ estimates would require additional
capital for only a few banks and be equivalent to 0.3 percent of regulatory capital in the system until
2019. The authorities noted that further progress has been made since the 2013 Article IV
consultation in implementing key recommendations from the 2012 FSAP Update, including the
introduction of a new framework for Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), and the approval of the
updated bylaws of the deposit insurance fund (FGC).
37.
The authorities agreed that addressing the infrastructure gaps is essential to boost
potential growth and that further domestic private sector participation is needed, given
limited fiscal space. They pointed to the recent success of their infrastructure concession program
in attracting investors when auctioning the concessions of ports, roads and airports. They added
that public banks are expected to continue to play a role in the financing of infrastructure, and that
new options to mobilize private financing from capital markets were also under consideration.
11

Brazilian banks will be required to build 0.625 percent of regulatory capital as conservation buffers from 2016 and
the required buffers will increase to 2.5 percent. The possibility of activation of countercyclical capital buffers,
equivalent to the size of conservation buffers, will be available from 2016.

24

BRAZIL

38.
The authorities agreed that structural reforms would help boost Brazil’s potential
growth, but remarked that in some cases improvements in fiscal transfer programs (such as
better targeting and reduction in abuses) provided incentives for higher labor productivity
equivalent to reforms.


The authorities see great potential benefits from a simplification of the ICMS. However, they
indicated that this reform would need time as it involves complex negotiations with state
governments and the Senate. The simplification of the PIS/COFINS is also receiving
consideration, as is the expansion of SIMPLES, the tax regime that applies to most small
enterprises, so it includes some medium-sized enterprises as well.



The authorities agreed that promoting a more open economy would be beneficial, and
highlighted recently introduced procedures for trade facilitation, including in customs, aimed at
reducing bureaucratic hurdles to trade.



The authorities argued that modifying the minimum wage indexation formula was not a
pressing need, as the current formula would imply modest increases in the real value of the
minimum wage in the next few years, and it had proved a factor of stability in the last two years.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Brazilian economy faces serious challenges in the context of stalling growth and
high inflation. The new government must strengthen macro-financial policies and institutions to
restore credibility, and use its political capital to embark on much-needed structural reforms that
would improve competitiveness and put the economy on a strong and sustainable medium-term
growth path.
40.
The announced fiscal targets for 2015−17 are welcome, but implementation will be
crucial for bolstering market sentiment. An ambitious and front-loaded fiscal consolidation is
required for reducing public debt and restoring policy credibility. For these reasons, staff welcomes
the government's primary fiscal targets for 2015−17, the authorities’ decision to end policy lending,
and the emphasis on reducing gross debt. The recent announcements of a series of expenditure and
revenue measures have sent an important signal of the authorities’ commitment to their policy
strategy. Given the weak underlying fiscal position in 2014, the fiscal target of 1.2 percent of GDP for
2015 is appropriate, but further measures will be needed to meet this target. However, starting in
2016, aiming for a primary surplus above the minimum objective of 2.0 percent of GDP in 2016−17
would bolster fiscal sustainability, lower vulnerability to shocks, help reduce the interest bill faster,
and strengthen policy credibility. A more gradual path for fiscal consolidation than the one
announced should only be considered in the context that reforms addressing structural sources of
fiscal pressure are brought forward and pursued with vigor. Moreover, anchoring fiscal targets in an
effective medium-term fiscal framework would improve the predictability of fiscal policy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BRAZIL

41.
Improving transparency of public finances is critical. Full disclosure of the underlying
fiscal position would boost confidence and help communicate the need for adjustment. The
weakening of Petrobras’ financial position poses a risk to the public finances and to the company’s
investment plans. In this context, staff welcomes the ongoing investigation, and encourages the
authorities to take steps to limit any economic fallout from the probe and to prevent future
instances of procurement fraud and corruption.
42.
Monetary policy has been appropriately tightened, but bringing inflation to target
within the next two years will likely require some further tightening in the near term. While
moderate economic activity and planned fiscal consolidation should help reduce inflation, the
required re-alignment of relative prices, and the persistent cost-push arising from wage
negotiations, will necessitate monetary policy maintaining a tightening bias to deliver a significant
reduction in overall inflation by end-2016. Moreover, if currency weakness or the correction of
regulated prices were to fuel inflation expectations, monetary policy would need to be further
tightened.
43.
Staff welcomes the recent scale down of the foreign exchange intervention program.
Within the context of the flexible exchange rate regime, intervention can be useful when faced with
episodes of excessive volatility, as was the case when the current intervention program was
introduced. However, the continuous operation of the program could delay convergence of the
exchange rate to a more competitive value. In this context, the recent reduction in the scale of the
program should moderate its side effects, and consideration should be given to not renewing the
program further.
44.
Close monitoring and prudential measures could help deal with latent risks in private
sector balance sheets, including banks and corporates. In the current low growth environment,
there is a risk of deterioration in the quality of assets on banks’ balance sheets, especially
commercial loans to SMEs and non-housing consumer loans. Enhanced supervision and the pursuit
of targeted microprudential measures would help reduce such risks. Staff welcomes the enhanced
on- and off-site supervision of public banks by the central bank. Public banks should also be
encouraged to bolster their capital positions, including by retained earnings. Rising corporate
leverage, including through overseas borrowing, should be carefully monitored. It is important to
continue assessing whether corporates are adequately hedged.
45.
Structural reforms are critical for improving the economy’s productive capacity and to
anchor strong, sustained, and balanced growth over the medium term. Prioritizing these
reforms and getting an early start would be essential. Staff welcomes the emphasis placed on the
implementation of the infrastructure concessions program, and the intention to address tax
inefficiencies related to the ICMS and foster a more open economy in particular. It will be essential
to follow through with these efforts, and to consider other areas of reform as well.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Brazil: External Sector Assessment 20141
Brazil’s external position is weaker than the level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Reserves are adequate and FDI continues
to cover a significant share of the current account deficit. Further efforts to increase
national saving are needed, including by advancing with pension reform and shifting
the structure of public spending away from consumption. Foreign exchange
intervention, including through the use of derivatives, can be appropriate to address
bouts of excess volatility in the foreign exchange market arising from unstable capital
flows, but should not be used to resist currency pressures that reflect changes in
fundamentals.
Current account
1.

Brazil’s current account turned into deficit

over the past decade, despite large terms of trade
gains. Import volumes more than doubled since 2004,
supported by strong domestic demand, while export
volumes have remained broadly constant. Booming
commodity prices sustained exports and helped contain
the current account deficit, but the share of

the importance of commodity prices, were the terms of
trade to return to their 2005 level, Brazil’s current account
deficit would have reached 5.1 instead of 3.6 percent of
GDP in 2013. In recent years, the terms of trade have fallen
from record highs, with the current account deficit
reaching 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014.2

The authorities are in the process of revising external sector statistics in line with the sixth edition of the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position manual (BPM6). This movement is consistent with the
adoption of the new methodology of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) in Brazil, due to be published
by end March 2015. Revised BOP data are expected to be published in April 2015, with revised external debt data
expected in June. As part of this conversion, at least two important revisions will be made: foreign holdings of
domestic debt securities will be included in external debt statistics, and its income, up to now reflected jointly
with principal outflows in the portfolio account, will be recorded separately in the income account. Staff expects
that these changes will lead to upward revisions of both external debt and the current account deficit.

2.

The observed worsening of the current account balance reflects low savings. The

challenge to Brazil’s external sector outlook from a savings-investment perspective is that both
private and public savings are relatively low compared with other emerging economies. Since
2004, consumption has accounted for almost all the
growth in Brazil. Increasing domestic savings would help

8.0

prevent further deterioration in external balances over the

The current account appears weaker than

the range of -2.0 (EBA CA regression approach) to

‐1.2 percent of GDP (ES approach), broadly consistent
with staff’s assessment of a norm range of -0.5 to
‐2 percent of GDP. Combined with a cyclically adjusted
current account deficit of about 3.8 percent of GDP, the

current account gap in 2014 would range between
‐1.8 to ‐3.3 percent of GDP.3
4.

The current account deficit will improve over the medium term, but terms of trade

volatility and offshore oil exploration plans raise uncertainty surrounding projections. The
current account is projected to fall to 3.4 percent of GDP by 2020. This outlook is based on an
only modest recovery in domestic demand and some further worsening in the terms of trade.
These factors are expected to be more than offset by the weak real, a recovery in trading partner
growth and the expected boost to the oil balance. Further declines in export commodity prices
remain a key vulnerability as iron ore, soybeans and oil alone account for one third of total
exports. The development of Brazil’s off-shore oil potential will support the current account. The
oil balance—oil and distillates exports net of direct oil and distillates imports—is expected to

improve by around 1 percent of GDP by 2020. However, a variety of factors including pressures
on Petrobras’ balance sheet as part of the recent corruption scandal as well as the price of oil in
international markets increase uncertainty surrounding exploration projections. Moreover,
imports of machinery and other intermediate goods related to the construction of platforms and
the development of the oil fields will partly offset the boost to the current account.

The real effective exchange rate in 2014 was overvalued by some 10−20 percent on

average during the year. Estimates from the EBA REER approach suggest that the real was
undervalued by some 3 percent. However, staff assesses the REER approach to be less reliable
than other approaches in general, and especially so in the case of Brazil due to the wide
dispersion in the evolution of different measures of the REER. Based on the assessment of a
current account gap of ‐1.8 to -3.3 percent, staff’s assessment is that the real was some 10 to
20 percent over-valued on average in 2014. As of December 2014, the REER had depreciated by
some 6 percent compared to its 2014 average. For this reason, staff’s assessment is that the REER
was approximately 5−15 percent above the level implied by fundamentals and desirable policies
at end-2014.4

The exchange rate gap estimated based on the EBA REER approach moved from +7 percent to -3 percent

60 percent of total intercompany loans is made up of loans to Brazilian foreign investors
extended by their own subsidiaries. A likely cause for such loans is the large offshore debt
security issuance by foreign incorporated subsidiaries of Brazilian parent companies. The relevant
subsidiaries are largely based in the Cayman Islands and the Netherlands, with the parents
predominantly engaged in extractive industries and banking. The striking correlation between
offshore issuance by non-financial corporations and intercompany loans to Brazilian foreign
investors suggests that the majority of offshore issuance indeed returns to Brazil in the form of
FDI (an inflow of intercompany loans resulting from such offshore issuance can be regarded as
carrying a risk profile more similar to portfolio debt than other types of FDI inflows).

Brazil’s flexible exchange rate remains the most important shock absorber,

although prolonged intervention may have slowed convergence of the real toward more
competitive levels. Brazil has a flexible exchange rate which remained the most important shock
absorber, including during the market turbulence since May 2013. The authorities have not
conducted any spot market interventions since 2012 but relied on the use of foreign exchange
swaps (conventional non-deliverable forwards settled in local currency) and Brazilian foreign
exchange repos (conventional foreign exchange swaps) to contain market volatility (see Selected
Issues Paper on FX intervention). Intervention can be useful when faced with episodes of
excessive volatility, as was the case when the current intervention program was introduced. The
program initially served this purpose well, being targeted directly to reducing the cost of
hedging during the financial market turmoil following the Fed’s tapering announcement but may
also have encouraged additional risk taking by the private sector. Moreover, the continued
extension of the program may have slowed convergence of the exchange rate to a more
competitive value.

Nevertheless, in recent years Caixa has ventured into other, higher-risk credit segments, such as
non-payroll personal loans, credit card, and SME loans. Delinquencies at public banks started to
pick up in 2014, a trend which is likely to continue, especially in the newer credit segments. This
said, credit growth deceleration in public banks in 2014 was most marked in these newer credit
segments.
2.

When looking at loan performance, it is clear that traditional business lines have

held up their quality over time. BNDES’s NPL ratio has been under 0.3 percent over the past
three years, even taking into account the effects of OGX’s bankruptcy last year, a much
publicized case. Banco do Brasil (BB) reduced the share of non-earmarked loans and replaced it
with rural credits and real estate loans, and as a result its NPL by loan vintage has gradually
decreased over the past three years. Caixa maintained the quality of its mortgage loans high by
applying loan-to-value caps at around 70 percent.
3.

However, some high-risk lines of business have recently shown declining

performance. Delinquencies in these loans are rapidly increasing. Should the deterioration of
economic activity persist, the repayment capacity of households and firms will be weakened and
thus public banks will need to set aside more provisions, impairing its earnings. Even if this trend
does not imply systemic risk given their large loan loss provision and capital buffers (which guard
against expected and unexpected losses, respectively), they will need to tighten lending
standards to preserve asset quality.

Additional fiscal consolidation measures should

the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix IV. The Inflation Targeting Framework1
1.

Inflation has been above the midpoint of the central bank’s tolerance band for several

years, and longer-term inflation expectations have risen. Estimates suggest that inflation
expectations (1−3 years ahead) have
risen due to both higher inflation
outturns and perceptions of higher
2

inflation in the medium term , reflecting
at particular times foreseeable price
pressures, but also some questions
about the operation of the policy
framework itself.
2.

Brazil's central bank has

enjoyed ‘de facto’ independence
since 1999, but it does not have
statutory independence. The central
bank currently enjoys what is
commonly known as ‘instrument
independence’, choosing how to best
meet the inflation target determined by
the National Monetary Council.
However, as shown in a survey
conducted by the Bank of England3,
Brazil's central bank is unique among
inflation-targeting central banks for two

Governors do not have fixed-term contracts and can be dismissed by the president at any time.

Inflation expectations data are sourced from Consensus Economics. Contributions to inflation expectations are
estimated using a non-linear Kalman filter with time-varying parameters and state constraints. At each horizon h,
expectations are modeled as:

is inflation expectations at horizon h,
is
year-over-year inflation in the IPCA,
is an unobserved expectation of medium-term inflation, and
is an
idiosyncratic error. The weight associated with current inflation and medium-term inflation at horizon h
is
restricted to be between 0 and 1.

3.

While no institutional framework guarantees success, experience suggests a higher

degree of autonomy can help central banks execute their functions more effectively. Over the
medium term, this can make them less prone to episodes where doubts are raised over government
influence, particularly when inflation deviates from the midpoint of the tolerance range for some
time. In fact, "central bank independence, accountability and transparency" is a core Basel principle
of banking regulation.
4.

Brazil’s inflation tolerance band is relatively wide and can accommodate persistent

inflation deviations from target midpoint. Brazil has a wide tolerance band relative to other
central banks with inflation targets, with a target that allows inflation to range between 2.5 percent
and 6.5 percent. Moreover, the inflation target as currently specified (in terms of 12-month inflation
in December) allows inflation to be outside the tolerance band for all but one month of the year,
unlike other central banks whose targets are specified in a more permanent fashion. This design
permits outcomes which, while formally in compliance with the framework, can erode its credibility
and contribute to increases in long-run inflation expectations.

bank’s effectiveness and
credibility going forward,

complemented with measures that enhance accountability, such as mandating the achievement of
price stability as the monetary policy objective (also recommended in the FSAP), narrowing the
inflation tolerance band, and better clarifying the medium-term inflation target. Stronger autonomy
and accountability for the central bank would bolster the effectiveness of the inflation targeting
framework over the long term.

Appendix V. Measurement of Gross Public Debt in Brazil1
This Appendix explains in detail the methodological difference between the Brazil’s
Central Bank (BCB) indicator of General Government Gross Debt (GGGD) and that
employed by the Fund, which follows the guidelines in the current Government Financial
Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001 and 2014 editions).2The key difference between these
indicators is the treatment of government bonds held by the BCB and not pledged as
security in monetary policy operations, which are counted as part of government debt
under GFSM standards, but not under the BCB’s definition.

A.

Institutional background and the GFSM 2001 conceptual approach

1.

As many other central banks, the BCB performs monetary policy interventions through

the use of government securities.3 The Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2000 (FRL) prevents the
Brazilian central bank from issuing its own debt instruments; thus, the FRL obliges the BCB to retain
government securities for the conduct of monetary policy operations. In fact, when the FRL went
into effect, the BCB was in possession of a stock of government securities of different kinds acquired
over time in different ways. By also banning direct financing of the Treasury by the BCB, the FRL in
effect called for special procedures for the central bank to maintain and increase its holdings of
government bonds. Between December 2000 and September 2003, the central government issued
securities (amounting to 7.8 percent of GDP) which were included in the BCB’s restructured portfolio
(Figure 1). The issuance of these securities was fully reflected in the increase of central government
gross debt reported by the government in its official statistics.
2.

Since 2008, the government can issue securities directly to the BCB, which can be

automatically rolled over by the latter. A 2008 law authorized the direct issuance of securities by
the Treasury to the BCB, without a counter-payment by the BCB, consistent with the FRL’s principle
of no central bank financing for the government (see Box). These direct issuances have the same
terms and a similar maturity structure as the bonds in the hands of the public.4 Since 2008, the
accumulation of government securities in the BCB’s balance sheet reflects to a large extent

The appendix focuses on differences pertaining to the measurement of gross debt of the General Government only.
These differences carry over to the measurement of gross debt of the nonfinancial public sector, which is presented
in Table 3 of the Staff Report.

The BCB reduces liquidity by selling government securities under repurchase agreements (REPOs) to money market
participants; these securities remain on the balance sheet of the central bank, which effectively uses them as
collateral. To increase liquidity, the BCB engages in buy-back transactions of the central government debt securities.

compensation for unrealized financial losses by the BCB, related to changes in the valuation of
international reserves (see Box) and, more recently, losses on FX swaps operations. In addition, the
2008 law foresees that the central bank can automatically roll over the Treasury securities, which in
practice the BCB always does to keep an adequate amount of securities available for liquidity
management (REPOs).5
Box. Equalização Cambial and the Evolution of Debt
The legal framework governing the relations between the Federal Government (FG) and the BCB states that
whenever the BCB makes a profit, the whole amount must be transferred to the Federal Government
through a deposit in the single treasury account. If the BCB makes a loss, the Federal Government must
compensate that loss by issuing debt securities to be placed in the BCB’s portfolio.
In November 2008, the Law 11803 established a swap operation between the BCB and the National Treasury
regarding the financial results of international reserves and financial derivatives operations. The law applies
to unrealized and realized gains or losses incurred by the BCB as the holder of those assets. 1 Data on this
financial result (positive or negative) are disseminated by the BCB under the item “Equalização Cambial” (EC)
on the General Government Debt tables. The authorities consider it in the compilation of the net debt (a
positive result decreases net debt; a negative result increases net debt), but not in the gross debt (GGGD)
indicator. While profits are transferred semi-annually 10 days after the publication of the budget,
recapitalization takes place with some delay.
EC is calculated by the BCB on a daily basis and includes changes in the valuation of reserves, carry cost of
reserves, and the result of operations with swaps and derivatives.
_____________________________

At end-2008, the financial result of these operations resulted in a holding gain of R$171.4 billion. Although unrealized,
this gain was effectively transferred to the single treasury account (in March 2009). At end-2009 the result was a holding
loss of R$52.2 billion, which was compensated by the central government through the issuance of a corresponding
amount of securities to be placed in the BCB’s portfolio. The end-2014 result was a holding gain of R$65.2 billion.

B.

The BCB’s measure of GGGD: concept and comparative evolution

3.

The BCB’s portfolio of government securities is divided in two subsets: securities

currently pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements, and securities not in use as collateral
(free securities), which the authorities consider of BCB’s “outright ownership.” The evolution of these
securities over time can be seen in Figure 1 and reflects (i) government security issuances for
accumulation at the BCB, and (ii) the trend increase in REPO operations. Under the GFSM 2001/2014,
assets pledged for REPOs remain on the original owner’s balance sheet, a criterion consistent with
generally accepted accounting practice, and a criterion that had also been followed by the BCB in its
own reporting of GGGD until 2008.
5

An additional 2009 regulation is still in place stipulating that the government will issue new paper to the BCB when
its uncollateralized portfolio (see Footnote 3) falls below R$20 billion.

authorities changed the methodology for
disseminating GGGD by excluding the

government revenue (although interest is accrued, no cash payments take place; instead, new
securities are issued to service the liability); (ii) free securities do not affect the market conditions
(yield and maturities of normal debt issuances), as those securities are not acquired by the BCB in
the market; (iii) they do not reflect the financing needs of the general government; and (iv) these
securities do not give rise to refinancing risk. Although true in practice, arguments (i) and (ii) are not
relevant for the definition of “liability” under GFSM 2001/2014.6 Neither are arguments (iii) and
(iv), which are further discussed below.
5.

Regardless of whether they were meant to finance a government deficit or not,

Treasury securities held by the BCB represent a claim on the general government and are
therefore considered part of the GGGD under the GFSM 2001/2014. The GFSM standard defines
the BCB as a financial corporation, classified outside the government sector. Consequently, gross
transactions and stock positions between the BCB and the government are to be recorded
accordingly. In particular, when the government issues securities to the BCB, a financial claim (on the
government) is created and recorded at the BCB’s balance sheet. The government is obliged to
service this debt. From the accounting perspective, a liability of equal value is to be simultaneously
incurred by the government as the counterpart of the BCB financial asset. So long as the BCB holds
the asset, the liability is part of the GGGD, according to the GFSM 2001/2014. It bears noting that, in
its own balance sheet, the BCB still counts its total holdings of government securities as part of its
assets.

6

The national definition is nevertheless reported as a memorandum item in the GFSM Brazil country Table 8, as well
as in Table 3 of the Staff Report.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

6.

The wedge between the national and GFSM definitions of gross debt (that is, the stock

of free securities held by the BCB) has varied considerably over time. The evolution of the two
indicators―GGGD with and without free securities―is plotted in Figure 2. Although the difference
amounted to over 15 percent of GDP in the past, it has narrowed considerably through November
2014 (to 3.2 percent of GDP), although it increased to 6.1 percent of GDP in December 2014.
Incidentally, the two series suggest somewhat different trends in public debt; with the Fund measure
showing a clearer declining trend in the pre-crisis years.
7.

By excluding free securities, the authorities’ measure of GGGD is affected by central

bank sterilization operations. For a given stock of government securities in its portfolio, every time
the central bank conducts REPO transactions, the authorities’ GGGD indicator will change in equal
measure. Thus, by this definition, public debt rises (falls) when the central bank mops up (injects)
liquidity. The authorities find this a useful feature of the indicator as it induces lower monthly
variation of the GGGD series (because the BCB sterilizes the short-term impact of government
operations on market liquidity), even if the same smoothing effect is not observed at a yearly
frequency. In any case, neither the Fund’s nor authorities’ gross debt concept is simply explained by
the trajectory of the general government deficit in the last several years owing to the accumulation
of government debt issued in favor of public banks (policy lending). Changes in net debt are thus
closer to the government’s net lending, as both the Treasury Single Account and claims on public
banks are netted out.

The negligible refinancing risk of public debt held by the central bank is

acknowledged in the discussion of risks in staff’s Debt Sustainability Analysis for Brazil. While
there is no legal obligation for the BCB to roll over its holdings of government debt indefinitely, the
BCB has always done it, meaning that amortization of this debt does not create a need for financing
from capital markets. Thus, actual gross financing needs from the market are lower than those
measured by the amortization of total government debt (as measured by GFSM2001/2014): about
14 of GDP in public debt will be rolled over in 2015, of which 10.3 percent of GDP in the market.

Safeguards Assessments: A safeguards assessment of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) was
completed in June 2002 and updated in March 2005.
Exchange Rate Arrangement: Since January 18, 1999, Brazil’s de facto and de jure foreign
exchange regime has been classified as floating. Brazil accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective November 30, 1999.
Staff has determined that the tax on financial transactions (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras,
IOF) of 6.38 percent on exchange transactions carried out by credit card, debit card, and traveler's
checks (including cash withdrawals) companies in order to fulfill their payment obligations for
purchases of goods and services abroad by their customers gives rise to multiple currency practices
(MCP) subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. In January 2008, the IOF for
these exchange transactions was raised to 2.38 percent and then further increased to 6.38 percent in
March 2011. The scope of operations was expanded to other foreign exchange transactions than
with credit cards in December 2013.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation with Brazil was concluded by the Executive Board on July 26, 2013.
Brazil is on the 12-month cycle. Joint Fund/World Bank missions visited Brazil in 2002 for the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which was discussed by the Board in December 2002.
A FSAP Update mission took place in March 2012.
Technical Assistance
Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD). In September 2001, an FAD mission conducted a fiscal ROSC, and
in December 2001 a mission provided Technical Assistance (TA) on tax reform. Subsequent missions
have discussed the scope for increasing investment in infrastructure within a framework of
continued fiscal responsibility, including during a follow-up visit in November 2004. In July 2008, a
ROSC on fiscal transparency was undertaken for the state of São Paulo, which also received a
seminar on performance budgeting in November 2008. In December 2009 a mission visited São
Paulo to examine the state’s medium-term expenditure framework with the purpose of improving
fiscal performance and the quality of public expenditure. In November 2010, a short-term expert
visited São Paulo to provide advice on cost accounting and a long-term advisor was installed in
February 2011 to support efforts in this area. In April a follow-up mission evaluated progress in

implementing the program budgeting and cost accounting systems. In May 2011, a short-term
expert followed-up on the implementation of the program budgeting reforms. Between July 2011
and November 2014, FAD conducted several missions on public financial management, focusing on
the review of the cost accounting systems and on improvements to the budgeting system in the
State of São Paulo.
Statistics Department (STA). Several missions have visited Brazil during 1998–2014 to provide TA
on monetary and financial statistics, annual and quarterly national income accounts, and
government finance. These missions also assisted the authorities in the subscription to the SDDS,
improving the analytical quality of Brazil’s monetary aggregates, the development of quarterly
sectoral accounts and balance sheets and the implementation of GFSM 2001. Recent missions have
assisted the Ministry of Finance, the Banco Central do Brasil and the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia
e Estatística with the compilation of government finance statistics, price indices and the new
national accounts framework, with greater emphasis on the consistency across macroeconomic
statistics.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). Missions visited Brazil in 2000 to assess
observance of the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies and
compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. In August and
December 2009, missions visited to assist the capital markets regulator (CVM) in considering mutual
funds development and regulation, and issues surrounding securitization and valuation of financial
securities. A mission visited in August 2009 to work on credit risk modeling for financial oversight. In
March 2010 a mission visited the National Treasury to initiate a technical cooperation project on
term-structure modeling and debt management. A follow up mission to present preliminary results
took place in January 2011. The project was completed in May 2011 with the publication of an IMF
working paper (No. 11/113), “On Brazil’s Term Structure: Stylized Facts and Analysis of
Macroeconomic Interactions.”

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
The World Bank approved its Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Brazil for FY 2012−15 in
November 2011. The CPS built on, and deepened, the last FY 2008‒11 Country Strategy. The main
objective of the World Bank Group (WBG) program during this period has been to make a catalytic
contribution to Brazil’s efforts to eradicate poverty and to become a more prosperous and inclusive
country. The World Bank Group has been a valued partner for Brazil, providing integrated and often
multi-sector development solutions tailored to its needs. The Bank has also benefited greatly from
Brazil’s unique demands, which required the WBG to adapt and learn and provided a broad range of
lessons on development for the Global Community in areas ranging from poverty reduction to social
inclusion and environmental management.
In August 2014, the World Bank approved the progress report for the CPS. The Progress Report
found that, while the rapid growth expected at the outset of the CPS period had been more elusive
than expected, Brazil achieved significant success in reducing poverty and promoting shared
prosperity in an inclusive and sustainable manner, with the support of Bank programs. Brazil remains
one of the World Bank Group’s most important partners, drawing on significant financial, knowledge
and convening services of all the Bank Group entities; testing innovative new instruments and
multi-sectoral approaches to solving development problems.
Brazil’s priorities for its partnership with the WBG are focused on second-generation
development problems that require innovative solutions. At the request of the government, the
FY 12−15 CPS program has continued to strengthen the focus on sub-national entities, combining
analytical and technical support at the federal level with the IBRD’s largest lending program,
implemented mostly through multi-sectoral operations at the subnational level. The program also
provides significant knowledge, advisory, convening and South-South activities in order to address
second generation development issues and to share the lessons of Brazil across the globe. The
Bank’s work has focused on supporting catalytic investments and policy reforms whose impact can
be enhanced through replication and that benefit from the Bank’s unique blend of financial and
knowledge services. The heavy emphasis on multi-sector approaches reflects the multi-dimensional
nature of addressing key development problems presented by the needs of country counterparts.
The key building blocks of the strategy―its 4 strategic objectives and 14 results areas―remain
relevant to, and well aligned with government priorities. The strategic objectives are focused on
addressing key development challenges and are mutually reinforcing. They are: (i) increasing the
efficiency of public and private investment; (ii) enhancing service provision to poorer segments of
the population; (iii) reducing regional economic disparities; and (iv) improving sustainable natural
resource management and climate resilience.

IBRD lending program was US$2.019 billion for FY 14, and is programmed at US$1.5 billion
for FY 15. While this is in line with previous years, it is equivalent to less than 0.3 percent of total
public expenditures. IFC's investment program is forecast at about US$1.7 billion in FY 15, a minute
fraction of total private sector investment. Thus, the WBG impact in Brazil cannot be derived
exclusively from the size of its financial contributions, which are bound to be small with respect to
the country’s own resources. Rather, the WBG is seeking to have a development impact in Brazil
through the knowledge contributions that it will embed in its various activities. In particular, the
Bank Group deploys its resources according to the following principles. Flexibility: Adjusting areas of
engagement and instruments to better respond to the country’s evolving needs. Selectivity:
Focusing on areas where Brazil faces second-generation development challenges and can benefit
most from the Group’s knowledge and experience. Innovation: Supporting innovative investments
and policy reforms that can be replicated locally and internationally, and offering innovative services
and instruments (e.g. result-based and multi-sector loans, partial credit risk and other guarantees).
Leveraging: Increasing the use of leveraged resources from government, the private sector and
other development partners, to maximize development impacts.
IFC will continue responding to the needs of a rapidly-evolving private sector with a suite of
competitive financial and advisory products. IFC’s investment portfolio in Brazil now stands at
US$4.3 billion, including US$1.7 billion from syndications, making it the Corporation’s third largest
country program. IFC new commitments totaled US$2 billion in FY 13, including an IFC
member-state record of US$514 million in equity. In FY 14 they reached US$1.8 billion. Looking
forward, the commitment target for FY 15 is US$1.7 billion with investments geared toward:
infrastructure, telecom, health, education, agribusiness and financial institutions, supporting the
country in financial inclusion, urbanization, competitiveness and sustainable management of natural
resources. In addition to its investment projects, IFC has provided Brazil’s fast-growing private sector
with various advisory services, including a partnership with BNDES for public-private partnerships
(PPP).
MIGA has recently processed its first exposure transaction in Brazil since FY 09. While MIGA
has had no exposure in the Brazil in recent years, it views Brazil as a target market, where it can
support the government’s agenda of meeting the country’s massive infrastructure requirements,
through the provision of guarantees of Non-Honoring Financial Obligations (NHSFO) in respect of
financial payment obligations of the sovereign, sub-sovereign and state-owned enterprises. These
products provide credit enhancement to borrowers to enable them to (i) reduce their funding costs,
(ii) increase their access to long-term financing, and (iii) diversify their financing sources. A case in
point is the São Paulo Sustainable Transport Project. MIGA’s NHSFO guarantee, which was approved
by the Executive Directors in April 2014, will mobilize long-term commercial bank financing on
competitive terms, by guaranteeing the State of São Paulo’s financial obligations under such bank
financing. Brazil will also be the first IBRD beneficiary of the Bank Group's effort to take advantage of
synergies across the balance sheets of World Bank Group entities. Brazil will gain about
US$100 million in additional IBRD lending headroom through an exchange of existing IBRD
exposure to Brazil, where MIGA has the capacity to assume higher exposure, for MIGA exposure to
Panama, a country where IBRD has available capacity.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The IDB’s Country Strategy with Brazil was approved on May 9, 2012. This was established for
the period 2012−14 and is comprised of six strategic objectives: (1) stimulate social and productive
inclusion; (2) improve the condition of the country’s infrastructure; (3) promote the development of
sustainable cities; (4) improve the institutional capacity of public entities; (5) increase the sustainable
management of natural resources and climate change mitigation and adaptation actions; and
(6) promote development through the private sector. A new Country Strategy with Brazil for the
period 2015−18 is under preparation, and it is expected to be approved in the second semester of
the current year.
For 2015, the total loan approvals are projected to reach US$1,856.0 million. Loans with
sovereign guarantee make the bulk of the operations, amounting to US$1,609.0 million, while
operations with the private sector are expected to total US$247 million.2 In addition, the IDB
program in the period estimates approvals of US$4.8 million in grants for Technical Cooperation.
In 2014, the IDB approved 30 loans amounting to US$2,947.8 million, including 21 sovereign
guarantee operations for US$2,240.8 million. Half of the lending went to support productivity
and infrastructure (50 percent), stimulate social and productive inclusion (22 percent) and
institutional strengthening and modernization of the state (20 percent) and lending to subnational
governments corresponded to 71 percent of total lending to Brazil. Among the major operations
approved, some highlights are: (a) São Paulo State Road Investment Program Phase II

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 30, 2015)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: The quality of macroeconomic statistics has improved significantly, and data provision is

adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The national accounts estimates are compiled based on the guidelines of the

1993 System of National Accounts. The availability of annual and quarterly supply and use tables also
contribute to the development of consistent national accounts estimates. The series (data and
supporting methodological notes) are available on the internet (http://www.ibge.gov.br) and in
International Financial Statistics (IFS). The IBGE is in the process of changing the base year of the
national accounts and implementing the System of National Accounts 2008. It is also participating in
the G-20 Data Gaps Initiative regarding recommendation 15, which calls for developing a strategy to
promote the compilation and dissemination of the balance sheet approach, flow of funds, and
sectoral data on a quarterly and annual basis.
Price Statistics: Since July 1999, the official consumer price index has been the Broad Consumer Price

Index (IPCA) compiled by the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE). The IPCA covers changes in the
prices of goods and services purchased by households earning between one and forty times the
minimum wage in 11 metropolitan areas. Wholesale price indices are compiled only by the Getúlio
Vargas Foundation (FGV). The export price data include total unit values of exports, and unit values
and wholesale prices of coffee exports. The IBGE compiles a monthly producer price index of
manufacturing activity with a December 2009 base.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance and the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) compile

and disseminate government finance statistics using the Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM) 2001 presentation. The reported statistics include the statement of government operations
and financial balance sheet for the consolidated central government (comprising the National
Treasury and Social Security) as well as financing operations and the financial balance sheet for the
general government. The reported data are compiled by converting the nationally published data,
which still broadly follow the GFSM 1986 framework. The data reflect the movements of the single
treasury account and are on a cash basis except for interest. The gross debt indicator excludes
government securities under the central bank’s outright ownership, making international
comparisons difficult.
In 2009, the Brazilian authorities developed a migration plan for the full implementation the GFSM
2001. This plan comprises the introduction of a new accounting framework based on the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), which merges the traditional budgetary
approach, the accrual based accounting, and some additional internal controls into a single system.
This new accounting framework significantly enhances the usefulness of the Brazilian public sector
accounting information, which will be a significant step towards the compilation of complete GFS in
a systematic way, and is expected to be in place in 2015.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (Concluded)

Monetary and Financial Statistics: The BCB compiles and publishes monetary and financial statistics,

with concepts, definitions, and classification that are broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. In close cooperation with STA, the BCB introduced the standardized
report forms based on accounting data in March 2013. However, the institutional coverage of the
other financial corporations needs to be expanded to include insurance corporations, open pension
funds, capitalization funds, and exchange houses.
The BCB regularly reports quarterly FSIs to the IMF for publication. Currently, the BCB reports all
core and 18 encouraged FSIs, with data beginning in Q1 2005. Plans are under way to compile the
rest of the encouraged FSIs.
External Sector Statistics: Brazil disseminates quarterly data on the balance of payments and

international investment position. External data are compiled according to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The BCB is supplementing the registry of the foreign exchange system
with surveys on transportation, insurance, and other services. Compilation of reinvested earnings
and undistributed branch profits item in the current account and reinvested earnings item in the
financial account could be improved, as the registry of the foreign exchange system does not
capture these transactions. The BCB publishes the data for monthly balance of payments and the
Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity with a lag of one month.
Brazil reports quarterly total external debt position data with a three-month lag to the World Bank’s
Quarterly External Debt Statistics database. The authorities are in the process of revising external
sector statistics in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position manual (BPM6). This movement is consistent with the adoption of the new
methodology of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) in Brazil, due to be published by end
March 2015. Revised BOP data are expected to be published in April 2015, with revised external debt
data expected in June. As part of this conversion, at least two important revisions will be made:
foreign holdings of domestic debt securities will be included in external debt statistics, and its
income, up to now reflected jointly with principal outflows, will be recorded separately.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Gross debt of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) has remained high in recent
years, reaching 71 percent of GDP in 2014, whereas net debt has declined by
13 percentage points of GDP in the last decade to 37.6 percent of GDP in 2014. The
debt maturity profile and composition have improved over time, but spreads on
government bonds remain somewhat elevated and external financing requirements
are large. Primary surpluses around 1.6 percent of GDP (excluding interest revenue)
are needed simply to keep gross debt from growing as a ratio to GDP, and larger
primary balances will be needed to put the gross debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward
path. In the baseline scenario, which is consistent with the government’s announced
targets for 2015−17, gross debt decreases by 2.2 percentage points to 68.8 percent
of GDP by 2020. The trajectory of gross debt is sensitive to growth and fiscal policy
underperformance given the pressure arising from high borrowing costs.

A. Background
Debt coverage. Brazil’s gross debt statistics cover the NFPS, defined to exclude Petrobras and
Eletrobras and consolidate the Sovereign Wealth Fund. The NFPS debt includes Treasury
securities on the central bank's balance sheet, including those not used under repurchase
agreements. At end-2014, the gross debt amounted to 71 percent of GDP.2 The (consolidated)
public sector has a large stock of assets, amounting to 39.1 percent of GDP in 2014, which
include 19.4 percent of GDP in international reserves. Although net debt reported by the
government corresponds to the public sector, defined to include the central bank, in this Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) we use net debt of the NFPS to maintain consistency. Nonfinancial public sector assets amount to 32.5 percent of GDP (see Box). Brazil’s debt is reported
at nominal value.3
Debt profile. Brazil’s Federal government
(FG) domestic tradable securities account
for 92 percent of total NFPS gross debt in
2014, of which 2/3 were held by the public.4
Active debt management in recent years has
improved the profile of these instruments,

The national definition of gross debt includes the stock of Treasury securities used for monetary policy
purposes by the central bank (those pledged as security in reverse repo operations), but excludes the rest of
the government securities held by the central bank. According to the national definition, gross debt of the
general government amounted to 64.2 percent of GDP at end-2014.

The nominal value is calculated by discounting future interest and principal payments at the existing
contractual interest rate(s), and generally differs from face value.

The rest is held by the central bank on its balance sheet. The central bank uses over half of its holdings as
security in liquidity-draining operations with the banking system.

which now display longer maturities, of about 4.4 years on average, up from less than 3 years
in 2008. Still, a large share of domestic tradable securities, nearly 25 percent of total, matures
within 1 year.5 The government has the objective of raising average maturity to 5.5 years and
bringing total short term debt (on both original and residual maturity basis) down toward 20
percent of all debt. Fixed-rate and inflation-linked domestic bonds have gradually replaced
foreign-currency linked instruments and floating-rate bonds. Zero-coupon bonds with original
maturities over one year constitute slightly more than half of FG domestic tradable securities
held by the public, or 21.7 percent of GDP. Foreign holding of domestic debt has increased
and amounted to 17 percent of total at end-2014.
In addition to tradable securities, other NFPS debt consist of liabilities issued by SOEs and
subnational governments, as well as direct bank lending to the FG. Foreign currency
denominated debt of the NFPS accounted for only 5 percent of the total in 2014, representing
slightly more than 4 percent of GDP. Gross financing needs have tended to be high, above
15 percent of GDP. However, this figure overstates rollover risk, as a large fraction of the
federal government debt (about 20 percent of GDP, with a maturity profile in line with that of
overall debt) is held by the central bank, which follows a policy of automatic rollover of its
holdings of government securities.

Although gross non-financial public sector (NFPS) debt has
declined only marginally over the past decade, net debt has
been on a mostly downward path. Brazil has made important
strides in improving the debt profile, now displaying longer
maturities, lower foreign exposure, and a higher share of fixedrate instruments. Yet, while gross debt has hovered above
65 percent of GDP over the past decade, net debt was reduced
significantly, supported by strong accumulation of assets. What
lies behind this evolution of assets and liabilities?

Lending through development banks and sterilization of
capital inflows have been the main drivers of the widening wedge between gross and net debt. The
build-up of assets has reflected the countercyclical policy followed in response to the global crisis, which was
based on lending through development banks. In addition, sterilization of large foreign inflows that has
resulted in an increase in international reserves has had as a counterpart growing Treasury cash holdings at
the central bank (TSA). The TSA balances hit 11.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (compared to 7.1 percent in 2003)
while credit to public financial institutions, mainly the national development bank (BNDES), increased from
0.5 percent of GDP before the global crisis to 10.8 percent of GDP in 2014. In addition, a large share of
assets of the Workers’ Assistance Fund (FAT)―now amounting to 4 percent of GDP, are mainly invested in
the BNDES since, by its constitution, at least 40 percent of FAT’s annual revenues must be transferred to

This is broadly a recurring situation. At original maturity, short-term debt is very small, amounting some
2 percent of total NFPS debt.

such lending operations. The repayment profile of BNDES
loans is very favorable, with terms as long as 40 years, and
grace periods of up to 20 years for the principal repayment and 5 years for interest. The interest rates BNDES
charges on its loans are linked to the long-term interest rate (the TJLP), set by the National Monetary
Council, which has been around 5−6 percent in since 2009. Reflecting attractiveness of BNDES loans to firms
and high loan portfolio quality, historical default rates on BNDES loans have been below 3 percent and NPLs
have more recently been near 0. From the government’s perspective, despite the low risk profile of its loans
to BNDES, their liquidity is by construction low because these loans are not in the form of a negotiable
security. Their economic value is below their book value because the government borrows at the SELIC rate
and earns the TJLP on its loans to BNDES.3 Thus, the grant element implicit in government loans to BNDES is
about 52 percent. The NPV of the stock of credit to BNDES, calculated with the government’s borrowing cost
as the discount factor, was below 4 percent of GDP at end-2014, less than half its nominal value.
There may be scope for achieving a better balance between gross debt and assets in the near future.
Because assets have low liquidity or value (loans to BNDES) or must be maintained at reasonable
precautionary levels (cash), gross debt remains the most useful indicator; thus, lowering the gross debt ratio
is an important policy objective. Transfers from the Federal Government to BNDES are expected to stop,
although BNDES will remain involved in funding of investment, including in infrastructure, by recycling its
funds, and fostering capital market development including through guarantees. However, a sustained
decline in gross debt will in any case have to be based on ambitious primary surpluses.

The NFPS includes the FAT. Because there is no pre-defined amortization schedule, FAT’s claims on BNDS can be
considered as quasi-equity.
2

Moreover, the TSA is remunerated at an average rate interest paid by the federal government securities in the central
bank’s portfolio, about 10−11 percent during the same period.

BNDES is subject to Basel III requirements as other financial institutions in Brazil.

B. Baseline Scenario
Macroeconomic assumptions. The projections assume a real GDP contraction of -1 percent in
2015, a slight recovery in 2016, and a gradual return to potential growth of 2.5 percent by the end of
the projection horizon. The assumed fiscal adjustment brings the primary balance to 2.5 percent of
GDP by 2018, which implies an improvement of 3.1 percentage points of GDP during 2015−18.
Policy lending is projected to stop from 2015. The nominal interest rates on new borrowing are
between 11 and 13 percent over 2015−20, bringing the effective interest rate below 12 percent on
average.6 The DSA also assumes that deposits are made into the TSA held at the Central Bank to
keep its balances constant at 11.9 percent of GDP (the latest observation) throughout the projection
period. The baseline scenario assumes policy strengthening and implementation of the
infrastructure concessions program, but otherwise limited structural reforms and a modest world
output recovery. In this baseline, gross debt increases to 72 percent of GDP in 2015 before it
declines to 68.8 percent of GDP in 2020. Gross financing needs are projected to remain above the
high risk threshold of 15 percent of GDP on average over the medium term. The primary balance
required to stabilize debt in the baseline scenario is 1.6 percent of GDP (excluding interest revenue).7
Past forecast errors. There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline
assumptions that would undermine the assessment of sustainability and the projected fiscal
adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. The median forecast error for GDP growth
and the primary balance is below 1 percent and in line with other countries’ forecast errors.
Realism of projections. Brazil’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of about 3 percentage
point in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is ambitious, but it
appears achievable. The magnitude of adjustment is also in line with other countries’ experiences,
with a 3‐year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted primary balance at the 20 percentile among all
surveillance countries.8

C. Shocks and Stress Tests


Growth shock. The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio of the 1 standard deviation shock
(2.6 percent) to real GDP growth is large. Over 2016-17, real GDP growth rates become negative
while inflation declines by 150 bps in each year. The primary balance worsens before recovering
in 2018; interest rates increase by 55 bps for each percentage point decline in output growth. In

6

Interest rates on new borrowing are projected to behave in line with the latest yield curve of each instrument
augmented for the change in the DI curve.
7

The debt stabilizing primary balance shown on the right-most column of the table on “Contributions to changes in
public debt” in the Baseline Scenario (3.1 percent of GDP) corresponds to a concept of the primary balance that
includes interest revenue. The definition of the primary balance as a non-interest concept is customary in Brazil and
corresponds to 1.6 percent of GDP quoted in the main text.
8

The interaction between growth and inflation are Brazil-specific and were estimated through a macro-model by
desks. The estimates of the fiscal multipliers and persistence are part of the 2015 Article IV Selected Issues Paper. The
fiscal multiplier and the persistence are estimated at 0.3 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

BRAZIL

this scenario, gross debt increases above 81.5 percent of GDP by 2019 and stabilizes at
81.1 percent in 2020 while gross financing needs reach almost 23 percent of GDP.


Primary balance and real interest rate shocks. In the primary balance shock consolidation is
delayed by one year. In the interest rate shock borrowing costs increase by 200 bps in the first
projection year and remain the same over the medium term. The impact of these shocks on debt
and gross financing needs is modest, pushing up debt-to-GDP by 2 percentage points above
the baseline in 2020.



Combined macro-fiscal shock and contingent liabilities shocks. The macro-fiscal shock combines
the growth and interest rates shock and a primary balance shock as in the standard examples
above, together with the real exchange rate shock consistent with a maximum movement of the
real exchange rate over the past 10 years and a pass-through coefficient of 0.25. The contingent
liability shock simulates a loss of 10 percent of banking system assets, in line with the experience
with past banking crises in other countries, and assumption of contingent liabilities by the public
sector. The latter results in a primary deficit of ‐3.6 percent of GDP in 2016 and a 1 standard
deviation shock to GDP growth in 2016 and 2017. The effect of these shocks on debt ratios and
gross financing needs is large and reflects in particular the sensitivity of debt to growth shocks,
which make the largest contribution to the change in the debt path. Debt-to-GDP reaches about
85 percent by 2020 in both shocks.



Heat map. In addition to the vulnerabilities from shocks discussed above, the heat map suggests
that the premium asked by the market on government borrowing, the reliance on external
financing, and the share of short-term debt are all high pointing to risks to the debt profile. As
noted earlier, however, the gross financing need indicator overstates actual rollover risk as a
result of the policy of continuous rollover maintained by the Central Bank, which holds a
significant amount of FG bonds.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 10, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Brazil
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
Consultation1 with Brazil on March 16, 2015.
Starting in 2015, the new government has been introducing a series of measures to strengthen
macroeconomic policies and restore credibility following a period in which Brazil’s growth has
surprised on the downside. Determined implementation of these measures should help restore
confidence and foster a recovery in growth and investment in due course.
Brazil’s growth has decelerated in recent years.2 The boost from decade-old reforms, expanding
labor income, and favorable external conditions, which enabled consumption and credit-led
growth and underpinned sustained poverty reduction, has lost steam. Investment has been
sluggish, reflecting eroding competitiveness, a worsening business environment, and lower
commodity prices. Consumption has also moderated despite strong wage increases, as job
creation has halted and financial conditions have tightened, affecting household income and
consumer confidence.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

References to GDP (including ratios to GDP) do not reflect the revised national accounts issued by IBGE in March

2015.

2
In recent years, headline and core inflation have been near the upper-edge of the inflation
tolerance band, owing in part to sustained wage cost pressures, lingering indexation practices,
and, more recently, the ongoing drought. In turn, longer-term inflation expectations rose since
2011, although they have edged down since end-2014. Meanwhile, modest increases in regulated
energy and fuel prices helped hold back overall inflation for some time. But overdue adjustments
in regulated prices are now underway, while inflation in market-determined prices is moderating
reflecting tighter financial conditions and subdued economic activity. New inflation pressures are
emerging from the Real’s nominal depreciation.
The central bank hiked the monetary policy rate 375 basis points to 11 percent between
April 2013 and April 2014. Policy tightening paused from May through September 2014.
Between October 2014 and March 2015, the rate was again increased by a cumulative 175 basis
points to prevent second round effects from currency depreciation and the anticipated increases
in regulated prices.
Despite weakening domestic demand, the current account deficit reached 4.2 percent of GDP in
2014, up from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2012. The deterioration reflects worsening terms of trade, a
drop in exports to Argentina, and an increase in fuel imports necessitated by the drought. The
recent depreciation against the U.S. dollar, arising in part from general dollar strength, has not
translated one-for-one into gains against competitors in global markets. Moreover, persistently
high unit labor costs continue to dampen competitiveness. As a result, the external position is
weaker than desirable, with the real still overvalued at end-2014.
International reserves are high and capital flows have remained stable. FDI financed more than
70 percent of the current account deficit in 2014, and portfolio inflows have been buoyant. At
about US$362 billion, gross international reserves (cash concept) are well above the IMF’s
reserve adequacy metric and other standard benchmarks.
The banking system’s soundness indicators remain favorable. Although private sector leverage
and past expansion of public bank lending are potential sources of stress, banks’ indicators are
encouraging, showing adequate levels of capitalization and provisioning as confirmed by stress
tests.

3
In 2013, the non-financial public sector primary balance declined to 1.9 percent of GDP,
undershooting its 2.3 percent target despite one-off revenue measures. Coming on top of tax
breaks introduced over 2012-2013, rapid real expenditure growth and slowing revenues brought
the primary fiscal balance of the nonfinancial public sector to -0.6 percent of GDP in 2014,
despite one-off measures of about ½ percent of GDP. Policy lending to public banks also edged
back up. As a result, nonfinancial public sector gross debt increased to 71 percent of GDP.
Declining growth and weak fiscal performance affected Brazil’s sovereign credit rating in 2014.
Standard & Poor’s cut Brazil’s credit rating to BBB- in March 2014, its first downgrade since
July 2002. In September 2014, Moody’s revised Brazil’s sovereign rating outlook to negative.
Since January 2015, the government began introducing a series of important measures to
strengthen macroeconomic policies and restore credibility. The linchpin of the new strategy is an
ambitious fiscal adjustment to bring the primary surplus of the nonfinancial public sector to
1.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and to at least 2 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017. The measures
aim first to stabilize nonfinancial public sector gross debt and then put it in a downward
trajectory.
Fund staff projects negative output growth of 1 percent in 2015, with some drag from tighter
fiscal and monetary policies and from the cuts in investment by Petrobras adding to the
downward momentum in activity carried over from 2014. Successful implementation of the
fiscal adjustment strategy and other policy actions should contribute to strengthen confidence
and help reinvigorate investment in the latter part of 2015, providing the basis for a return to
positive growth in 2016. The outlook is subject to significant downward risks, including
drought-induced rationing of energy and water, the possible fallout from the Petrobras case, and
a more adverse international environment.

Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors underlined the success of the Brazilian authorities in reducing
unemployment, poverty, and inequality in recent years. Directors noted that stalling growth, high
inflation, and deteriorating public finances pose difficult challenges, while external downside
risks also weigh on the outlook. In this context, they emphasized the need to further strengthen
policy credibility and market confidence, boost investment and competitiveness, and reinforce
the foundation for strong, balanced, and sustainable growth.
Directors welcomed the newly announced fiscal strategy, which includes targets for 2015−17,
the decision to end policy lending to public banks, and the emphasis on reducing gross debt
ratios. They stressed that achieving the budget targets would require ambitious, front-loaded
measures. They supported the focus on cuts in current expenditures and tax exemptions to make
room for priority spending on investment and social programs. Many Directors pointed to the
benefits of targeting a higher primary surplus over the next two years in further strengthening
policy credibility and the fiscal position, although some cautioned about the growth impact of
such adjustment. Directors saw a need for continued fiscal reforms to reduce budget rigidities,
simplify the tax system, and address structural sources of fiscal pressure more broadly, including
the pension and wage indexation systems.
Directors encouraged strengthened governance frameworks in state-owned enterprises. They
considered it an immediate priority to address the problems at the state-owned oil company and
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to find a swift resolution.
Directors generally agreed that monetary policy should remain tight. They welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to the announced inflation target and their readiness to take additional
action so as not to jeopardize that target. Directors recommended further efforts to improve
monetary policy transmission and the inflation targeting framework over time.
3

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

5

Directors noted that Brazil’s flexible exchange rate has an important role to play as the main
shock absorber. They welcomed the recent scale-down of the foreign exchange intervention
program and recommended that its use remain limited to smoothing out excessive volatility,
thereby allowing a further depreciation of the exchange rate in line with fundamentals and
promoting external competitiveness.
Directors recognized the soundness of the banking system, with adequate capital buffers,
provisioning, and liquidity. They stressed the importance of monitoring banks’ balance sheets
and corporate leverage in the current low-growth environment. Enhanced bank supervision,
including for public banks, as well as targeted microprudential measures, would help mitigate
potential risks. Directors were encouraged by the significant progress being made in
implementing key recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors considered supply-side reforms as critical for boosting the economy’s productive
capacity and growth potential. They recommended that priority be placed on infrastructure
investment and initiatives to enhance tax efficiency, improve the business climate, and foster
international trade. Prioritization of reforms and greater private sector participation will be key to
success.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Brazil,
Ivan Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director, and Fabio Najjarian,
Advisor to Executive Director
March 16, 2015

1.
We would like to thank staff for the report and the accompanying papers as well as
for the fruitful interaction with the authorities during the visit to Brazil. The Article IV
mission took place in the first fortnight of December 2014 – in the middle of a government
transition – when many policy measures were still being formulated and the new economic
team was not yet in office. In 2015, Brazil embarked on an ambitious economic consolidation
program. Tight macroeconomic policy objectives were set to correct the deterioration of the
fiscal and external positions that occurred especially in 2014 and steer inflation back to the
midpoint of the target range. The authorities expect that this will lay the ground for a new
cycle of growth and further rises in living standards, as fiscal and monetary indicators
improve and market confidence builds up.
Economic activity
2.
Economic activity will remain subdued in the near term, but the authorities foresee a
recovery already in the fourth quarter of 2015. They expect the economy to gain more steam
in 2016, as business and consumer confidence improve in response to the implementation of
the adjustment program.
3.
As indicated in paragraph 29 of the staff report, the Brazilian authorities disagree with
staff’s growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016, which they consider to be overly pessimistic.
Some of the assumptions behind staff’s projections seem exaggerated, such as the weight that
appears to have been attributed to possible water and energy rationing and the impact of the
reduction in investment by Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company. The tariff realignment
should have an impact on the demand for energy, and recent rainfall has resulted in some
increase in reservoir levels in the regions most affected by a severe drought. Staff’s
projections are worse than current market readings: the most recent central bank’s survey of
market expectations presents medians of -0.78 percent and 1.3 percent for GDP growth in
2015 and 2016, respectively.
4.
Regarding Petrobras, it is important to note that the company is fundamentally sound.
In 2014, Petrobras registered a record production of 2.67 Mbpd of oil and natural gas, with
the new pre-salt production areas responding for about ¼ of total output. In 2015, the
company is expected to benefit from higher production, larger refining capacity, higher
domestic prices and lower import prices. The Brazilian securities and exchange commission
(Comissão de Valores Mobiliários – CVM) is in dialogue with its counterparts abroad and
Petrobras’ external auditors in order to accelerate the publication of an audited financial
statement.

Fiscal and monetary policy objectives for 2015-2017
5.
President Dilma Roussef was reelected in October 2014 and started her second
mandate on January 1st, 2015. In December 2014, the economic team appointed to take office
at the start of her new term announced some of its macroeconomic policy objectives. On the
fiscal policy side, the goal is to reach a primary surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and at
least 2.0 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017. It was also announced that the Treasury would
not provide new policy lending for public banks, which will help stabilize and subsequently
reduce the gross public debt to GDP ratio. On the monetary policy front, end-2016 was
established as the horizon for inflation to converge to the 4.5 percent midpoint of the target
range.
6.
Staff’s call for higher primary surplus targets and additional monetary policy
tightening does not seem entirely persuasive. Planned fiscal consolidation is already very
strong. The staff report itself estimates that the structural primary deficit of 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2014 will be converted into a 2.5 percent surplus in 2016 – a swing of more than 3
percentage points of GDP in only two years (table 3). Staff’s estimate of the planned
adjustment is even larger if policy lending is included in the calculation of the structural
primary balance.1 Moreover, the central bank has already undertaken and is continuing to
undertake significant monetary tightening. All this is being done in a scenario of weak
growth.
7.
The authorities are facing difficult trade-offs. Fiscal consolidation includes an
adjustment of relative prices that is taking a toll on inflation in the short run. Exchange rate
depreciation should benefit the current account balance but is also having an impact on
inflation. Monetary tightening, in turn, implies a higher cost for servicing public debt,
making the objective of reducing the public debt ratio more difficult. Despite these
challenges, the authorities are forging ahead with their adjustment program.
Fiscal policy
8.
The above mentioned objectives are already being translated into concrete measures,
as shown in Box 4 of the staff report. Since the report was issued, one of the possible
additional measures listed there is in the process of being submitted to Congress under
urgency procedures. We refer to the reversal of payroll tax cuts, which is estimated to yield
0.4 percent of GDP savings per year.
9.
The design of fiscal adjustment measures was guided by long-standing government
goals. Thus, social spending is being preserved, in the pursuit of further gains in the
1

The structural primary balance including policy lending is estimated to rise from a deficit of 1.7 percent of
GDP in 2014 to a 2.5 percent surplus in 2016 (table 3).

3
reduction of poverty and social inequality. The authorities have also given attention to
improving the balance between current expenditure and investment, with a view to increasing
the share of investment in output and fostering long-term economic growth.
10.
In order to ensure that limits on discretionary expenditures will be observed in 2015,
the government preventively set lower ceilings for these expenditures until the approval by
Congress of the Annual Budget Law. The Federal Government also established an interministerial working group to monitor and evaluate public spending.
11.
Fiscal consolidation at the sub-national level will be pursued through enhanced
control procedures. This will include a review of regulations, a tightening of the criteria for
authorization for new domestic borrowing, and stricter limitations on the granting of
warranties on external loans. Moreover, revenues from the Imposto sobre Circulação de
Mercadorias e Serviços (ICMS), which is collected by state governments, are expected to
increase due to the recent realignment of energy and fuel prices.
Public debt
12.
Staff estimates that the gross public debt to GDP ratio will rise slightly in 2015 and
gradually decline as of 2016 (table 3). It should be noted, however, that there is a significant
difference between the Fund’s and the authorities’ definitions of gross public debt. The
former includes in gross public debt all treasury securities held by the Central Bank of Brazil
(BCB). The latter excludes the treasury securities that are held by the BCB and only accounts
for those held by the public – including as collateral for BCB’s liquidity-mopping repos. The
authorities’ definition is widely used by financial markets, including major international
banks, and by the three largest rating agencies in their debt sustainability analyses.
13.
As can be seen from table 3 of the staff report, the divergence between the two
definitions is far from negligible. Under the Fund’s approach, the ratio of gross public debt to
GDP was nearly 7 percentage points higher in 2014. The Fund’s methodology also leads to
an overestimation of gross financing needs, as the rollover risk of securities held by the BCB
is insignificant – something that staff now recognizes. Despite this recognition, the debt
sustainability analysis is entirely based on the Fund’s inappropriate definition of gross public
debt.
Monetary policy and FX swaps
14.
The BCB is determined to bring inflation back to the 4.5 percent midpoint of the
target range by the end of 2016. After having raised the policy rate by 375 basis points from
April 2013 to April 2014, the BCB resumed monetary tightening last October, increasing the
policy rate by a further 175 basis points, totaling a 550 basis-point increase. This will help
cope with the second-order effects on inflation arising from two important adjustments in

4
relative prices currently underway: i) the realignment of tradables prices vis-à-vis those of
non-tradables; and ii) the realignment of administered vis-à-vis market-based prices.
15.
The authorities have stressed that the floating exchange rate regime remains the first
line of defense. The exchange rate has moved in response to changing fundamentals and
external shocks. A FX swap program was put in place in August 2013 to mitigate financial
risks arising from monetary policy normalization in the U.S. and has helped preserve
financial stability by allowing economic agents to hedge their foreign exchange positions. As
they are settled in local currency, the FX swaps do not compromise or commit international
reserves. The BCB considers that the notional value of FX swap contracts outstanding is
broadly in line with the hedging needs of the private sector. As indicated in the staff report,
the latest extension of the FX swap program on a reduced scale and for a shorter period is
consistent with this view.
16.
Staff’s argument that the swap program, by lowering the cost of hedging, encouraged
excessive risk taking is debatable. Actually, lower costs facilitate access to hedging and
therefore a reduction and a better distribution of risks.
Financial sector
17.
Data in table 6 of the staff report indicate that the Brazilian financial system has
ample liquidity, is well-provisioned and holds adequate capital levels. Financial sector
regulation and supervision are recognized to be strong, both in terms of on-site and off-site
monitoring.
18.
The BCB is confident that credit expansion in recent years did not create fragilities in
the banking system. Staff’s assessment of the risk of deterioration of banks’ balance sheets in
a scenario of low growth seems exaggerated. We note that stress tests conducted by the
central bank with extreme scenarios proposed by staff only pointed out to some – yet limited
– need for additional capital.
19.
Staff emphasizes the need for close monitoring of the health of bank balance sheets in
response to evolving economic conditions without sufficiently recognizing the extent to
which the BCB is able to exercise its supervisory mandate. In particular, the BCB’s credit
registry system tracks 99 percent of banking credit, allowing for early identification of asset
quality deterioration, an aspect that the staff report should have taken into account.
20.
The level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking system as a whole remains
low. The ratio of NPLs to total loans has been stable at less than 3 percent since 2013. At 2.1
percent as of September 2014, the NPL ratio of public banks continues to be significantly
lower than that of private banks (table 6).

5
External Sector
21.
The current account deficit has widened and is expected to have reached 4.2 percent
of GDP in 2014, compared to 3.6 percent in 20132. Brazil’s attractiveness to foreign
investors, however, remains strong. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2014 surpassed USD
60 billion, enough to cover more than ¾ of the current account deficit. Brazil accounted for
4.4 percent of global FDI inflows and ranked among the top five FDI host economies in
UNCTAD’s 2014 World Investment Report. The BCB expects FDI flows to remain broadly
stable in 2015, around USD 65 billion.
22.
The rise in the current account deficit is in part due to exogenous factors, such as a
worsening in the terms of trade and a reduction in demand from important trading partners.
The ongoing realignment of the exchange rate, with further real effective exchange rate
depreciation in late 2014 and early 2015, will help reduce the current account deficit going
forward. Moreover, the authorities expect that the recovery in the U.S. will have a positive
impact on Brazilian exports.
23.
Brazil’s foreign reserves are one of the country’s main strengths, a point perhaps
insufficiently stressed by staff. Reserves closed 2014 at USD 364 billion, the equivalent of
377 percent of short-term debt at residual maturity and more than 15 months of prospective
imports of goods and non factor services (table 5 of the staff report). Nonetheless, the high
level of reserves is not taken into account in staff’s analysis of external risks; it is not even
mentioned in the report’s Risk Assessment Matrix (Appendix III).
Investment program
24.
Brazil’s investment program covers three key areas: (i) removal of regulatory
obstacles to investment, especially to infrastructure investment; (ii) adoption of coordinated
policy measures for increasing competiveness; and (iii) improvement of labor force skills and
promotion of innovation in order to boost productivity and lift potential growth.
25.
For each of these areas, specific measures have been planned to address Brazil’s
policy gaps and challenges. Those measures include: i) an infrastructure investment package
of USD 40 billion in the form of concessions and public-private partnerships already
negotiated, and projects in the pipeline totaling USD 110 billion; ii) a new regulatory
framework for small and medium enterprises to reduce red tape and improve their access to
capital markets and export credit; iii) trade facilitation through the integration of all foreign
trade procedures under a new single window system; and iv) implementation of the National
Education Plan and the National Program of Knowledge Platforms.
2

It should be noted, however, that part of the increase in the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP
reflects the impact of exchange rate depreciation on GDP expressed in dollar terms.

6
New investment instruments have been developed to facilitate private sector participation in
infrastructure projects, such as the infrastructure debentures (fixed-income securities linked
to infrastructure projects). As of December 2014, the outstanding volume of these debentures
surpassed 15 billion reais, with maturities ranging from 5 to 17 years.
Social programs
26.
In 2014, Brazil’s social programs continued to advance firmly in line with their main
objectives: universal coverage of social protection through the application of well-defined
criteria; economic inclusion of the poorest; and reduction of income, gender, color, and
regional inequality.
27.
The main instrument to achieve these objectives has been Bolsa Família (BF), the
conditional cash transfer program created in 2003. In 2011, the target of overcoming extreme
poverty in Brazil started to be more directly addressed with the creation of the Brasil Sem
Miséria social program.
28.
Box 1 of the staff report provides a useful summary of the two programs, but we add
further information to emphasize some of their most important features:


Close attention is given to efficient program implementation. In spite of its wide
scope – currently reaching 54 million people or 14 million families – BF’s budget, at
around 0.5 percent of GDP, is relatively low, and administrative costs represent less
than 5 percent of the total.



Program monitoring is strong. Around 1.3 million people were excluded from BF in
2014 (an election year), either for not having fulfilled the requirement for biannual
update of their data; for not having continued to meet the conditionalities (regularly
checked against information provided by the educational and health systems); or for
no longer meeting the revenue criterion (monitored through cross-checking of data
with several other official databases).



BF’s national reach is ensured by the participation of all states and municipalities,
which has also been key to the development of the Single Registry of Social
Programs of the Federal Government. This centralized database, in turn, has provided
support for several initiatives under Brasil sem Miséria, such as the enrollment of 1.8
million people in the professional training program Pronatec and the formalization of
1.2 million micro-entrepreneurs, in addition to far-reaching initiatives for the
improvement of water and energy supply, prevention and the treatment of the most
common diseases among children, and the expansion of day care, which now reaches
700 thousand children registered in BF.

7
29.
As a result of these concerted actions, the rate of chronic poverty in Brazil has fallen
from 1.8 percent of the population in 2011 to 1.1 percent in 2014; and the country has left the
map of world hunger of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
