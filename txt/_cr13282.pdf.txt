STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 14, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Republic of Congo is endowed with abundant natural resources, notably
oil and iron ore. Membership in the CFA franc zone continues serving the country well as
an anchor for financial stability; macroeconomic performance has been broadly
satisfactory in recent years, with strong growth, moderate inflation, and large fiscal and
foreign buffers. However, Congo has achieved limited progress in poverty alleviation,
and remains vulnerable to external shocks. Moreover, policy coordination has weakened
since the expiration of the last ECF arrangement in 2011. Weak governance and business
conditions are significant constraints to private sector development and growth
inclusiveness. The political situation is generally calm, and the next presidential elections
are planned for 2016.
Consultation focus. Policy discussions focused on: (i) the current fiscal stance and fiscal
framework for the medium to long term; (ii) vulnerabilities to external shocks;
(iii) competitiveness and external sector sustainability; (iv) growth inclusiveness; and
(v) policy coordination.
Key policy recommendations and authorities’ views. Congo’s main challenge is to
ensure long-term macroeconomic stability in the face of oil revenue volatility and
exhaustibility, and to make growth more inclusive. The mission recommended:
(i) improving resilience to shocks and fostering growth inclusiveness by adopting a fiscal
framework that ensures budget and debt sustainability, explicitly taking account of
impending depletion of oil wealth; (ii) swiftly implementing the IFC-supported action
plan to improve the business environment and strengthen competitiveness;
(iii) expanding ongoing employment and social safety net programs; and (iv) setting up a
policy coordination and monitoring committee. The authorities broadly concurred with
staff’s assessment and recommendations; they have signaled possible interest in Fund
technical assistance in strengthening the fiscal rule introduced in January 2013 to
improve the management of oil resources.

BACKGROUND: GENEROUS RESOURCES
ENDOWMENT, BUT LIMITED POVERTY REDUCTION
1.
The Republic of Congo is endowed with abundant natural resources (Figure 1).
Proven oil reserves are estimated at about 2 billion barrels. In 2012, oil production reached
100 million barrels, the fourth largest in sub-Saharan Africa, and generated
nearly US$ 4.5 billion in government oil revenues. In addition, Congo has large iron ore
deposits and a vast agricultural potential.

expansion of credit to the private sector.
3.
The benefits of growth are not evenly distributed. The poverty rate declined from
50.7 percent in 2005 to just 46.5 percent in 2011, and the prevalence of poverty remains much
high than in peer oil-exporting countries. Moreover, despite registering the 3rd largest per
capita public investment envelop in the CFA Zone during 2005–11, Congo continues to suffer
from considerable social and economic infrastructure gaps.
4.
Recently, the authorities have implemented key recommendations from the
2012 Article IV consultations (Table 6). Notably, they are gradually introducing a fiscal rule to
address the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy and protect the budget from the volatility and
exhaustibility of oil revenues; and Congo has reached “compliant” status under the Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). However, the country remains in breach of the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) obligations with regard to repatriation
of export proceeds and reserve pooling as a large share of its foreign reserves is still deposited
off-shore.
1

Following the civil war of the late 1990s, which brought President Sassou N’guesso back to power, the
political situation has stabilized; and the next presidential elections are planned for 2016.
2

The basic non-oil primary balance is defined as revenue (excluding oil revenue, investment income and
grants) minus total expenditure (excluding interest payments and foreign-financed investment). It provides the
most appropriate indicator of fiscal stance and effort for the Republic of Congo.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND SHORT-TERM
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
5.
In 2012, economic developments were dominated by the authorities’ fiscal
response to the explosion of an ammunitions depot in Brazzaville (Tables 1–4)3. The
government’s swift response in attending to the needs of the victims and beginning
reconstruction underpinned a brisk increase in public outlays, which pushed non-oil GDP
growth to nearly 10 percent and end-year inflation to 7.5 percent (year-on-year). Spending
was nevertheless lower than budgeted owing to capacity and other administrative constraints,
helping to contain the basic non-oil primary deficit at 62.9 percent of non-oil GDP
(46.3 percent in 2011), compared with a revised budget objective of 73.1 percent of non-oil
GDP. Credit to the private sector continued on a high growth path (about 40 percent, year-onyear), reflecting the robust expansion of the non-oil sector and the still modest depth of the
financial sector.
6.
While the fiscal and external positions should remain comfortable in 2013,
preliminary data points to somewhat weaker economic activity—particularly in the oil
sector. 4 Real GDP growth is rebounding to 5.8 percent (half a percentage point below initial
target); and inflation should ease as the effects of the 2012 sharp increase in government
spending dissipate. In the fiscal area, the authorities have revised current and capital spending
to contain the negative impact on the budget of an oil revenue shortfall and large overruns in
domestic arrears repayments5 (Table 3a). Consequently, the basic non-oil primary deficit show
should narrow to 43.5 percent of non-oil GDP (62.9 in 2012), with government bank deposits
strengthening by about ten percentage points to 34.2 percent of non-oil GDP (CFAF 963 billion
just slightly below the initial target of CFAF 1098 billion). To meet these objectives, the
authorities have established quarterly revenue and expenditure targets, and tightened treasury
and budget management more generally. The tighter fiscal policy stance, together with lower
oil sector income repatriations, is expected to underpin a strengthening of the external current
account to a surplus of 8 percent of GDP. In the financial sector, the ongoing expansion of
credit to the private sector is expected to continue.

An estimated 250 people lost lives, another 2300 were injured; and extensive housing and other property
damages were suffered.
3

4 Oil

output has been revised downward to 96 million barrels (about 3 percent below initial target), reflecting
efficiency losses in maturing fields. The ensuing revenue shortfall is expected at CFA 135 billion (4.8 percent of
non-oil GDP).
5

In the first quarter, the government settled previously frozen benefits to various social partners in response
to rising social tensions, including a teachers’ strike that threatened to derail the school year.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS: BUILDING
UP ADDITIONAL BUFFERS AGAINST PERSISTENT
VULNERABILITIES
7.
Congo’s medium-term prospects are generally favorable (Table 1, Figure 6). Real
GDP growth is expected to average 6½ percent during 2014–16 under the baseline scenario,
despite oil production becoming more volatile due to the transition from maturing to new oil
fields (Figure 1). Main drivers of economic activity are investment; strong activity in
construction and public works, telecommunications, and agriculture sectors; and a timid start
of iron ore mining production.6 Inflation is expected to remain in line with the regional CEMAC
target of 3 percent over the medium term. The recently-introduced fiscal rule is expected to be
strengthened to better anchor the fiscal stance; and continued spending prudence will secure
further budget consolidation gains and policy buffers.
8.
The main risks to the outlook stem from possible downward pressures on oil
prices (Table 7). A protracted activity slowdown in the Euro area and in the emerging
economies would lower international oil prices and weaken significantly macroeconomic
performance. On the domestic front, prospects hinge on ensuring that the next presidential
elections in 2016 are run smoothly.

6

Iron mining is constrained by limited road and rail transportation capacity. Staff estimates that real GDP
growth would rise to 9 ½ percent in 2014–16 if iron ore production increases to an annual average of 9 million
tons compared with 2.5 million tons/year under the baseline scenario.

Box 1. Mining Sector: Potential Waiting to be Unlocked
The Republic of Congo is endowed with large mineral resources. Iron ore reserves are
estimated to exceed 10 billion tons; while potassium and phosphate reserves are assessed at
about 1 billion tons and 500 million tons, respectively. To date, mining sector activity is confined
to artisanal diamond and gold production, but mining activities have experienced a new
dynamism in recent years following the adoption of the more attractive 2005 Mining Code. So
far, 48 prospecting permits have been awarded to 28 companies; 49 exploration permits to
26 companies; and 3 production permits to 2 companies.
One project is advancing to the production phase whereas others are delayed owing to
uncertain global economic conditions and weak transport infrastructure. Production from
one iron ore site (Mayoko exploited by DMC-Exxaro) is expected to start by end-2013 with a
modest 130,000-ton output, and will likely reach 7 million tons per year by 2017. A Chinese
company was expected to take over a project on the border of Cameroon and Congo but the
transaction was cancelled in April 2013 due to weaker growth in China. More generally, main
bottlenecks to strong and profitable mining production include the lack of adequate
transportation infrastructure, reliable power supply, and scarce skilled labor. For some projects,
such as the Mayoko venture, infrastructure (rail road and port) exists but the current capacity
levels are inadequate to support production at full capacity. In other cases, such as the projects in
the northern part of the country, infrastructure does not exist at all and will need to be
developed from ground up.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Congo’s main challenge going forward is to make growth more inclusive, while
safeguarding macroeconomic stability in the face of oil revenue volatility and
exhaustibility. The discussions therefore focused on the adoption of a stability-oriented fiscal
framework; reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks; assessing competitiveness and external
sector sustainability; identifying policy options to make growth more inclusive; and improving
the effectiveness of policy management.

A. Securing Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
10.
In January 2013, the authorities introduced a fiscal rule aimed at protecting the
budget from oil revenue volatility and preventing fiscal policy pro-cyclicality (Annex 1).
The rule calls for the allocation of CFAF 1,500 billion of oil revenue to current (CFAF 500 billion)
and capital (CFAF 1,000 billion) expenditures each year, while the reminder of oil revenues is
saved in government deposits. This allocation would secure gradual gains in fiscal
consolidation, and facilitate the achievement of infrastructure scaling up in line with Congo’s
absorptive capacity and as envisaged under the National Development Plan. For the period
2013–20, nearly 70 percent of projected total oil revenue would be spent (two thirds of which
on capital goods), and 30 percent saved. However, if oil revenue falls temporarily below
1,500 billion CFAF, the rule makes provisions for the authorities to draw on the saved funds to
protect infrastructure spending7.
11.
Staff urged the authorities to expand the new fiscal rule and cast it in a
framework that accounts for the exhaustibility of Congo’s oil reserves and insures
macroeconomic sustainability over the medium to long term (Annex 1). The enhanced
framework would allow a significant scaling up of investment to begin closing the
infrastructure gap; alignment of expenditure with absorptive capacity to ensure efficiency of
public expenditure and continuing gains in macroeconomic stability; and achievement of an
adequate stock of net wealth to provide policy buffers and support consumption in the
post-oil era. The framework anchors fiscal policy on a gradually strengthening non-oil primary
balance.
12.
Developing a long-term stability-prone fiscal framework for the Republic of
Congo is crucial in view of the declining oil revenue going forward (Text Table 2 and
Annex 1).8 Under an illustrative scenario discussed by the authorities and staff, revenue
7

Oil revenue is projected to be structurally above CFAF 1500 billion during 2013–19, averaging
CFAF 2,123 billion/year; with oil production and prices at annual averages of 100 million barrels and
US$ 93/barrel, respectively.
8

The fiscal framework discussed with the Congolese authorities could be amended as needed consistent with
the recommendations from ongoing discussions on the introduction of fiscal rules in the CEMAC region. Staff
initiated related policy exchanges with the regional authorities during the 2013 Article IV Consultation
discussions with CEMAC.

and safety nets for future generations, as well as a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 10 percent over
the long term.9 Staff underscored aligning the 2014 budget with the above medium- and longterm fiscal framework.
13.
The authorities are introducing critical reforms to strengthen non-oil revenue
collection, and beginning to improve public financial management (PFM). The tax payers
list is being updated, resulting in a 10-percent increase in the number of registered payers in
early 2013; and the exchange of taxpayer data between the Tax and Treasury departments and
Customs has been stepped up. A withholding tax on government contracts has been
introduced; and a one-stop window for customs clearance put in service. Also, Parliament
recently adopted an organic law on financial operations of the State; and the authorities have
initiated preparations for effective implementation of regional CEMAC PFM directives.
However, the efficiency and quality of public expenditures remain weak as notably suggested
by frequent power outages and poor road conditions despite a significant scaling up of capital
spending in recent years.10 Staff stressed (i) accelerating the preparation and adoption of the

Results of a value-at-risk analysis suggest that a stock of wealth equivalent to 185 percent of non-oil GDP

fiscal accountability law; (ii) completing, with the assistance of the World Bank, a public
expenditure review in key areas; and (iii) expediting implementation of World Bank-supported
reforms to strengthen the management of the public investment program and enhance the
productivity of the development budget.
14.
The authorities concurred with the pertinence of the proposed medium- and
long-term fiscal framework. Facing daunting infrastructure and skills constraints, they
especially appreciated the proposed front-loading of investment spending. They recognized
that consideration needed to be given to absorptive capacity limits in budgeting government
outlays, but argued that Congo’s large and pressing development needs justify prudent
spending flexibility beyond the targets under the proposed fiscal framework. In discussions
with staff, some members of Parliament advocated casting the proposed fiscal framework in a
law to underscore its importance and make the arrangement legally binding. To this end, the
authorities might request technical assistance from the Fund. The authorities concurred with
staff’s assessment of the poor quality of expenditure in Congo; and committed to working
closely with the World Bank to seek improvements, including in the operation of the Large
Infrastructure Project Unit. They have already appointed budget controllers and procurement
managers in each ministry; and initiated World Bank-guided public expenditure reviews for key
sectors. The authorities have also requested technical support from the Fund in strengthening
the PFM legal framework based partly on an evaluation of the reforms introduced in 2008, and
implementing the regional CEMAC PFM directives.

B. Addressing Vulnerabilities to External Shocks
15.
Shocks to oil prices remain a potentially important source of economic
disruptions, given Congo’s heavy dependence on the oil sector (Figure 2). Oil currently
accounts for 65 percent of GDP, 75 percent of government revenue, and 80 percent of exports.
This makes the country one of the economies in sub-Saharan Africa most dependent on oil
(Figure 1, panel 5). Staff considered three downside scenarios: (i) a gradual but persistent
deterioration of growth in euro area, (ii) a weakening of investment demand in the BRICs (plus
South Africa), and (iii) a plunge in oil price to its 2009 level. Simulations suggest that, relative
to the baseline scenario, real GDP in 2018 would be lower by 6.2 percent under the first
scenario, 8.4 percent under the second scenario, and 35.6 percent under the third scenario.
16.
Wary of Congo’s vulnerability to external shocks, the authorities concurred about
the need for rigorous implementation of the identified precautionary and corrective
policy measures. The focus is on beefing up the policy buffers through the achievement of
additional fiscal savings and the continued strengthening of Congo’s foreign exchange
reserves. To that end, while exercising spending restraint, the authorities are strengthening
non-oil revenue collection, continuing building up of policy buffers, diversifying the
production base, and improving the quality of public expenditure.

C. Enhancing External Sustainability and Competitiveness
17.
Congo’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals. The currency appreciated by 3.8 percent in real terms
between June 2012 and April 2013 on the back of a strengthening euro (vis-à-vis the
US dollar) and higher international oil prices. However, a quantitative evaluation of the REER
based on the standard Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodologies indicates
no significant misalignment. The external sustainability analysis tailored to oil-exporting
countries confirmed these findings (Annex 2).
18.
Structural bottlenecks remain the main impediments to competitiveness. The
World Bank’s 2013 Doing Business Indicators Report ranks Congo 183rd out of the 185 listed
countries; areas of primary investor concern include difficulties in starting a business and
dealing with tax administration, as well as obstacles to trading across borders. The country lags
also behind comparators on governance, particularly on government’s efficiency and quality of
regulations.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment of structural impediments to
competitiveness and are taking measures to improve the business environment. A reform
plan designed with support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) focuses on
streamlining administrative procedures pertaining to enterprise creation, land registration,
building authorization, and cross-border trade. In this context, the authorities recently
established an Investment Promotion Agency that should become operational in the coming
months.

D. Promoting Inclusive Growth
20.
The equitable sharing of the benefits from Congo’s abundant natural resources
remains a major challenge (Annex 3). Poverty is pervasive (Figure 3) and provision of public
goods is scarce, despite scaled-up public investment (Text Table 3). The International Labor
Organization estimates the unemployment rate at 16 percent and underemployment to be
severe. In addition to urging improvements in the quality of public expenditures, the mission
recommended stepping up growth inclusiveness efforts through fostering financial
development, advancing reforms of the education system to address skills mismatches, and
adopting well targeted employment and social safety net programs.

21.
The financial sector is broadly sound but remains underdeveloped (Annex 4,
Figures 4 and 5). Most financial sector soundness indicator thresholds are met, except that on
risk concentration.11 However, Congo ranks amongst the weakest laggards on key financial
development indicators. Despite marked acceleration of credit to the private sector in recent
years, financial depth—ratio of credit to GDP—remains modest at 10 percent in 2012. Staff
urged improvements in property rights and creditors protection frameworks to improve access
to financial services and facilitate the development of the financial sector. The envisaged one11

predominance of a few major activity areas and players in the formal sector.

stop shop for land title registration would strengthen land property-based loan collaterals.
Staff urged an expeditious implementation. It also called for a more comprehensive coverage
of Congo’s credit registry, and for stepped-up efforts to shorten court procedures as relates to
legal disputes affecting the financial sector.

Figure 5. Financial Sector Development

22.
Congo is making changes to the education system to ensure that it corresponds
better to the needs of the labor market (Annex 3). Consistent with recommendations under
the 2012 Article IV consultations, reforms of the education system have been given high
priority with significant allocations in the 2013 budget.12 Consequently, specialized centers are
being set up for technical and vocational training. Also, a public-private platform has been
charged with aligning teaching curricula with the needs of private sector employers. Staff
encouraged the authorities to ensure rigorous implementation of these initiatives drawing on
technical assistance from relevant development partners.
23.
The authorities are implementing employment and social safety net programs in
the context of a new labor market policy (Annex 3). A National Employment Policy is
expected to be finalized later this year after comments from various stakeholders are fully
incorporated. Pending government adoption and implementation, the authorities have
deployed a paid internship program under which unemployed youths are given temporary
(possibly leading to permanent) private sector jobs. The authorities are also carrying out labor
intensive public works and self employment programs, as well as a rural employment
development initiative. Implementation difficulties include delays in obtaining budgeted funds.
At the same time, conditioned cash transfer projects are being executed, and are expected to
be expanded with support from various partners including the World Bank. Staff encouraged
the authorities to expedite implementation of the new national employment policy and ensure
timely availability of funding for the various employment programs already under way; while
stressing the importance of mobilizing adequate technical assistance.
12

The 2013 budget allocates CFAF 200 billion (2.8 percent of GDP) to capital outlays for education (compared
with CFAF 69 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) in 2012.

24.
As part of an endeavor to achieve stronger and more inclusive growth, the
government is seeking accelerated economic diversification and employment gains
through development of Special Economic Zones (SEZ, Annex 5). They have completed
feasibility studies for three of the four economic zones under consideration, but have yet to
finalize the governing legal frameworks. Staff urges the authorities to refrain from extending
preferential fiscal incentives to SEZ participants and limit government role to providing
infrastructure and facilitating administrative procedures.

E. Economic Policy Management and other Surveillance Issues
25.
Policy coordination needs strengthening. After the achievement of the HIPC
Initiative completion point in 2010 and the expiration of Congo’s three-year arrangement
under the ECF in 2011, economic policy management has considerably weakened. The
committee that monitored the implementation of reforms under the program has become
idle. As a result, gaps have emerged in the timeliness and quality of macroeconomic data and
of information on developments in the structural area. Recognizing the need for better
coordination in the execution of their policy initiatives, the authorities agreed to urgent
remedial actions. Budgetary operations are already more rigorously monitored on a weekly
basis; and the authorities have committed to improving the collection and dissemination of
macroeconomic data. Staff recommended the setting-up of a centralized institutional policy
design and monitoring framework, drawing from Congo’s broadly satisfactory reform
management experience under the last ECF arrangement; and reiterated Fund availability to
continue providing policy advice through surveillance and technical assistance.
26.
The Republic of Congo complied with nearly all CEMAC quantitative convergence
criteria at end-2012.13 The basic fiscal balance showed a surplus of 10.5 percent of GDP
against a floor of zero percent. Total public debt—domestic and external—amounted to
31.3 percent of GDP against a ceiling of 70 percent. No accumulation of domestic or external
arrears was recorded, as per CEMAC’s relevant requirements. However, the country did not
observe the convergence criterion on inflation, which reached 7.5 percent (year-on-year)
against a threshold of 3 percent. The one-off prices spike is subsiding and inflation should
gradually decline to close to the regional target level by 2014. Staff called for continued
spending prudence to keep inflationary pressures in check.
27.
Observance of the regional obligation on reserves pooling remains problematic,
but the authorities are working toward advantageous solutions with the regional
authorities. The authorities continue holding sizable portions of their oil revenues in overseas
accounts outside of the regional central bank because of the higher remuneration of such
deposits “in the context of a multi-pronged alliance with a strategic partner”. Staff pointed out
that membership in the CFA franc zone has served Congo well as an anchor for financial
13

CEMAC’s convergence criteria need updating; staff has initiated discussions with the regional authorities to
that effect. The fiscal and debt targets could notably be revisited to support a better management of the
region’s non-renewable resources and help to prevent a too rapid accumulation of debt post HIPC/MDRI.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

stability. It urged strict compliance with regional CEMAC obligations, stressing that respect of
internal community rules was critical to insuring continued orderly management of the
regional central bank and preservation of monetary policy effectiveness in the CFA zone. The
authorities pledged full support to the ongoing review of the regional reserves pooling
framework and expeditious implementation of ensuing recommendations and proposed
corrective actions.
28.
Congo’s low risk of debt distress is confirmed by an updated Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) (Text Table 4). The debt profile has improved significantly since the
achievement of the HIPC

29.
Data Issues. Data communication to Fund staff became somewhat sporadic after the
expiration of the ECF-supported program in 2011. The authorities are taking steps to improve
the timeliness and quality of macroeconomic data, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness
of policy design and implementation. They have resumed regular communication of fiscal data
to Fund staff.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Republic of Congo remains on a path of strong growth, but significant gains
in poverty reduction have yet to materialize. Congo ought to make growth more inclusive
while preserving macroeconomic stability. To this end, the authorities’ medium-term policy
agenda appropriately aims at seeking further gains in budget consolidation while scaling up
investment to address large infrastructure and skills gaps; fostering economic diversification
and private sector development; and improving governance and transparency. Invigorating
growth and enhancing the effectiveness of Congo’s poverty reduction strategy in the period
ahead will require the rigorous implementation of reforms underway in these critical areas.
31.
Continued close adherence to stability-prone fiscal policies is key to
consolidating the recent gains in macroeconomic stability. Staff welcomes the ongoing
efforts to strengthen non-oil revenue collection in the context of a new fiscal rule that protects
spending against the volatility of oil receipts. It urges expanding and casting the newly
introduced fiscal rule in a framework that accounts for the exhaustibility of oil reserves as well;
and underscores the timely implementation of World Bank-supported measures to improve
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

public investment management. While supporting pro-growth and pro-poor outlays, the
proposed rule-based fiscal framework should seek the achievement of significant fiscal savings
over the long term, necessary to build up buffers and sustain reasonable levels of expenditures
in the post-oil era. In this context, Congo should continue adhering to a prudent borrowing
policy to preserve long-term debt sustainability after HIPC/MDRI debt relief.
32.
Congo’s external stability assessment points to additional improvements in the
last year, but competitiveness ought to be further strengthened. The real effective
exchange rate is in line with macroeconomic fundamentals, but external competitiveness is
being stifled by deeply-rooted structural impediments to private sector development. Staff
encourages the authorities to promptly implement the reform measures agreed to with the IFC
to improve the business environment, including by making the recently established Investment
Promotion Agency fully operational and streamlining the administrative requirements for
engaging in business activities.
33.
Improving governance and business conditions is needed to support strong
private sector-led growth and poverty reduction. The authorities have reached compliant
status under the EITI; they now have to expedite adoption of the fiscal transparency law that is
currently under review in Parliament. To diversify the economy and promote employment, the
Government is developing SEZs; strengthening technical and vocational education; and
introducing special employment-supporting programs. In parallel, innovative social safety net
arrangements are being set up to protect the most vulnerable groups. The timely availability of
budgeted funds will be needed to ensure that these programs are well implemented. As
regards the SEZs program, the government should avoid granting special fiscal incentives that
create distortions and often give rise to abusive practices, focusing instead on revamping
infrastructure and advancing administrative facilitation.
34.
While the medium-term prospects are generally favorable, the authorities should
be vigilant to risks related to downward pressures on world oil prices. Despite anticipated
fluctuations in oil production over the next years, real GDP growth should remain robust and
inflation would be contained around the CEMAC target of 3 percent. However, uncertainties in
the Euro area and a weakening of investment in the emerging markets, resulting in lower thancurrently projected world oil prices, would cloud Congo’s otherwise favorable outlook.
35.
Congo should fully comply with its CEMAC obligations. The authorities are
supporting and closely monitoring the ongoing review of the regional central bank (BEAC)’s
reserves management framework. Pending completion of the review, staff urges full
observance of relevant CEMAC commitments to insure the continued smooth operation of the
BEAC and the pegged exchange rate arrangement. Staff also encourages the authorities to
step up the efforts to ensure the timely provision of information to the Fund on the standard
macroeconomic data that is required for effective surveillance.
36.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Policy response to the 2012 explosion:
conduct a detailed costing of the losses and
of policy responses; limit fiscal impulse to
avoid triggering macro instability (inflation);
ensure quality of expenditures; prioritize
projects to make space for reconstruction
spending.
III - Improve the business environment to
begin removing structural impediments
to growth.

-

Avoid creating new distortions: instead of a
Special Economic Zone, eliminate tax
exemptions and tax holidays and streamline
the tax system.

especially on reserves repatriation and
pooling requirements.
V - Compliance with the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative.

Medium-term

Short/Medium-term

Source of risks

26

Global risk
Deeper than expected slowdown in
Emerging Markets, reflecting lower
than anticipated potential growth,
which would trigger a substantial drop
in commodity prices including oil and
iron ore.
Domestic risk
Lower oil production. Oil production
has fluctuated in recent years as oil
fields are maturing. Production is
expected to take a declining trend as
from 2018. However, an earlier-thanexpected decline cannot be ruled out
as extraction from oil fields inherently
involves uncertainty.
Global risk
Protracted period of slower European
growth (larger than expected
deleveraging or negative surprise on
potential growth), putting downward
pressures on oil prices.

Domestic risk
Political instability. President
Sassou N'guesso returned to power
in 1997, at the end of a civil war. He
was reelected to a second and last
7-year term in 2009. The next
presidential elections are planned
for 2016. The President’s political
alliance holds an 85-percent majority
in Parliament. A constitutional
amendment to strike out the two-term
limit and allow the President to run for
a third term could ignite tensions and
instability.

Medium

High

Low

Expected Impact
High
The significant decline in oil prices
would strain government revenue
and could weaken aggregate
demand, which might cause
extensive deterioration of hardwon macroeconomic stability.
High
Lower production would have
similar impacts as the pricerelated risks reviewed in item 1
above.

High
Given the acute dependence on
the oil sector (80 percent of
exports and 75 percent of
government revenue), lower
exports and aggregate demand
would weaken activity in the nonoil sectors.
High
Political instability and violence
would disrupt economic activity
and lead to large macroeconomic
imbalances. Economic growth
during the civil war was
5 percentage points lower than in
years of peace.

Annex 1. Medium- and Long-Term Fiscal Framework1
Background:
1.
The budget of the Republic of Congo depends heavily on oil revenues. Such
dependence has recently increased with oil revenues accounting for about 75 percent of total
revenues on average since 2000 (60 percent in the 1990s). Under the current production pace
of 100 million barrels per year, the proven reserves of about 2 billion barrels would be
depleted in 20 years. Based on planning of oil companies that currently hold licenses,
production is expected to oscillate around the current level through 2018. Thereafter, oil
output would steadily decline at an annual average of about 17 percent, and by 2032 annual
production would drop below 10 million barrels. Staff’s analysis assumes oil prices to decline
by an annual average rate of 3 percent during the period 2013–18, and to remain constant in
real terms thereafter.
Key objectives:
2.







This analysis describes a fiscal orientation cast in a framework that:
Ensures medium- and long-term fiscal and debt sustainability;
Begins addressing past fiscal policy pro-cyclicality; and protects the budget from the
volatility of oil revenue to prevent disruptive changes in spending plans;
Contributes to closing the large infrastructure gaps by allocating the bulk of oil revenue to
investment spending;
Takes into account expenditure absorptive capacity to avoid upward pressures on
domestic prices and preserve the quality of public expenditures;
Pursues a prudent borrowing policy; and
Helps building resource buffers for future generations.

Anchor:
3.
This medium- and long-term fiscal framework uses the non-oil primary balance
as policy anchor. In particular, it:




1

Contains total expenditure at about 30 percent of GDP compared to an average of
30 percent of GDP for oil exporting sub-Saharan African countries in 2012, 32 percent in
SSA middle-income countries, and 33 percent in Middle East and North Africa. This level is
deemed appropriate to address Congo’s social and developmental needs, and consistent
with the country’s absorptive capacity.
Makes provisions for a gradually build up of the stock of public capital to a middle-income
country level of about 120 of GDP. 2 Thereafter, it follows the path of capital accumulation

of upper middle income countries, with a public investment effort of about 6 percent of
GDP per year;
Stabilizes wealth in the long run.

Implementation:
4.






The framework would be implemented as outlined below:
During 2013–20, when oil revenue is structurally above CFAF 1,500 billion, the authorities
would (i) allocate CFAF 500 billion of oil revenue to current expenditures and
CFAF 1,000 billion to capital expenditures; (ii) cover the remaining current expenditures
and all other government financial obligations with collected non-oil revenue and
mobilized loans and grants; and (iii) direct all unspent resources to a strengthening of
government deposits. The authorities would draw down the saved funds to protect
spending if oil revenue falls below 1,500 billion CFAF. A ceiling would be set on the
withdrawal to ensure a minimum stabilization buffer.
Beyond 2020, with oil revenue structurally below CFAF 1,500 billion (based on existing oil
exploitation licenses), investment spending would be gradually reduced as the economy
would have already benefited from large public investments in earlier years.
Accordingly, staff expect that:
o During 2013–20, 30 percent of oil revenue would be saved; 47 percent allocated to
investment expenditures; and 23 percent directed to current expenditures;
o Fiscal consolidation would continue, with the non-oil primary deficit narrowing from
52 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013 to 22 percent in 2020 and 3 percent in 2032;
o During the projection period, total expenditure would average about 31.5 percent of
GDP;
o By 2020, the stock of public capital would have reached about 122 percent of GDP;
o In 2032, total wealth would amount to about 185 percent of non-oil GDP, providing
safety nets and policy buffers for future generations.3

3

By way of comparison, Saudi government deposits with the central bank—Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency
(SAMA)—amounted to about 108 percent of non-oil GDP and SAMA’s foreign holdings stood at about
211 percent of non-oil GDP at end-2011.

Annex 2. Exchange Rate and Competitiveness1
The Republic of Congo’s external sustainability has moderately improved over the last year and
remains generally strong. The balance of payments continues to be dominated by developments
in the oil sector, but mineral exports have the potential to become an important foreign
exchange earner in the medium term; and the exchange rate is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals. The removal of structural bottlenecks that stifle competitiveness is
a critical prerequisite for fostering private sector development and achieving stronger and
inclusive growth.
1.
Congo’s external balances are dominated by developments in the oil sector. Over
the last decade, current and financial accounts have been fairly volatile reflecting swings in
international oil prices, production cycles in existing oil fields, and investment spurts to
improve extractive capacity (Figure 1). Oil receipts have been generally strong allowing the
country to finance large and persistent non-oil trade deficits, while generating significant profit
repatriation outflows. Non-oil exports as a share of the world’s exports have risen somewhat
from their very low levels, but the increase has been lower than that of Sub-Saharan African
peers owing to the rather poor business environment in Congo (Figure 2). Over the medium
term, main risks stem from the volatility of international petroleum prices, the pace of the
expected decline in oil production, and uncertain prospects for effective exploitation of
mineral resources.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated moderately during the
last year. Since the conclusion of the last Article IV consultations in June 2012, the REER
appreciated by 3.8 percent, mainly reflecting the strengthening of the euro vis-à-vis the
US dollar (4 percent) and the significant rise of international oil prices (9 percent). Going

forward, progress in limiting the erosion of competitiveness will critically hinge on the swift
adoption of reforms agreed with development partners to improve the business environment
and broaden the export base.
3.
However, consistent with the evaluation for CEMAC, quantitative analysis
suggests that Congo’s REER is broadly in line with its medium-term fundamentals
(Table 1). Standard methodologies based on the Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER)
point to a moderate overvaluation within the range of 7 to 12 percent in real terms. 2
Nonetheless, these results are affected by significant uncertainty as standard methodologies
do not fully capture important specifics of resource rich countries—including the nonrenewable nature of their resources. 3 Traditional exchange rate assessment approaches were
therefore complemented with methodologies tailored to net oil-exporting countries. The
results of the external stability approach based on Bems and Carvalho Filho (2009) show a
somewhat improved picture with respect to the evaluation done in 2012 and indicate that the
REER is broadly in line with its medium-term determinants. 4 The authorities broadly agreed
with staff’s assessment and noted that, as production in the mining sector picks up, pressures
for real appreciation of the currency may intensify over the medium term.

The overall quality of Congo’s business environment is rather poor. The World
Bank Doing Business indicators rank Congo 183 out of 185 countries in 2013 (184 out
of 185 in 2012), suggesting significant scope for gains in addressing long-standing structural
impediments to private sector development (Figure 3). Critical areas of intervention are the
ease of starting a business, paying taxes, and trading across borders. Significant weaknesses
are also identified by the World Bank Governance indicators that position Congo largely below
the CEMAC average in areas such as government effectiveness and quality of regulation
(Figure 4). The authorities acknowledged the limited progress made in improving the business
climate so far and concurred that steadfast implementation of the reform agenda agreed with
the IFC is a critical priority. In this regard, they expressed the intention to focus on possible
“quick wins”—including effective operation of the recently established one-stop window for
customs clearance and investment promotion agency.

The exchange rate assessment with standard CGER methodologies is based on Vitek (2010) and Aydin (2010).
The dataset used for the regressions contains annual data on non-advanced countries over the period 1990–
2012.
3

For more information on the shortcomings of CGER methodologies in LICs see Prati and others (2011). In the
case of non-renewable resource-rich countries, a major pitfall pertains to the fact that the equilibrium levels of
the current account or the REER are derived abstracting from intergenerational saving and equity
considerations.
4

The assessment is robust to alternative assumptions on the current account equilibrium level (norm) that
would stabilize Congo’s NFA position at a specific benchmark level based on some rule for intertemporal
allocation of the income accruing from the sale of exhaustible resources (e.g. oil, gas).

Annex 3. Growth Inclusiveness1
Abundant natural resources and strong growth have yet to translate into significant reduction of
poverty. The quality of public investment expenditures for Congo lags behind peers; and the
social and economic infrastructure gaps remain large despite considerable increases in
investment outlays in recent years. Beyond the efforts to strengthen competiveness and foster
private sector development, the authorities are advancing growth inclusiveness by reforming the
education system, implementing employment and social safety net programs, and enhancing the
productivity of the investment budget.
1.
The poverty rate declined only modestly in recent years and is well above that of
countries with similar income level (Figure 1). Based on a recent household survey, the
poverty rate improved from 50.7 percent in 2005 to 46.5 percent in 2011.2 Poverty is
particularly acute in rural areas, affecting 75.6 percent of their population, compared to
32.3 percent in urban areas. The poverty rate decreases with the level of education; it reaches
53.2 percent among households whose heads have not received a formal education, compared
to 15.4 percent among those who have attended universities. International comparisons
indicate weak performance of the Republic of Congo in terms of poverty and human
development indicators. The country’s poverty rate is similar to the average of developing
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but its GDP per capita is about twice as high; and the poverty
rate is about twice higher than the median rate of countries with similar level of income. 3

the 2011 status presented in this figure was estimated by applying the percentage point improvement between 2005 and 2011 taken from the
national household survey. For the Human Development Index, a higher value indicates a better performance.

This analysis considers countries that have per capita GDP (in PPP US $) between 50 percent above and
below that of the Republic of Congo (i.e. between 2,300 PPP US$ and 6,280 PPP US $). The human
development index measures development by combining indicators of life expectancy, educational attainment
and income. The HDI serves as a frame of reference for both social and economic development.

Large budgeted investments have not led to significant narrowing of the social
and infrastructure gaps (Tables 1–2 and Figure 2). Congo’s average public investment budget
during the last decade was about 50 percent higher than that in the WAEMU region.
Expenditure per capita ranks third in the CEMAC region for the same period and is about four
times larger than the average of the WAEMU region. However, power outages remain frequent
and road infrastructure is far from adequate.

The education curriculum is being revised to match the needs of the labor market
and help boost employment.4 While youth unemployment exceeds 30 percent, Congo’s
labor force cannot meet firms’ skills demands. To address the skills shortage, the government
has given higher priority to technical education; and set up a committee to revise the

education curriculum as well as a public-private consultation platform on related issues.
Technical training centers have been created, manned by 120 trainers in 12 areas. A program
to alternate in-school based education and on-the-field training is under preparation; and a
memorandum of understanding is being negotiated with the private sector to provide an
effective private-public sector collaborative framework in this area.
4.
The authorities have launched support programs aim at providing transitory
income generating activities, improving skills, and facilitating access to stable
employment. The International Labor Organization estimates the unemployment rate at
16 percent.5 Four types of programs are being carried out (i) an internship program for
unemployed youths, (ii) a labor-intensive public works program, (iii) a self employment
program, and (iv) a rural employment program. Skills acquired through the first two programs
would allow beneficiaries to qualify for the latter two programs and secure long-term
employment. A total of 8,600 people have benefited from these programs to date, for a total
of a labor force of about 1.5 million.
5.
Social safety nets programs are being developed, aimed at supporting the most
vulnerable groups and providing opportunities to those with working ability to become
autonomous. Beneficiaries include people living with physical handicaps, unattended children,
and the elderly. Conditioned cash transfer programs for poor and vulnerable households are
being implemented and will be enhanced with assistance from the World Bank. Eligibility
criteria include continuous schooling of children and regular health checks for all households’
members. A pilot program would cover 5,000 households, with an objective of
250,000 households over a three-year period (for a total population of about 4 million). Other
programs are designed to gradually reduce dependency on direct social transfers: (i) laborintensive public works would generate income to households while providing opportunities to
improve skills through on-the-job trainings; (ii) a social reintegration fund offers possibilities
for the poor to create their own economic activity, and facilitates access to microcredit
financing; (iii) a community development program facilitates access to basic social services
while supporting community-based economic activities. For 2013–16, the cost of the social
safety nets programs is estimated at CFAF 218 billion (about US$ 436 million or 3 percent
of 2012 GDP).
6.
The authorities are working to improve the productivity of the investment
budget and its impact on social and economic conditions. Key reforms to that end include
an overhaul of the procurement code and the operation of a new procurement agency. A
public expenditure review is undertaken in some key sectors of human development, including
health, education and social protection; and a public expenditure management and financial
accountability review (PEMFAR) is planned for 2014. Also, the World Bank is providing
assistance in (i) improving transparency and accountability in budget management, including
in the areas of human resources management and procurement; and (ii) helping to strengthen
internal and external controls by providing assistance in strengthening the operation of the

Figures on unemployment rates are subject to large margins of uncertainty. Surveys conducted by the
authorities showed unemployment rates of 19.4 percent in 2005 and 6.9 percent in 2011.

7.
Continued and rigorous implementation of the programs spelled out above is
critical for government success in improving growth inclusiveness. In this context,
reported delays in disbursing budgeted funds for some of the employment programs should
be addressed, and necessary steps should be taken to ensure an early implementation of the
National Employment Program, and of the envisaged expansion and rationalization of ongoing
social safety net programs. Also, the focus on vocational and technical training ought to be
sustained beyond the 2013 budget.

Annex 4. Financial Sector Stability and Development1
Congo’s financial sector is largely dominated by banks. Although the country has experienced
rapid growth in intermediation in the post-conflict period, it remains financially underdeveloped.
Congo shows weaknesses in a number of areas related to the quality of policies and institutions.
The authorities have proposed a set of measures for enhancing access to credit in the context of
improving the overall business environment, but deeper reforms will be needed to remove
barriers to the effective provision of financial services.
1.
The past decade has witnessed a marked improvement of financial
intermediation. Between 2003 and 2012 credit to the private sector increased almost ninefold in nominal terms with annual growth rates exceeding 40 percent in each of the last three
years. For the same period, deposits of firms and households rose by a factor of twelve,
bringing the ratio of deposits to GDP up to 24.0 percent at end-2012 (compared to 6.8 percent
in 2003). While to some extent the dynamic growth of money and credit could be viewed as
recovery from the depressed post conflict levels, there are signs of genuine expansion of the
financial system in the recent years, including in its outreach, as evidenced by the evolution of
the banks’ branch network and the number of customers (Figure 1). 2 The intensified
competition has brought down interest rate spreads substantially – from about 15 percentage
points in the early 2000s to about 8 percentage points in 2012, the decline being driven mainly
by the dynamics of lending rates. As of December 2012, more than half of the stock of credit
to the private sector was short-term and claims were highly concentrated in a few industries

As of end-December 2012 the Congolese banking system comprised 9 banks, compared to 6 banks at
end-2010.

Credit expansion is expected to decelerate in 2013 and beyond, allaying concerns about the stability of the
financial sector; the authorities and staff concurred nevertheless about the need for close monitoring of
developments in bank lending.

2.
Despite recent favorable trends, the financial sector in Congo remains
significantly undeveloped. Standard indicators of financial depth and breadth suggest that
the country lags behind its peers at a similar level of economic development. Cross-country
comparisons of some commonly used measures, such as private credit to GDP ratio, number of
bank branches, depositors and borrowers (scaled by population) reveal that the respective
values for Congo are well below the median for a group of countries with broadly comparable
per capita GDP (Figure 2, panel A). 4 The differences are less pronounced when Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) is used as a benchmark, reflecting what is sometimes referred to as “African
financial development gap”.5 Yet, based on most metrics Congo underperforms within this
comparator group as well (Figure 2, panel B).
3.
Promoting the creation of an efficient financial system enhances long-run
economic growth. Research shows that countries with well-functioning financial sectors grow
faster and that the availability of financing helps to reduce poverty, including through
expanding the range of opportunities for education and entrepreneurship and decreasing the
dependency on initial wealth. It is therefore important for Congo to ensure that the recent
gains in financial deepening and penetration are sustained in the long run. A number of
studies have established a strong link between financial development and the quality of a
country’s policies and institutions. A simple correlation analysis for the Sub Saharan Africa
countries suggests that the private credit to GDP ratio in these countries is significantly
correlated with some of the CPIA and Doing Business indicators, such as the business and
regulatory environment rating, property rights and rule-based governance rating,
transparency, accountability and corruption rating, number of procedures necessary to enforce
a contract, credit registry coverage and depth of credit information. Congo’s standing is
relatively weak under most of these indicators which likely contributes to its shallower financial
sector (Figure 3).
4.
The Congolese authorities have identified some specific problems related to
access to credit and have designed corrective measures. As part of a broader initiative to
improve the country’s ranking in the Doing Business report, the government (together with
IFC) has introduced an action plan which among other things envisages the establishment of a
business promotion center (Maison de l’entreprise) and a special fund for guarantees and
support (FIGA—Fonds d’Impulsion, de Garanties et d’Accompagnement).6—While the details

Congo (2011 data). This group comprises 42 countries with per capita GDP in PPP between 2180 and
6540 current international dollars and includes five African countries besides Congo.
5

This term relates to the finding that after controlling for the determinants of financial intermediation, its level
in Africa is significantly lower than in other parts of the world, i.e. there is a gap relative to what is implied by
the fundamentals. A recent study attributes this gap partially to lower population density and poor
infrastructure which make interactions among firms, households and banks more difficult (Allen, F., Carletti,
E., Cull, R., Qian, J., Senbet, L., Valenzuela, P: “Resolving the African Financial Development Gap: Cross-Country
Comparisons and a Within-Country Study of Kenya”, forthcoming in the NBEER Volume on African Economic
Successes).

regarding the size of this fund or the precise mechanisms for extending the guarantees are still
being worked out, it is worth noting that in determining the parameters of the support
consideration should be given to its potential budgetary implications if the guarantees are
called. Other policies are aimed at removing constraints to credit supply, strengthening the
judicial framework and reducing the asymmetry of information through initiation of changes in
certain COBAC regulations, acceleration of the launch of an arbitration center and creation of a
centralized balance sheet bureau (Centrale des bilans) that is expected to improve the
availability and quality of accounting data. While some of the policies outlined in the action
plan are concrete and well defined, others are cast in rather general terms, which makes it
difficult to assess how effective they will be in promoting Congo’s financial sector
development.
5.
Overall, the proposed government program represents a good start but broader
and more ambitious reforms could be undertaken. In particular, there is significant scope
for improvement in the functioning of the legal system which does not seem to be efficient in
protecting creditors’ rights. Concerns have been raised that court procedures are too slow and
costly and that rulings sometimes are influenced by factors other than applying strictly the rule
of law. Increasing transparency, including through the publication of court decisions and their
motives, and shortening the duration of court procedures would address some of these
concerns.7 Unclear property rights have been a major obstacle to credit provision, at least until
recently. In this regard, the decision to establish a comprehensive property register (Fonds
national du cadastre) and one-stop shop to trace land titles is a positive step. To facilitate
further the exchange of information and thus reduce transactions costs, the coverage of the
credit registry could be expanded and the quality of information that it provides could be
enhanced, (e.g. by including information from non-bank financial institutions and utility
companies). Moving from the current practice of monthly dissemination of information to
providing real time access to the credit registry could be considered as well.
6.
Going forward, a key challenge would be to continue to improve access to
financial services without putting financial stability at risk. The loan to deposits ratio in
Congo, which currently stands at about 40 percent is deemed low by most standards. Banks
have abundant liquidity as manifested in their large excessive reserves held in the central bank
(about 25 percent of total deposits in end-2012). At the same time, the array of investment
instruments available to banks is seriously limited given the capital controls and practically
non-existing domestic securities market. Faced with a rising inflow of deposits and intensifying
competition in the sector, banks could be tempted to loosen lending standards which would
result in deterioration of the quality of their credit portfolios. Currently the share of nonperforming loans in total loans is low at 2.8 percent and banks are well capitalized; however,
the rapid expansion of credit warrants careful monitoring of the financial soundness indicators.
Against this background, relaxing prudential regulations, in particular on individual exposure
limits as advocated by some market participants, could be counterproductive. Instead, the

For instance, the average time to resolve insolvency in Congo is estimated at 3.3 years, nearly double that in
Botswana, for example (World Bank, Doing Business project 2013).

focus should be on broadening of the investment opportunities, including through the newly
launched regional government securities market.
7.
In addition to banks, microfinance institutions could play an important role in
fostering financial sector development in Congo, especially through improving access to
financial services for the poor. Microcredit institutions were first introduced in the 1980’s
under the framework of cooperatives and credit unions. As of 2009, about 62 microfinance
institutions were operating in the country. However, the volumes of deposits and credits of the
sector only represented 14.4 percent and 9.1 percent of the financial system, respectively.8 The
authorities plan to enhance cooperation between commercial banks and microfinance
institutions to improve availability of medium-term resources for the latter. To that end, the
banking supervisory agency has developed accounting software for microfinance institutions
to allow commercial banks to better assess their financial viability and the associated risks.
Postal banking has also been launched, and can support development microcredit
transactions.

Annex 5. Special Economic Zones1
1.
The authorities are pressing ahead with the creation of special economic
zones (SEZ). This initiative aims at accelerating investments, diversifying economic activities
and exports, promoting employment creation, facilitating technology transfers, supporting
integration to the global economy, and ultimately reducing poverty. To date, four economic
zones are under consideration in the regions of Ouesso, Oyo/Ollombo, Brazzaville, and Pointe
Noire; the feasibility studies are completed in all but the latter zone.2 The zones would host
investments in agriculture and agro-industry, farming, wood factories, and building materials
(including cement factories). The government would contribute by providing the required
infrastructure and facilitating administrative procedures (land, roads, electricity, security, onsite tax and customs procedures, special arbitrage, expedited labor procedures etc...). The legal
and fiscal framework is currently being prepared; preferential fiscal treatments have not been
ruled out but would be limited in compliance with relevant CEMAC regulations. A ministry in
charge of developing SEZs was created at the office of the President of the Republic.
2.
Experiences with special economic zones shows uneven results at the global
3
level. It has been more than 50 years since the creation of the first modern SEZ. The policy
rationale for SEZs is to boost competitiveness of a specific geographical zone (eventually
combined with some sectors) with the expectations that it will spur economic activity in other
zones over the medium- and long-term. This dual-track strategy led to a rapid export-led
growth in China, East Asia, some countries in Central and South America, and a few countries
in Africa (including Mauritius). In some cases, the expansion of the fast-tracked part of the
economy spilled over to other sectors of the economy, triggering positive structural change.
On the other hand, many SEZs did not produce the expected outcome or were severely
opposed, as illustrated by the experience of several African countries, Pakistan, Ukraine and
Moldova. For instance, in Senegal a SEZ was closed down by the authorities in 1999 because it
could attract only 14 companies after operating for 25 years. The Moin Free Zone in Costa Rica
received only three firms during its first eight years.
3.
The most important factors for the success of a SEZ appear to be adequate
infrastructure, enabling regulatory framework, and light administrative procedures.
Many SEZs failed because of prohibitive minimum requirements on job creation and initial
investment, a long and cumbersome process in obtaining permits, rigid labor regulation, and
high infrastructure-related production costs (energy, telecommunications and transport).
Various country experiences have shown that the SEZs built and managed by private operators

outperform those that are run by governments. Governments should provide infrastructure
and facilities only to the gate of the zone, while private developers should bear the on-site
costs and ensure operation on a cost-recovery basis. Fiscal incentives have proven to be of
little effectiveness in the success of SEZs. Incentives packages have become broadly similar as
countries are under pressure from competitors. Those packages often include tax holidays;
corporate tax reductions or exemption; duty-free importation of raw material, capital goods,
and intermediate inputs; no restrictions or taxes on capital and profits repatriation; exemption
from foreign exchange controls (where applicable); no charges on exports; and exemption
from most local and indirect taxes. Some of these incentives do not improve competitiveness,
create distortions and are a burden on the budget. For instance, profit tax holidays would most
likely not be effective as companies are not making profit in the initial years of operation;
companies would be tempted to shift their income from non-tax exempt to tax-exempt
companies through transfer pricing, and to focus on short-term investments as long-term ones
do not benefit from the tax holidays. Moreover, certain fiscal incentives can be considered as
explicit or implicit export subsidies, breaching the trade rules. Interventions that could improve
competitiveness might include accelerated depreciation, free transfer of foreign currency in
and out of the host country, introduction of SEZs under regional trade agreements, and
facilitation of SEZs’ eligibility to local contents.

_________________

Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguard Assessment:
In accordance with Safeguards Policy requirements for regional central banks, a quadrennial
safeguards assessment of the Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is underway. The
assessment, which included a mission to Yaoundé during March 20–29, 2013, occurs against
the backdrop of fraudulent activities uncovered in the BEAC office in Paris in 2009, and
subsequent special audits initiated by the BEAC authorities that identified governance

challenges and control failures. For its part, the BEAC adopted an action plan with the aim of
reforming its own governance, strengthening key safeguards, and building capacity. In
addition, a series of rolling measures were agreed between the BEAC and the IMF, as a basis
for determining whether periodic IMF program reviews could continue for those BEAC
members using IMF resources. A summary of the results of the current assessment will be
reported upon its completion.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Congo’s currency is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of
CFAF 655.95 =Euro 1. Congo does not impose any restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 19, 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings, but remains broadly adequate for surveillance.
Since the expiration of the ECF-supported program in 2011, data are provided to Fund staff
with long delays, which reached six months at times, due to lengthy procedures and weak
capacity. Insufficient coordination among different governmental agencies and with the
regional institutions obstructs data consistency and availability. Since the occurrence of
governance problems at the BEAC, timely delivery of financial sector data has been hampered.
Technical assistance has resulted in some progress, and the authorities are taking steps to
consolidate these gains and further strengthen statistical capacities.
National Accounts: National accounts data is weak, with inconsistencies both internally and
with balance of payments statistics. The Directorate General of Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry
of Finance (MoF) provides Fund missions with a breakdown of GDP by expenditures and
sectors, both in nominal and real terms. In the context of moving to the SNA93 system of
accounts, the DGS completed the national accounts estimates for 2005 (the new base year)
and for 2006–07, with the assistance of a resident statistical expert and AFRITAC Central. The
authorities are currently working with the AFRITAC Central to revise national accounts’
estimates back to 2000 and up to 2010. Annual data on employment in the central
government are available from the MoF. As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the
context of the post-conflict program, the government completed an audit of public service
employees.
Price statistics: Movements in the prices of commodities consumed by households are
recorded for the capital city of Brazzaville and for Pointe Noire, the center of economic
activities. Data are compiled on a monthly basis. Starting August 2010, the authorities
introduced a new CPI measure with new weights and a new composition of the basket of
goods and service. This new CPI is harmonized with that of other countries in the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
Government finance statistics (GFS): Data provision has become sporadic since end-2011.
The authorities have recently set up a centralized reporting system to improve the monitoring
of budget execution and the timely availability of data. The result of this initiative is still to be
seen. Progress is underway to increase the comprehensiveness of the data through the
adoption of systematic compilation practices and steps have been taken to computerize
expenditure chain accounting. However, the recording of fiscal financing in the official table of
financial operations of the State is incomplete and results in large, unexplained statistical
discrepancies. The Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement (CCA) produces data on the
outstanding stock of external public debt, including arrears and their composition, together
with detailed projections on debt service due. These data are provided to Fund missions.
However, the debt stock data cannot readily be reconciled with flow data in the fiscal accounts.
The CCA also produces domestic debt data. Concerns still exist with regard to the
reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics. There is no centralized, comprehensive
database on the operations of public enterprises.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

Monetary statistics: BEAC reports monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for
publication in IFS, albeit with delay. In 2007, the BEAC started a project to migrate monetary
statistics of member countries of the CEMAC to the methodology in the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). As part of this project, a regional workshop was organized
by the BEAC in December 2007 to finalize the mapping of source data from commercial banks
to the MFSM concepts and framework. STA participated in this workshop to provide guidance
and advice. Submission of data by the BEAC using the standardized report forms is pending.
Following governance issues that occurred in 2009 at the BEAC, data delivery on financial
system indicators has been hampered. The accuracy of national monetary statistics may be
affected by large cross-border movements of BEAC issued banknotes among CEMAC member
countries. However, the Republic of Congo is moderately affected by such movements:
10 percent of banknotes issued in the Republic of Congo by the BEAC national directorate
circulate in Cameroon and 2 percent in Gabon, while currency in circulation in the Republic of
Congo includes 0.9 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and 1.9 percent from Gabon. The
magnitude of banknote movements between the Republic of Congo and CEMAC member
countries other than Cameroon and Gabon is very small. There are also long delays regarding
data on the soundness of the banking system.
Balance of payments: Although BEAC produces balance of payments data, delays occur and
data suffers from significant inconsistencies with other datasets. The opacity surrounding
certain transactions in the oil sector introduces an extra layer of imprecision. Balance of
payments data for 1995 through 2005 are published in the Fund’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS), and STA is working with the authorities in updating the data series. In
February 2007, a follow-up STA balance of payments statistics mission made a number of
recommendations aimed at improving institutional arrangements for balance of payments
statistics compilation and validation. Progress in this regard has been slow, delaying the
process for finalizing BoP data for 2005–10. The balance of payments committee, in charge of
data reconciliation, validated the BoP for 2008; the validation for subsequent years is still
pending as the committee does not meet on a regular basis.
Data Standards and Quality
The Republic of Congo participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 5, 2003. However, the metadata posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB) has not been updated or certified since 2003. No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA
The Republic of Congo reported (in September 2008) GFS data to STA for fiscal years 2004
and 2005 using the GFSM 2001 template—data for 2006–10 has experienced delays. Highfrequency fiscal data has not yet been reported for publication in IFS. The compilation of GFS
statistics to be reported to the Fund should be carried out in close cooperation with the
division in charge of statistics on financial operations of the government.

Congo’s debt outlook has strengthened further since the last debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) conducted in 2011 (EBS/11/118, Supplement 1). Under the baseline
scenario for the current DSA all debt burden indicators are projected to be significantly
below the indicative policy thresholds and the standard stress tests do not result in
breaches of these thresholds. As a result, the Republic of Congo remains at a low risk of
debt distress. However, the economy continues to be vulnerable to external shocks and, in
particular, to adverse changes in oil prices. This calls for continued efforts to promote
diversification of the economy away from oil to increase the economy’s resilience; and to
ensure medium- and long-term fiscal and debt sustainability, including through
continued adherence to prudent borrowing policies.

BACKGROUND
4.
Congo’s stock of external debt has declined substantially thanks to
comprehensive HIPC/MRDI debt relief. As noted in the previous DSA, Congo reached the
HIPC Initiative Completion Point in January 2010 which resulted in estimated total debt service
savings of $1.9 billion, and a

nearly two-thirds of total debt
(Text Table 1). Domestic public debt is relatively low at 6 percent of GDP and mainly comprises
arrears, including wage arrears to employees in the social sectors. An audit of government
domestic arrears is underway; a repayment plan will be developed after the outstanding
amounts are confirmed.
5.
The sustainability of Congo’s debt should be assessed in the context of the
country’s sizeable assets. Government deposits at BEAC stood at about 20 percent of GDP at
end-2012; and the government is holding deposits abroad and has extended loans to some
African countries (for an estimated total of about 29 percent of GDP); thus, Congo’s net debt
position is negative. The strong external position reflects the impact of continuing high oil
prices since the achievement of HIPC/MDRI debt relief in 2010. As the government continues
to save part of the oil revenue and to build foreign assets, the net public debt is expected to
remain in the negative territory throughout the projections horizon. Relative to GDP, the net
debt position is projected to peak at the equivalent of a negative 105 percent of GDP
around 2022 and gradually decline thereafter reflecting decreasing oil proceeds.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The medium and long-term macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is
consistent with the baseline scenario presented in the Staff Report for 2013 Article IV
Consultation. The main assumptions and projections for key macroeconomic variables are
summarized in Box 1. Economic activity is expected to remain strong, largely driven by the
non-oil sector. While oil production is foreseen to fluctuate around current levels until 2018,
38

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

growth in the non-oil sector is projected to be robust, reflecting developments in construction,
agriculture and services. The authorities are assumed to undertake large initial capital outlays
to address the country’s infrastructure gap. Once a threshold of public capital stock is reached,
corresponding to middle-income countries level, public investments would be gradually
contained as private investments pick up, attracted by the more enabling infrastructure base.
Growth would be supported by this dynamics. Compared to the macroeconomic framework
underpinning the 2011 DSA, the main difference relates to the assumed external borrowing
conditions, particularly for the loan disbursements under the strategic bilateral partnership
with China, which have been revised as per the latest discussions with the authorities. In the
mining sector, considering the large uncertainty, a conservative approach is adopted; only one
of Congo’s iron ore projects under development is assumed to reach the production phase,
keeping output and activity relatively low. Removing existing sector-specific infrastructure
bottlenecks in transportation would provide a significant boost to longer-term growth at the
cost of significant initial investments.
7.
Under the baseline, the current account balance is expected to remain positive in
the medium term. This implies a further increase in international reserves and no pressing
external financing needs for the economy. In line with these projections, new external
borrowing in the medium term would largely be limited to a second bilateral loan with China
in the amount of $1 billion for which negotiations are underway. Disbursements are assumed
to take place in the course of four years starting in 2013, and on concessional terms and
conditions identical to those of the existing Chinese loan. In the longer run, as the oil exports
decline becomes more pronounced and non-oil export receipts fall short of compensating for
the loss, additional financing would be needed. The present DSA assumes financing for the
gap to be secured on concessional terms, although with a grant element somewhat lower than
that under the current China loan.

Box 1. Republic of Congo: Main Macroeconomic Assumptions


Real GDP growth: The non-oil sector is projected to grow robustly by 7.5 percent during
2013–20 driven by construction, agriculture and services; growth would stabilize at about
5 percent thereafter. Despite a large potential, mining production is assumed to originate from
only one project, given the uncertainties surrounding the other projects (including sluggish
global demand and the need for large investment in infrastructure). Thus, production would
start timidly in 2013 at 120,000 tons, augment to 2 million tons in 2015 and stabilize at a
conservative projection of 7 million tons from 2017.



Oil production and prices: Oil production is expected to fluctuate around 100 million barrels
per year during 2013–18. Based on existing licenses, production would decline by 15 million
barrels per year during 2019–32, leading to a drop of annual production from 100 million
barrels in 2012 to about 10 million barrels in 2032. Prices at international markets are projected
to decrease by about 3 percent per year during 2013–18; thereafter, this analysis assumes
constant prices in real terms.



Inflation: Following the sharp acceleration to 7.5 percent (year-on-year) in 2012, inflation is
expected to drop to 4.1 percent by end-2013 as the impact of the shocks related to the
ammunitions depot explosion in 2012 dissipates. In the medium term, inflation is projected to
decline gradually below the CEMAC’s convergence criteria of 3 percent.



Current account balance: The fluctuation of the current account balance is driven by the
dynamics of exports and imports in the oil and mining sectors. The balance is expected to be
positive until 2018, supported by the oil sector; however, it would turn to a widening deficit
thereafter as the currently assumed iron ore production would not suffice to compensate for
the decline in oil production.



Fiscal balance: The authorities are expected to continue adhering to the fiscal rule introduced
in 2013. Following the brisk increase in expenditures in 2012, fiscal consolidation would
resume in 2013 and be continued in the medium- and long-term. The basic non-oil primary
deficit would improve from about 63 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012 to 27 percent in 2018 and
about 4 percent in the long run.



External financing: A second agreement with China is assumed in the medium-term, with
total disbursements of US$ 1 billion during 2013–16. These disbursements would finance
reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the 2012 ammunitions depot explosions and
contribute to address Congo’s infrastructure and skills gaps. The agreement is assumed to be
highly concessional, similar to one entered into in 2006. In the long run, external borrowing
would be needed to ensure a minimum public investment of about 6 percent of GDP.

8.
The macroeconomic outlook is subject to risks. The baseline scenario is built around
relatively favorable assumptions about commodity prices and the continued concessionality in
new public sector borrowing. Also, the Congolese economy is highly vulnerable to external
shocks, notably to a fall in oil prices or slowdown of trade partners’ demand. The government
has accumulated sufficient fiscal and external reserves to mitigate the immediate effects of
such shocks. A protracted worsening of the terms of trade or foreign demand may
nevertheless trigger severe imbalances and require additional borrowing to avoid a sharp
contraction in income and could have negative implications for debt sustainability.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
9.
All of Congo’s debt indicators are below the relevant country-specific debt
burden thresholds. The joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income
countries classifies Congo as a “weak” performer, based on the quality of the country’s policies
and institutions as measured by the 3-year average of the ratings under the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). This is reflected in lower debt sustainability
thresholds compared to countries operating in a strong policy environment (Text Table 2).
Nevertheless, given the low level of external debt and strengthening indicators of repayment
capacity, the debt stock and debt service ratios remain comfortably within the sustainable debt
domain throughout the projections period under the baseline.
10.
Stress tests do not result in breach of the indicative thresholds either. Standard
bound tests that examine the implications of various shocks for the debt and debt-service
paths based on the country’s historical volatility result only in moderate increases in the debt
burden indicators (Figure 1). For all indicators, except for the debt-service to revenue ratio, the
most extreme scenario is associated with a shock to exports. A decline in exports to a level
equivalent to one standard deviation below their historical average in the first two years of the
projection period would cause the PV of debt to GDP ratio to rise by about 4 percentage
points and the PV of debt to export ratio by 10 percentage points at the peak.39 Under the
historical scenario, which derives the debt indicators assuming that key variables are at their
10-year historical averages, all debt ratios decline very rapidly. However, as pointed out in the
previous DSA, this scenario is less relevant for resource-rich countries since past trends are
likely a poor predictor of future outcomes.40

The vulnerability stems from very high share of oil in Congo’s exports and large volatility of oil prices and
production.

Therefore, the historical scenario is not shown in the graph. Moreover, the debt dynamics under this
scenario results in negative debt-burden indicators.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
11.
Adding domestic public debt to external debt does not change the results of the
analysis. Given the low level of Congo’s domestic public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
and lack of access to private markets, the evolution of the total public debt indicators broadly
follows that of external debt under the baseline. The most extreme shock (in this case real GDP
growth in 2013–14 set at one standard deviation below its historical average) raises the PV of
debt to GDP ratio substantially to over 50 percent in the outer years of the projections period,
and stabilizes at this level. A permanently lower GDP growth would have a similar, albeit
somewhat smaller, effect on the debt ratios. The results of the bound tests should be
interpreted with caution as they do not capture appropriately the accumulation of assets by
the government, which in the case of Congo is quite significant, especially in the initial years of
high primary surpluses.

CONCLUSIONS
12.
The DSA shows that the Republic of Congo continues to face a low risk of debt
distress, unchanged from the 2011 DSA. All external debt indicators are well below the
country-specific indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario and none of these
thresholds are breached under the various standard stress tests. Congo is unlikely to resort to
extensive external borrowing in the near future given the comfortable level of reserves which
could be used as a buffer to smooth consumption in difficult economic times. It is therefore
important for the government to adhere to its medium-term fiscal framework and to save the
excess revenue according to the adopted fiscal rule. Should a need for additional borrowing
arise, new loans should be contracted on concessional terms to the extent possible in order to
maintain debt sustainability.
13.
Improving competitiveness and promoting economic diversification are key to
increasing resilience to exogenous shocks. As the DSA indicates, Congo’s debt ratios appear
to be most sensitive to swings in exports. Given the high concentration and vulnerability of the
economy to downward movements in oil prices, broadening of the economic base by
enhancing the development of the non-oil sector would reduce the volatility of exports and
would strengthen the debt service capacity of the Congolese economy. In this regard, the
national program for improvement of the business environment that the authorities recently
launched with assistance from the World Bank to strengthen competitiveness and diversify and
boost growth, is a welcome step; it ought to be rigorously implemented. In the same vein, in
addressing Congo’s weak physical and human capital, priority should be given to making
electricity supply more reliable and competitive, and to enhancing the quality of transportation
services and of the labor force.
14.
The authorities broadly concur with the conclusions of the DSA. They expressed
commitment to continuing prudent external borrowing policies.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Congo
On August 30, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo on a lapse-of-time basis,
and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.1, 2
The Republic of Congo is endowed with abundant natural resources, notably oil and iron ore.
Proven oil reserves are estimated at about 2 billion barrels; and the country has large iron ore
deposits and a vast agricultural potential.
Supported by an improving political situation, macroeconomic performance strengthened
markedly in the run up to and aftermath of the 2010 Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative completion point. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 6.5 percent
during 2009–11, with robust activity in both the non-oil and oil sectors. Inflationary pressures
were subdued, and the financial sector remained sound. Moreover, against the background of
high oil prices, the government accumulated large fiscal savings. However, in contrast with the
broadly satisfactory macroeconomic performance, the incidence of poverty stood at a high
46.5 percent in 2011. In 2012, economic developments were dominated by the authorities’

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report,
which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The lapse-of-time procedure is proposed for article IV consultations where the following conditions apply: (i)
there are no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or
circumstances are unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program
review is being completed, it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources
is not under discussion or anticipated.

fiscal response to the explosion of an ammunitions depot in Brazzaville. The government’s
swift response in attending to the needs of the victims and beginning reconstruction
underpinned a brisk increase in public outlays, which pushed end-year inflation to 7.5 percent
(year-on-year). Spending was nevertheless lower than budgeted owing to capacity and other
administrative constraints; and the government’s financial situation remained broadly
comfortable.
In 2013, the fiscal and external positions are expected to improve further. However,
preliminary data points to somewhat weaker than-initially-anticipated economic activity,
owing to a decline in oil production. Real GDP growth is nevertheless projected at 5.8 percent;
and inflation is easing as the effects of the 2012 sharp increase in government spending
dissipate. In the financial sector, credit to the private sector remains strong.
The medium-term prospects are generally favorable. While oil production is expected to
fluctuate quite considerably, growth should remain robust in the non-oil sector, sustained by
the Republic of Congo’s large oil revenues; and membership in the CFA franc zone should
continue serving the country well as an anchor for macroeconomic stability. The main risks to
the outlook are related to possible downward pressures on oil prices, stemming from
uncertainties in the Euro area and emerging markets. On the domestic front, prospects hinge on
ensuring that the next presidential elections in 2016 are run smoothly.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo, Executive
Directors endorsed the staff appraisal, as follows:
The Republic of Congo remains on a path of strong growth, but significant gains in poverty
reduction have yet to materialize. Congo ought to make growth more inclusive while
preserving macroeconomic stability. To this end, the authorities’ medium-term policy agenda
appropriately aims at seeking further gains in budget consolidation while scaling up
investment to address large infrastructure and skills gaps; fostering economic diversification
and private sector development; and improving governance and transparency. Invigorating

growth and enhancing the effectiveness of the poverty reduction strategy in the period ahead
will require the rigorous implementation of reforms underway in these critical areas.
Continued close adherence to stability-prone fiscal policies is key to consolidating the recent
gains in macroeconomic stability. The ongoing efforts to strengthen non-oil revenue collection
in the context of a new fiscal rule that protects spending against the volatility of oil receipts are
commendable. The newly introduced fiscal rule ought to be expanded and cast in a framework
that accounts for the exhaustibility of oil reserves as well. While supporting pro-growth and
pro-poor outlays, the proposed rule-based fiscal framework should seek the achievement of
significant fiscal savings over the long term, necessary to build up buffers and sustain
reasonable levels of expenditures in the post-oil era. In this context, the Republic of Congo
should continue adhering to a prudent borrowing policy to preserve long-term debt
sustainability after HIPC/Multilateral; Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). World Bank-supported
measures to improve public investment management ought to be timely implemented.
The external stability assessment points to additional improvements in the last year, but
competitiveness ought to be further strengthened. The real effective exchange rate is in line
with macroeconomic fundamentals, but external competitiveness is being stifled by deeplyrooted structural impediments to private sector development. The reform measures agreed to
with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to improve the business environment ought
to be promptly implemented, including by making the recently established Investment
Promotion Agency fully operational and streamlining the administrative requirements for
engaging in business activities.
Improving governance and business conditions is needed to support strong private sector-led
growth and poverty reduction. The authorities have reached compliant status under the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative; they now have to expedite adoption of the fiscal
transparency law that is currently under review in Parliament. To diversify the economy and
promote employment, the Government is developing Special Economic Zones (SEZs);
strengthening technical and vocational education; and introducing special employmentsupporting programs. In parallel, innovative social safety net arrangements are being set up to
protect the most vulnerable groups. The timely availability of budgeted funds will be needed to
ensure that these programs are well implemented. As regards the SEZs program, the

government should avoid granting special fiscal incentives that create distortions and often
give rise to abusive practices, focusing instead on revamping infrastructure and advancing
administrative facilitation.
While the medium-term prospects are generally favorable, the authorities should be vigilant to
risks related to downward pressures on world oil prices. Despite anticipated fluctuations in oil
production over the next years, real GDP growth should remain robust and inflation would be
contained around the CEMAC (Central African Economic and Monetary Community) target
of 3 percent. However, uncertainties in the Euro area and a weakening of investment in the
emerging markets, resulting in lower than-currently projected world oil prices, would cloud
the country’s otherwise favorable outlook.
The Republic of Congo should fully comply with its CEMAC obligations. The authorities are
supporting and closely monitoring the ongoing review of the regional central bank (BEAC)’s
reserves management framework. Pending completion of the review, relevant CEMAC
commitments should be fully observed to insure the continued smooth operation of the BEAC
and the pegged exchange rate arrangement. The authorities are encouraged to step up the
efforts to ensure the timely provision of information to the Fund on the standard
macroeconomic data that is required for effective surveillance.
