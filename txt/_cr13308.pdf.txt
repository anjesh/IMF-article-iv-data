OF ETHIOPIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 29, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Ethiopia’s public sector-led development strategy has contributed to considerable
poverty reduction and progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as
envisaged under the authorities’ Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). Economic growth has
been robust, and inflation has declined to single digits. The investment requirements of the GTP
are large and securing the associated financing remains a challenge. Without greater scope for
the private sector the realization of the GTP’s objectives could be elusive.
Growth and inflation prospects: Real GDP growth remains robust and is estimated by staff at
7 percent in 2012/13 and projected to increase to 7.5 percent in 2013/14 and 2014/15 before
tapering-off slightly in subsequent years under current policies.1 Inflation has been brought down
to around 7 percent at end 2012/13 and is projected to remain in single digits.
Policy mix: The discussions focused on policies to sustain robust and inclusive growth and
structural transformation in the context of prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Staff
recommendations centered on maintaining pro-poor expenditure, improving the investment
climate, and adjusting the overall fiscal stance with the aim of creating greater room for the
private sector to further leverage large public investments. Enhancing external competitiveness
and building adequate foreign reserves (to at least three months of imports) through greater
exchange rate flexibility and improved productivity of the traded goods sector were
recommended to enhance resiliency. Bolstering capacity at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) for
the formulation and implementation of financial sector policies to promote financial deepening
and broader inclusion were considered important for the realization of the GTP objectives.
Risks: Persistent shortfalls in the financing of planned infrastructure investment and a tightening
of foreign exchange availability could constrain medium-term growth in the absence of policy
adjustments. A significant slow - down of the major emerging markets could also hamper
development plans and robust growth.

Historical GDP statistics are official data and are subject to significant weaknesses. Applying plausible factor
productivities would suggest that the annual GDP growth rate prior to 2011/12 could be overestimated by as
much as 3 percentage points (Annex 1).

Income distribution in the country is relatively even. Among Sub-Saharan African
countries, Ethiopia is one of the most egalitarian with
a Gini coefficient of 33.6 (Figure 3) and it has
consistently maintained this distribution in the last
ten years. With a large population and more than
80 percent of it in rural areas, Ethiopia stands out
among comparable African countries regarding
relatively even income distribution, although there
are likely differences between rural and urban
populations.

3.
Economic growth has helped to reduce unemployment particularly in urban areas.
While overall unemployment rate stands at about

the urban areas.

A public sector-led growth strategy centered on high public investment has been

instrumental in delivering these results. The strategy, which calls for substantial external financing
and state mobilization of domestic resources, has provided an important impetus to growth.
Combined with pro-poor spending that has averaged more than 12 percent of GDP over the past
decade, this has helped improve living standards. Following the passing of Prime Minister Meles in
August 2012, the new Prime Minister Hailemariam has reaffirmed the state-led model and the public
investment plan embodied in the GTP. Developments in the first two years (2010/11–2011/12) of the
GTP suggest that the required external financing is not materializing, and the investment drive in the
priority projects through directed domestic credit is squeezing the availability of credit and foreign
exchange for the rest of the economy.

The recommendations from the 2012 Article IV consultation have only been partially

implemented. The authorities brought inflation down to single digits. While, owing to the decline in
inflation, the extent to which real interest rates were negative have been reduced, positive real
interest rates are yet to be realized and liquidity management at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE)
remains to be improved. Similarly, progress has been slow on structural reforms to allow proper
functioning of financial markets; to liberalize the foreign exchange or improve the business climate.
Much emphasis continue to be put by the authorities on improving physical infrastructure such as
roads, railway, and electricity supply, which they believe would help improve business climate. The
2013 Article IV discussions touched upon these recommendations, which remain valid.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic and Policy Developments
6.

Recent macroeconomic developments are encouraging, with a significant deceleration

in inflation and continued robust economic growth (Figures 5, 6, and 7). Despite significant
decline in coffee prices and supply bottlenecks growth remains robust, supported by better
agricultural output and construction and other services activities.4 Inflation declined from the peak
of 40 percent in July 2011 to around 7 percent in June 2013, lower than initially projected by staff.
This has significantly eased the extent to which real interest rates were negative, reducing the
severity of the distortionary effect on financial intermediation. Pressures resulting in foreign
exchange shortages in the wake of the passing away of Prime Minister Meles, have eased, although
the spread between the official and parallel markets is yet to be eliminated.
7.

Fiscal policy at the general government level remains prudent with cautious execution

of the government budget. 5 Overall revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall from 14.0 percent in
2011/12 to 13.2 percent in 2012/13. Reflecting the strong pro-poor focus, the ratio of
poverty-reducing expenditure to GDP is being maintained and non-priority expenditure will likely be
compressed in 2012/13. Staff estimates the government budget deficit, including grants, to be
2.8 percent of GDP.

4

GDP statistics in Ethiopia are subject to significant weaknesses. Applying plausible factor productivities would
suggest that the annual GDP growth rate could be off by as much as 3 percentage points in recent years. In the past
two years, staff used its own estimates showing lower GDP growth. The methodology improved considerably in
2011/12 and the authorities are continuing efforts to further strengthen national accounts statistics. Staff has thus
reverted to using official statistics, but has stressed the need to further improve national accounts data and offered
technical assistance (see Annex I).

Excluding public enterprises.

8.

However, public enterprises continue to expand their investment activities. Net credit

expansion (through loans and corporate bonds) from the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) to
public enterprises (in the 10 months up to April, 2013) alone accounted for 3 percent of GDP. In
addition, they borrowed from the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and through bond issuance
for the construction of Renaissance Dam, which is proceeding as planned. The dam is estimated by
the authorities to cost 10 percent of 2012/13 GDP and is intended to be entirely financed
domestically.
9.

An accurate overall fiscal stance for the consolidated public sector (including public

enterprises) is difficult to gauge, although it would seem considerably more expansionary.
While appropriately consolidated data on the overall public sector finances were not available,
external financing of public enterprises in 2012/13 was 2.3 percent of GDP and the monetary survey
indicates additional domestic financing of public enterprises from the banking sector of 4.3 percent
of GDP in 2012/13, not taking into account non-bank financing of the Renaissance Dam. This implies
overall public sector (including public enterprises) borrowing of at least 9.4 percent of GDP in
2012/13.
10.

Although the monetary stance remains generally tight to keep inflation in single

digits, recent developments point to some relaxation. Base money contracted by 4 percent in
2011/12, achieved by not extending any new NBE credit to the government and foreign exchange
sales. Annual base money growth at end-May 2013 stood at 18 percent (compared to one percent
contraction for end-May 2012) and the authorities adjusted only slightly the base money target for
the year at 13 percent from 12.2 percent. The pickup reflects an increase in net domestic credit, net
foreign assets, and in other items net. Achieving the 13 percent target implies a very tight monetary
policy for the remainder of the fiscal year. The reserve requirement ratio has been further lowered
recently (March 2013) from 10 percent to 5 percent, following an earlier (January 2012) lowering by
5 percentage points, and NBE sterilized the resulting liquidity injection through the sale of certificate
deposits, reflecting lack of clarity in monetary policy decision-making. Broad money growth remains
somewhat high and stood at 28 percent in 2012/13.
11.

The external current account deficit widened slightly to US$3 billion in 2012/13 from

US$2.8 billion in 2011/12, reflecting a weaker trade balance, although it improved as a ratio
of GDP from 6.6 percent to 6.4 percent. Export performance suffered from a decline in prices and
weak external demand conditions, growing only 3.2 percent (in nominal terms), while continued
infrastructure and industrial investment and higher fuel importation contributed to an increase in
imports by 6.3 percent. Transfers brought in a net inflow of around US$5 billion due to a surge in
net private transfers that more than offset a decline in official transfers. Increased loan

disbursements to the central government and public enterprises yielded a capital account surplus of
US$3.4 billion. The resulting surplus on the overall balance of payments was less than US$0.2 billion
(0.4 percent of GDP) compared to a deficit of US$1.1 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) in 2011/12. The
NBE’s gross international reserves slightly declined to US$2.2 billion (1.8 months of imports) at the
end of 2012/13 from US$2.3 (1.9 months of imports) at the end of 2011/12.
12.

Foreign exchange supply came under pressure in the first half of 2012/13. The passing

of Prime Minister Meles created uncertainty and excess demand in the foreign exchange market
which was also reflected in a widening of the premium in the parallel market. Since its previous peak
in October 2008, the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) reached the highest level in
November 2012, indicating an erosion of competitiveness gains from previous devaluations which
may also be a factor in the recent trade performance. This has started to turn around with the recent
decline in inflation, although the REER may still be significantly overvalued based on the IMF’s
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate methodology (Annex II).

B. Medium Term Outlook and Risks
13.

Outlook. Inflation has been brought down to about 7 percent at end-2012/13 and is

projected to remain in single digit over the medium-term.6 The current account deficit as a
percentage of GDP is projected to slightly improve over the medium-term, as exports recover after
declining in 2012/13. Moderate recovery in external demand and ongoing efforts to improve
productivity, increase value-added, and diversification of the export base (covering, for example,
agricultural and agro-industrial, horticultural, livestock, light manufactures, and electricity exports)
are expected to support export growth. Overall economic growth is projected to remain robust in
2013/14 and beyond but fall short of the highly ambitious GTP target. Constraints on external
financing for public investment, uncertain external demand, and a cumbersome business
environment are the factors underpinning the growth shortfall. Reflecting continued uncertain
global environment and unchanged policies, the projected growth rate tapers-off over the mediumterm falling further short of the ambitious GTP target.
14.
Risks. Key risks to the outlook include (i) a continuation of limited financing for
infrastructure investment in the GTP; (ii) re-emergence of severe foreign exchange shortages;
(iii) significant growth slowdown in the major emerging market countries; and (iv) weather-related
shocks, particularly a possible drought returning to the Horn of Africa (Table 1).
6

Taking into account developments on the ground, in particular better than anticipated inflation at the end of the
fiscal year 2012/13 and less severe negative real interest rates, staff has adjusted its projections, notably on broad
money.

Strain on the state-owned
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
resulting from increased domestic
financing of GTP.

Given the systemic importance of CBE
(70 percent of total banking sector assets),
it would slow down the entire Ethiopian
economy, resulting in significant
deceleration of medium-term growth and
a buildup of further vulnerabilities on both
domestic and external fronts.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

PROMOTING INCLULSIVE GROWTH AND REDUCING
VULNERABILITIES
15.

Ethiopia has been able to translate its broad-based economic growth into significant

poverty reduction. Both rural and urban areas have experienced significant increases in per capita
consumption between 1995 and 2011. Improvements in nonmonetary measures, such as primary
schooling and life expectancy have been particularly impressive (Table 7). However, further efforts
are needed, to identify and address the needs of those in severe and chronic poverty and to
significantly reduce malnutrition. In addition, to sustain the gains in poverty reduction, improving
access to factor and product markets for the bulk of the population would be important.
16.

The government’s objective is to become a middle-income country by 2025. The GTP

envisages achieving an average economic growth target of 11.2 percent over 2010/11–2014/15 and
realizing the MDGs. Among the key pillars are raising agricultural productivity and scaling-up
infrastructure and human capital development. The authorities seek to realize their ambitious
development objectives through proactive public policies with heavy state involvement in
infrastructure and industrial investments. Although the required financing for the GTP has not been
fully spelled out, the expansion of domestic credit to public entities has constrained the availability
of credit and foreign exchange for the private sector. Policies thus need to be adapted for an
appropriate balance between the public and private sectors to enhance the resiliency of the
country’s developmental model.
17.

On the basis of a continuation of current policies, a deceleration of medium-term

growth is expected, pointing to the need for policy adjustments. The baseline projections
assume the continuation of current policies, including constraints on private banking activities,
directed lending with artificially low real interest rates and allocation of foreign exchange to priority
public investment projects. Some of these policies undermine the authorities’ growth objectives and
have contributed to the recent foreign exchange shortages, especially for the private sector.
Domestic financing is unlikely to meet the requirements of the GTP and prospective external inflows
are insufficient to fill the gap. Absent mid-course policy correction, in particular strengthening
private sector leverage in the economy, the government’s 11 percent growth target is likely to be
elusive. Based on a domestic financing which is less compared to full financing of the GTP, staff
projects growth in the 7–7.5 percent range over the medium term (Table 2).7

7

Domestic financing and prospective external inflows amount roughly to two third of full financing of the GTP.

14

18.

Policy discussions focused on sustaining robust and inclusive growth and structural

transformation while maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and mitigating
vulnerabilities. Key recommendations include (i) rationalizing and appropriately pacing public
sector investment, especially for state-owned enterprises, (ii) keeping inflation under control,
eliminating exchange rate overvaluation, and restoring reserve adequacy; (iii) strengthening financial
deepening and inclusiveness, bringing real interest rates to positive levels, and enhancing access to
finance for farmers and small and medium enterprises; and (iv) increasing the scope for the private
sector’s role in the economy (Table 1). The implementation of these recommendations would
facilitate financial development that should enable less distortionary financing of the GTP that is
consistent with debt sustainability.
19.

Staff has developed an alternative scenario that targets stronger growth while

safeguarding macroeconomic stability and reducing vulnerabilities and that is consistent with
the policies mentioned above (Table 6). Under staff’s alternative (adjustment) scenario, the
growth rate is projected to rise to 9.5 percent in 2016–17 and inflation is targeted to decline further
to 6 percent by 2014–15, as positive real interest rates expand the deposit base, the exchange rate is
kept competitive, private sector access to credit from the banking system increases.

C. Fiscal Policy: Stance and Inclusion
Fiscal stance
20.

The fiscal stance embodied in 2013/14 general government budget submitted to

parliament recently is appropriately restrained (Tables 3a and 3b). However, despite the
government’s revenue mobilization efforts, the revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall from
13.2 percent in 2012/13 to 12.9 percent in 2013/14. Reflecting the ongoing efforts to improve tax
administration, the tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise but nontax revenue is slated to fall on
account of lower dividends from state-owned enterprises. The authorities are relying on
administrative improvements to increase revenue substantially. Staff encouraged the authorities to
consider the revenue potential of reducing tax expenditure and tax incentives and improved tax
collection, along the lines identified by IMF FAD technical assistance.8
21.

The budgetary focus on pro-poor spending has been impressive and the 2013/14

budget aims to strengthen this further (Box 1). To maintain the ratio of poverty-reducing
expenditure to GDP, its share in the total expenditure will need to rise as federal government
8

Since 2012 FAD undertook a series of TA missions, recommending rationalization of tax incentives and tax
expenditures. Staff alternative scenario suggests that annual tax revenue gain ranges from 0.4 percent to 2 percent of
GDP over the next five years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

support to regional governments for MDGs wanes as projects receiving this allocation approach
completion by 2014/15, the target year for the MDGs (for a discussion of pro-poor spending see
also the accompanying Selected Issues Paper).
22.

Public financial management (PFM) reforms are yielding significant improvements in

the budgetary processes. Program-based budgeting is in the second year of full implementation
and cash management reform, with the aim of reducing idle cash in the various government
accounts and improving the quality of fiscal reporting, is progressing well. Staff stresses the need to
maintain the momentum in these areas. The IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department is prepared to provide
continued technical assistance as requested by the authorities.

Public sector debt
23.

The pace of accumulation of overall public sector debt deserves close attention. A rapid

growth of credit to public enterprises to finance major investments in dams, factories, and housing
construction continues to drive this buildup. The net worth of the government is thus heavily
exposed to the direct borrowing by these enterprises and contingent liabilities stemming from such
lending by CBE and DBE. Staff stresses the need for comprehensive and timely information on the
financial position of public enterprises as part of the enhancement to the medium-term debt
strategy.
24.

Debt sustainability analysis continues to show that Ethiopia remains at a low risk of

external debt distress. It is predicated on a conservative disbursement profile that is considerably
lower than the requirements for the full implementation of the GTP. Staff encourages the authorities
as in the 2012 Article IV consultation to seek concessional external financing and reconsider the
pacing of the investments if scaled-up external financing on manageable terms is not forthcoming
and authorities intend to maintain their low risk of external debt distress.
25.

Domestic debt is rising and vulnerabilities will continue to increase as large public

investments draw financing from domestic sources. Beyond a certain limit, such financing could
be destabilizing and/or inflationary, suggesting that careful consideration should be given to the
sustainability of the overall financing envisaged in the GTP. Consideration should be given to
developing a comprehensive debt management strategy covering total public debt, including the
debt of public enterprises, to improve public fiscal management and monitoring of the total fiscal
stance.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Fiscal policy and inclusiveness
26.

The tax structure of Ethiopia with its heavy reliance on indirect taxes suggests scope

for making it more equitable even though income tax brackets appear somewhat progressive.
Staff could not estimate the incidence
of taxes for various income cohorts
due to data constraints. However, tax
revenue in Ethiopia derives largely
from international transactions—on
average 4.8 percent of GDP in
1999/00–2011/12, compared with
regional comparators’ average of
1.4 percent—suggesting a relatively
regressive revenue structure. Income taxes, which are considered more progressive than indirect
taxes, averaged 3.7 percent of GDP in the same period against the regional comparators’ average of
4.8 percent of GDP. On the other hand, domestic taxes on goods and services stand only at
2.4 percent of GDP as opposed to 7.2 percent of GDP for regional comparators’ average. There is an
apparent potential to raise more revenue from income tax and domestic taxes on goods and
services to support growth promoting and social expenditure. Income tax revenue could be boosted
by ensuring adequate tax collection from public enterprises and by broadening the tax base through
promoting the private sector.
27.

The authorities’ focus on pro-poor capital expenditure has resulted in improvements

in human capital and physical infrastructure. Strong investment-led economic growth has also
delivered improvements in the employment conditions in the urban areas, but youth and female
unemployment are still high and bringing them down remain a challenge. While the poor have
generally benefited from strong economic growth the benefits have not been realized by poorest to
the same extent. Thus, more focused efforts would be needed to lift up the poorest of the poor.

Box 1. Ethiopia: The Budgetary Focus on Pro-poor Spending
Despite the tight resource constraint, the government has been successfully maintaining public investment and pro-poor
spending in line with GDP (Box Figure 1). While the expenditure-to-GDP ratio has declined from the peak of 27.3 percent in
2002/03 to 16.9 percent in 2011/12 (partly reflecting an exceptionally high emergency food assistance in 2002/03), pro-poor
1

expenditure have been maintained, averaging 12.4 percent of GDP over the 10 year period. The key to achieve this outcome has
been the prioritization through the budgetary processes, and the strong pro-poor focus that has been instrumental in Ethiopia’s
progress toward the MDGs.
Within pro-poor spending, recurrent expenditure has been

expenditure. The restraining of recurrent spending has taken place

Pro-poor expenditure in the official definition consists of education, health, agriculture, natural resources (water), and roads.

Authorities’ views
28.

The authorities expect their revenue mobilization efforts through administrative

improvements to deliver substantial revenue increases (some 4 percent of GDP by 2014/15).
They concurred with staff on the desirability of increasing the share of direct taxes over the medium
term and on the need to review tax expenditures and exemptions. They indicated that all public
enterprises were subject to corporate income taxes. They also noted the difficulty of identifying the
appropriate investment-friendly exemptions and stressed that continued technical assistance from
the Fund and other development partners was necessary to support their efforts.

D. Monetary Policy
29.

The NBE seeks to control inflation through targeting base money and intervenes in

credit allocation to ensure that broad money is consistent with government’s inflation,
growth and employment objectives. Although inflation has been brought down to single digits,
the risks remain on the upside, especially considering the downward stickiness of nonfood inflation

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

and the successive reductions of reserve requirements. To the extent that directed credit allows
access to finance across selected industries and geographical areas, it could contribute to financial
inclusion. However, significant segments of the economy, especially in rural areas, remain
constrained by lack of access to credit. The conduct of monetary policy suffers from rigidity in
interest rates and inflexible instruments to achieve monetary objectives. Changes in reserve and
other requirements and foreign exchange sales are used for liquidity management and for achieving
other developmental objectives.
30.

The NBE’s monetary policy stance has contributed to the decline in inflation. Inflation

has come down to single digits with beneficial effects for the general population and especially for
the poor. Base money increased by 13 percent in 2012/13 (Table 4). In addition to the slowdown in
global food and fuel price inflation, this has been instrumental in the recent decline in inflation to
7.4 percent in June. Limited resort to NBE financing of the government and mopping of liquidity
through sales of foreign exchange also helped in this regard, although this is at the expense of
building foreign exchange reserve buffer.
31.

Monetary policy implementation and liquidity management would be greatly

enhanced by the use of indirect monetary policy instruments and allowing for price discovery.
At present, the NBE uses changes in reserve requirement and foreign exchange sales as the main
tools and has also deployed offsetting deposit requirements for liquidity management, and for
achieving other developmental objectives. While the reserve requirement ratio has been lowered
recently (March 2013) for a second time from 10 percent to 5 percent, the NBE simultaneously
sterilized the associated excess reserves through the issuance of the NBE’s certificate of deposits. To
preserve the gains on inflation monetary policy will need to remain vigilant, taking into account the
effect of changes in reserve requirement on the money multiplier and the growth of broad money.
Going forward, monetary policy implementation would need to take into account the renewed NBE
financing of the government’s budget deficit and changing money demand conditions. In the
context of relatively low levels of foreign exchange reserves, monetary operations with market
priced Treasury or NBE bills can provide the NBE with greater flexibility in liquidity management.
32.

Activating the Treasury bills market would be important for the development of the

money market. It could also improve the monetary transmission mechanism, allow for establishing
a short-term risk-free yield curve, encourage banks to more actively manage their own liquidity
positions and allocate risks. Treasury bill market remains also a precondition for establishing a
market for longer-term instruments, such as Treasury bonds. Technical assistance from the Fund
could be helpful in this regard.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

33.

Proper coordination and consistency between monetary and exchange rate policies are

critical for further financial market development and orderly conditions in the foreign
exchange market. The foreign exchange market developments in the first half of 2012/13 and the
premium in the parallel market suggest considerable scope for improving the functioning of the
NBE’s foreign exchange sale mechanism and the interbank market. Greater flexibility in exchange
rate and presence of NBE in the foreign exchange market whenever necessary can be helpful in
preventing excessive volatility and disorderly conditions in the market. Exchange rate flexibility is
also essential for the competitiveness of the traded goods sector which staff considers critical for the
realization of the authorities’ growth objectives. For NBE to effectively play its role in this regard,
staff welcomes its objective of raising its foreign exchange reserve target to US$2.5 billion
(about 1.9 months of imports) by the end of 2013/14 and further to the equivalent of 3 months of
imports over the longer term as a move in the right direction. However, staff would prefer a faster
buildup of foreign exchange reserves—which would be facilitated by an increased use of domestic
securities (rather than foreign exchange sale) for liquidity management—to 3 months of import
cover (Table 6).
Authorities’ views
34.

The authorities agreed on a restrained monetary stance to sustain single digit inflation

but were more circumspect about any policy response to international food and fuel prices
shocks. They noted that low nominal interest rates were necessary to finance public investment but
agreed on the need to have positive or near zero real interest rates. They were also open to
considering flexible pricing of securities for the conduct of monetary policy but indicated that this
would be dependent on sustaining single-digit inflation for some time. They indicated that renewed
NBE financing of the budget is consistent with the demand for base money and in the event that
money demand conditions changed, direct instruments will be used. They also stressed that foreign
exchange market pressures in the first half of 2012/13 reflected the uncertainty and a speculative
element in the wake of Prime-Minister Meles’ passing away.

E. Financial Sector Policy and Inclusion
35.

Access to finance in Ethiopia is mainly through the banking sector and to some extent

the microfinance institutions; capital markets are yet to be developed. The country’s banking
sector comprises one state-owned development bank and 18 commercial banks—including two
state-owned, with one dominant, CBE, with assets representing about 70 percent of the sector
total—as of May 2013. The remaining 17 commercial banks, mainly private, together account for the
remainder. Out of a population of nearly 90 million, only 7.1 million have deposit accounts, i.e., less

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

than 8 percent of Ethiopians have a banking account. The proportion of borrowers is even smaller (a
mere 112,793). Access to finance in rural areas is limited, with only 31 microfinance institutions
(MFIs) as of end-June 2012, providing financial services to 2.9 million clients. Fifteen insurance
companies exist with each insurance branch serving on average a population of 335,000. The
industry is not sufficiently developed to mobilize significant contractual savings.
36.

Broadening financial inclusion could have a significant payoff in terms of economic

growth. The limited reach of the financial sector constrains the opportunities for small
entrepreneurs and savings instruments for the poor, subjecting them to vulnerabilities in the event
of shocks. The structure and regulation of Ethiopia’s financial system contribute to these limitations.
The authorities’ development strategy relies heavily on directed lending to public enterprises mainly
by the CBE.
37.

Commercial banks continue to be subject to the April 2011 directive requiring them to

hold 27 percent of new loan disbursements in low-yield NBE bills. The proceeds of these bonds
are transferred to the state-owned Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) which, according to the
stated policy is supposed to on-lend them to government targeted private sector activities.
However, an analysis of DBE balance sheet reveals that more than half of the proceeds are used to
buy T-bills. This, combined with the policy of directed lending mainly to public enterprises in an
environment of negative real interest rates, results in a significant transfer of resources from
creditors (savers) to borrowers, especially the public sector.
38.

The banking sector remains highly profitable despite a slowdown in overall credit

extension to the economy. Overall credit to the nongovernment sector grew by 22 percent over
the first 10 months of the fiscal year 2012/13 compared to 50 percent over the same period last year
in the context of higher inflation. Of this, 79 percent was allocated to the public enterprises and the
rest to the private sector. The authorities indicate that the composition of very short-term fast
rolling-over borrowing of the public and private sectors was more even. Driven by aggressive
expansion of the number of branches by banks, demand deposits increased by 16 percent while
time and saving deposits increased by 22 percent over the same period. Owing to increased lending
rates and net interest margins, profitability in the banking sector remains strong with return on
assets of 3.1 percent and return on capital of 47 percent as of March 2013.
39.

The NBE directive requiring banks to hold NBE bills equivalent to 27 percent of their

lending has been distortionary and has triggered unnecessary portfolio adjustment by banks.
Since the directive initially did not discriminate short-term from long-term loans, private banks
adjusted their portfolios toward long-term loans to avoid high NBE-bills purchase due to higher

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

turnover of short-term loans. They also raised fees and commissions to make up for lower returns
on NBE bills holding. The subsequent amendment to the NBE directive also requires banks’
short-term loans to be at least 40 percent of total loans at any given time.
40.

Staff reiterated the 2012 Article IV recommendation and suggested phasing out the

27 percent NBE bills holding requirement. The directive was introduced to provide funding to
DBE for lending to priority projects. This modality is indirect and it would be better if DBE funds itself
through bond issuance, supported by appropriate credit enhancements, including attractive pricing,
as needed. In the interim, proceeds from this requirement transferred to the DBE and not yet
committed could be used to increase credit for small scale entrepreneurs to promote financial
inclusion. Purchase of T-bills by DBE from these proceeds should be substantially reduced and
limited to the DBE’s day-to-day liquidity management requirements. In addition, the recent
amendment of the NBE directive requiring banks to hold 40 percent of total loans in short-term
loans should be withdrawn.
41.

Although available financial soundness indicators (Table 8) do not point to immediate

risks, the systemic importance of the CBE and the concentration of large exposures to single entities
warrant strict supervision of compliance by the NBE. On the whole, the banking sector seems sound
with aggregate CAR at 14.6 percent and system-wide NPL ratio at 2.4 percent as of March 2013. The
NBE is strengthening its oversight of the financial sector through risk based supervision. NBE
regulations set a limit of 25 percent of capital for loans to related parties and a limit of 15 percent of
capital for a single borrower. These limits should be rigorously applied to the borrowings of public
enterprises where they currently do not apply. The DBE should also be subject to similar oversight
and supervision. Going forward, allowing greater role for private banks (including opening up to
foreign banks) could reduce the systemic importance of CBE and the associated vulnerabilities
(Table 1).
42.

Promoting financial inclusion is an essential requirement for pro-poor development.

Staff supports the efforts the authorities are already devoting in this area. Among the promising
avenues are seeking greater technology based penetration in rural areas to promote access to
financial services; allowing banks to operate microfinance institutions with funding for on-lending
purposes from international financial institutions eager to increase access in rural areas in low
income countries, thereby giving time for domestic intermediation efforts to be created; and forging
partnerships with international organizations with experience in rural and microfinance.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
43.

The authorities do not share staff concerns about the financial sector. They disagreed

with staff assessment of the impact of the 27 percent NBE bill requirement arguing that private
banks remain highly profitable. They disagreed that private banks are raising fees and commissions
to make up for lower returns on NBE bills holding. The authorities indicated that NBE was vigilant in
taking actions to mitigate any risks that would emerge. They had adopted risk-based supervision
and assigned a desk officer to each bank and were holding monthly prudential meeting with banks
as well as conducting quarterly credit and liquidity risk stress testing. In addition, implementation of
World Bank financial sector capacity building recommendations was ongoing. The authorities
acknowledged the CBE’s systemic importance and were confident in their close supervision of the
bank. They considered an assessment such as under the FSAP premature until the capacity building
exercise being undertaken was completed. While they would welcome technical assistance and
knowledge sharing partnerships with international organizations with respect to rural and
microfinance institutions, they saw risks in allowing IFIs to provide funding to MFIs.

F. External Policy
44.

External competiveness has eroded and foreign exchange reserves cushion remains

modest considering that foreign exchange sales are used to sterilize liquidity. Improved
competitiveness—as a result of exchange rate adjustments in 2009–10—had fully given way by end2011/129, with the exchange rate currently estimated to be overvalued by 10–14 percent (Annex II).
In the absence of an active Treasury bill market, foreign exchange reserves have been the primary
monetary policy tool to affect liquidity. Gross official reserves have declined since
early-2012 and are currently at about 1.8 months of imports (Table 5)—compared to the reserve
adequacy assessment, which points to the need for a much higher (6.8 months) cushion (Annex III).
Going forward the real appreciation needs to be reversed in order to reduce vulnerabilities and
restore competitiveness and foreign exchange reserves need to be replenished.
45.

The NBE is targeting annual increases of US$300 million in gross international reserves

over the medium term. This would maintain reserves at around 2 months of imports. Together with
the expected replenishment of foreign exchange reserves of commercial banks, the target implies
achieving an overall balance of payments surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2013/14. The authorities
expect to achieve this outcome through appropriate monetary and foreign exchange policies.
9

The de facto exchange rate regime is crawling peg to the U.S. dollar and the de jure regime is managed floating.
Adjustments to the peg took place in July 2009 (9.0 percent), January 2010 (4.8 percent), and September 2010
(16.7 percent).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

However, given the lack of monetary instruments for sterilization and the overvalued exchange rate,
this could be challenging.
Authorities’ views
46.

The authorities were of the view that in the context of their de jure managed float

regime, the exchange rate was allowed to adjust to maintain competitiveness but it was very
difficult to pin this down precisely and determine magnitude of the over- or under-valuation.

KEY STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR PROMOTING
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
47.

There is a pressing need for policies to translate positive growth outcomes into

stronger employment gains and further reduction in poverty and set off a dynamic, virtuous
cycle of self sustaining and broad-based growth. Thus far, the informal agricultural and trade
sectors have been the main drivers of growth. The authorities see economic diversification and
increased competitiveness as vital to creating more formal sector jobs and achieving strong inclusive
growth. Their strategy of quickly addressing major infrastructure gaps (mainly in power and
transportation) is a major step toward achieving their objectives. The GTP envisioned the structural
transformation of the country, with the public housing scheme, roads, railroads, hydro-electric
generation plants, sugar factories and other projects transforming the national labor market.
Technical and vocational training for construction workers is provided and the program Competence
of Excellence has certified more than 400,000 individuals. However, availability and high turnover of
qualified workers constitutes a major challenge for the execution of the projects included in the GTP.
Staff emphasized that achieving these objectives would require correcting structural bottlenecks,
strengthening financial intermediation, leveraging more the private sector, and reducing the costs of
doing business.
48.

Promoting financial deepening and inclusion in the country’s development model is

crucial, as borrowing by the public sector risks crowding out the private sector in a context of
limited savings. As in many developing economies, domestic savings in Ethiopia are low. Small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) have very limited access to bank credit or other financial services. Over
the first 10 months of 2012/13, 79 percent of total loans issued by the banking sector were allocated
to the big public enterprises, with only 21 percent going to the private sector. Not surprisingly, in
various business climate surveys, access to finance has been identified as one of the key obstacles to
doing business. Enhancing access to credit (especially for agriculture and SMEs) will require efforts in
many areas, including the elimination of the 27 percent NBE bill directive; training for entrepreneurs
24

in the preparation of adequate business plans; improving credit reporting systems; and
strengthening enforcement of lenders’ rights over collateral. Developing nonbank sources of
financing such as contractual savings through promoting insurance companies and pension
schemes should be considered to boost domestic savings. An assessment, such as under the FSAP,
could provide a comprehensive diagnostic of the financial sector.
49.

Promoting the private sector’s role in the country’s development model is vital. While

Ethiopia has so far pursued a state-led development strategy, it may be approaching the limits of
this strategy in engendering broad-based growth. A number of key sectors, especially
manufacturing, are lagging behind and the scope seems wide for private sector involvement, while
retaining control in some strategic sectors. In particular, opening up the telecommunication sector,
sugar industry, and transport sector to private sector (including foreign investors) could attract new
investments, improve efficiency and delivery of services, and increase public revenues.
50.

Transforming agriculture with the aim of improving its productivity is the linchpin of

the reform program. Transforming agriculture—which employs more than 50 percent of the labor
force—from a subsistence into a commercial sector with value-chain linkages to manufacturing
holds a great potential for reducing poverty. The authorities’ strategy involves better use of the land
inputs and labor with growing needs of qualified and better remunerated workers; an agricultural
credit insurance scheme; and the setting up of the Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA) to help
poor farmers improve their production technology. Staff welcomes these developments, which are
contributing to productivity improvements.
51.

Addressing the external competiveness issue is critical (Box 2). In the context of an

overvalued exchange rate (10–14 percent), deteriorating terms of trade, and limited foreign
exchange reserves, the authorities intend, going forward, to implement foreign exchange policy with
a view of containing inflationary pressures. This policy—together with measures aimed at lowering
domestic transportation costs, streamlining customs clearance procedures, putting in place needed
infrastructure, and enhanced access to credit—should over time address the competitiveness
problem. Staff’s analysis indicates that bringing more flexibility in the exchange rate to eliminate its
overvaluation would better support the country’s economic development (Annex II).

Box 2. Ethiopia: Export Competitiveness and Diversification

Strengthening export competitiveness is critical to the success of authorities’
development strategy. In 2012/13, Ethiopia’s exports of goods and services amounted to
the equivalent of some 13 percent of GDP, about the average over the past two decades.
The commodity-heavy export structure is subject to developments in international markets
and has tended to vary significantly over the years—ranging from 9 to 17 percent of
GDP—without demonstrating a clear trend.
While exchange rate flexibility is critical, addressing structural factors are also
important for improving productivity and performance of export industries. The cost
of transporting goods to markets is high, but improved transportation links are expected
to significantly lower these costs. Several major road projects are under way along with a
railroad from Addis Ababa and Djibouti. Together with streamlined customs clearance and
other government procedures, the authorities aim at increasing gradually farm-gate prices
relative to export prices (farm-gate prices currently constitute only 60 percent of export
prices), thereby improving the incentives for exports.
Ongoing and planned non-government investments—including in cold storage
facilities and increased airline capacity—augur well for export diversification. The

commence in 2014/15 and once
the Renaissance Dam has been completed, electricity export is expected to increase
further.
Labor-intensive manufacturing hold considerable potential for further export
diversification. FDI into leather manufacturing and textile production indicate areas where
Ethiopia seems to have a comparative advantage. Public sector investments in electricity
and transport infrastructure would provide the necessary support for a scaling up of
additional FDI into these and other manufacturing sectors. Their success will also depend
on a competitive exchange rate.

Reforming the current tax structure with its heavy reliance on indirect taxes with the

aim of making it more equitable will further support inclusion. Staff and authorities concurred
that further technical assistances from the Fund’s Fiscal Department will be helpful in this regard.

OTHER ISSUES
53.

Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance, albeit with notable

shortcomings and delays. Although GDP statistics in Ethiopia are subject to significant weaknesses,
the national accounts compilation methodology improved considerably in 2011/12 and the
authorities are continuing efforts to further strengthen their statistics. Staff has stressed the need to
further improve national accounts data and offered technical assistance. Substantial information
gaps on the health of the financial sector remain as the mission did not have access to detailed
banks’ balance sheet data in order to undertake a banking sector diagnostic. In addition, fiscal and
BOP statistics require improvements. For example, comprehensive public sector data, including on
public enterprises, are still lacking and would be desirable for a proper assessment of public sector
finances.
54.

Ethiopia has yet to move to Article VIII status and maintains several exchange

restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions that are not
consistent with Article VIII.10 A unification of the official and parallel exchange markets would free
up significant efficiency gains. Staff enquired about the terms of the 2006 China EXIM Bank
Framework agreement with Ethiopia. The authorities indicated that the agreement is consistent with
Ethiopia’s commitments under the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
55.

WTO accession negotiations are ongoing. Since the submission of the Memorandum of

Foreign Trade Regime in 2006, four rounds of Working Party meetings have taken place. The
authorities intended to join the WTO within the current development plan period, i.e., before
end-2014/15, but this timetable may be stretched. Outstanding issues relate to domestic market
access, including non-financial and financial services, state trading regime, and customs valuation
practices.
56.

Ethiopia’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)

regime is not in conformance with international standards. In consequence, Ethiopia continues
to be listed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as among the jurisdictions with strategic
10

See Informational Annex.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing them. The authorities
explained the delay in addressing the FATF requirements by their interest in also ensuring
compliance of their legal framework with the new FATF standard. In order to avoid further scrutiny
by the FATF and possible counter-measures, Ethiopia should continue to work on addressing the
long standing strategic deficiencies highlighted by the FATF, particularly in the areas of terrorist
asset freezing and sanctions. In the meantime progress is being made in part owing to training
provided by bilateral donors. Further technical assistance has been requested from the World Bank.

STAFF APPRAISAL
57.

Ethiopia’s public sector led developmental strategy has delivered robust growth and

rising standards of living. Staff commends the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management and the realization of robust growth and impressive progress in poverty reduction.
Restrained fiscal and monetary policies have been instrumental in reducing inflation to single digits.
58.

A restrained overall fiscal stance is essential for macroeconomic stability and

sustaining growth. While the budgetary stance at the general government level has been
restrained, staff urges the authorities to carefully monitor the operations of the overall public sector
(including public enterprises) to properly calibrate the fiscal stance. Concentrating data collection on
federal and regional governments, as currently is the case, provides only a partial view and fiscal
policy would benefit from a more complete picture, including public enterprises, of the overall fiscal
stance.
59.

Staff applauds the authorities for their achievements and urges them to continue and

strengthen the policies for inclusive growth. The poverty reduction strategies have achieved
important results and the government’s focus on pro-poor expenditure has been paying off in terms
of improved social indicators. The authorities should continue the momentum of revenue
administration reforms and staff welcomes the ongoing reforms in public financial management to
achieve the GTP fiscal objectives. Introducing measures to mobilize more revenue from income taxes
and domestic taxes on goods and services equitably should be considered. Authorities should also
consider adopting the FAD TA recommendations on rationalizing tax incentives and tax
expenditures. Staff advises the authorities to strengthen the policies for inclusive growth, especially
by making the tax system more progressive and maintaining and possibly expanding pro-poor
spending as more revenues are mobilized.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

60.

Preserving these gains and mitigating vulnerabilities and risks in order to achieve the

objectives embodied in the GTP would require continued cautious policy stance as well as
private sector involvement. Ethiopia’s public sector led developmental strategy is now at crossroads. There is a need to carefully consider the balance between the public and private sectors in
the economy. In light of the large financing need in the GTP, staff urges the authorities to reduce
and streamline the role of public enterprises in the economy. Development of a strong and vibrant
private sector is essential to sustain growth and attain middle income status. This would mean
fostering competition in areas where public enterprises enjoy monopolies, gradually withdrawing
from areas where they displace and crowd-out the private sector, and fully corporatizing and
orienting outward through foreign partnerships those that remain. In particular, foreign direct
investment should also be encouraged for example in trade logistics and communications sectors.
61.

The transformational power of the private sector could be further harnessed to

generate employment and sustain development. Opportunities for the private sector are an
important dimension of inclusion. With its strong investment and trade capabilities, the sector could
be a strong engine for creating employment opportunities for the youth. The authorities should thus
strengthen competitiveness by improving the business climate and enhancing public private
dialogue to better understand the needs of the private sector and create a supportive policy
environment. They should also work with the World Bank—in particular its private sector arm, the
International Finance Corporation—to incubate entrepreneurship for SMEs, youth, and women. They
should increase vocational schools to address skills mismatch and support job creation for youth.
62.

NBE needs to continue its focus on keeping inflation in single digits, as the risks are on

the upside considering the still high nonfood inflation and potential of shocks to food prices.
Staff suggests a cautious stance of monetary policy that keeps base money growth consistent with
preserving the gains on inflation and achieving robust economic growth. Monetary policy will need
to remain vigilant to increasing resource pressures and changes in broad monetary conditions
taking into account the aggressive deposit mobilization by banks. It would also need to be
supported by proper pacing of public enterprises’ investment and a reconsideration of the renewed
NBE financing of the government budget deficit.
63.

Staff urges the authorities to improve the efficiency and flexibility of NBE instruments,

including through flexibility of nominal interest rates and development of market-based
liquidity management. Avoiding the use of reserve requirements as the main monetary policy
instrument and focus on developing indirect instruments to achieve the monetary targets should be
considered. Flexibility would be needed to make T-bills an effective instrument for liquidity
management. Staff underscores that, with inflation in the single digit, the timing is right for bringing
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

flexibility in interest rates to increase domestic saving and to support inclusive growth. Raising
interest rates should encourage saving which is important for scaling up investment, which in turn is
vital for sustaining growth and broader inclusion.11
64.

More broadly, introducing policy measures to support higher domestic savings should

be explored. Consideration could be given to developing nonbank sources of financing such as
contractual savings—e.g., (i) providing incentives for the emergence of more insurance companies;
and (ii) strengthening pension schemes and other long-term savings instruments. Introducing
mobile banking to increase access to finance is also vital to support inclusive growth.
65.

Phasing out the forced 27 percent holding of NBE bills by commercial banks would

help promote financial deepening and facilitate the GTP financing. The impact of this policy
measure has been to crowd out private sector credit even if commercial banks are currently enjoying
high profitability from higher non-interest income and interest rate spreads which is further
squeezing out the private sector. Its phasing out would help realize the objectives of GTP in a much
more sustainable manner. In the interim, at a minimum, the proceeds from this requirement that are
transferred to the DBE should be used to increase credit for small scale entrepreneurs to promote
financial inclusion. Purchase of T-bills by DBE from these proceeds should be discontinued.
66.

Strengthening capacity at the NBE for supervision and formulation of financial policies

to promote inclusion for all segments of the economy is crucial. This also encompasses banking
supervision capacity to enable regular inspection of all banks and improve the quality of the analysis
of banks’ soundness.
67.

Staff supports the authorities’ objective of building foreign exchange reserves, while

encouraging them to bring some flexibility in the exchange rate. Accumulation of foreign
reserves initially to at least three months of imports would be desirable. Allowing more
market-based movement of exchange rate with a view toward enhancing competitiveness and
eliminating the spread between the parallel and official foreign exchange markets would be helpful.
Using foreign reserves to manage liquidity in the context of a rigid (and overvalued) exchange rate
risks external stability. In addition, better coordination of monetary and exchange rate policies with a
view toward strengthening external competiveness on a lasting basis would be welfare improving.

11

According to the Commission on Growth and Development (2008), for growth to be inclusive it is critical that it is
sustainable (see also the October 2011 Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa).

Staff underscores the need for continued improvements in data quality. There are

significant financial sector data gaps and fiscal and BOP statistics require improvements.
Comprehensive public sector data, including on public enterprises, data would be desirable for a
proper assessment of public sector finances.
69.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held on the

12-month consultation cycle. This is in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles,
Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010).

Annex I. National Accounts Statistics Issues
1.
Ethiopia’s official national account statistics suffer from significant weaknesses. An
IMF Statistics Department (STA) mission in March 2010 identified major compilation and
estimation deficiencies and suggested corrective actions. The authorities developed a national
accounts improvement and capacity building action plan which they have been implementing.
2.
During the 2012 Article IV consultation, it was agreed that completion of a new
benchmark GDP for 2010/11 and implementation of the improved methodologies being
supported by East AFRITAC (AFE) would help improve official statistics. Since then, with the
help of AFE, the authorities have made methodological improvements and published the 2011/12
national accounts based on the new benchmark which show a real GDP growth rate of 8½ percent,
significantly lower than in recent years, reflecting in part lower growth in agricultural output.
3.
The authorities need to continue to improve national account statistics and related
capacity. In consultation with STA, the mission decided to use the official historical figures with a
notation regarding data weaknesses and possible overestimation of GDP growth rates. This
approach is consistent with the general practice of reporting official historical data in other countries
with national account data deficiencies. Staff will continue to have its own projections, but at the
end of the fiscal year will adopt official statistics based on the national accounts outturns with the
appropriate caveat. Authorities expressed their disagreement about putting a caveat on their
statistics. Staff stressed the need to continue to improve national accounts data and the readiness of
the Fund to offer further technical assistance.

Annex II. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
The assessment of the exchange rate in Ethiopia for the fiscal year 2012/13, based on
the IMF’s CGER methodology, suggested an overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate
in the range of 10 to 14 percent, depending on the method applied. The estimated
misalignment has slightly narrowed since the 2012 Article IV consultation. The standard CGER
methods are (i) the macroeconomic balance approach, (ii) the equilibrium REER approach, and
(iii) the external sustainability approach.
2.
The macroeconomic balance approach indicates an overvaluation of 10 percent,
because a REER depreciation of that proportion would align the current account with its
equilibrium level. The current account is expected to sustain a large but reducing deficit in the
medium term. With an estimated current account deficit of 6.4 percent of GDP in 2012/13, the
deficit is expected to shrink to 5.2 percent of GDP in the next five years. The norm current account
balance is also negative (4.5 percent), supported in part by the large inflow of remittances and
international development aid that is expected to continue in the medium term. Large level of
imports is forecasted in the medium term, mostly on petroleum products and heavy construction
equipment. A 10 percent depreciation of the REER is necessary to close the current account gap.
3.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach shows an overvaluation of about
10 percent from the equilibrium REER derived from the medium-term macroeconomic
fundamentals. This result is predicated on highly volatile terms of trade, a stable level of
remittances, and government expenditure partially financed by large external transfers.
4.
The external sustainability approach suggests an overvaluation of the REER of about
14 percent. This approach calculates the current account balance that stabilizes the net foreign
asset (NFA) position at a sustainable level. Nominal GDP growth is estimated at 14.9 percent, and
the underling current account deficit of 5.8 would result in a long-run NFA position of -41.6 percent
of GDP. To sustain the NFA position at -24 percent (average of last five years), the current account
deficit should be 3.1 percent of GDP, implying a depreciation of 13 percent in the REER.

Annex III. Reserve Adequacy Assessment
1.
Ethiopia is a low-income country with an agricultural commodity export oriented
sector and a high dependency on imported fuel and capital goods. The economy is exposed to
potential terms-of-trade shocks and has a limited capacity to absorb them, given chronically low
reserve coverage.
2.
In addition, Ethiopia receives a large volume of private transfers from Ethiopians
leaving abroad. These remittances averaged about US$3 billion in the last three years, an amount
close to the value of total exports during the same period. The large trade deficit is also partially
offset with important official transfers that reached US$1.7 billion in 2011/12.
3.
From September 2011 to May 2012, international reserves contracted by more than
US$1.5 billion as the government sold reserves in an attempt to control domestic liquidity.
Since then, reserves appear to be growing again.
4.
The reserve coverage has remained low in months of imports. By June 2013 reserves
could sustain only about two months of prospective imports. Given the relatively high level of
imports expected in the coming years, further accumulation of reserves is needed to improve the
coverage and have some buffer to respond to possible deterioration of the terms of trade.
5.
Reserves have stabilized in percent of broad money just above the 20 percent
threshold. Although there are no large capital flows in Ethiopia, low reserves in the context of a
pegged exchange rate could add to the evidence of an inadequate reserves level.
6.
Reserve adequacy assessment based on Dabla-Norris and others (2011)1 shows that for
a country with a fixed exchange rate regime and assuming the cost of holding foreign
reserves is set at 5 percent (mid-point in the range of the marginal product of capital in lowincome countries), the optimal reserve coverage would be the equivalent of 6.8 months of
imports. The model evaluates various shocks in external demand, terms of trade, FDI, and aid flows
for different cost levels of holding reserves. Remittances are not explicitly included in the calculation
of the cost-benefit analysis, but a large and sustained inflow of foreign resources to Ethiopian
households could imply lower reserve coverage for a given cost of holding those reserves.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS
Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Elliott Harris (IMF) and
Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association

Based on the Low-Income Country debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) framework, the
updated DSA found that Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress remains low. The public
DSA suggests Ethiopia’s overall public sector debt dynamics are sustainable under the
baseline scenario but vulnerable under several alternative scenarios. Public sector debt
ratios are projected to decline in the medium and long term, starting from a relatively low
level in 2013. An alternative scenario with a government primary deficit fixed at the 2012
level would have a detrimental impact on debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios,
suggesting that the government must develop a strategy to contain the primary deficit as
it’s already assumed in the baseline. Maintaining the growth of exports through
diversification of the export sector, developing a medium-term debt strategy for the public
sector, and limiting non-concessional borrowing remain crucial to maintaining a low risk
of external debt distress.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND AND KEY FINDINGS
1.
The last Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), prepared in August 2012, concluded that
Ethiopia was at a low risk of external debt distress. Ethiopia reached the completion point under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 2004 and benefited from debt relief under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 20061. In 2011/122, public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt declined to 18.4 percent of GDP, more than 5 percentage points relative to the previous
year.3 High GDP growth and negative domestic real interest rates on public debt contributed to the decline.
2.
The previous DSA findings were robust to the inclusion of remittances and higher nonconcessional loans as part of the assessment. Last year’s external DSA did not result in any breach of
indicative thresholds with or without remittances and debt-to-exports ratios were about 20 percentage
points better in the baseline with those private transfers. The assessment was made not taking into account
remittances as recommended in the LIC DSA framework, with strong evidence of low external debt distress
risks. An alternative scenario stretching the non-concessional borrowing capacity up to US$1 billion a year
confirmed the capacity of the country to absorb those resources with no harm to the external DSA.
3.
Ethiopia remains at low risk of external debt distress in 2013. The present value (PV) of PPG
external debt is expected to increase slightly from 13.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 14.4 percent of GDP
in 2012/13. The ratio of PV of PPG external debt to exports would go from 94.3 percent to 110.6 percent in
the same period, as a result of the rapid buildup of external debt and low exports growth. The inclusion of
workers’ remittances significantly lowers the baseline average of the debt-to-exports ratios in the
projection period (2012/13–2032/33) by 16 percentage points.4 There is no breach of any indicative
threshold in either case, excluding or including workers’ remittances.
4.
The current DSA assumes a decline in the share of concessional loans, particularly from
International Development Association (IDA), and higher nonconcessional external loan

1

While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement with
bilateral official creditors from Bulgaria, Libya, and FR Yugoslavia and commercial creditors from Italy, former
Czechoslovakia, and FR Yugoslavia whose outstanding loans (US$378.8 million) accounted for 7.0 percent of the debt
stock in 2009/10. HIPC terms are assumed for these loans. Negotiations with Russia on outstanding loans
(US$161.6 million) are at an advanced stage, and debt service on these loans is excluded from this DSA.
2

The Ethiopian fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

3

PPG debt includes not only federal and regional governments’ debt, but also encompasses all major state-owned
enterprises, except Ethiopian Airlines (EAL). EAL debt is excluded from PPG debt, because, although owned by the
government, it is run on commercial terms. EAL enjoys managerial independence, borrows without any government
guarantees, publishes annual audited reports and has a sizeable profit margin.
4

Based on the 2012 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score, Ethiopia is classified as a medium
performer. The thresholds for the debt burden for medium performers are 150, 40, and 250 for the PV of debt to
exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively; debt service thresholds are 20 and 30 percent of exports and revenue,
respectively. In the scenarios that include workers’ remittances, the corresponding threshold for PV of debt to exports
and remittances is 120 percent (compared to 135 in the 2011 DSA) and is 16 percent for debt service to exports and
remittances; the PV of debt to GDP and remittances is 36 percent.

disbursements between 2013/14 and 2019/20. An increase in projected commercial loan disbursements
to finance large acquisitions of capital goods by state-owned enterprises is the largest contributor to the
buildup of new debt in the medium term. New commercial loans will contribute to subsequent increases in
the various debt ratios and a decline in the grant element on new borrowing throughout the projection
periods. This DSA assumes disbursements just below US$1 billion in nonconcessional loans a year in the
next four years, with Ethiotel (the telecommunications company) taking US$1 billion over four years. The
DSA assumes that nonconcessional loan disbursements will remain at around US$730 million on average
over the projection period (2018−33). Over the time horizon of the DSA, 53 percent of new external loans
are assumed to be concessional on average. Average maturity on all new external loans is assumed to be
26 years while new non-concessional loans are assumed to carry a maturity of 11−12 years. Average
interest rates on new external loans are assumed at 2.3 percent over the horizon, and interest rates on new
non-concessional loans are assumed to be in the 2−4 percent range.

In April 2013, IDA authorized a US$1 billion ceiling for Ethiopia for FY13 and, in principle, a
similar ceiling for FY14 and FY15. This implies that Ethiopia can borrow up to US$1 billion per year from
other creditors on non-concessional or commercial terms as long as these loans finance projects that are
growth enhancing. According to the IDA Non-concessional Borrowing Policy, a loan counts at the point of
signing the loan contract (regardless of the disbursement profile). The decision was informed by the 2012
DSA analysis, which demonstrates that such a ceiling is consistent with the maintenance of low risk of
external debt distress. The 2013 DSA is consistent with the new ceiling.5
6.
Some of the large public investment projects by state-owned enterprises could pose risks to
Ethiopia’s public debt sustainability. The state-owned power company, the Ethiopia Electricity Power
Company, is undertaking several large investment projects. Most rely on external assistance and loans
(including both concessional and nonconcessional) while the Renaissance Dam project, estimated by the
authorities to cost 10 percent of 2012/13 GDP, is intended to be financed entirely domestically. The
Ethiopian Railway Corporation recently signed contracts with Chinese and Turkish companies for projects
whose total size is more than US$3 billion, or 6 percent of 2012/13 GDP. The telecommunications company
signed two agreements with Chinese providers for a total of US$1 billion in equipment. It would be
prudent for the authorities to formulate a medium-term debt management strategy and to start
monitoring the overall debt (including external and domestic) of the consolidated public sector.
7.
Authorities requested the exclusion of the commercial external loans in the telecom sector
from the DSA. Ethiopian authorities agreed with the findings of the updated DSA, but requested the
exclusion of the two specific loans that Ethiotel has signed with Chinese equipment suppliers for a total of
US$1 billion. The conditions of those loans are nonconcessional and the authorities explained that there is
no government guarantee. The equipment has not been delivered and the process could take several
years. Staff proposed to split the disbursements in the next four years to reflect the multiyear nature of the
agreement and the time needed to properly commission the equipment. Authorities agreed on the
proposed treatment and the inclusion of the loans under those conditions.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
8.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook underlines an upward revision on output
growth and slightly lower inflation compared to the assumptions of the 2012 DSA (Box 1). Real GDP
growth is forecasted at 7 percent in 2012/13 and 7.5 percent in the following two years, reflecting strong
economic activity mainly led by public infrastructure investment. The projected long-run GDP growth rate
is maintained at 6.5 percent.
9.
Export growth is projected to continue but at a slower pace than in the previous DSA, partly
reflecting developments in commodity prices. In the medium- to long-run, export growth would be
supported by diversification of the export sector as emerging export industries expand, funded by greater
inflows of foreign direct investment, and domestic investments to boost service exports including
5

Some simulations implying slightly higher external non-concessional borrowing (above the US$1 billion limit)
produce debt trajectories that would lead to a downgrade in Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress.

electricity. Overall, exports of goods and services are projected to grow at 11.2 percent each year from
2013/14 to 2017/18 or 1.2 percentage points below the rate assumed in the 2012 DSA.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
10.
Under the baseline scenario (not including remittances), the PPG external debt indicators
will rise in the next several years, but will remain well under the relevant indicative thresholds
(Figure 1). The PV of PPG external debt in percent of GDP would slightly increased in 2012/13 to
14.4 percent and is projected to reach 19 percent by 2017/18, reflecting the assumed steady increase in
new loan disbursements, and subsequently decline to about 10 percent in the long run. The PV of debt in
percent of exports reached 110.6 percent in 2012/13; and despite continued strength in exports, it is
projected to continue increasing, peaking at 124 percent in 2015/16. The debt service-to-exports ratio also
remains well below the relevant threshold although it keeps rising to a peak of 12.5 percent in 2019/20,
reflecting servicing of non-concessional loans by public enterprises.
Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Based on a domestic financing which is less compared to full financing of the Growth and Transformation Plan
(GTP), real GDP growth is projected at 7 percent in 2012/13, 7.5 percent in the following two years, and to slightly
tamp down to 7 percent until 2017/18 and 6.5 percent during rest of the projection period.1 This assessment
contrasts with the government’s growth ambitions in the GTP and reflects the still difficult business environment,
given the limited space for private sector growth on account of crowding out by public sector borrowing. Inflation
is projected to reach 7.4 percent by the end of 2012/13 and to stay at 8 percent in the long run. The primary
balance of the public sector is projected to record a large deficit (averaging 5.7 percent of GDP in 2013−18)
initially reflecting investment by public enterprises, and it is expected to remain about 4.2 percent in the long run.
The external current account deficit (before official transfers) is expected to improve slightly to 9.3 percent in
2013/14 after reaching 9.5 percent in 2012/13 and gradually to reduce to about 7 percent in the long-run.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow by 15 percent in 2013/14, after an increase of 3.3 percent in
2012/13, and with an average growth of about 9.4 percent in the long run. A decline in commodity prices,
especially in gold and coffee, largely offset gains in export volumes. Investments in targeted sectors that receive
government support are expected to contribute to export growth, with export volume growth projected about
15.4 percent for 2013/14 and about the same growth rate in the next four years to just below 8 percent over the
remaining DSA horizon. Imports of goods and services are projected to increase slightly above GDP as demand for
imported capital goods is expected to grow fast during the GTP implementation. In the long run, imports are
expected to grow in line with domestic output.
Workers’ remittances have played a key role in supporting the balance of payments and in 2013/14 are expected
to remain at 7 percent of GDP. High growth, economic stability and the return of growth in developed countries is
expected to maintain remittances at around 5.7 percent of GDP in the long run.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected at 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013/14 and will increase gradually to a long
run yearly average of 4.5 on account of policies to promote greater private investment to sustain high growth.
1

Domestic financing and prospective external inflows amount roughly to two third of full financing of the GTP.

11.
Under the historical scenario, the debt stock indicators would be lower than under the
baseline scenario. The scenario reflects significantly higher nominal GDP and export growth (than in the
baseline) which works to drive the debt ratios down. It also reflects larger net debt creating flows (than in
the baseline) which work to drive up the debt ratios. The dynamic path under the historical scenario is
determined by these two offsetting forces.
12.
Without remittances, the terms-of-trade shock is the most extreme potential risk for the
sustainability of the external debt. Even under the possibility of a large deterioration in the terms-oftrade, no indicators would breach the indicative thresholds during the period covered by the DSA. The PV
of PPG external debt to exports approached the threshold without reaching the 150 mark during 2017/18
through 2020/21, declining to less than 100 by 2032/33.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
13.
Under the baseline scenario and similar to the findings in the 2012 DSA, the total public
sector debt-to-GDP ratio would rise sharply in the near term. This reflects large domestic borrowing
and continued accumulation of external PPG debt by public enterprises to implement infrastructure
investment projects contemplated in the GTP. It is expected that after an initial period of high spending,
total public sector expenditure would revert to a lower level in the long run.
14.
Debt stock related indicators grow steadily and peak in 2020/21 and debt service related
indicators peak one year earlier. All debt indicators decline gradually from the peak in the baseline
scenario; this result depends on continuation of robust GDP growth, moderate public sector primary
deficits, and most crucially the authorities’ policy of keeping domestic interest rates low. Interest rates are
assumed to remain in negative territory in real terms with inflation expected to stay at 8 percent in the long
run.
15.
Public sector debt would grow in the long-run as a result of a permanent negative shock on
GDP growth, but debt service-to-revenue could absorb this shock (Figure 2). The scenario with
unchanged primary balance from 2012/13 shows particularly sharp deterioration because of the unusually
large primary deficit in that particular year, reflecting investment activities by public enterprises. The other
two alternative scenarios (real GDP growth and primary balance at the historic average; permanently lower
GDP growth) show trajectories with no important changes in the debt ratios during the DSA horizon.
16.
The baseline scenario understates the public debt burden for the economy because it
reflects actual costs of borrowing by the public sectors, which are significantly lower than inflation.
Although inflation is projected to remain at a single-digit level, given the current policy of financing public
investment at low costs, interest rates on public enterprise domestic borrowing would not be fully adjusted
to a positive level in real terms. Ethiopia’s relatively benign public sector debt outlook hinges strongly on
the continuation of this current policy. If the actual cost of borrowing were to rise above inflation, the debt
indicators would worsen or fiscal adjustment could be required to maintain fiscal sustainability.

17.
This analysis which maintains a low risk of debt distress assumes disbursements of external
borrowing significantly lower than required for the GTP. The ongoing large public investment projects
rely heavily on domestic financing and would lead to a large accumulation of public debt. Absent an
appropriate pacing of the public investment projects in the GTP, the domestic financial sector could be
squeezed. Monitoring the operations of the consolidated public sector including contingent liabilities
arising from financial transactions among public entities is crucial.

CONCLUSION
18.
The level of Ethiopia’s external and public debt distress remains at a low risk rating. The
external debt ratios have risen rapidly in recent years, and this trend is projected to continue in the
medium-term. The results suggest the importance for Ethiopia of monitoring debt closely and remaining
vigilant regarding new debt accumulation, particularly with commercial loans. The financing plan
underlying the GTP needs to take into account these results. Vulnerabilities identified in various sensitivity
analyses are relevant for considering policies that would help maintain the low risk rating of external debt
distress. Particular emphasis must be made on adequate concessionality of new external loans.
19.
Domestic borrowing by the public sector continues to increase. The overall debt (including
external and domestic) of the consolidated public sector must be monitored carefully. Adjustments to
policies to ensure price stability, a competitive exchange rate, and greater private sector involvement in
investment and trading activities would go a long way in enhancing Ethiopia’s debt sustainability.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate, g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equal to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguard Assessment
An update safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was completed in
December 2009 in connection with Ethiopia’s ESF-RAC approved on January 23, 2009. The
assessment found that, since the previous assessment in 2001, the NBE has implemented some
improvements to the safeguards framework but that several initiatives were a work-in-progress and
substantial gaps remained. Financial transparency has improved through the publication of
independently audited financial statements, and internal audit capacity has been strengthened. In
response to the assessment’s recommendations, action has been taken to commence Audit
Committee (AC) oversight, and introduce controls and independent reviews over program data

reporting to the Fund. The authorities are also in the process of addressing remaining safeguards
issues relating to enhancing AC oversight of the external audit mechanism, further strengthening of
reserve management capacity, and introducing bank-wide risk management practices. Going
forward, the NBE Law will need to be strengthened with regard to independence of the central bank
and the potential scope for unlimited financing of the government.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The authorities describe
their exchange rate regime as a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.
The pace of the depreciation, however, has been stable. The NBE supplies foreign exchange to the
market based on plans established at the beginning of each fiscal year that takes into account
estimates of likely supply and demand. The transaction-weighted average interbank market
exchange rate on July 31, 2013, was Br 18.90 = US$1.
Ethiopia currently maintains four restrictions on the payments and transfers for current international
transactions, which relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of dividend and
other investment income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and supplies and
foreign partner credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks; and (iv) the
requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to obtain import permits. These restrictions
are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain
unapproved.
The staff is continuing to assess whether a general finance and economic cooperation agreement
signed between the government of Ethiopia and China in 2006 gives rise to exchange restrictions
under Article VIII.

Article IV Consultation
Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article
IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010). The last consultation was concluded
on September, 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, albeit with
some shortcomings. Despite recent progress, there are some shortcomings in financial, real, fiscal,
and balance of payments statistics.
National Accounts: Shortcomings in the source data and compilation practices affect the
accuracy and reliability of the statistics. The GDP estimates are heavily dependent on benchmark
data that may not reflect current economic activity. Further, the techniques used to compile the
estimates for construction, distribution, and some other services activities do not conform to
international best practice. While some progress has been made in compiling estimates of GDP
by final expenditure, there remain substantial shortcomings, particularly in the estimation of
private consumption and fixed capital formation. The statistical discrepancies between the
estimates by expenditure categories and output remain large.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements, general government fiscal
statistics continue to be affected by shortcomings. Timely data on the consolidated operations of
local governments is unavailable. Significant discrepancies between data on the domestic
financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts continue to complicate assessment of
fiscal developments.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are broadly adequate for analytical purposes, although
there is a need for the NBE to resume data submissions based on the SRF and IMD framework.
For policy purposes, however, ensuring data collection and reporting in a timely manner
continues to be critical.
Financial statistics: The staff does not have access to sufficient data to assess the soundness of
the banking sector.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data require improvements in coverage, valuation,
timing, and classification of current account transactions. Financial and capital account
transactions are also incompletely covered and data on FDI could to be better reconciled with
alternative sources. Improvements in balance of payments compilation could most appropriately
be pursued in the context of adopting the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual.

II.

Data Standards and Quality

Ethiopia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata were
partially updated in early 2008. Ethiopia participates in the GDDS project for capacity building in
statistics in Anglophone Africa (2006–09) including socio-demographic, macro-economic and
financial statistics. No Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes has been completed.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
On September 18, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.1
Recent macroeconomic developments are encouraging, with a significant deceleration in
inflation and continued robust economic growth. Despite significant decline in coffee prices
and supply bottlenecks, growth remains robust, supported by better agriculture output and
construction and other services activities. Inflation declined from the peak of 40 percent in
July 2011 to around 7 percent in June 2013. This has significantly eased the extent to which
real interest rates were negative. Pressures resulting in foreign exchange shortages in the
wake of the passing away of Prime Minister Meles have eased.
Fiscal policy at the general government level remains prudent, with cautious execution of the
government budget. Overall revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall from 14 percent in
2011/12 to 13.2 percent in 2012/13. Reflecting the strong pro-poor focus, the ratio of
poverty-reducing expenditure to GDP is being maintained and non-priority expenditure will
likely be compressed in 2012/13. The government budget deficit, including grants, is
estimated to be 2.8 percent of GDP.
Overall fiscal stance for the consolidated public sector (including public enterprises) is likely
considerably more expansionary. While appropriately consolidated data on the overall public
sector finances are not available, external financing of public enterprises in 2012/13 and the
monetary survey suggest that overall public sector (including public enterprises) borrowing
exceeded 9 percent of GDP in 2012/13.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Although the monetary stance remains generally tight to keep inflation in single digits, recent
developments point to some relaxation. Base money contracted by 4 percent in 2011/12, but
by end-May 2013 expanded by 18 percent at an annual rate. The authorities adjusted slightly
the base money target for the year to 13 percent from 12.2 percent. Achieving the 13 percent
target implies a very tight monetary policy for the remainder of the fiscal year. The reserve
requirement ratio has been further lowered recently (March 2013) from 10 percent to
5 percent, following an earlier (January 2012) lowering by 5 percentage points, and the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) sterilized the resulting liquidity injection through the sale
of certificate deposits. Broad money growth remains on the high side and was 28 percent in
2012/13.
The external current account deficit widened slightly to US$3 billion in 2012/13 from
US$2.8 billion in 2011/12, reflecting a weaker trade balance, although it improved as a ratio
of GDP from 6.6 percent to 6.4 percent. Export performance suffered from a decline in prices
and weak external demand conditions, growing only 3.2 percent (in nominal terms), while
continued infrastructure and industrial investment and higher fuel importation contributed to
an increase in imports by 6.3 percent. Transfers brought in a net inflow of around
US$5 billion due to a surge in net private transfers that more than offset a decline in official
transfers. Increased loan disbursements to the central government and public enterprises
yielded a capital account surplus of US$3.4 billion. The NBE’s gross international reserves
declined slightly to US$2.2 billion (1.8 months of imports) at the end of 2012/13 from
US$2.3 billion (1.9 months of imports) at the end of 2011/12.
Foreign exchange supply came under pressure in the first half of 2012/13. The passing of
Prime Minister Meles created uncertainty and excess demand in the foreign exchange market
which was also reflected in a widening of the premium in the parallel market. Since its
previous peak in October 2008, the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) reached the
highest level in November 2012, although this has started to turn around with the recent
decline in inflation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia’s strong growth performance and impressive progress in decreasing poverty and
inequality under the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). Prudent macroeconomic
management has ensured a significant deceleration in inflation. Going forward, Directors
agreed that the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia’s public-sector-led strategy needs to
be recalibrated, with greater participation by the private sector to sustain robust and inclusive
growth and mitigate vulnerabilities. They emphasized the importance of policies to maintain
fiscal sustainability, preserve low inflation, rebuild external buffers, and improve financial
intermediation and the business environment.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent budgetary stance, but underscored the need to
gain a fuller picture of public enterprises’ finances and to pace public investments
appropriately. Sustaining pro-poor expenditures will require increased domestic revenue, and
Directors therefore encouraged the authorities to continue the momentum of revenue
administration and tax policy reforms. Further public financial management reforms as well
as a medium-term debt management strategy would also help maintain fiscal sustainability
and achieve the fiscal objectives under the GTP.
Directors agreed that a continued cautious monetary stance is warranted to preserve low
inflation. They underscored the importance of improving the efficiency and flexibility of
monetary policy instruments, including through greater flexibility of nominal interest rates
and the development of market-based liquidity management. Directors called for better
coordination between exchange rate and monetary policies and for greater exchange rate
flexibility to help reconstitute foreign exchange reserves, strengthen competitiveness, and
eliminate the spread between the parallel and official rates.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains well-capitalized and profitable. They stressed
the need to carefully monitor concentration of large exposures to single entities, and for
strengthened capacity to ensure effective financial sector supervision and regulation.
Directors encouraged policies to improve the private sector’s access to finance and promote
financial inclusion. In particular, phasing out the directive requiring commercial banks to
hold low-yield central bank bills would facilitate financial deepening. They also encouraged
the authorities to address the remaining deficiencies in the Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime.
Directors underscored the transformational power of the private sector, which can be further
harnessed to generate employment and sustain development. Accordingly, they advised the
authorities to enhance competitiveness and attract Foreign Direct Investment by improving
the business climate and fostering competition.
Directors acknowledged recent improvements in GDP statistics. They encouraged the
authorities to make further efforts to improve data quality, particularly financial sector, fiscal
and balance-of-payments statistics, with support from the International Monetary Fund
technical assistance.

STATEMENT BY MR. SAHO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
SEPTEMBER 18, 2013
The Ethiopian economy has performed remarkably well in the past decade. GDP growth has
averaged over 11 percent, resulting in a significant drop in poverty. The realization of the
macroeconomic objectives of the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) is anchored under
three pillars: inclusive growth; public investment and structural transformation; prudent fiscal
and monetary management. Overall, the income gap has narrowed significantly, economic
wellbeing has risen substantially and the Gini index now stands at 33.6.
My Ethiopian authorities appreciate the discussions they had with International Monetary
Fund (IMF) staff during the 2013 Article IV consultation. They value the exchange of views
on key policy issues aimed at supporting the continued implementation of the GTP, while
addressing any potential risks and challenges. My authorities remain confident that by
persevering with the current macroeconomic framework, they stand a good chance of
mitigating risks associated with a renewed slowdown in the global economic recovery. While
they consider the quality of staff policy advice as useful, nevertheless, they do not share
some of the conclusions reached by staff as expressed below.
I. BACKGROUND
The Government of Ethiopia has been working for the past seven years establishing the
protection of basic services program in collaboration with the World Bank (WB), the African
Development Bank, European Union and other development partners, which are active in the
country. The program aims at sustaining basic services such as water, health, roads and
agricultural extension development projects in all regions of the country. Since the inception
of the program, Ethiopia has made impressive progress in ensuring rapid and quality basic
services for the majority of the population and these efforts are expected to help and support
Ethiopia meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
In addition, the government has critically evaluated both external and internal conditions in
setting the growth targets in the GTP, which is mainly driven by the agriculture sector.
Through significant investment in agriculture, my authorities aim to modernize the sector and
insulate it from recurring drought shocks. Spending priorities remain geared towards the poor
and there is substantial investment in public infrastructure.
The high growth of the last several years has been accompanied by a halving of the
proportion of the population living below the poverty line, from 60.5 percent in 1995 to
30.7 percent in 2011. Other indicators of living standards, such as literacy rate, labor
participation rates have also shown significant improvements. However, the significant
progress towards the MDGs has so far failed to generate adequate employment opportunities,
particularly for the youth. As a result my authorities are focused on reducing unemployment
in the urban and rural areas. To this end, the five-year GTP, which aims to foster high and

2
broad-based growth, is expected to expand employment opportunities by emphasizing the
development of small and medium-scale industries.
My authorities are committed to enhance the participation of the private sector in growing the
economy. Cognizant of the role of the private sector as a key player in the development
process, the government continues to formulate policies to ensure that the private sector
emerges as a central player in the future development of the country. The currently high
infrastructure developments and service delivery improvement by the government is geared
towards opening opportunities and creating an enabling environment for the active
participation of the private sector.
II. MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
The growth momentum continues albeit at a slower rate. GDP is estimated at 8.5 percent for
2011/12, lower than the expected 11 percent due to poor performance in agriculture. My
authorities expect growth to rebound to 11.3 percent in 2012/13 as the agriculture sector
recovers. The tight monetary policy stance, aided by slowdown in food and fuel price
inflation, saw consumer price inflation decelerating to 7 percent year-on-year in
August 2013. Food price inflation eased to 3.8 percent in August, down from 5.8 percent in
July, while non-food inflation rate edged higher to 10.8 percent from 10.5 percent in July.
Vigorous policy implementation by my authorities has enabled Ethiopia to make significant
advances in meeting the key challenge of low international reserves while sustaining the high
growth rate and development momentum. Nevertheless, going forward my authorities will
continue to adjust their policies, including the growth in reserve money to ensure
macroeconomic stability. My authorities recognize that inflation, despite the significant
decline recently, remains a concern as it could quickly pose a challenge to their plan to
sustain the current real growth momentum.
The government’s determination to hold down prices was further reflected in its prudent
fiscal policy focusing on strengthening domestic resources and reducing domestic borrowing.
Fiscal policy remains geared towards maintaining the level of spending on the key MDGs
clusters and infrastructure while conforming to the overall macroeconomic framework. To
protect spending in priority areas, my authorities will continue to strengthen domestic and
concessional resource mobilization in the medium term. They are committed to improving
domestic revenue mobilization and are appreciative of the continued IMF technical
assistance (TA) in this area. Given the overall resource limitations, my authorities intend to
facilitate greater participation of the private sector and mobilize a modest level of nonconcessional financing while remaining vigilant of the contingent liabilities and debt
sustainability implications and strengthening their debt management strategy. The joint debt
sustainability analysis undertaken by the IMF and WB staffs reaffirms that the level of debt
distress will not worsen. My authorities also recognize the important role played by the
public enterprises, particularly in the improvement of infrastructure critical to socioeconomic development.

3
III. DATA ISSUES
The authorities have noted the need to further improve the quality and reliability of the
macroeconomic data. However, they note that the revised lower GDP number for 2011/12
was primarily due to the less than expected growth in agriculture (4.9 percent), in contrast to
growth in the previous years (7.6 percent in 2009/10 and 9.0 percent in 2010/11) rather than
the change in methodology following TA on national accounts from the IMF. In fact the
March 2010 IMF Statistics Department mission’s report states that, “some of the weakness
noted …. are not unique to Ethiopia. In fact, the compilation system compares quite
favorably with the system of other countries in the region…” is implying that the weaknesses
are not unique to Ethiopia and that the country is relatively well positioned in terms of the
quality of statistics in SSA. My authorities agree on the need expressed in the staff report for
continued improvement of National Accounts Statistics (NAS) compilation methodology and
have started implementation of NAS improvement and capacity building action plan to
identify weaknesses and incorporate improvements in the compilation process on an ongoing
basis.
In an effort to improve the national accounts statistics, my authorities have recruited a
resident international expert for one year to help improve estimation methodology and build
the capacity of NAS compilers. In addition, they have benefited from the expertise of an
IMF East AFRITAC expert to further improve the methodology. Going forward, they expect
TA from IMF East AFRITAC to improve GDP - Expenditure estimation would help further
and express their commitment to keep on improving NAS compilation on an ongoing basis.
IV. AML/CFT
With regard to AML/CFT, Ethiopia has recently taken significant steps towards improving
the AML/CTF regime, including enacting a law that criminalizes money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. The authorities are addressing the deficiencies in their action plan visà-vis international standards with the help of consultants from the WB. They expect the
Financial Action Task Force to review and remove Ethiopia from the list of jurisdictions with
strategic AML/CFT deficiencies.
V. CONCLUSION
My authorities will continue to focus on sustaining macroeconomic stability, enhancing
domestic resource mobilization, promoting broad-based and pro-poor growth, and increasing
investment in infrastructure, primary sectors and core MDG clusters. They intend to be
vigilant and continue adjusting their economic policies and programs in the near term to meet
the emerging challenges and maintain macroeconomic stability while at the same time
maintaining their focus on the long-term development objectives of poverty reduction,
sustaining the growth momentum and closing the infrastructure gap in line with the GTP.
Going forward, they will continue to consult with the IMF and seek the support of
development partners in order to achieve Ethiopia’s development goals.
