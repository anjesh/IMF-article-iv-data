STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 11, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Russia has recovered from the 2008–09 crisis and the output gap is closed.
Inflation has fallen due to temporary factors, and is projected to pick up by end-2012.
Anti-crisis fiscal stimulus has been only partially withdrawn and a procyclical fiscal
expansion is planned this year. Monetary policy has improved—notably by allowing
greater exchange rate flexibility, which is providing an effective way of absorbing
external shocks —but the policy stance has become too loose. While the banking
system has improved with higher profitability and lower NPL ratio, progress on FSAP
recommendations has been slow and vulnerabilities persist. The investment climate is
weak and the outlook for reforms uncertain.
Challenges: In the short-term, managing domestic demand to avoid overheating. In
the medium-term, maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening macroeconomic
policy frameworks, and improving the investment climate to boost potential growth
and realize Russia’s large remaining catch-up potential.
Policy recommendations:






Ambitious fiscal consolidation, and reinstatement of a fiscal anchor;
Monetary tightening to keep underlying inflation on a declining path, and
continued progress on the flexible exchange rate and the monetary framework;
Expedited implementation of FSAP recommendations, including the adoption
of pending legislation on consolidated supervision and connected lending, and
the expansion of the CBR’s powers to exercise discretion based on professional
judgment in applying regulations to individual banks;
Delivering on long-awaited structural reforms to help boost investment.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
The Russian economy has recovered from the 2008–09 crisis and the output gap is estimated to
now be closed.
1.
Russia’s recovery continued in 2011 and the momentum continued in the first quarter
of 2012. Russia recorded growth of 4.3 percent in 2011, the same as in 2010. Economic activity
rebounded in the second half of the year on the back of a favorable harvest and high oil prices

modest. International reserves increased by
$19bn in 2011, partly due to evaluation effects.
The staff’s external sector assessment found that in 2011 the external position was moderately
weaker than one consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policy settings
(Box 1).
5.
Recent global turmoil heavily impacted Russia’s markets. The MICEX stock market fell
17 percent in 2011, reaching a nadir in October as euro-area tensions peaked. In 2012, however, the
stock market added 16 percent in Q1 but lost all the gains during May’s global flight to quality
episode. Similarly, Russia’s EMBI+ sovereign spreads rose to a peak of 410 bps in October 2011, and
stood at about 275 bps in June 2012.
6.
Credit growth has rebounded strongly. This growth partly reflected a switch by the
corporate sector from external to domestic funding. At the same time, consumer credit grew
strongly. On the credit supply side, improving bank balance sheets (with declining nonperforming
loan (NPL) ratios and improving profitability) and funding (reflecting solid deposit growth and the
CBR’s liquidity provision) allowed an expansion of lending (Figure 2).
7.
Fiscal policy tightened. The federal nonoil deficit declined from 12.7 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2011. This improvement was due to both nonoil revenue
overperformance and expenditure cuts. Some of the windfall oil revenues from 2011 were deposited
in the Reserve Fund in early 2012 (Figure 3).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

OUTLOOK
A. Near-Term Outlook and Risks
8.
The outlook is for continued moderate growth; inflation will rebound under
unchanged policies. Staff projects real growth at around 4 percent in 2012 and 2013, with potential
GDP growing at a slightly lower rate, leading to moderate overheating. The unimpressive growth
rate of potential GDP reflects the slow progress with productivity-enhancing structural reforms and
the weak investment climate. Inflation is projected to rebound to 6½ percent by end-2012,
reflecting the economy running above potential, the base effect, and the delayed increases in
administered prices in mid-2012. The external current account surplus is projected to decline, amid
weaker oil prices and continuing strong import demand. Capital outflows will likely continue, albeit
at a moderating pace.
9.
Near-term risks are balanced but remain considerable. On the upside, higher oil prices
could push growth higher. Further, some reversal of capital outflows is also possible, in the event of
higher oil prices, diminished political uncertainty, and a quick start on implementing credible
structural reforms, adding more pressures to domestic demand and inflation. Finally, fiscal policy
could become looser, following pre-electoral promises. On the downside, external shocks—for
example, a further decline in oil prices, weaker investment sentiment, and lower external demand—
or domestic complacency and a lack of reform could weaken the growth outlook as discussed in the
Risk Assessment Matrix (Annex I). A strong intensification of financial turmoil in the euro area
accompanied by lower growth would affect Russia mostly through the oil channel. While the Russian
economy is also exposed to risks of accelerated capital outflows and sudden stop of external
funding, the more flexible exchange rate, the improved crisis management capacity, and large
international reserves would help Russia better handle an intensification of external shocks. A
weaker growth outcome in Russia would have knock-on effects throughout the region, mainly
through remittances and trade (Box 2).
10.
Policy actions could cushion the impact of adverse spillovers if downside external
shocks materialize. The exchange rate should be allowed to operate as the main shock absorber.
Sufficient liquidity should be provided to banks, with the CBR making emergency liquidity facilities
available as needed to mitigate the impact on banks (while providing for adequate safeguard of
funds). Monetary policy could become more accommodative, provided inflation is in check. Since
the nonoil fiscal deficit is already high and the multiplier is low, another massive fiscal stimulus is
imprudent. Instead, adjustment in the nonoil deficit should be postponed and automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate.

B. Medium-Term Outlook
11.
Russia still has significant unrealized growth potential. Twenty years after the collapse of
the Soviet Union, Russia’s per capita income

level stands at only about 40 percent of the
50

was less than impressive against the

and a difficult investment climate. Large scope
for catching up remains.
12.
Current policy plans do not go sufficiently far in reversing the crisis-related stimulus
and ensuring economic stability and growth. Unless these weaknesses are forcefully addressed,
growth prospects will remain subdued, with real growth projected to fall to 3¾ percent by 2017 in
the baseline scenario (Figure 5). Long-term potential growth will be modest—below 4 percent.
Inflation will remain elevated at around 6½ percent under unchanged policies. The current account
surplus will gradually decline as oil prices stabilize and robust import growth continues.
13.
A continuation of current policies would amplify Russia’s vulnerability to external
shocks. In an adverse scenario, a sharp and permanent decline in commodity prices—following, for
example, a significant drop in global growth—would put considerable pressure on Russia’s external
and fiscal accounts as the economy slows. Over the medium term, investor confidence would be
slow to return and capital outflows would continue putting a drag on growth.
14.
A strengthening of policy frameworks and decisive progress on structural reforms
could lift the medium-term growth rate considerably. The reform scenario envisages higher
medium-term growth—around 6 percent—supported by a stronger and more credible fiscal
retrenchment, monetary policy taking full control of inflation, a stronger and more competitive
financial system, and effective implementation of structural reforms. In this scenario, the short-term
drag on growth from fiscal retrenchment would be offset by a more stable and business-friendly
economic environment. This would boost investor confidence and support an early return of
productive capital inflows. More ambitious policy adjustment would also help build policy space to
respond to possible shocks.

Staff’s assessment indicates that Russia’s external position in 2011 was moderately weaker than one
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The authorities broadly
agreed with this assessment but expressed reservations about the methodology.

In addition to Russia’s structural factors such as expected population aging and the high dependence
on nonrenewable resources, the assessment of the current account and real exchange rate also reflect
an important policy gap in Russia. The nonoil fiscal deficit remains significantly higher than its longterm sustainable level (estimated at around 5 percent of GDP). More prudent fiscal policy, as
recommended by staff, would result in a larger current account surplus (by about ¾ percentage points
of GDP, which is about the half of the estimated current account gap). The increased flexibility of the
exchange rate also is appropriate and should help address imbalances.

Box 2. Regional Spillovers from Russia1
The Russian economy is closely interconnected
with the CIS region, mainly via trade,
remittances, and policy channels. The sharp
contraction of the Russian economy during
the 2008/09 crisis affected the region severely,
with a significant drop in Russia’s imports from
and remittances to the region. A large
depreciation of the ruble during the crisis also
triggered sharp currency devaluations in most
CIS countries, weakening banks’ balance sheets
and credit. While Russia’s subsequent recovery
has been benefiting the region, Russia’s export
ban on cereals during August 2010–June 2011
and the increase in the gasoline export duty to
a prohibitive level in May 2011 added to
inflationary pressures in the region.
Imports and remittances have recovered fully
from the 2008/09 crisis. Russia’s imports from
CIS countries rebounded beyond the 2007–08
levels (over 8 percent of the combined GDP of
the region). The Russian markets are particularly
important for Belarus, Kyrgyz Republic, and
Ukraine—Russia’s imports account for
23–32 percent of these countries’ total exports.
Remittances also surpassed the pre-crisis peak,
and they remain particularly important for
Moldova, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan, where
remittances from Russia are a key source of
foreign exchange earnings (15-40 percent of
GDP). Given the strong linkages between Russia
and other CIS countries, new shocks to the
Russian economy would continue to
reverberate throughout the region.

1/ Assumptions for the three scenarios are as follows:
▪ Baseline scenario assumes a continuation of current policies. Monetary policy will allow greater exchange-rate flexibility but remain too loose
resulting in inflation above the medium-term target. Fiscal policy will implement the 2012-14 medium-term budget, with an unchanged nonoil
deficit after 2014. There will be no major changes in banking sector policies. Policy frameworks will remain largely unreformed.
▪ Adverse scenario assumes a permanent external shock, with oil prices declining to $60 per barrel in 2013 and staying there in real terms for the
remainder of the forecast. In 2013, fiscal policy responds by maintaining expenditures unchanged in nominal terms at their 2012 level, while
monetary policy becomes more accommodative. During 2014-15, the nonoil deficit of the federal government is reduced at the same pace as
envisaged in the current medium-term budget for 2013-14, with no further consolidation after 2015, while monetary policy remains neutral. As in
the baseline, no progress is made regarding structural reforms and the strengthening of policy frameworks. In 2013, when oil prices drop by
about $40 per barrel, the ruble depreciates significantly, but reserves are used to prevent an overshooting of the exchange rate.
▪ Reform scenario assumes full implementation of reforms recommended by the staff. Monetary policy will focus on bringing inflation down to 3
percent over the medium term, amid a flexible exchange rate. Fiscal policy will implement a more ambitious, credible, and growth-friendly
consolidation with the nonoil deficit of the federal government declining to the government’s suspended long-term target of 4.7 percent of GDP
by 2015. The supervisory framework will be strengthened along the lines recommended by the 2011 FSAP. Fundamental structural reforms are
put in place to improve the business climate and competitiveness, and policy frameworks will be strengthened in line with IMF staff
recommendations.

The policy discussions focused on how Russia’s new government could put in place the
reforms needed to lift growth and diversify the economy. These efforts should focus on
reducing fiscal vulnerabilities and limiting the crowding out of private investment, bringing down
inflation while allowing a flexible exchange rate, and pushing ahead on structural reforms.

A. Anchoring Fiscal Policy
Russia’s public finances should be anchored on a rule that both delinks the economy from
oil price fluctuations and ensures equitable sharing of the oil wealth by all generations. In
order to return the nonoil deficit to a level consistent with these objectives, an ambitious
medium-term plan should be articulated. In light of the low share of discretionary
spending, fundamental public sector reforms will be needed, including in pensions,
healthcare and education.
16.
Staff and the authorities agreed that continued high nonoil deficits amplify fiscal
vulnerabilities and undermine economic stability. At nearly 10 percent of GDP in 2011, the
federal government nonoil deficit was more than

GDP respectively, in 2011).
17.
Fiscal policy is procyclical again this
year. The 2012 budget implies an increase in the
federal nonoil deficit of about 1 percent of GDP,
while election campaign promises could add up
to another 1½ percent of GDP in 2012 and
6 percent of GDP on a cumulative basis by 2018,
on top of an already un-ambitious medium-term
budget. At the same time, the Reserve Fund
stands at a relatively low level compared to the
pre-crisis situation, even after the authorities
partially replenished it earlier this year.

In this regard, staff views the

intergenerational equity. The 2012–14 budget envisages that the nonoil deficit by 2014 would still
be about 9 percent of GDP—only slightly lower than its 2011 level.
19.
A more ambitious fiscal consolidation than envisaged in the medium-term budget
would reduce overheating pressures as well as vulnerabilities to external shocks. Cutting the
deficit by some 1½ percent of GDP in 2012 compared to the 2012 supplemental budget with further
consolidation of about 1½ percent of GDP per year through 2015, would reduce demand pressures
while rebuilding the Reserve Fund to create a cushion against external shocks. This would require
that implementation of campaign promises are offset by fiscal savings elsewhere.

Reserve Fund reaches this threshold, at least half of excess oil revenues should go to the National
Wealth Fund, while the remaining resources would be channeled to the budget to finance
infrastructure and other priority projects. Starting in 2013, the rule will use a 5-year
backward-looking average of oil prices as the base, which will gradually increase to a 10-year
average by 2018, to avoid abruptly moving to a very low base oil price. The authorities consider that
the planned oil-price rule would be easier to communicate than the nonoil deficit rule and would
allow for a more gradual transition to a stronger fiscal position. The authorities also added that a
more ambitious rule would be politically very difficult to implement. Staff noted that while the
precise form of any rule may be less important than political support and consistent
implementation, the proposed rule would leave the Reserve Fund below the authorities’ targeted
level of 7 percent of GDP—too low to adequately insulate against a large drop in oil prices—and the
nonoil deficit in excess of a level consistent with equitable sharing of the oil wealth across

generations by 2020 (Box 4), though it would help delink the budget from short-term oil price
fluctuations. Staff also emphasized the importance of avoiding excessive use of supplemental
budgets to avoid undermining the rule.
22.
Pension reform will be indispensible to achieve the required fiscal adjustment but
other measures will also be needed. With discretionary expenditures amounting to only about
one-third of total expenditures, durable fiscal consolidation will require structural reforms. This will
need to include pension reform, especially in light of adverse demographic trends. Staff projects
that, absent reforms, maintaining the current replacement rate of about 40 percent would require
substantial increases in public pension spending—from 9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 16 percent
in 2050. Recent proposals by the Strategy 2020 working group (an expert group which in late 2011
made proposals for Russia’s economic and development strategy through 2020) aimed at ensuring
the sustainability of the pension system—including increasing the retirement age for both sexes to
63 by 2030—go in the right direction, but not far enough. Staff’s advice is to progressively raise the
retirement age for both men and women to 63 years by 2030 and 65 years by 2050 (in line with
expected advances in longevity), which would allow pension spending to remain broadly unchanged
in relation to GDP from its 2010 level while increasing the supply of labor (Box 5). The authorities
agreed that pension reform is needed to contain public pension spending and are exploring
options, with formal proposals to be put forward in coming months. In addition, the generous
eligibility criteria for early retirement should be tightened, while strengthening disability and welfare
programs to protect the vulnerable. Means-testing could also help because local governments top
up basic pensions to the regional subsistence level and the eligibility criteria are unclear. Other
measures, such as better targeting social transfers and improving the efficiency of government
expenditures, are also needed to ensure fiscal sustainability.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Box 3. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities’ macroeconomic policy adjustment and structural reforms over the past two years have
been in the direction recommended by staff, but at a slower pace and a smaller magnitude.
Monetary and financial sector policies
In line with staff advice, the CBR has gradually tightened monetary policy, made important changes to
the operational framework to make monetary policy more effective, and prepared for the introduction
of inflation targeting. In particular, the CBR started using the repo rate as the main effective policy rate
and has taken steps to narrow the policy rate corridor—both measures should strengthen the clarity of
the monetary policy signal. In line with long-standing staff advice, the CBR has also continued to make
the exchange rate more flexible and interventions have been further reduced. Communications on
monetary and exchange rate policy have also improved markedly. On financial sector policies, however,
implementation of the recommendations from the 2011 FSAP has been slow as key legislative
amendments to expand CBR supervisory authority over bank holding companies and related parties,
and the use of discretionally expert judgment (in line with the Basel framework) remain pending before
the Duma.
Fiscal policy
The reduction of the federal nonoil deficit back to the authorities’ (currently suspended) long-term
target of 4.7 percent of GDP has been slow and has come mainly as a result of higher-than-expected
nonoil revenues and expenditure under-execution rather than a concerted effort at rapid consolidation.
The Reserve Fund was used to finance the budget deficit in 2009, in line with staff’s advice, but as the
economy started recovering in 2010, the Reserve Fund continued to be drawn down to finance the
budget deficit. Despite the suspension of the fiscal rule, the authorities transferred most of the higherthan-anticipated oil revenues in 2011 to the Reserve Fund to rebuild buffers as staff recommended.
However, the practice of twice-yearly supplemental budgets undermines the fiscal framework.
Structural policies
While over the past several years there have been several policy proposals aimed at attracting
investment, diversifying the economy and raising potential growth, implementation has been limited.
Russia’s WTO accession, expected to be finalized in mid-2012, is a bright spot which should be
leveraged to catalyze the needed domestic structural reforms staff has been recommending such as
limiting corruption, strengthening the rule of law, and reducing state interference in the economy.

Box 4. An Example of the Oil Price Rule in Practice1
The objectives of a fiscal rule in oil producing countries are two-fold: first to protect the budget—and by
extension the economy—from oil price volatility and second to ensure fiscal sustainability by supporting
intergenerational equity. Using a nonoil deficit target as derived by a permanent oil income model (POIM)
can help ensure that both objectives are met and fiscal reserves are gradually rebuilt—this is discussed in
more detail in Strengthening Russia’s Fiscal Framework. The planned oil price rule, on the other hand, has to
be supplemented with other constraints, such as a ceiling on borrowing or expenditure, to meet the first
objective of delinking the budget from oil price fluctuations, and the base oil price should be set to be
consistent with the second objective of intergenerational equity.
The Ministry of Finance has put forward a proposal for a new fiscal rule discussed in paragraph 21.
The planned rule implies that the nonoil balance would decline to 6.3 percent of GDP by 2020 but the overall
balance would remain in deficit over this horizon, despite oil prices that are generally lower than the WEO
projections for oil prices, with the exception of 2016-18. As a result, the Reserve Fund would remain at a low
level that could be insufficient to withstand a prolonged period when oil prices are lower than the base price.
If a more restrictive rule were used where expenditures were limited to oil revenues at a base price of $80
plus all nonoil revenues, the overall level of spending could be maintained constant in real terms over the
long term, thereby preserving intergenerational equity. Under such a rule, the nonoil deficit would reach the
4.7 percent level recommended by staff (see Strengthening Russia’s Fiscal Framework) by 2019, the assets in
the RF could be augmented further as this rule would generate fiscal surpluses throughout the period
to 2020, and the income from these assets would contribute to maintaining constant overall spending in real
terms. Indeed, this rule would increase the RF to nearly 6 percent of GDP by 2014.
The following example compares the rule proposed by the Ministry of Finance and the rule that would ensure
intergenerational equity.

2050

Curtailing eligibility (mainly by increasing the retirement age) is the recommended option. The statutory
retirement ages in Russia of 55 years for women and 60 years for men are low in an international context.
Gradually equalizing the retirement ages for both sexes to 63 years by 2030 and 65 years by 2050, in line
with projected increases in life expectancy could stabilize pension spending at current levels. At the same
time, increases in the retirement age should be accompanied by steps to limit early retirement. In Russia, this
would mean phasing out the complex system that allows certain occupations and professions to claim
benefits early and reduce benefits claimed prior to retirement age to reflect the longer period over which
they will be received.
Increasing retirement ages would have many other advantages such as: increasing employment levels;
helping avoid a decrease in the replacement rate thus reducing the impact of reforms on elderly poverty;
and being potentially easier for the public to understand in light of increasing life expectancies (see
Macroeconomic Effects of Public Pension Reforms). By undertaking reforms to put Russia’s pension system
on a sustainable footing, pension reform could support the needed fiscal adjustment over the medium to
long term in order to ensure an enduring return to a sustainable fiscal position.
Substantial cuts in replacement rates, which are broadly in line with other countries at present, would be
undesirable as they would increase old-age poverty. Increasing the payroll tax from its current level of
22 percent of wages to about 30 percent of wages in 2030 and more than 40 percent in 2050, in order to
keep pension spending at current levels, would also be undesirable. These levels of contribution are beyond
the currently observed payroll rates in other countries—nearly all advanced and emerging economies have
pension contribution rates below 30 percent of wages. Such large contribution hikes would have adverse
labor market effects and could further promote informality. Such increases would also go against recent
efforts of the Russian authorities to reduce the cost of labor.

B. Tightening the Monetary Policy Stance and Anchoring Low Inflation
After a significant tightening of monetary conditions in 2011, policy has been on hold.
Further policy action will be required to keep inflation within the range targeted by the
CBR. While recent advances in the operational framework for monetary policy are
welcome, further steps are needed to enhance its effectiveness and to anchor inflation at
a low level.
23.
The monetary stance has become too loose in view of the cyclical position of the
economy and continued high core inflation. The CBR tightened monetary policy during 2011,
including by gradually steering the interbank market rate from the CBR deposit rate of 2¾ percent
in January to the CBR repo rate of 5¼ percent by the end of the year (Figure 4). Since then, however,
policy has effectively been on hold. Despite the currently low level of headline inflation, with core
inflation still above 6 percent, the output gap closed, and real credit growth in double digits, the
risks to medium-term inflation have increased. Including some modest pass through from recent
ruble depreciation, headline inflation is likely to bounce back to 6½ percent by the end of 2012.
Without policy action, this level would likely be sustained in 2013, thus causing the authorities to
breach their end-year inflation targets for 2012 (5-6 percent) and 2013 (4½-5½ percent).

Projection

24.
At the same time, the CBR has continued to make good progress with the preparations
for the adoption of formal inflation targeting. In particular, in line with staff advice over the past
year, the CBR has moved from an effective floor system to

1/ Trimmed-mean core inflation excludes the most extreme
price movements on a monthly frequency. It is a good
proxy for trend inflation, measured as a centered 24-month
moving average inflation rate.

25.
The staff argued for a gradual further
tightening of monetary policy to keep underlying
inflation on a downward path. A monetary tightening,
effected by a gradual increase in the CBR repo rate, should reduce core inflation and help to keep
headline inflation between 3–5 percent over the medium term—a level regarded as appropriate by
staff. Timely policy action to contain the expected rebound in inflation would also be essential to
bolster the CBR’s credibility and help anchor medium-term inflation expectations (see Annex III). The
authorities conceded that there was a considerable risk that the inflation targets would be missed
in 2012 and 2013, but were reluctant to raise interest rates in light of signs of decelerating credit

growth, low headline inflation, and the large uncertainties stemming from the euro area financial
turmoil.
26.
Recent advances in monetary operations are welcome but further steps are needed. In
particular, the staff suggested that formally making the repo rate the primary CBR policy rate, in

targeting. The authorities had no plans to make the
repo rate the primary formal policy rate, and noted that in practice markets were already
recognizing it as the key policy rate. With regard to communication policies, they broadly agreed
with the staff and noted their intention to strengthen external communications on the inflation
outlook, albeit initially without publishing inflation projections.
27.
The ongoing steps to further enhance exchange rate flexibility are commendable. In
December 2011, the authorities further widened the moving operational exchange rate band from
5 to 6 rubles (some +/- 8 percent around the center of the current band) while further reducing
intervention limits. The staff and the authorities agreed that these steps were helping to make the
exchange rate more flexible and allow monetary policy to focus squarely on inflation. The staff
supported the authorities’ plans to make the ruble even more flexible going forward, noting how
ruble flexibility is playing an essential role in absorbing current fluctuations in oil prices.
28.
International reserves are adequate and there is no need for further reserve
accumulation for precautionary purposes. At end-2011, international reserves amounted to about
$500 billion, nearly a quarter of which are savings in the Reserve Fund and National Wealth Fund.
The staff noted, however, that the accumulation of fiscal savings in the oil funds should continue as
long as oil prices are high. Over time, it would be appropriate to invest oil reserve fund assets in a
more diversified portfolio of instruments. The staff also noted that the differentiation in reserve
requirements according to residence, which was introduced in 2011, was obsolete in the face of
continued capital outflows and could be revoked. The authorities agreed but did not consider
revoking the differentiation a priority.

C. The Financial Sector: Containing Risks and Promoting Sound
Intermediation by Strengthening Supervision
While Russian banks weathered the 2008-09 crisis and the financial market distress in 2011
relatively well, important gaps in the supervisory framework vis-a-vis international standards,
as identified by the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), remain. Strengthening
the supervisory framework is key to promoting sound financial intermediation that would
help underpin investment, growth, and stability.
29.
Official liquidity support to banks has shielded the financial system from international
financial turmoil. Banks have managed ruble and foreign exchange liquidity risks well, supported
by solid deposit growth and their net foreign creditor position. However, tight global liquidity
conditions and capital outflows from Russia have reduced external funding for the corporate sector,
while the fiscal position and the change in exchange rate policy affected liquidity conditions in the
domestic money market. Stepped-up official liquidity operations helped maintain broadly adequate
levels of liquidity in the system, ensuring the continued availability of financing to the private sector
(Figure 2).
30.
The financial system is improving but concerns remain about asset quality in the
context of rapid credit growth and volatile oil prices (Table 7). Banks’ overall performance has
improved, as indicated by higher profitability (over 2 percent return on assets); lower NPL ratios
(which declined from about 10 percent in 2009 to below 7 percent in 2012Q1); and stable ratings
despite global turbulence. At the same time, credit growth has picked up, reducing the capital
adequacy ratio to 14¾ percent in 2012Q1, partly as the government has not expanded the capital
base of state-owned banks since the crisis, and raising the loan-to-deposit ratio. Maintaining credit
quality of rapidly expanding loans could be a challenge going forward, as the stock of legacy NPLs
remains high.2 Stress tests at the CBR highlight the role of oil prices as a main source of spillovers
from global market conditions. The authorities considered nominal credit growth of 20–25 percent
per year manageable, especially as part of the growth reflected the corporate sector substituting
domestic for external funding. Authorities and staff concurred that rapid growth in household credit
warranted vigilant monitoring, notwithstanding the small size of this segment (10 percent of GDP);
and, more broadly, saw that strengthening the supervisory framework per the 2011 FSAP
recommendations is key to promoting sound financial intermediation.
31.
The authorities are improving financial sector supervision. The CBR has created a new
financial stability department and now organizes regular stress testing for banks. Separately, the
authorities are establishing a new high-level financial stability council to strengthen macroprudential
oversight, although its relation to the existing Inter-Agency Working Group to Monitor Financial

2

Potential under-reporting and under-provisioning, as examined by the 2011 FSAP stress testing exercises, remain
important.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23

Market Conditions has yet to be defined.3 The planned adoption of Basel III capital framework
implies tightening minimum capital requirements in line with new global standards with a stricter
definition of capital and more prudent risk-weights, while maintaining a 10 percent minimum total
capital ratio requirement.
32.
However, critical legislative changes that address the supervisory framework’s key
weaknesses remain pending. The 2011 FSAP identified important gaps in the regulatory and
supervisory framework vis-à-vis international standards. In particular, the CBR lacks adequate
authority to effectively supervise bank holding companies and related entities, and address
connected lending. The CBR also does not have sufficient power to exercise discretion based on its
professional judgment in applying regulations to individual banks, which is an important component
of the Basel framework. Without these powers, the CBR has limited ability to detect vulnerability and
to take adequate supervisory actions; for instance, the CBR has no legal power to request banks to
recapitalize after a negative stress test result. Legislation addressing these weaknesses was
submitted to the Duma in the spring of 2011, but has yet to be passed. Moreover, the current draft
introduces professional judgment only for defining related parties. The staff and the authorities
agreed that prompt passing of the pending legislation, which is only a first step towards bringing
Russia’s regulatory system at par with international standards, remains a top priority.
33.
The supervisory framework for non-bank financial institutions also needs further
strengthening. In 2011, the Federal Service for Financial Markets (FSFM) assumed responsibility for
insurance and securities market supervision and was given responsibility for supervising
cooperatives and microfinance institutions. Staff noted that major legislative changes will be needed
to equip the expanded FSFM with basic supervisory powers, including the authority to issue
secondary regulation to interpret the law as well as industry-wide binding norms, in line with FSAP
recommendations. The authorities indicated that the timeframe for doing so remains uncertain.

D. Improving the Investment Climate
Improving Russia’s investment climate is essential for attracting productive investment and
capital inflows, diversifying the economy, and promoting sustainable growth.
34.
Russia’s weak investment climate remains an important obstacle to economic
diversification and growth. Given adverse demographic trends, productivity improvement—
through higher investment and innovation—will have to be the primary source of long-term growth
in Russia. This challenge underscores the need for broad reforms to strengthen the business
environment which compares unfavorably to peers (Figure 6).
35.

Russia’s WTO accession should be a useful platform for further reforms. Russia’s WTO

membership will come into force in mid-2012, after a long journey spanning two decades. WTO
3

This Group, established at end-2010, narrowly focused on defining systemically important financial institutions to
be intensively monitored.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

membership should be seized upon to strengthen the momentum for domestic reforms to make the
business environment more predictable and rules-based, and thereby boost Russia’s long-term
growth potential. The experience of other countries suggests that the development of sound
domestic institutions is the main determinant of the benefits gained from WTO accession in terms of
medium-term development and growth.
36.

Expeditious implementation of reform plans already announced will be crucial. Staff

broadly agrees on the current reform proposals to strengthen the business climate, including former
President Medvedev’s anti-corruption initiatives and “10-point plan,” the government’s privatization
agenda, and the recommendations of the Strategy 2020 advisory group. However, actual progress
has been limited. More generally, reform efforts to limit corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and
reduce the state’s influence in the economy (including through more decisive privatization of stateowned companies) should be prioritized to realize further catch-up gains in productivity and income
levels. The authorities confirmed that their long-term economic policy will focus on strengthening
the investment climate and regional development, as recently put forward by President Putin’s
Executive Order (Box 6).

Box 6. Long-Term Economic Policy Priorities of the New Government1
On May 7, 2012, the first day of his new presidency, President Putin issued a Decree on long-term economic
policy, focused on investment climate improvement. The government is ordered to take measures to increase
fixed capital investment from current 21 percent of GDP to 27 percent, to raise labor productivity by 50 percent
and the share of high-tech industries in GDP by 30 percent by 2018. The President also called for an
improvement of Russia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business index from the current 120th place to 20th
place by 2018. Among others, the following actions are envisaged by the decree:
I. Submit to the Duma, by October 1, 2012, a draft law on use of oil revenues, including new rules for the
Reserve Fund and the National Wealth Fund.
II. Revise by November 1, 2012 privatization plans to include sale by 2016 of all Government stakes in all
companies, excluding those in the energy sector, defense enterprises and natural monopolies, and adopt
regulations for state-controlled companies to purchase stakes in other companies. By December 1, 2012,
companies with more than 50 percent Government share should create and launch programs for selling noncore assets.
III. Analyze by March 1, 2013 the efficiency of state corporations, owing assets in airplane building, ship
building, defense and car industries and draft proposals for improving their management.
IV. Significantly reduce by January 1, 2015 the time it takes for businesses to complete procedures (and the
costs of such procedures) in some areas of state regulation (construction, connections to utility networks, tax
benefits and tax administration, customs).
V. Establish by December 1, 2012 the institution of ombudsman for entrepreneurs’ rights at both the federal
and regional levels.
VI. Starting from 2013, introduce compulsory public audits of costs and technologies for all large investment
projects with state participation
VII. Introduce by November 1, 2012 a new mechanism of issuing state guarantees for investment projects of
medium-sized enterprises in sectors other than mineral extraction and processing.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The Russian economy has recovered from the 2008–09 crisis and is now running close
to its potential. High oil prices, strong wage growth, and robust consumption have supported
demand. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate and capacity utilization have recovered their pre-crisis
levels, suggesting that any remaining slack in the economy is small. The factors recently muting
headline inflation are expected to recede in coming months. The external position was moderately
weaker in 2011 than one consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policy
settings. The increased flexibility of the exchange rate has been helping absorb external shocks and
address imbalances.
38.
Ongoing turbulence in international markets is affecting Russia mostly through oil
prices. Reliance on oil exports exposes Russia to declining oil prices, especially if accompanied by
large capital outflows. While the more flexible exchange rate and the private sector’s reduced
external exposure have improved the economy’s resilience to external shocks, significant
weaknesses persist. In the event downside risks materialize, the exchange rate should be allowed to
operate as the main shock absorber, liquidity should be provided as needed, and the automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to operate.
39.
Russia still has significant unrealized growth potential but, under unchanged policies,
the outlook is for continued moderate growth and a rebound in inflation. The new government
has the opportunity to realize this potential and put Russia on a sustainable growth path, while
reducing vulnerabilities to shocks. An ambitious fiscal adjustment would help contain demand
pressures in the short run, while over time laying the basis for balanced economic growth and
equitable spending of oil wealth across generations. Adopting a firm medium-term anchor for fiscal
policy should be an integral part of the fiscal strategy. Monetary policy should aim for stable and
low inflation, with further monetary tightening needed to keep inflation on a declining path.
Exchange rate flexibility should help absorb external macroeconomic shocks. Critically, the new
government should deliver quickly on long-awaited structural reforms.
40.
The current budget risks overheating the economy and is depleting the wealth of
future generations. The authorities should implement an ambitious fiscal consolidation to return
the nonoil deficit to about 5 percent of GDP by 2015, which staff estimates would be consistent with
intergenerational equity. At the same time, an adequately ambitious fiscal anchor should be
reinstated to guide medium-term fiscal policy, decoupling the fiscal stance from short-term
variations in oil prices and ensuring the oil wealth is shared across generations. Given the low share
of discretionary expenditures in total expenditures, durable fiscal consolidation will need to be
underpinned by structural reforms, including pension reform.
41.
Monetary policy should be aimed at securing low and stable inflation. Timely tightening
of monetary policy is necessary to contain the rebound in inflation and anchor inflation
expectations. The greater exchange rate flexibility is welcome as, besides helping absorb external
shocks, it allows monetary policy to focus squarely on inflation. For the successful adoption of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

inflation targeting, continued steps to strengthen monetary policy tools are necessary. In addition,
further enhancing communication policies, including the publication of inflation forecasts, will be
important to improve transparency and convey the rationale for the CBR’s policy measures to the
public. Transparency would also be improved by making the repo rate formally the primary policy
interest rate.
42.
A stronger supervisory framework is key to facilitating sound financial intermediation.
The financial system is improving, but concerns remain about asset quality in the context of rapid
credit growth and volatile oil prices. Russia continues to improve its financial stability analyses and
macroprudential oversight framework. In this regard, the prompt passing of legislation on
consolidated supervision and connected lending, and the expansion of the CBR’s powers to use
professional judgment remains a top priority.
43.
Delivering on structural reforms will promote economic growth. Structural reforms are
crucial to increase investment, diversify the economy, and raise potential growth. Russia’s accession
to the WTO should be seized upon to strengthen the momentum for reforms, make the business
environment more predictable and rules based, and to resist protectionist pressures.
Complementary steps to reduce corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and scale back state
involvement in the economy—including through transparent and decisive privatization of stateowned companies—are priorities.
44.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX III. Russia: Sensitivity of Inflation Expectations
The effect of exogenous price shocks on inflation generally depends on how well inflation
expectations are anchored. If a central bank’s commitment to low and stable inflation is credible, the
private sector may expect that it will neutralize the effect of price shocks, so that outer-year inflation
projections would likely be less affected than otherwise. In turn, such firmly-anchored inflation
expectations would also help the monetary authorities to stabilize inflation with smaller policy
adjustments than would otherwise be needed.
The extent to which inflation expectations are anchored can be examined by estimating the
response of medium-term inflation expectations to a revision to the near-term inflation forecast,
which generally reflects the up-to-date information on factors that affect (or will affect) inflation.
Following the methodology used in the October 2011 WEO (Chapter III), we estimate how the

where d is a dummy variable for negative inflation news.
In Russia, short-term inflation expectations are very responsive to upward inflation news. For
example, when the current period inflation projection is revised upward by 1 percentage point, next
year’s inflation projection (t+1) is revised by the same magnitude. The sensitivity of inflation
expectations to a positive inflation shock in Russia is significantly higher than that in advanced
economies throughout the 5-year expectation horizon, and also higher than that in EM peers in the
short term (1 year), though the gap there is much narrower and disappears in the medium-term
projections (top panels of text chart).
In contrast, Russia’s market expectations on future inflation have hardly responded to downward
inflation news suggesting that Russia’s private sector regards a downward inflation shock as
transitory, and thus does not adjust even short-term inflation expectations in face of downward
inflation news. Such an asymmetry between upward and downward shocks does not exist in
1

Consensus forecasts update the inflation survey twice a year, March and September. The change in the current
period inflation expectations is the revision to the nearest end-year inflation projection between these biannual
surveys.

advanced economies. And the pattern in Russia is opposite to that found in its inflation targeting
EM peers, where forces driving downward revisions to the current period inflation projections are
seen as more lasting—i.e., structural gains, while the wider confidence interval implies that crosscountry variations are considerable (bottom panels of text chart).
More persistent (and asymmetric) inflation expectations in Russia seem to be a reflection of the
weak credibility of the central bank’s commitment to low and stable inflation in the past, which, in
turn, appears to have undermined the effectiveness of the monetary policy. Continuing the recent
improvement in the central bank’s credibility—and thereby more firmly-anchored inflation
expectations—will be key to the success of formal inflation targeting in Russia.

permissible fluctuations were revised based on changes in fundamental factors governing
formation of the country’s balance of payments in accordance with the Uniform State
Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2008, in response to a gradual transition to a more flexible
exchange-rate-setting policy. The value of the bi-currency basket is determined under the
influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the CBR. The interventions
take place both in interbank currency exchanges and on the over-the-counter interbank
market to limit daily fluctuations. Effective October 13, 2010, the CBR has eliminated the
fixed trading band of Rub 26-41 against the bi-currency basket, in force since January 2009.
The CBR has also widened the moving intervention band from 3 to 6 rubles in three
installments, with the size of the maximum intervention amount within the band reduced
from $700 million to $500 million. The permissible fluctuations may be revised in response
to changes in macroeconomic indicators. Owing to the continued control of the CBR over
the exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is other managed
arrangement. The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for currents
international transactions.

II. WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION

4

1.

The Fund Russia team led by Mr. Spilimbergo (mission chief) met with the World
Bank Russia economic policy team led by Mr. Bogetic (lead economist and
country sector coordinator) on May 1, 2012 to discuss and reconfirm macrocritical
structural reforms and to coordinate the two teams’ work for the period
October 2011-September 2012.

2.

The teams agreed that Russia’s main macroeconomic challenges are to raise growth
prospects and strengthen the banking system. A reduction of economic vulnerabilities
and reinvigoration of structural reforms will be needed to meet these challenges.

3.

Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified five reform areas as
macrocritical:



Strengthening the fiscal framework: Key elements of reform include: (i) focusing on the
nonoil balance as the anchor for fiscal policy, (ii) using a Permanent Oil Income Model
(POIM) rule to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability; (iii) avoiding excessive use of
supplemental budgets; and (iv) replenishing the Reserve Fund (designed as a “rainy day”
fund). These reforms are macrocritical as they will help to reduce fiscal (and economic)
vulnerabilities, and increase the credibility of fiscal policy, which would support higher
growth.



Public expenditure reforms: Key elements of reform include: (i) promoting aggregate fiscal
discipline and strengthening public expenditure efficiency and management;
(ii) strengthening capital budgeting in the road and rail sectors; and (iii) improving the
efficiency of public employment. These reforms are macrocritical as they will help to identify
savings to support fiscal consolidation and reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.



Reforming the pension system: Key objectives of reform include bringing down long-run
fiscal costs and providing reasonable pension benefits to all pensioners current and future.
These reforms are macrocritical as they will help to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.



Strengthening the monetary policy framework: Key elements of reform include (i) further
increasing exchange rate flexibility; (ii) streamlining the set of monetary policy instruments;
(iii) establishing a binding policy rate; (iv) gradually narrowing the policy interest rate
corridor; and (v) further improving policy communications. These reforms are macrocritical as
they will help to improve the effectiveness of the monetary policy efforts to control inflation,
which is key for macroeconomic stability and growth.



Financial sector stability assessment and financial sector development: The banking
sector is stable but regulatory and supervisory deficiencies need to be addressed, specifically:
(i) prompt adoption of pending legislation on consolidated supervision and connected
lending; (ii) granting an appropriate degree of supervisory discretion to the CBR; (iii) closer
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

supervision of systemically important banks to contain moral hazard and improve systemic
risk monitoring. These reforms are macrocritical as financial sector stability is key for effective
intermediation of savings to promote investment and growth.
4.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:



Strengthening the fiscal framework: The Fund has elaborated reform options and
discussed them with the authorities during the 2011 Article IV consultation. The Fund will
also start a dialogue with the authorities on the best ways to analyze, manage, and disclose
contingent liabilities and fiscal risks, drawing on international best practice in these areas.
The Bank is preparing a new lending project for FY13 to strengthen the fiscal regime to
encourage business investment, streamline the intergovernmental fiscal system and increase
oversight of financial risks through policy advice and capacity building in the Ministry of
Finance and the Federal Tax Service. The Bank is also monitoring fiscal developments,
reforms and policies as part of its regular Russian Economic Reports covering
macroeconomic and structural issues. In addition, the Bank is providing technical assistance
on program budgeting and public expenditure efficiency.



Public expenditure reforms: The Bank has elaborated reform options in its Public
Expenditure Review, which were discussed with the authorities and published in June 2011.
The Bank will further explore cooperation with the authorities in the areas of improving the
business environment and public administration reform, including in the regions.



Reforming the pension system: The Fund has elaborated reform options and presented
them at a high-level conference in Moscow in January 2012 which included representatives
from the government, academia, private sector, and civil society, and discuss these options in
the context of the 2012 Article IV consultation. The Fund also assessed the reform proposals
of the Strategy 2020 Working Group on Pensions that were presented to the authorities. The
World Bank has completed several recent studies that relate to the pension system, including
a study of long-term fiscal risks and a recent paper on the second, private pillar. The Bank
team has shared these studies and also participated in the Fund’s January 2012 pension
reform workshop.



Strengthening the monetary policy framework: The Fund has elaborated reform options
and discussed them with the authorities during the 2011 Article IV consultation. Envisaged
follow-up work includes: (i) examining the optimal width of the policy rate corridor and
strategies for narrowing it; (ii) coordination between monetary policy and government
operations that affect liquidity conditions; (iii) foreign exchange intervention policy; and
(iv) effective communications policies.



Financial sector stability assessment and financial sector development: The Fund
conducted the assessment in March/April 2011 and discussed reform options with the
authorities, along with participation of Bank staff. Follow-up work includes more
comprehensive recommendations in the macro-prudential policy area, based on recent work

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

carried out by the Fund. The Bank has appointed a new private sector/financial sector
coordinator for Russia, who is stationed in Moscow to coordinate the work on longer-term
developmental issues in the private/financial sector. The Bank is also preparing a new lending
project to (a) achieve an orderly financial market expansion and development of domestic
capital markets to better serve the needs for corporate finance, (b) enhance financial market
stability through a modernized state-of-the-art regulatory framework and the
implementation of robust supervisory and enforcement mechanisms, and (c) reach global
best practice standards in the market infrastructure and regulation, in order to achieve a
broader international reach as a center of financing.
5.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the macrocritical reform areas
under the Bank’s purview and also to receive an analysis from the WB of the composition of
the authorities’ 2012–14 medium-term budget, along the lines of the recent Public
Expenditure Review.



The Bank team requested that the Fund share on a regular basis with WB and invite, as
needed, Bank’s comments on policy notes, draft staff reports, and other relevant materials;
and that Bank staff be invited to attend policy meetings, as has already been the case with
the 2011 Article Consultation Discussion. Timing: in the context of the Article IV and other
missions (and at least semi-annually).

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in the context of
emerging data demands for assessing external vulnerabilities, the scope for further data
improvements exists.
Russia is an SDDS subscriber, has a range of statistical dissemination formats, and reports data
for the Fund’s statistical publications. These sources inform surveillance.
National Accounts: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there have been concerns
about the reliability and consistency of quarterly GDP estimates among a wide range of users,
including Fund staff. This may point inter alia to lags in the revision schedule of the various data
formats. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) started a national account development
plan for 2011–17, which will expedite compilation of quarterly GDP estimates consistent with
annual GDP estimate. Following the introduction of methodological changes in the compilation
of important indicators, backward revisions of the series were delayed impairing timely economic
analysis. However, a historical revision of the industrial production index was released in
July 2010. Consistent with the new series, a historical revision of the annual and quarterly GDP
series, which will also incorporate the results of the 2006 agriculture census as well as
methodological improvements, was made in the third quarter of 2010.
The Rosstat follows the 1993 SNA in general, although scope exists for methodological
improvements in the calculations of volume measures of the production-based GDP estimates,
including estimates of the output of financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM).
The imputed rental services of owner-occupied dwellings are undervalued. Improvements in the
coverage of source data are constrained by an inadequate response to business surveys. The
unavailability of balance sheet data continues to be an obstacle for analyzing balance sheet
vulnerabilities, and work is underway to disseminate the first quarterly sectoral accounts and
balance sheets for 2012–14 by 2016.
Price statistics: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Monthly CPI and PPI, both compiled
using the Two-State (Modified) Laspeyres (2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian
Federation. In addition to the general CPI index, Rosstat also publishes indices for foodstuffs,
non-food products, and services. Since September 2010, the Rosstat has also published price
indices broken down according to the Classification of Individual Consumption According to
Purpose (COICOP) on a monthly basis. Detailed CPI weight data have been made available on the
Rosstat website beginning in 2006 and in the publication Prices in Russia beginning in 1995.
Since 2009, detailed consumer expenditure data, used as the basis to develop the CPI weights,
are posted on Rosstat’s website annually. Earlier data on detailed household expenditures have
been published in the following publications: Prices in Russia 2004 and Prices in Russia 2006.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Detailed PPI weight data are published on the Rosstat website for 2006–11: and detailed data on
total annual sales, which are used to develop weights for the PPI, are also published by economic
activity on the website under the Entrepreneurship section, industrial subsection. However, the
detailed weights are available only on the Russian version of the website, making it less
accessible by users. Further efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the core
inflation index and a new household budget survey—which has been under consideration for
some time—could significantly strengthen data quality.
Government finance statistics: For surveillance purposes, the timeliness and level of detail of
the data disseminated can be improved. Since July 2010, data on the economic classification of
expenditures have been published on a monthly basis with a lag of about 1½ months, but
problems with consistent historical data still remain. The data on functional classification of
expenditure and financing differ from international standards. Historical data on the maturity
structure of domestic and external federal debt are not published, except the most recent
observation available through SDDS. Monthly data on the size and composition of ruble
guarantees are not available prior to 2011. Historical monthly data on foreign currency debt are
not available prior to 2009, though quarterly data are available since 2006. In addition, there is
no integrated debt monitoring and reporting system. Reconciliation of different datasets of fiscal
statistics (budget execution, cash flow statement, GFSM 2001 format, SDDS) is difficult. The
website where fiscal statistics are disseminated can be made more user friendly by consolidating
all statistical links in a dedicated data dissemination page, available both in Russian and in
English, and supplementing the data with relevant definitions, description of compilation
methodology, and relevant analytical materials. The authorities are working to address the
recommendations of the 2010 ROSC Data Module Update.
Monetary statistics: Since July 2008, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has provided the IMF, in
the MFSM-recommended format for the surveys, with summarized data on (i) the Central Bank
Survey, (ii) the Other Depository Corporations Survey, (iii) the Depository Corporations Survey,
(iv) the Other Financial Corporation Survey (data cover insurance companies and private pension
funds), and (v) the Financial Corporations Survey (data cover the banking system, insurance
companies, and private pension funds). In the context of the current global turmoil, analysis of
balance sheet effects has been hindered by a lack of comparable data on the currency and
maturity breakdown of banking-sector assets and liabilities. Adoption of data reporting in full
detail of the framework for Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), as recommended by an STA
mission in 2007, would provide information on the currency and instrument breakdowns of the
banking sector assets and liabilities. Starting in July 2010, the CBR includes in the Surveys the
breakdown of positions by currency.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are broadly adequate for surveillance, and
significant improvements have been made to enhance data quality. The CBR has recently
published the gross capital flow data for the private sector, which would facilitate the analysis of
relatively complex flows. However, there still remains scope for improving the coverage of certain
components of the current, capital, and financial accounts. The balance of payments is compiled

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

according to the framework of the Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and
the CBR is actively implementing the recommendations of the BPM6. Partial data from a variety
of sources are supplemented by the use of estimates and adjustments to improve data coverage.
In particular, the CBR makes adjustments to merchandise import data published by the Federal
Customs Service to account for “shuttle trade,” smuggling, and undervaluation. Statistical
techniques are also used to estimate transactions and positions of foreign-owned enterprises
with production sharing agreements, and these techniques are continuously being improved. At
the same time, Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile their data with those of partner
countries. Improvements have been made in the coverage and quality of surveys on direct
investment, and the CBR is participating in the Fund’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey.
Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on a weekly basis with a
four-business day lag. Comprehensive information is reported in the Reserves Template with a
lag of 20 days, exceeding SDDS timeliness requirement of one month.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since January 31, 2005. SDDS
flexibility option used for the timeliness of data on central government operations.
A data ROSC prepared in October 2003 was published on the IMF website on May 14, 2004.
A data ROSC reassessment in June-July 2010 was published on the IMF website on
February 28, 2011 and concluded that Russia’s macroeconomic statistics are generally of high
quality. It found that compiling agencies have made significant progress in adopting
international statistical methodologies and best practices.
III.

Reporting to STA (Optional)

Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. Monetary data reported as the basis for publication in IFS are in the format of
summarized surveys rather than in the full detail of the SRFs that present positions by financial
instrument disaggregated by currency (national and foreign) and the economic sector of
counterparty.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
the Russian Federation

On July 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
Russia’s economic recovery continued in 2011 with growth of 4.3 percent, the same as
in 2010. Economic activity rebounded in the second half of the year on the back of a
favorable harvest and high oil prices. The momentum continued in the first quarter
of 2012 with strong real wage and consumption growth supporting demand.
Unemployment has continued to decline to pre-crisis lows, the capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector has recovered its 2007–08 level, and the output gap is estimated
to now be closed. Inflation has come down significantly in recent months, largely due to
one-off factors, and staff’s measure of core inflation—a good proxy of trend inflation—
remains high at around 6 percent. The current account has strengthened in 2011 aided
by high oil prices, but net capital outflows persist, broadly mirroring the current account
surplus.
Following two years of stagnation, credit growth rebounded strongly in 2011. This partly
reflected a switch by the corporate sector from external to domestic funding. Consumer
credit also grew strongly. On the credit supply side, improving bank balance sheets (with
declining nonperforming loan ratios and improving profitability) and funding conditions

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

(reflecting solid deposit growth and the Central Bank of Russia’s liquidity provision)
allowed for the expansion of lending.
Fiscal policy tightened in 2011, but it remains procyclical. The federal nonoil deficit
declined from 12.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2011. This
improvement was due to both nonoil revenue overperformance and expenditure
underexecution. Some of the windfall oil revenues from 2011 were deposited in the
Reserve Fund in early 2012. However, the 2012 budget implies an increase in the
federal nonoil deficit of about 1 percent of GDP.
The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) tightened monetary policy significantly during 2011,
including by gradually steering the interbank market rate from the CBR deposit rate of
2¾ percent in January to the CBR repo rate of 5¼ percent by the end of the year. Since
then, however, monetary policy has effectively been on hold. Meanwhile, the CBR has
continued to increase exchange rate flexibility as the intervention band was widened
further, and intervention amounts have been relatively modest.
The near-term outlook is for continued moderate growth and a rebound in inflation. Real
growth is projected at around 4 percent in 2012 and 2013, with potential GDP growing at
a slightly lower rate. Inflation is projected to rebound to 6½ percent by end-2012,
reflecting output rising above potential, the base effect, and the delayed increases in
administered prices in mid-2012. The external current account surplus is projected to
decline, amid slightly weaker oil prices. Capital outflows will likely continue, albeit at a
moderating pace.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Russia’s recovery from the 2008–09 crisis and noted that
the output gap is estimated to have been closed. The challenge in the short term is to
manage domestic demand in order to avoid overheating and in the medium term to fully
realize Russia’s significant growth potential by maintaining macroeconomic stability,
further strengthening the policy framework, and making decisive progress on structural
reforms.
Directors recommended an ambitious fiscal consolidation path to reduce overheating
pressures and vulnerabilities and ensure intergenerational equity. Some Directors saw
merit in a cautious approach at the current juncture given the uncertain global
environment. Directors stressed the importance of a strengthened fiscal framework to
anchor medium-term fiscal policy. They welcomed the plan to introduce a new fiscal rule
to decouple the fiscal stance from short-term variations in oil prices, but saw scope for
further improvements to allow for the effective rebuilding of the Reserve Fund. While the
immediate priority would be to unwind crisis-related stimulus, Directors underscored that
durable consolidation will need to be underpinned by structural reforms, including
pension reform.

Directors welcomed the improvements in the monetary policy framework, especially
greater exchange rate flexibility which is helping absorb external shocks and allows
monetary policy to focus on inflation. They noted the significant decline in inflation, but
generally recommended a gradual further tightening of monetary policy to contain
underlying pressures and anchor expectations. Directors also encouraged continued
strengthening of monetary policy tools and enhanced communication policies to prepare
for the successful adoption of formal inflation targeting by 2014.
Directors welcomed the improvements in the financial system and its resilience to a
variety of shocks. They called for continued vigilance with regard to asset quality in the
context of rapid credit growth and volatile oil prices, and commended the authorities’
ongoing efforts to improve financial stability analyses and the macroprudential oversight
framework. Directors called on the authorities to expedite the implementation of FSAP
recommendations that strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework. Important
priorities are the prompt passing of legislation on consolidated supervision and
connected lending and the expansion of the central bank’s powers to use professional
judgment.
Directors underscored that structural reforms are crucial to increase investment,
diversify the economy, and raise potential growth. Welcoming Russia’s accession to the
WTO, they encouraged the authorities to seize this opportunity to strengthen the
momentum for reforms and make the business environment more predictable by
strengthening the rule of law, reducing corruption, and scaling back state involvement in
the economy, including through transparent privatization of state-owned companies.
