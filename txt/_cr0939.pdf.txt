FINLAND
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Finland
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tessa van der Willigen
December 16, 2008
Executive Summary
Although among the best EU performers, Finland’s economy faces important challenges.
Spillovers from the global turmoil are adversely affecting activity and may weaken the financial
system. In the longer term, rapid population aging and slowing productivity weigh down on growth
and fiscal sustainability, while expanding financial integration tests supervision.
From a cyclical perspective, a fiscal structural loosening is warranted. However, its effectiveness
in Finland’s small, open economy would be limited, in the absence of an EU-wide fiscal package. The
authorities were confident that an EU-coordinated budget expansion is in the cards. There was
agreement that loosening should be designed to minimize damage to long-term fiscal sustainability.
Medium-term policies still fall short of ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. A permanent
improvement in the structural primary balance after 2011 of at least 1½ percent of GDP is required.
This gap should be filled soon once the economy recovers for intergenerational equity and to reduce
the needed adjustment, as the authorities recognize. The authorities concurred that, with
comparatively high spending, adjustment should rely mainly on expenditure restraint and improved
efficiency. Tax reform and higher pension fund yields can help too. Government’s plans to lower
labor taxation are appropriate, but staff advised against cutting the food VAT rate.
Though banks have been largely sheltered from the turmoil so far, the impact of a weakening

economy on bank profitability and non-performing loans must be monitored closely.
The authorities also noted that rising household debt, softer house prices, and developments in
funding markets may become a concern. Staff supported authorities’ steps to guarantee bank debt
renewal and recapitalize banks, if needed, as well as their efforts to improve European coordination
and harmonization in deposit insurance and cross-border financial supervision. Both insurance and
pension companies have suffered significantly negative returns this year, and supervisors underscored
the need to step up vigilance of financial conglomerates.
Structural reforms are essential to raise long-term growth and secure fiscal sustainability. With
the working-age population set to decline, the participation rate should be increased, and measures to
increase competition, especially in the “sheltered” sectors of the economy, are required to stimulate
productivity. The authorities were receptive to these suggestions, but emphasized the need to move
cautiously in socially sensitive areas.

I. ECONOMIC SITUATION
1.
Though among the best EU performers, the Finnish economy faces important
challenges. Spillovers from the global turmoil are adversely affecting economic activity
(Figure 1, Table 1). High wage increases have raised the risk of cost pressures that could
maintain inflation above the EU average and erode competitiveness. Looking forward, rapid
aging and slowing productivity threaten longer-term growth, competitiveness, and fiscal
sustainability. Improved pension fund management could help cope with aging, while
growing financial integration and complexity create new risks and supervisory challenges.
2.
Growth was robust in 2007,
but is decelerating fast. It attained a
strong 4½ percent in 2007, with activity
significantly above potential, although
the pace slackened in the second half of
the year. Exports were vigorous early in
the year. Private consumption was
buoyed by high employment growth
and sizable wage awards. Vibrant
corporate investment offset slackening
residential construction. Expansion
slowed sharply in the first three
quarters of 2008, amid declining
consumer and business confidence.

3.
The disappointing outcome of decentralized wage negotiations and a tight labor
market pose inflation risks. With cyclically brisk labor demand, long-called-for
decentralized wage accords in the second half of 2007 provided some firm-level flexibility,
but paid little heed to productivity gains and differentials, including most worryingly in the
public sector. Employment growth has recently slowed, with the unemployment rate
increasing to 6.5 percent in September, but sectoral labor shortages and mismatches persist.

Inflation surged to 4.7 percent in September, greatly exceeding the euro area average. While
this reflects in part excise increases and the energy and food price shocks earlier in the year,
rising unit labor costs and “core” inflation risk fueling persistence of inflation above the euro
area average.

External competitiveness is adequate. In 2006–07, the current account surplus
hovered around a sizable 4–4½ percent of GDP, and is projected to remain broadly
unchanged this year, as decelerating import demand offsets slowing growth among trading
partners, higher average oil prices, and continuing decline in terms of trade (Figure 2,
Table 2). Various measures point to a comfortable competitiveness margin for Finland
(Box 1).
5.
The fiscal position stays enviable, although the surplus is set to drop. The general
government (GG) surplus surged to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2007, buoyed by economic
expansion, strong property revenues (partly a statistical revision), and spending moderation.

Population aging still jeopardizes long-term fiscal sustainability. Its fiscal impact
is large (5½ percent of GDP of additional annual expenditures by 2050, mostly on account of
healthcare and pensions). Finland is well placed to deal with this problem. Indeed, its benign
initial (2007) fiscal position would already be sustainable, were it not for discretionary

Box 1. Finland’s External Competitiveness
External competitiveness is adequate according to most indicators. The current account surplus,
though declining, remains substantial. Standard real effective exchange rate (REER) measures based on
different price or cost indices, after depreciating substantially in the 1990s, have been broadly stable
since 2000. The manufacturing unit-labor-cost-based measure has dropped the most, reflecting relatively
high productivity growth in Finland’s tradable sector. However, the price of Finnish industrial goods
relative to that of trading partners has also been falling. Nevertheless, relative export profitability (the
inverse of the relative labor share) has stayed broadly stable over the last decade. And the net
international investment position (especially when abstracting from the large share of foreign holdings of
domestic equities) has shown a trend improvement (Table 3).

Applying the multilaterally-consistent CGER methodology to Finland suggests moderate real

and (iii) a slightly higher
negative effect of anticipated population aging on domestic saving.
Risks to the external position appear manageable. Recent large wage awards may result in higher
relative unit labor costs and erode competitiveness. Finland’s export base remains narrow, with the
important forest and paper industry under pressure from Russian roundwood export tariffs. The terms of
trade continue their trend decline, with much of domestic productivity gains distributed abroad through
lower export prices. Relatively rapid population aging is expected to reduce domestic saving.
Nonetheless, existing medium-term competitiveness margins appear sufficient to handle these concerns
and prevent significant REER appreciation above its equilibrium value.

government’s term) that imply a sizable

aging would lead to an unsustainable
deterioration of public finances, if not
offset by reduction of aging-related
entitlements, cuts in other spending, or
revenue increases.

Banks have been largely sheltered from the turmoil, but profitability, crosscountry supervision, mortgage lending, and links to insurance companies and foreign
affiliates require attention.
•

Exposure to U.S. subprime assets, U.S. GSEs, and Lehman is minimal. The main
problems related to two Icelandic banks’ small local operations, which have been
resolved. The CDS spreads for the biggest banks (both foreign owned) have widened
and remain volatile, but stayed consistently below those of European peers.

•

Despite some variation across banks, key financial stability indicators remain quite
healthy (Table 5 and Figures 3–4). Returns on equity and capital-adequacy ratios are
high, while loan-loss and cost ratios low. However, lending margins face pressures
from increased competition, although recently banks have moved to increase them.
Softer economic growth, reduced non-operating and fee income, and rising funding
costs herald lower profitability and higher loan losses, albeit from very healthy levels.

•

Banks have exhibited limited risk appetite and prudent underwriting policies. The
decline in the share of customer deposits in recent years has been offset by bonds and
CDs as funding sources, and Finnish banks have maintained good access to interbank
markets. While liquidity has tightened, the domestic interbank market did not freeze
in 2008 and banks even gained some deposits from mutual funds in a flight to safety.
Credit growth held up in the first half of 2008, but declined in the third quarter.

•

Some 60 percent of banking assets are foreign-owned, posing challenges for crossborder supervision.

•

Helsinki stock prices are about 55 percent off their late-2007 peak, comparable to
other European indices, although, with some 60 percent of total capitalization held by
nonresidents, the impact on domestic activity is relatively limited.

•

Housing prices have risen much more moderately in Finland than in many other
European economies. They have slightly declined in real terms in 2008, amid rising

7
mortgage rates earlier in the year and margins more recently. Consumption is unlikely
to be much affected as consumer loans backed by real estate collateral are limited. In
general, mortgage credit standards are prudent, though rising rates, reliance on
floating rates, and relatively high concentration of debt among young borrowers with
low net worth are concerns. Nonetheless, prevalence of fixed monthly payments with
variable maturity and frequent interest rate caps contribute to very low default rates.
•

Household and nonfinancial corporation balance sheets remain strong, although
household debt has risen sizably and enterprise profitability is squeezed by rising
labor costs and energy and commodity prices (Figure 5). Given the uncertainties and
costs of bond market access, corporate reliance on bank funding has increased.

•

Insurance and pension companies have suffered significant losses owing to the
plummeting capital markets. While minimum solvency ratios are met, margins have
declined considerably1 , underscoring the need to step up vigilance over financial
conglomerates. Life premia are stagnating, though the share of unit-linked life
products is increasing, which could over time lower insurance sector risks.

Structural progress continues, but at slower pace. Reforms led to sizable
employment gains in recent years, with the unemployment rate now below the EU average.
Nevertheless, employment rates for the elderly and—especially—youth lag behind those in
other Nordic economies, amid growing labor mismatches and still high structural
unemployment (Figure 6). Productivity growth has been sluggish in the sheltered sectors
(agriculture, utilities, and trade), and even declining in local government (LG) social
services. Steps to ease such constraints—to activate the labor force and stimulate competition
in product markets—have been largely confined in 2007–08 to implementation of previously
adopted measures.

Finnish statutory pension funds are buffer funds within the PAYG system. A lower buffer increases the
probability of future rises in contribution rates, but does not mean insolvency of a pension provider.

II. OUTLOOK
9.
The economy is slowing in 2008–09 amid dwindling domestic demand and a
flagging external environment. Growth is projected to decelerate to about 2 percent in 2008
and further to ½ percent in 2009, owing mainly to lingering effects of the global turbulence. 2
Lower activity in a number of major trading partners will reduce export expansion, hit also
by Russian export tariffs on roundwood. Sluggish employment growth, the erosion of real
disposable income by higher inflation, higher debt servicing, and falling consumer
confidence will constrain consumption. Capital formation is projected to brake for cyclical
reasons, tightening profit margins, worsening expectations, and rising financing costs. Staff
estimates a cumulative direct impact of financial tightening on 2008–09 growth at
¾ percentage points. 3 Inflation is expected to peak at about 4 percent in 2008, before falling
back in 2009, as the pass-through of earlier food and fuel price surges (and excise hikes)
fades, aided by a late-2009 cut in food VAT.

Uncertainties regarding the
outlook are high, with risks
broadly balanced. Main risks
include deviations from the baseline
in: (i) lending conditions or housing
and equity prices, that could affect
domestic demand; (ii) oil prices;
(iii) external demand spillovers;
(iv) the value of the euro; and
(v) labor market situation (the sharp
acceleration of inflation may trigger
cost pressures and erode
competitiveness, but poorer
employment prospects could dampen
this concern). Upside and downside
outcomes for these risk factors are
deemed equally probable, but their
dispersion is unusually pronounced,
in light of uncertainties concerning
the impact of the global financial
distress on real activity.

The chart includes the following risks to the projections of growth (2.1 percent in
2008 and 0.6 percent in 2009):
• changes in tightness of financial conditions;
• changes in foreign demand;
• variations in oil prices;
• changes in the value of the euro;
• changes in the labor market situation.
These risks are weighted by the staff's subjective probability assessment of their
occurrence.

1/ Both the level of the FCI and the direction of recent changes have implications for economic activity. For example, a value of 1 means
that the total impulse of financial conditions to GDP is one percentage point, annualized. A decline in the FCI from 1 to 1/2 would be
expected to reduce GDP growth by 1/2 percentage point, but the contribution still would be positive. See Appendix I for more details.

10
11.
In the longer term, rapid
aging and sluggish productivity are
important risks for potential
growth and competitiveness. Trend
productivity growth is declining in
Finland, while imminent population
aging will shrink working-age
cohorts. Therefore, raising the
employment rate and stimulating
productivity—especially in the
service sector with a lackluster
productivity record—are key for longrun growth and competitiveness.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Against this background, discussions focused on fiscal policy, financial sector
issues, and structural reform. Specifically:
•

the appropriate short-term budget policy;

•

ensuring fiscal sustainability through growth-friendly tax and expenditure policies;

•

maintaining stability and raising efficiency of the financial sector—in a context of
global market tensions and rising volatility;

•

reforming labor and product markets to enhance competition and utilization of soonto-be shrinking labor force.
A. Fiscal Policy

13.
With fading economic expansion, policy makers have shifted priority to support
growth through fiscal policy. Following a substantial improvement in the GG structural
balances during 2004–07, the 2009 budget and accompanying medium-term plan envisage a

2050

11
decline in the structural primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP from 2008 to 2011. A fiscal
impulse equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP is estimated for 2009 alone, with further cuts
on labor taxes at the beginning of next year (brought forward for cyclical reasons), and a
reduction in the VAT rate on food from 17 to 12 percent in October 2009.
14.
Staff saw merit in the relaxation envisaged by the authorities as part of an EUwide fiscal stimulus package. It recognized that, from a cyclical perspective, given negative
output gaps envisaged for 2009–12, there is scope for a discretionary budgetary impulse.
Nevertheless, staff noted that, especially with a tight labor market, the effectiveness of
demand-enhancing measures in Finland’s small, open economy would be limited if done in
isolation. It also cautioned that:

some budgetary margins must be preserved, should the acute global crisis require
fiscal interventions by Finland to recapitalize distressed financial institutions.

On balance, staff thought that the structural loosening planned by the government was
appropriate, in the context of a harmonized EU fiscal package. The authorities were confident
that a coordinated budget expansion at the EU level was in the cards and its size may be similar
to that envisaged for Finland, while bank recapitalization will not be needed.
15.
There was agreement that the fiscal stimulus should be designed to minimize the
negative impact on the long-term budget position. This required the stimulus to rely on
actions that reduce economic distortions or can be implemented swiftly and clawed back
quickly once growth prospects improve. Specifically, rapidly implementable infrastructure
projects―e.g. through public support of social housing construction projects halted by
emergence of liquidity constraints for contractors―and earned-income tax cuts to promote
labor force participation (¶22) were preferable.
16.
The authorities concurred that medium-term budget policies still fall
significantly short of ensuring long-term sustainability. Given the expected increase in
aging-related spending (¶6), to ensure sustainability, the GG structural primary balance after

1/ Projections differ from those in the previous staff report reflecting latest developments in the fiscal
position of the government, changes in the medium-term policy plans and their estimated impact, and a revision
in demographic projections.
2/ Based on IMF staff projections for 2008-13, and influenced by Stability Program projections thereafter.
Other assumptions include: average real GDP grow th at 2 percent till 2020, and 1.4 percent thereafter; real
interest rate at 3 percent; employment rate increasing to 74 percent by 2030 (from about 69 percent in 2006);
labor productivity grow ing by 2 percent up to 2020, and by 1.8 percent thereafter. The baseline and alternate
baseline projections correspond to sustainability gaps of 2½ percent and 1½ percent of GDP, respectively.
3/ The level of net assets in the staff adjustment scenario is endogenous and results from the requirement
that the structural primary balance in 2013 be set to maintain a net debt (or assets) ratio that is eventually
constant despite the increase in aging costs.

13
2011 should be permanently higher than in the current policies path by 1½–2½ percent of
GDP—the fiscal sustainability gap. The gap would be even larger if structural relaxation is
more than now anticipated. Staff recommended filling the gap as early as possible once the
economy recovers, because front-loaded fiscal retrenchment is desirable for intergenerational
equity and to contain the size of the required tightening, as accepted also by the authorities.
17.
Officials stressed that expenditure restraint is the lynchpin of adjustment, but
tax reform and improved management of pension assets can support it. The expenditureto-GDP ratio in Finland is already comparatively high and will rise further due to aging, thus
containment of government spending is a priority (¶18–21). Taxation of earned income is
quite heavy with the marginal rate for the average wage exceeding 40 percent, which
discourages employment and labor force participation. Thus, lowering labor taxation would
promote growth—and possibly help fiscal sustainability, if accompanied by a broadening of
the bases of less distortionary levies (¶22). Higher returns on pension assets could also limit
the sustainability gap (¶23).

Measures to contain demand for public services and increase competition in
their provision were identified. Competition can kindle response to customer preferences
and improve efficiency by raising cost awareness. Accordingly, in line with staff
recommendations, the authorities will continue to:
•

increase recourse to user charges for public services, thus relying more on price
mechanisms to regulate demand, provide signals to suppliers to improve service
delivery, and facilitate competition among providers;

•

encourage contracting out, outsourcing, and well-designed public-private
partnerships, especially in areas like institutional and home-care for the elderly and
day-care for children, where the private sector may have a comparative advantage
relative to local entities.

20.
In addition, it was not disputed that it would be useful to improve the budgetary
discipline of LGs. Specifically, staff counseled to adopt CPI-based rather than cost-based
indexation for CG transfers to LGs and to strengthen the agreement with the association of
LGs so as to extend expenditure ceilings to LGs. The authorities were skeptical about the
LGs willingness to accept those changes.
21.
The authorities are considering further social security reform to increase the still
low effective retirement age. Early versions of the proposals by a working committee,
which must be submitted to the government by early 2009, are broadly in line with past Fund
advice. Specifically, they aim to: (i) restrict use of the unemployment pipeline (which in
practice provides early retirement from age 57), stepping up activation measures for the older

15
unemployed; (ii) tighten control on access to disability pensions; and (iii) strengthen early
medical and vocational rehabilitation.
22.
Tax reform should contribute to fiscal sustainability also. The government is
committed to lowering taxes on labor and the VAT rate on food. Staff concurred that
moderating labor taxes should

boost labor participation and
growth, and therefore can benefit
long-term fiscal sustainability.
However, it advised against the
VAT cut—because the VAT is
among the least distortionary
taxes and revenue losses must be
minimized for sustainability’s
sake. Indeed, staff argued that the
base of the Finnish VAT should
be broadened, considering that its
effectiveness is barely at the
OECD average with special
treatments for a relatively large
share of goods and services.

The authorities target an increase of the long-term real return on pension fund
assets. Raising it to 4 percent a year (from the 3 percent assumed in the baseline
sustainability scenario) would reduce the GG deficit in 2050 by 3 percentage points of GDP.
To facilitate this objective, in 2007, the investment guidelines for pension funds were eased.
Staff proposed additional steps (¶31).
B. Financial Sector
24.
While confirming the resilience of Finnish banks to market turmoil so far, the
authorities pointed out several concerns. Risks relating to toxic assets, derivatives,
liquidity, or off-balance-sheet exposure appear moderate. However, the ongoing turbulence

16
does affect banks indirectly through lower growth, and thus less profitability and higher non
performing loans. Though reliance on covered bonds and securitization is limited, bonds and
CDs are increasingly important funding sources for major Finnish banks and may become
more expensive. Also, losses on group insurance and asset management activities and the
banks’ global operations (especially in the Nordic-Baltic region) could be sources of
unexpected contagion and need to be watched carefully. Accordingly, officials saw the need
to monitor insurance capital and cover ratios closely and ensuring proactive recapitalization
where necessary.
25.
Officials are vigilant about mortgages and consumer lending in light of the runup in household debt. House price rise has been less worrisome than in other countries,
households’ net worth is robust, and debt servicing is historically low. Thus, the slowing
economy and higher unemployment may be a bigger concern than current
weaknesses in household balance sheets. In this context, supervisors stressed the need
for alert scrutiny of weakening home prices and credit risks in specific sectors such as
high loan-to-value loans to young borrowers.
26.
Diversification of banks’ wholesale funding was seen as a positive development.
Despite a sound mortgage portfolio, both covered bonds or securitization remain rare.
Mortgage-covered bonds can be issued only by dedicated mortgage banks, and only two
banks have so far set up such special vehicles. Staff argued that this provision could be
relaxed. The authorities observed that securitization is small in part due to excessive product
customization. The larger banks are now considering to develop securitization as a strategic
funding source to preserve capital and boost return on equity. Staff encouraged officials to
support the process through voluntary industry-led standardization and facilitating a dialogue
between banks and potential investors. There was agreement that these steps were useful, but
gradualism was of the essence, given unfavorable market conditions and the need for market
participants to acquaint themselves with the new instruments.
27.
Staff supported the authorities’ measures to buttress the financial sector. In
keeping with euro area agreements, Finland raised its deposit insurance to €50,000,
announced a €50 billion fund to guarantee the rollover of term debt issued by banks (subject
to compensation on commercial terms and with maximum maturity of five years), and
proposed a bank recapitalization fund of €4 billion. Staff urged prompt passage of the related
legislation and regulations. It also endorsed the authorities’ intention to implement these
measures without distorting competition among Finnish banks.

adequacy.
29.
The authorities have made good progress in expanding the scope of stress tests,
but further improvements were identified. Supervisors concurred that future tests
should aim to: (i) cover more thoroughly market risks, such as valuation losses, counterparty
risks, risk concentration, and strategic risks relating to liquidity and new capital issuance;
(ii) integrate more completely the insurance sector; and (iii) explore procyclicality implicit in
capital adequacy measures under Basle II.
30.
Supervisors acknowledged that, while financially sound, the insurance sector is
facing the impact of the global crisis and stagnation in some lines. Solvency levels for
insurance companies were strong and improving until mid-June 2007, but have dropped
significantly after the steep market declines in 2008. Finnish insurers’ premium growth
leveled off in 2007, with falling premia in the life segment in recent years. Accordingly, the
authorities noted concerns relating to: (i) the impact of insurers’ potential problems on
related groups; and (ii) possible saturation of the life market.
31.
Pension funds appear in good financial health, but officials may evaluate further
reforms to cope with changing demographics. The 2005 reforms have significantly
improved the system’s long-term stability, but have resulted in linking benefits to life
expectancy and other considerable risk-sharing by the employees. 4 Thus, with high and
uncapped contribution rates, officials expressed interest in exploring the merits of gradually
raising funding levels and introducing a defined-contribution (DC) component option—while
preserving an adequate minimum means-tested pension and defined-benefit (DB) component
up to a replacement rate target determined by societal preferences on intergenerational risk
sharing. A DC component could help raise long-term returns, thereby easing adjustment to
future demographic or investment return shocks and aiding fiscal sustainability. The
authorities were broadly receptive of suggestions to: (i) integrate administration and
investment functions across funds, notably those of local and central governments; and
(ii) fine-tune solvency regulations to reflect better the PAYG nature of the pension system.

4

Any increases in contributions in private sector plans will be borne by employers and employees equally.

18
32.
The authorities are committed to strengthen cross-border supervision. Already
well regarded, Finnish financial market supervision should further improve efficiency and
effectiveness with the merger of the Financial Supervisory Authority and the Insurance
Supervisor. The authorities are satisfied with their cooperation with Swedish and Danish
counterparts. Nonetheless, the still evolving harmonization of EU regulations and supervision
for large multinational institutions remains an important concern, as underscored by recent
Icelandic and Benelux cases. Officials concurred that further clarification of supervisory and
fiscal responsibility of home-host authorities in crisis resolution was a priority. Similarly,
supervisors deemed helpful to: (i) use supervisory colleges for both subsidiaries and
significant branches; (ii) improve harmonization and clarity about operation of deposit
insurance schemes, especially in the wake of its significant recent expansion; and
(iii) develop common criteria for intervention in troubled institutions. While these measures
should be pursued at the EU level, it was agreed that an eventual move towards a more
integrated European supervisory structure, at least for the major cross-border institutions,
would be opportune.
33.

The authorities reiterated their interest in an FSAP update for early 2010.
C. Structural Policies

34.
There was consensus that labor and product market reforms are needed to
stimulate growth. In particular, with the working-age population set to decline after 2010,
boosting potential growth (and achieving fiscal sustainability) will require further labor force
activation measures. 5 Measures to enhance competition in product markets could raise
productivity growth. With respect to Fund recommendations (Table 7), progress continued
although largely restricted to realizing past legislative or regulatory reforms. To address the
lack of wage differentiation in the recent decentralized agreements, social partners are
considering improvements to stress the linkage with productivity increases, including
changing the order in which categories embark in negotiations. The government will also
apply moral suasion on social partners to seek more moderate outcomes from the next wage
bargaining round and some agreements may be reopened.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
While a strong performer recently, the Finnish economy faces the headwind of
the international crisis and important structural challenges. Banks and other financial
institutions have been resilient to the global turmoil so far, but spillovers from the persistent
upheaval will take a severe toll on growth and may exacerbate weaknesses in the financial
system. Inflation has picked up, with high wage increases raising the risk of cost pressures that
keep inflation above the EU average. Uncertainties about the outlook are unusually high owing to
5

19
the global crisis. Looking forward, rapid population aging and slowing productivity threaten
longer-term growth and fiscal sustainability. Deepening financial integration and complexity
create new risks and test supervision.

36.
External competitiveness is comfortable at present. Competitiveness margins have
declined since the previous consultation—reflecting also higher energy and commodity
prices. Nevertheless, they appear sufficient to handle pressures from aging and the secular
decline in terms-of-trade, although risks are exacerbated by the recent high wage awards.
37.
From a cyclical perspective a fiscal structural loosening is warranted, but it
should avoid damaging the long-term budget position. With a tight labor market, the
effectiveness of demand-enhancing measures in Finland’s small, open economy is limited.
Thus, the relaxation contemplated in the 2009 budget is suitable, in the context of joint action
at the EU level. The impulse should rely on measures that reduce distortions―such as the
proposed labor-income tax cuts that promote labor force participation―or can be
implemented swiftly and reversed rapidly once growth prospects improve. In addition,
budgetary margins must be preserved, in case the global crisis requires fiscal interventions to
recapitalize distressed financial institutions.
38.
Long-term fiscal sustainability is still elusive. Relative to the authorities’ mediumterm policies, a permanent improvement in the structural primary balance after 2011 of at
least 1½ percent of GDP is needed to stabilize net public debt in light of the budgetary costs
of aging. This gap should be filled as soon as the economy recovers to contain the size of the
fiscal correction and distribute the burden more equitably across generations.
39.
The main pillar of fiscal sustainability is expenditure restraint, but tax reform
and higher pension fund yields can help.
•

The bulk of the needed adjustment should rely on containment of spending since the
public-expenditure-to-GDP ratio in Finland remains comparatively high. More
efficient government programs could lower markedly expenditure rises from aging
without harming service provision. To improve productivity, further enhancements to
benchmarking could help identify best practices. Increasing resort to user charges and
greater recourse to contracting out, outsourcing, and well-designed public-private
partnerships could make an important contribution as well.

•

Lower earned income taxes can promote higher labor force participation―and
possibly aid fiscal sustainability, if accompanied by broadening the base of less
distortionary levies, especially the VAT. In this context, cutting the VAT rate on food
is not advisable. It would be useful to increase property taxation, low in international
comparison. To lift the real long-term return on pension assets, a defined contribution
pension option and a greater degree of funding could be considered.

The brunt of continuing capital market turbulence on bank profits and financial
conglomerates bears watching.
•

Lending growth and profitability have declined, and liquidity has become tighter,
though loan losses and capital adequacy remain at healthy levels. Rising household
debt, softer house prices, mortgage concentration in weak borrower segments,
developments in funding markets, and the impact of a weakening economy on bank
profitability and non-performing loans must be monitored closely.

•

Both insurance and pension companies have been hit particularly hard by the global
crisis. While minimum solvency ratios are met, margins have declined considerably,
underscoring the need to step up vigilance over possible contagion to banks in
financial conglomerates.

•

The authorities’ actions to guarantee bank debt renewal and recapitalize banks, if
needed, are appropriate and related legislation and regulations should be passed
promptly. Their intention to implement these measures without distorting competition
among Finnish banks is commendable.

41.
Strengthened cooperation with supervisors abroad is crucial in a majority
foreign-owned banking system. The authorities’ efforts toward further clarification of
supervisory and fiscal responsibility of home-host authorities in crisis resolution deserve
strong support. Progress is also important towards broader use of supervisory colleges and
better harmonization of deposit insurance and criteria for intervention in distressed banks,
and the eventual creation of a more integrated European supervisory structure for major
cross-border institutions.
42.
With fast population aging, raising labor utilization and productivity is essential
to boost living standards and support fiscal sustainability. Steps to strengthen activation
of the unemployed and partially disabled, shorten time spent in tertiary education, improve
training and reduce labor market mismatches, and lessen poverty traps will continue to be
crucial. The next round of wage bargaining ought to reflect productivity increases and
differentials to stem rising unit labor costs. Measures to raise competition, above all in
“sheltered” sectors of the economy, are required to enhance productivity growth.
43.
The next Article IV consultation will be held on a 24-month cycle. Finland is a
non-systemic country, with stable economic and financial conditions, and without
outstanding Fund credit or pressing policy issues of broad interest to the Fund membership.
Hence, the authorities agreed to move consultations to a 24-month cycle, with an interim
staff visit.

Past Staff Recommendations

Implementation

Fiscal Policy
Although the general government surplus has been sizable in
recent years, the overall fiscal position under current policies
remains unsustainable. Efforts should focus on expenditure
restraint, especially at the local level, in light of high tax rates.
The efficiency of public services needs to be raised. It may be
necessary to further revisit the pension system's parameters.

Significant reforms in the pension system were adopted in 2005, with a life expectancy coefficient to
be applied from 2009. The multi-year expenditure rule was reformed to increase its effectiveness.
Efforts to improve expenditure efficiency are being implemented, with greater success to date at the
central government level. Intergovernmental financing rules are being revised and measures to
encourage municipal mergers have been adopted.

Labor Market Policy
The wage bargaining system needs to allow for greater
flexibility in wage setting. Measures are needed to ease labor
market mismatches, reduce structural unemployment, and
induce earlier entry into the labor force. Various "pipelines" to
early labor force departure need to be further curtailed.

Financial Sector Policy
Strengthen financial sector stability, especially regarding
cross-country supervision, and improve stress testing
techniques.

Competition Authority's powers have been enhanced to more directly address anti-competitive
behavior, and the new government has formed a working group to review existing competition
legislation. Research has been launched to assess developments in competition, specifically in the
service sector. Companies and Auditing Acts amended to make it easier to set up new companies
and reduce administrative burdens, and a national action plan is to be introduced for better
regulation. Government goal adopted to increase R&D to 4 percent of GDP and make better use of
ICT, and promote innovation. Implementation of the EU services directive began in 2007.
Good progress has been made in expanding the scope of stress tests. Cooperation has been
enhanced with foreign supervisors regarding foreign-owned Finnish financial institutions.
Supervisors are also working closely with market participants and foreign supervisors to improve
supervision of an increasingly cross-border "infrastructure." Merger of Financial Supervisory
Authority and Insurance Supervisory Authority to take effect in 2009.

http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=21258.0).

28

Competition Policy
Strengthen competition in product markets, especially in
"sheltered" sectors, to boost productivity growth.

Employment gains under previous government exceeded its target, and Lisbon strategy
employment targets (overall, women and older workers) are already met. Centralized bargaining
was not in force in the current wage negotiations. Labor tax rates have been cut generally, with
additional specific reductions targeted for older, less productive workers. These cuts are to be
extended notably to young labor market entrants. Tax incentives and subsidies have been created
for labor-intensive services, home care and service work and to promote occupational and regional
labor mobility. New Ministry of Employment and the Economy formed to ensure more effective
cooperation of economic, industrial and labor policies. Labor force service centers have been
established for the hard-to-employ. The unemployment pension is to be phased out from 2009, and
the "unemployment pipeline" was tightened to begin from age 57. A tripartite working group has
been established to recalibrate the balance between flexibility and security ("flexicurity"). Another
group was established to initiate a comprehensive social security reform to promote work
incentives, reduce poverty and ensure adequate basic security.

Appendix I. Financial-Real Sector Linkages in Finland 6
1.
As discussed in the main text of this report, the impact of the global financial
turmoil on the Finnish banking sector’s performance has so far been limited.
Furthermore, credit growth has remained robust. Indeed, lending to non-financial enterprises
accelerated to about 21 percent at end-September 2008, from about 8 percent at end-2006, in
part reflecting the uncertainties and increased costs of enterprises’ bond market access
(Figure A1). 7

1/ Households also include non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations also
include housing corporations.

2.
To assess the (direct) impact of the expected slowdown and ongoing global
financial turmoil on credit availability and GDP growth, we use a three-pronged
approach. First, we build a financial conditions index (FCI), using vector autoregressions
(VAR) and impulse-response functions (IRF). Second, we estimate a disequilibrium model of
a system of equations for the supply of and demand for credits. Third, we estimate the impact
of credit growth on GDP growth, using simple correlations and VAR. 8
6

Prepared by Etibar Jafarov (EUR).

7

Data on corporate lending should be interpreted with caution. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these data are
distorted by enterprises continuing to draw on pre-crisis credit lines.

8

The first analysis follows the methodology used by Swiston, Bayoumi, and Mathai (2008). The main
advantage of a VAR-based FCI with respect to other methodologies is that it accounts for both direct and
indirect impact of shocks to financial variables on economic activity. The second and third analyses are similar
to those in Pazarbaşioğlu (1997) and Čihák and Koeva Brooks (2008), accordingly.

36
3.
The results indicate that the financial cycle has turned, but there was no “credit
crunch” in Finland as of September 2008. Tightening in financial conditions so far in
2007–08 is expected to reduce real GDP growth in 2008–09 by about ¾ percentage point, but
this seems to be mainly related to demand factors such as weak economic activity, rather than
supply factors such as capital destruction, balance sheet constraints, lack of access to market
liquidity, and banks’ unwillingness to provide credits (as observed in some other developed
economies). Indeed, the estimation of the equations for the supply of and demand for credits
in Section B of this appendix suggests that (1) credit supply in 2008 was above the levels
predicted by the model and (2) demand for loans has weakened. In addition, the estimations
in Section C suggest that loan supply alone had limited impact on growth in Finland. One
implication of these findings for policy-making could be that, in the absence of further
shocks, Finland may not need a big package of bank recapitalization and that the fiscal
stimulus to support growth is good also for the financial sector.
4.
Nevertheless, the outlook for credit quality bears watching, as activity is
expected to further weaken. While interest rates have increased globally, growth in both
exports and domestic demand are expected to slow down significantly. Gross household debt
has risen above disposable income, which, together with floating rates, suggests that
vulnerability to adverse shocks has increased over the past few years, even though debtservicing costs remain low.
A. VAR-Based FCI
5.
The FCI aggregates the impulse responses of GDP to a number of financial
variables in a VAR model.
•

First, to identify shocks, we use the Cholesky decomposition of the residuals and the
following variables (in levels): real GDP ( y t ); GDP deflator ( def t ); distance-todefault ( dtd t ); three-month HELIBOR ( Rt ); real effective exchange rate ( reert ); and
real equity return ( ert ). The choice of variables is determined by economic and
statistical significance of variables and data availability. 9 In addition, we took into
account the results of other studies of financial conditions, including Gauthier,
Graham, and Liu (2004), Goodhart and Hoffman (2002), and Swiston, Bayoumi, and
Mathai (2008). Thus, the VAR model we estimate can be written as follows:
A( L) z t = α + et

9

Future studies on this subject will significantly benefit from including data on bank lending surveys in
Finland, which were not available to us at the time of writing this appendix.

(1)

37
Where z t = ( y t , def t , dtd t , Rt , reert , ert )' , α is a vector of constants, and et is a vector
of error terms. 10 The estimated responses of variables to the shocks are mostly as
expected. For example, increases in interest rates and real effective exchange rate
appreciation reduce real GDP (Figure A2).

Then, the FCI is estimated as in the following equation:

FCI t = ∑ ⎢r t , j + ∑ (r t , j − r t −1, j )⎥

⎦

(2)

where r’s are the responses of GDP to each variable in the VAR, the j’s index the
variables, and the i’s index the time period. The term in brackets measures the impact
on GDP in quarter t of a financial shock occurring in the previous period. Since the
variables in the system are expressed in levels, the marginal impact of a shock that
occurred before the previous quarter is measured by subtracting the shock’s effect on

10

A different order of the elements in vector z was also used, but the main conclusions do not change.

38
the level of GDP in the previous period from its effect on the level of GDP in the
current period.

It is worth noting that both the level of the FCI and the direction of recent changes
have implications for economic activity. For example, a value of 1 means that the
total impulse of financial conditions to GDP is 1 percentage point, annualized. A
decline in the FCI from 1 to ½ would be expected to reduce GDP growth by
½ percentage point, but the contribution still would be positive.

6.
The estimated FCI suggests that the financial cycle has turned (Figure A3). The
FCI was in negative territory in 2002–03, due to lingering effects of real exchange
appreciation, increases in the interbank market rates, and stock market declines in 2000–02,
meaning that it dragged GDP growth down in that period. It was generally in positive
territory from early 2004 to late 2007, due mainly to declines in interbank market rates,
contributing to GDP growth, and re-entered negative territory in 2008, owing to higher
interest rates, lagged effects of real exchange appreciation, and the reversal of earlier stock
price gains. Compared with 2007, the financial conditions are expected to reduce growth by
about ¾ percent in 2008–09 (in the absence of further shocks). The analysis also suggests
that changes in interest rates and the real effective exchange rate account for most of the
changes in the FCI. On the other hand, the contribution of distance-to-default, used to
approximate banks’ willingness to provide credits, to the FCI is small.

B. Disequilibrium Model of a System of Equations for the
Supply of and Demand for Credits
7.
A disequilibrium model is estimated to identify the factors determining credit
growth as well as excessive demand and supply of credits. The model consists of a system

39
of equations for the supply and demand of credit. A general-to-specific approach yields the
following equations.

where, ls stands for loan supply in real terms; m3 for broad money in real terms; spb/sp for the
banking sector share price relative to the market average; dtd for distance-to-default; y for
real GDP; mar for margin; ld for demand for loans in real terms; i for lending rate in real
terms; and ut for shocks. 11
8.
The results portend that there was no generalized “credit crunch” in Finland in
September 2008. Specifically, growth in credit supply was above the levels predicted by the
model. On the other hand, there was some excess growth in demand for loans in 2002–05,
but that largely disappeared in 2008 (Figure A4). These results should be interpreted with
caution since this analysis does not take into account other credit channels such as the bond
market (Figure A5). Furthermore, we estimate supply of and demand for loans in aggregate
terms. It is quite possible that some enterprises and households that would qualify for credits
before the financial turmoil have had difficulty to obtain loans after the turmoil began.
C. Impact of Credit on GDP Growth

9.
Bank loans seem to have a limited impact on GDP growth in Finland. We
estimated the impact of loan growth on output, using both simple and instrumental variable
regression, as well as the VAR technique. The coefficients on loan supply growth are
11

Variables are in first differences since some variables appear to have unit roots. We found two cointegrating
relationships between loans, GDP, lending rates, and distance-to-default, but these relationships were not
statistically significant and were dropped out of equations 3 and 4. Also, we separately estimated similar
equations for supply of and demand for loans to enterprises and households, but the results were not
significantly different from those reported here.

40
consistently small, and the variable is not statistically significant (Tables A1, A2, and A3),
hinting that, in the recent past, loan growth has been of relatively little importance in
explaining growth in Finland. 12 13

The finding that bank loans have a limited impact on GDP growth does not contradict the conclusion in the
previous section that the increases in interbank lending rates would contribute to the reduction in GDP growth
in 2008-09. First, higher interbank rates account for less than half of the estimated impact of tighter financial
conditions on GDP growth. In other words, the higher interbank lending rates would reduce GDP growth by
only ¼ percent. Second, bank borrowing is not the only channel for enterprises (especially for large enterprises)
to borrow funds. Third, lending rates may affect investment and consumption decisions even in the absence of
borrowing. For example, lending rates are taken into account in the calculation of the cost of capital even when
enterprises use their own funds to invest (in Finland, the corporate sector has been a net lender in the last five
years). Finally, a cumulative impact of financial conditions of growth of ¾ percent of GDP over two years
doesn’t appear large.
13

Driscoll (2004) finds that loans have “small, often negative and statistically insignificant” effects on output in
the USA. On the other hand, Čihák and Koeva Brooks (2008) find that a 10 percent increase in loan supply
raises GDP growth by about 1 percentage point in the euro area.

D. Conclusions

10.
We conclude that financial conditions in Finland have tightened, but this
outcome was not related to supply-side problems as in some other developed economies.
On the one hand, the analysis in Section A of this appendix suggests that financial conditions
have stiffened, which is expected to reduce real GDP growth in 2008–09 by about
¾ percentage points. However, this is mainly related to the increases in interbank market
rates since mid-2007 and lingering effects of real exchange appreciation, with no significant
contribution from the distance-to-default (used here as a proxy for banks’ willingness to
provide credits). On the other hand, the estimate of the disequilibrium model of a system of
equations for the supply of and demand for loans in Section B suggest that (1) credit supply
in September 2008 was above the levels predicted by the model and (2) there was excess
demand for loans in 2003–07, but that excess demand has disappeared since then. These
findings are consistent with the facts that Finnish banks are well capitalized, have largely
maintained their access to interbank market, and have a strong deposit base. Indeed, both
deposits and corporate lending of Finnish banks surged in the first three quarters of 2008.
Moreover, the analysis in Section C suggests that bank lending has had so far limited impact
on GDP growth in Finland. These conclusions imply that, in the absence of further shocks,

43
Finland may not need a big bank recapitalization package, as some other developed
economies, and that the adopted fiscal stimulus to support growth is good also for the
financial sector.
Our findings also suggest that the outlook for credit quality remains uncertain,
11.
since both external and domestic demand are expected to decelerate further.
Widespread recourse to floating rates has increased vulnerability to adverse shocks over the
past few years, even though debt-servicing costs remain low, and this risk may be
exacerbated by weaker economic activity.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 30, 2009
1.
This statement summarizes economic developments in Finland since issuance of
the staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Economic growth contracted sharply at the end of 2008, while inflation is
decelerating more slowly than in other euro area economies.
•

Seasonally adjusted output fell by 1.6 percent year-on-year in October 2008.
Industrial production plunged by about 10 percent year-on-year in November, with a
near-collapse in the wood and paper industry. New orders for manufacturing were off
by one-third. Consumer confidence in December dropped to its lowest level since the
early 1990s. Accordingly, staff has pared down the estimate of 2008 GDP growth to
1½ percent.

•

The harmonized (HICP) inflation rate declined to 3.4 percent in December.
Nevertheless, it remains well above the 1.6 percent euro area average, a gap that has
widened throughout the fall. Nominal hourly wages accelerated further to 6.7 percent
in the third quarter, well above the 4 percent euro area average.

3.
Staff has further lowered its growth projections for 2009 and 2010, to -1 and
1¼ percent respectively. The revision reflects lower activity among trading partners as well
as reduced domestic demand. It is in line with revisions to the euro area projections in the
context of the January interim WEO update. With worse-than-envisaged terms of trade and
exports decelerating faster than imports, the external current account surplus in 2009 and the
medium term is expected to shrink more than anticipated by the staff report.
4.
Amid a deteriorating economic environment, the Finnish authorities have
adopted a number of budgetary measures to support activity. In addition to the tax cuts
already included in the draft 2009 budget and noted in the staff report, the government has
decided to raise spending, including for building construction and renovation, and for
infrastructure projects in transport and energy. The overall package of discretionary
loosening is estimated at about 1¼ percent of GDP. Owing also to the worsened growth
outlook, the headline surplus is now projected to decrease to 1¼ percent of GDP in 2009.
5.
The financial sector remains under stress, but appears to be comparatively
resilient. Banks’ capital adequacy remains well above minimum levels. Banks have not
needed to make use of government guarantees for debt issuance, nor has any governmentfunded recapitalization been necessary. Lending conditions are reported to have tightened,
but credit growth remained robust through October, although this may be partly due to a
sluggish corporate bond market.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Finland
On January 30, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Finland.1
Background
Although among the best EU performers, the Finnish economy faces important
challenges. Spillovers from the global turmoil are adversely affecting activity and may
weaken the financial system. High wage increases have raised the risk of a wage-price
spiral that could maintain inflation above the EU average and erode competitiveness.
Looking forward, rapid aging and slowing productivity threaten longer-term growth,
competitiveness, and fiscal sustainability. Improved pension fund management could
help cope with aging, while growing financial integration and complexity create new risks
and supervisory challenges.
While growth was robust in 2007, with activity significantly above potential, expansion
slowed sharply in the first three quarters of 2008. Growth is projected to decelerate to
about 2 percent in 2008 and further to ½ percent in 2009. Amid a flagging external
environment, sluggish employment growth, the erosion of real disposable income by
higher inflation and debt servicing, squeezed profit margins, and rising financing costs
will restrain both consumption and investment. The cumulative direct impact of financial
tightening on 2008–09 growth is estimated at ¾ percentage points.
A tight labor market and the disappointing outcome of decentralized wage negotiations,
with little heed paid to productivity gains and differentials, contributed to boost inflation in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

late 2008 to 4¾ percent, well above the euro zone average. Rising unit labor costs and
“core inflation” risk swelling inflationary expectations, fueling second-round effects from
the price hike, although worsening job prospects may temper this concern. With lower
fuel prices, inflation is anticipated to recede slowly. Various estimates suggest that
external competitiveness is adequate. The current account surplus has hovered around
a sizable 4–4½ percent of GDP in recent years.
The fiscal position stays enviable, although the general government surplus is set to
drop. It surged to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2007, buoyed by economic expansion and
spending moderation. Indeed, despite a large expected increase in aging-related
expenditures, the fiscal position would already be sustainable from a long-term
perspective. However, recently adopted or anticipated discretionary measures imply a
substantial reduction of the surplus, inconsistent with eventual stability of the publicdebt-to-GDP ratio.
Banks have been largely sheltered from the turmoil, but profitability, cross-country
supervision, mortgage lending, and links to insurance companies and foreign affiliates
require attention. Key financial stability indicators remain quite healthy, and exposure to
“toxic assets” is minimal. However, the ongoing turbulence does affect banks indirectly
through lower growth, and thus less profitability. House prices have risen comparatively
moderately, while household and nonfinancial enterprise balance sheets remain strong,
although household borrowing has increased sizably in recent years. With some
60 percent of banking assets foreign-owned, strengthened cross-country supervision is
key. Insurance and pension companies have suffered significant losses owing to
plummeting capital markets, although minimum solvency ratios continue to be met.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Finnish authorities’ pursuit of prudent and stabilityoriented policies, which have underpinned Finland’s strong economic performance and
fundamentals in recent years. High per capita GDP growth until recently, fiscal and
current account surpluses, a low ratio of public debt to GDP, and a sound financial
system provide the authorities with substantial room for maneuver during the current
global economic crisis.
Directors noted that spillovers from the global turmoil have adversely affected economic
growth. Moreover, while Finnish financial institutions have proven resilient to the
ongoing turbulence so far and stability indicators are relatively healthy, the downturn
poses risks to the financial system. Looking further forward, Directors underscored that
rapid population aging, slowing productivity growth, and labor and product market
rigidities pose challenges to longer-term growth and fiscal sustainability.
In light of Finland’s sizable general government surplus, Directors agreed that a
structural fiscal relaxation is warranted in the present circumstances, as part of a
coordinated EU-wide fiscal stimulus consistent with European Council guidelines.
Directors cautioned that this short-term budgetary easing should not adversely affect
long-term fiscal sustainability, and supported the use of measures that can be
implemented rapidly and scaled back once activity rebounds. They emphasized that,

3
once growth resumes, early action should be taken to address the long-term fiscal
sustainability issue.
Directors acknowledged that expenditure restraint should be the lynchpin of efforts to
achieve fiscal sustainability. In this regard, improved expenditure efficiency
supplemented by user fees to moderate demand for public services will be important.
Directors supported a shift from labor income to less distortionary taxation, especially as
it would also help increase labor force participation. However, most Directors considered
the planned cut in the value added tax rate on food to be undesirable on efficiency
grounds, while a few Directors saw merit in the measure from an equity perspective and
as a short-term tax stimulus. Directors believed that the recent easing of pension fund
investment guidelines could lead to higher long-term returns and thus also buttress the
long-term fiscal position.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate maintains a moderate
margin of external competitiveness. They concurred that Finland’s competitiveness is
adequate, but could be undermined if high wage awards in excess of productivity gains
continue.
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their effective supervision of the
Finnish financial system. They noted stress tests results indicating that banks could
withstand fairly severe shocks. Nevertheless, Directors urged the authorities to remain
vigilant to financial sector risks. In particular, they cautioned that the economic downturn
could worsen bank profitability and liquidity, especially through contagion from parent
banks given the large share of foreign-owned banks in the banking system. They
welcomed the steps that have been taken to guarantee bank debt renewal and to
recapitalize banks, if needed, and urged further enhancements in cooperation with
home supervisors of foreign-owned banks.
Directors underscored the importance of raising labor utilization and productivity growth
to support economic growth and fiscal sustainability. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to raise the still-low effective retirement age. They considered that a shift to
less centralized wage bargaining could increase labor market flexibility while
differentiated wage increases should better reflect productivity differentials. This could
stimulate labor force participation while preserving competitiveness. Directors also urged
that additional measures be taken to enhance competition and productivity in product
markets, especially in the “sheltered” sectors.

Statement by Jen Henriksson, Executive Director for Finland
and Janne Hukka, Advisor to Executive Director
January 28, 2009
1. Finland’s outlook as a small open economy is intimately connected with the state of
the international business cycle. Hence, the recent sharp deterioration in the external
environment has lead to a more rapid than expected turnaround in economic activity.
The close-to-potential GDP growth in the first half of 2008 was followed by a
significant slowdown particularly towards the end of the year. A slump in new orders
and cancellations of existing orders, coupled with tighter financing conditions, have
turned prospects in industry bleak. A rapid fall in investments, a wave of lay-offs and
weakening consumer confidence have followed. Also the construction sector has been
hard-hit by the subdued state of the housing market.
2. That said, Finland enters the crisis from a relative position of strength. The recent
years of growth did not create significant imbalances in the economy.
Notwithstanding the medium term demographic challenges, the prudent policies prior
to the crisis have created comparatively comfortable fiscal space for counter-cyclical
stimulus. Moreover, the collective memory of the previous crisis at the turn of the
1990s, combined with stabilizing effects of Finland’s euro area membership, have
prevented a build-up of large-scale financial sector vulnerabilities.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
3. Reflecting the most recent indicators of rapidly slowing economic activity, the
authorities’ expectations for the current year have become considerably more cautious
than staff’s revised projection. Just a week ago, the authorities indicated that they
expect the Finnish GDP to contract by more than 2 percent in 2009. A gradual
recovery will likely follow the bottoming out of the global downturn.
4. The contraction in growth will inevitably take its toll on employment. The rapid
employment gains of recent years stabilized toward the end of 2008 and the
unemployment rate is now set to rise for the first time in 15 years. As employers are
forced to shed the labour reserves accumulated against the backdrop of expected
labour shortages prior to the crisis, the impact on employment figures will also be
steeper than usual. The authorities envisage that the unemployment rate will climb up
to 8 – 9 percent by the end of 2009, compared to just over 6 percent last year.
5. The downturn has left growth in public demand as the main driving force in national
output. Lower global demand, a rise in labour costs from the 2007 wage negotiations
and the scaling down of forest industry production capacity have led to a
discouraging outlook for Finnish exporters. Tighter financing conditions and the
decline in construction have further weighed down investment plans. The cuts in
industrial output and rising unemployment have also eroded consumer confidence and

2
the projected increases in real disposable incomes over 2009-2010 do not fully
translate into higher consumption.
6. After having been suppressed for a number of years, inflation accelerated
considerably early last year and exceeded the euro area average for the first time in
six years by mid-2008, reflecting higher labour costs and delayed hikes of food
prices. With the reversal of energy prices and the rapid cooling of demand conditions,
the pace of increase in consumer prices should fall close to or below 2 percent in
2009 and 2010.
Financial Sector Developments
7. The authorities share staff’s view that the overall situation in the Finnish financial
markets is still relatively unproblematic. Banks’ short-term liquidity position is
healthy and capital adequacy ratios are on solid levels. However, the cost of longerterm funding has increased markedly. Also, banks’ profitability is weakening in line
with the rapidly slowing growth, falling interest rates and reduced demand for
housing loans and financial services in general.
8. Although no immediate need for public support is foreseen, the authorities are
implementing measures in line with the EU principles agreed in October 2008 to
support the functioning of the financial markets:
•

In December 2008, the Parliament approved a proposal for a state guarantee
scheme for Finnish banks. The scheme allows adequately capitalised banks to
apply for a state guarantee on their new short- or medium-term funding of up
to 50 billion euros. The scheme is in place until the end of April with an
option to extend it to the end of the year. The pricing of guarantees will follow
the recommendations of the ECB.

•

In early February, the Government will present a proposal to the Parliament
for a law on precautionary recapitalization of Finnish deposit banks. Under the
scheme, capital is provided through subordinated loans and access is limited
to solvent banks. The total amount of the scheme is limited to 4 billion euros.
The interest on the loans is the sum of the state’s five-year funding cost and a
600 basis point overall premium. Interest payments take seniority over
dividends. The loan conditions include reporting requirements on the bank’s
lending behaviour. Both the state guarantee and the recapitalization schemes
entail restrictions to executive pay.

9. Due to worsening financial situation in the corporate sector, banks are under growing
pressure to increase funding especially for large Finnish companies that are suffering
from steeply rising costs and reduced access to other sources of financing.
Consequently, the authorities are planning additional actions to alleviate companies’
increasing financing difficulties. The state pension fund was this week granted the

3
right to purchase limited amounts of domestic corporate commercial paper. Further
measures will be decided upon in the coming weeks.
10. Despite the strongly negative returns in 2008, the longer term outlook for the Finnish
pension funds remains broadly favourable. The 2007 reform of the investment
guidelines aimed at a gradual 2 percent per annum rise in the pension funds’ portfolio
share of equities, which could result in the long-term real return rising to 4 percent a
year . The temporary relaxation of the funds’ solvency rules at the end of last year has
also improved their financial health.
11. Starting from 2009, the Financial Supervision Authority and the Insurance
Supervisory Authority merged into the Financial Supervisory Authority with a
mandate over both sectors. The merger enables a more efficient utilisation of the best
expertise and available resources in an environment of increasingly complex risks and
regulation.
Fiscal Policy
12. The 2009 budget proposal and the subsequent amendments in November 2008
introduced various stimulative measures against the cyclical downturn, including taxcuts on labour and pensions, measures designed to boost infrastructure investment,
housing construction and renovation as well as measures to perk business operating
potential and financing options. The budget also includes a cut in food VAT that is
mainly motivated by equity considerations, but may also boost private consumption.
13. The discretionary stimulus introduced so far amounts to 1.2 percent of GDP, and it is
in line with the amount agreed under the European Economy Recovery Plan by the
European Council in December 2008. The total budgetary impact of the measures,
automatic stabilizers included, is roughly 2 ½ percent of GDP. The authorities intend
to introduce additional fiscal measures in a supplementary budget proposal in early
February 2009.
14. Finland’s healthy fiscal surpluses ease the burden of the cyclical downturn on public
finances. The 2008 general government surplus is estimated to have remained above
4 percent of GDP. However, this year will already see an erosion of the general
government surplus because of the rapid fall in cyclically sensitive tax revenues, rise
in unemployment related expenditure and the expansionary budget. The central
government balance will slip into deficit in 2009 for the first time this decade. Local
government finances are also expected to slide from a near-balance to a slight deficit,
which is to widen further in 2010. Hence, the near-term general government surplus
hinges entirely on the employment pension funds. The debt-to-GDP ratio will
increase substantially from its 2008 level of 33 percent.
15. The authorities concur that the near-term state of public finances is inconsistent with
long-term fiscal sustainability – estimated to require a general government surplus of
around 4 percent in the medium term – but remain committed to pursuing sound

4
spending and tax policies. The Government will assess in late February whether
sufficient provision has been made for the ageing population so that any necessary
reforms can be launched by 2011 while it is still in office. Meanwhile, growth in
public spending will be curbed by structural measures and enhancements in public
sector efficiency. The main instruments in this context are the Government
productivity programme and the ongoing restructuring of municipalities, where
following numerous local government mergers the emphasis has started to shift to a
reform of service structures. The authorities have also set up a working group
examining possible reforms to the tax system, due to complete its efforts by the end
of 2010. The prospect of rising long-term real return on pension fund assets may also
improve the general government balance in the long run.
Structural Policies
16. The authorities concur with staff over the need for further labour and product market
reforms:
•

Following the establishment of two working groups focusing on labour market
mismatches and “flexicurity”, the Government has launched a comprehensive
review of the whole social security legislation. The Committee presented its
mid-term report in January 2009. The main elements under consideration are
the unemployment pipeline, disability pensions and rehabilitation of workers
outside the labour force. The sizeable income tax cuts and targeted increases
in appropriations are expected to further improve labour market dynamics.

•

Two working groups have also been established to examine further product
market reforms. The “Competition Law 2010” analyzes the needs to reform
the current competition law. The “Level playing field” looks into the role of
regulations, including tax laws, that are not neutral with respect to private and
public sector players in product markets. Both working groups are to reach
conclusions this winter. The Government has also launched a new innovation
strategy seeking to enhance the economy’s innovation capacity and identify
areas where reforms are necessary.

17. After meagre results from the decentralized 2007 round of wage negotiations, the
authorities are considering a new structure to improve the provision of information on
wage and price developments and mitigate leap-frogging between different employee
groups. Partially owing to the current downturn, the wage increases from the next
round of negotiations in 2010 are anticipated to be modest.
