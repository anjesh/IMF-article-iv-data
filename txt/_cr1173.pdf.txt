TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
Approved by David J. Robinson and David Marston
December 22, 2010

Context: The decline in energy prices and the global crisis have led to a severe and prolonged
economic downturn in this highly energy-dependent economy. The difficulties of a large
financial conglomerate have also adversely impacted the economy. Despite ample buffers
including large fiscal space and strong reserves, the policy response has been constrained by
concerns about the magnitude of the fiscal deterioration, the sharp increase in the debt ratio,
and inflation.
Political background: A new government took office in May 2010 following a landslide
victory in early elections.
Focus of the consultation. The immediate challenge is providing a policy mix to support
economic recovery, while completing the resolution of a large failed insurance company
(CLICO). The medium-term challenges are sharply raising fiscal savings to reverse the recent
increase in public debt and prepare for the projected decline in energy reserves, while
securing adequate investment and social spending to promote diversification.
The staff’s main recommendations are:





Fiscal policy. Accelerate implementation of the 2010/11 budget, which is appropriately
geared toward supporting the recovery, the implementation of the investment program and
the resolution of several outstanding issues. Establish a credible medium-term framework
aiming for an overall balance by 2012/13 and putting debt on a downward trajectory to
rebuild buffers.
Monetary policy. Consider further policy rate reduction to signal commitment to support
an economic recovery if the economy continues to stagnate and inflation falls further.
Financial sector policy. Resolve the further delay in the restructuring of the outstanding
CLICO liabilities and contain any additional fiscal costs. Implement Financial Stability
Module recommendations including implementing consolidated supervision and
strengthening capital requirements for banks, and improving legislation on insurance
companies and on dealing with failed financial institutions.

Exchange system. Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3, and 4.

with the non-energy sector contracting by
7¼ percent. The large deterioration in terms of trade led to a fall in nominal GDP by 27 percent.
Notwithstanding a partial recovery in energy prices, economic activity is moribund reflecting the
uncertainty related to mid-term elections and delays in key policy decisions by the new
government. Real GDP continued to contract in the first half of 2010 while the unemployment
rate increased to 6.7 percent in 2010Q1 from 5.1 percent at end-2009.
2.
Despite ample buffers including
large fiscal space and strong international
reserves, the policy response to the crisis
has been constrained. The overall fiscal
balance turned sharply negative in 2008/09,
despite a real decline in expenditure, as
revenue fell by one third reflecting lower
energy prices and weaker activity. Concerns
about the magnitude of the fiscal deterioration
and a rapid increase in the public debt ratio
constrained a more supportive fiscal stance.

The mission, comprising J. Gold (Head), H. Monroe, Y. Wu, and P. Liu (all WHD) visited Port of Spain during
October 27–November 8, 2010. Ms. Des Vignes (OED) and Mr. Abuelafia (IDB) joined the mission in the second
week. The mission conducted outreach meetings with parliamentarians, trade and labor unions, and representatives
of the private sector. The mission overlapped with an MCM Financial Stability Module mission. Mr. Robinson
(WHD) participated in the final discussions. Mr. Robinson and Mr. Monroe presented papers on the impact of the
global crisis on the Caribbean and on Ponzi schemes in the Caribbean at the Caribbean Center for Money and
Finance annual conference.

fell below that planned in part because of election-related delays in capital spending, and the
fiscal impulse turned negative.2 Accumulation of large payment arrears to contractors and
increased delays in VAT refunds may have understated the deficit and public debt while
hindering the economic recovery.
3.
Inflation has resurfaced as a concern after falling to a historical low in 2009, but the
data are misleading. Inflation peaked at 16.2 percent in August 2010 as adverse weather
conditions drove up food prices, after falling to 1.3 percent at end-2009. However, the official
data may be overstating food inflation by as much as 50 percent3 and understating the GDP
deflator because of measurement problems. Inflation fell to 12.5 percent in October, while core
inflation remained broadly stable below 5 percent.
4.
The monetary policy stance has been generally supportive but ineffective in the
context of large excess liquidity. The CBTT lowered the repo rate beginning in late March 2009
by a combined 375 basis points to 5 percent in January 2010, and by a further 125 basis points
from August to November 2010. Nevertheless, private sector credit consistently declined since
October 2009. The excess liquidity in the banking system pushed the three-month T-bill rate to a
historical low of 0.3 percent in November 2010. Recent reports indicate bank profitability is
down and non-performing loans are up, but banks remain well capitalized with risk-adjusted
capital at around 23 percent in September 2010. Financial Stability Module stress tests show that
risks to banking sector stability are generally low, although credit concentration risk is of some
concern.
5.
The collapse of the CL Financial Group in January 2009 accentuated the economic
slowdown (Box 1).4 The intervention of CLICO, British American Insurance Trinidad (BAT),
and an investment bank subsidiary helped contain contagion, but the two insurance companies
continue to face financial difficulties and the size of the unfunded liabilities is greater than
realized. The 2010/11 budget announced a restructuring plan that would pay all investors in full
up to a threshold (TT$75,000 or US$12,000)5 and restructure the remaining outstanding amounts
over 20 years, with no interest—a discount in net present value (NPV) terms of about 40 percent.
The plan has met strong opposition from policyholders, but after its review, the government is
proceeding with the original plan with some modest revisions.

2

The fiscal impulse is calculated as the change in the cyclically-adjusted non-energy primary balance.

3

The Central Statistical Office with Fund technical assistance is updating its methodology for calculating the CPI to
remove an upward bias in food price inflation. The bias reflects the use of chain-linked index to aggregate food
prices. This index is not “transitive”—a price increase that is subsequently reversed would nevertheless still increase
the index creating a substantial upward bias when prices are volatile.
4

For additional background see the Selected Issues paper “The Collapse of the CL Financial Group and Government
Intervention.”

This is equivalent to deposit insurance provided by the Deposit Insurance Corporation for commercial banks.

5
6.
The recovery in energy prices is strengthening the external accounts after the sharp
deterioration in 2009. The current account surplus is projected to increase to about 17 percent
of GDP in 2010 from 9 percent in 2009. Lower export receipts and increased uncertainty led to
temporary pressures on the foreign exchange market in 2009, but pressures have eased and
international reserves increased to US$9.2 billion (14 months of imports) at end-October 2010
from US$8.7 billion at end-2009.
Outlook and Risks
7.
Growth is expected to pick up in the second quarter of 2011 and is projected to be
2.0 percent for the year. However, near-term risks are tilted to the downside reflecting the
absence of concrete signs of a recovery, the weak regional outlook, and increased global
uncertainty. Other factors undermining private sector confidence include delays in capital
spending, uncertainty regarding the CLICO restructuring, substantial arrears to contractors, large
pending VAT refunds, and difficult public sector wage negotiations for 2008–10. Inflation is
projected to stabilize as food inflation returns to its norm. The current account surplus is
expected to double from the 2009 level but will remain significantly below the pre-crisis levels.
8.
Medium-term growth prospects depend on the energy sector outlook.
Notwithstanding the firming of energy prices, growth is expected to remain below 3 percent
reflecting the subdued expansion of energy output. There have not been any significant findings
of oil and gas reserves in recent years, and at the current production level proven and probable
reserves will run out in 22 and 15 years for oil and gas respectively (Box 2), which will place
pressure on the fiscal and external accounts. However, industry representatives appeared relatively
confident about potential new finds as exploration activity is now increasing.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on balancing further fiscal support for economic recovery against the need
for adjustment to reverse the steep increase in public debt and to deal with declining energy
revenue in the medium term; providing a monetary environment conducive to supporting a nonenergy sector recovery; restructuring CLICO’s liabilities while containing the fiscal costs and
maintaining financial sector stability; and diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on
energy.6

6

The 2008 Article IV consultation recommended: further fiscal adjustment to reduce the non-energy deficit in the
fiscal and current accounts to levels that are sustainable in the long run and further fiscal tightening in the medium
term; gradually loosening monetary policy, once concerns over second-round inflationary effects have abated;
considering greater exchange rate flexibility once global conditions have stabilized; and intensifying supervision of
the financial sector including establishing a robust framework for the stress-testing of financial institutions and a
crisis management plan on a regional basis. These recommendations were largely overtaken by events as the global
crisis unfolded, economic activity slowed, and as CL Financial collapsed.

6
A. Fiscal policy
9.
The 2010/11 budget is appropriately geared toward supporting the recovery. The
budget envisages an overall fiscal deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP, excluding the cost of the CLICO
intervention, based on a conservative oil price assumption. Staff projects a lower fiscal deficit of
about 4½ percent of GDP reflecting the higher WEO forecast for oil prices.7 The budget
announced several fiscal measures, including a shift in the energy tax regime toward a
production sharing arrangement for new exploration and a tax amnesty on interest and penalties
through 2009. It also implements several campaign promises including a 50 percent increase in
the Senior Citizens Pension (at a cost of 0.6 percent of GDP). The total financing requirement—
including the additional cost of the CLICO intervention of about TT$11.9 billion8 (8.6 percent of
GDP) in 2010/11—will reach about 12.2 percent of GDP and gross public debt will increase to
50.9 percent of GDP.9
10.
The staff agreed that the immediate priority is to support an economic recovery. In
view of the very weak economic activity, the estimated fiscal impulse of 2 percent of GDP is
broadly appropriate and is unlikely to jeopardize fiscal sustainability. Moreover, given the
moribund activity, the staff recommended: (i) accelerating the implementation of the budget,
particularly on capital spending; (ii) appointing critical public enterprise boards with the
authority to approve new projects; (iii) rapidly resolving the 2008-10 public sector wage
negotiations; and (iv) paying contractor arrears after their verification and shortening delays of
pending VAT refunds. The authorities recognized that activity was weaker than expected when
the 2010/11 budget was finalized in September and agreed with these recommendations, while
noting that the size of contractor arrears is likely to be smaller than reported in the press and that
a large share of the pending VAT refunds was due to state enterprises.10

7

The budget assumes an oil price of US$65 per barrel in contrast to the WEO forecast of US$77 per barrel.

8

In addition, the budget will compensate the depositors in the Hindu Credit Union, which failed in 2008, up to
TT$75,000 at a cost of TT$300 million (0.2 percent of GDP).
9

This excludes arrears to contractors and pending VAT refunds. Public debt net of the assets held in the Heritage
and Stabilization Fund of TT$23 billion is projected to be TT$47 billion or 34 percent of GDP at the end of 2010/11.
10

Press reports suggest that the arrears could be as high as 7 percent of GDP, but the largest construction contractor
says the figure is at most about 1 percent.

11.
In the medium term, the staff called for a credible fiscal framework to increase
public savings and rebuild buffers. In the absence of policy measures, the deficit would
continue to increase gradually from the already high level projected this year to 5.2 percent of
GDP in 2014/15 and the gross debt-to-GDP-ratio would rise to 58 percent. The staff’s active
scenario involves stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2011/12 through an initial adjustment of
about 2 percentage points of GDP—to a deficit of 2.3 percent—and further measures in
subsequent years to firmly place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory. The strategy is
based on partially reversing the recent large increase in transfers without withdrawing support to
the most vulnerable, and containing expenditures on goods and services, while maintaining a
high level of investment to support diversification. It would also entail a moderate strengthening

in non-energy revenues, by improving the efficiency of the VAT, which is below regional levels.
The authorities agreed with the need to balance the budget by 2012/13 and further increase
public savings over the medium term. However, they were skeptical about the magnitude of the
proposed adjustment in the staff’s active scenario and emphasized the difficulty of cutting back
transfers.
12.
Moreover, the government should safeguard the sustainability of the National
Insurance Board. The increase in the monthly Senior Citizen’s Pension and the minimum civil
service pension to TT$3,000 has created pressure for a large increase in pension benefits, which
should only be considered in the context of the next actuarial review scheduled for completion in
2012.

The government’s large financing needs should be carefully managed.11 There is
considerable domestic liquidity which could be tapped without crowding out private sector
credit, and at a lower cost than external financing. The authorities requested the staff’s technical
assistance with debt management to help smooth new bond issuance and refinance existing debt
contracts to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment.
B. Monetary, and Exchange Rate Policy, and Financial Sector

policy. The CBTT has some some flexibility

The buildup of excess liquidity in
the banking system over the past two
years contributed to larger queues in the
foreign exchange market. Staff noted that
the persistence of queues points to the need
for more effective liquidity management,
increased intervention, and/or some
exchange rate flexibility. The authorities

noted that the queues data are misleading because buyers make multiple requests across banks,
and that the absence of a black market suggests the market is broadly in equilibrium. They were
reluctant to allow for more exchange rate flexibility because of concern that even modest
movements could be used as an excuse for hikes in prices of imported goods.
16.
The balance of risks suggests that the accommodative monetary policy stance
appears broadly appropriate given moderating inflation risks and the weak economic
activity. Actual inflation is likely to be significantly lower than reported once the methodology
for calculating the index is revised. Moreover, the inflation rate is declining in line with the fall
in food prices and core inflation remains broadly stable. At the same time, the impact of the
increase in the minimum wage is likely to be contained by the small segment of the labor force
directly affected (3 percent) and the weak economic outlook. Although the accommodative
stance is contributing to the queues, these could be managed as noted above. Thus, on balance,
further policy rate reduction could be desirable to support economic recovery if the economy
continues to stagnate, inflation falls further, and public sector wage increases are manageable.
The authorities generally agreed, and have since the completion of the mission further reduced
the policy rate, introduced an additional interest bearing deposit at the central bank, and
significantly increased foreign exchange sales to reduce the queues as of end-November.
17.
The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but more
flexibility may be needed. The authorities are comfortable with current reserve levels and
current policies do not target a specific reserve level. Based on staff’s estimates, the 2009
average REER is within the estimated 95 percent confidence interval. The high current account
norm (see text chart and Appendix I) reflects the large but temporary nature of non-renewable
energy income. Unless there is significant scope to grow exports outside the exhaustible resource
sector, future real income (or consumption) per capita will fall below current levels. This may
require greater exchange rate flexibility over the medium-term to support the expansion of nonenergy exports and rebalance consumption. The staff’s illustrative medium-term fiscal strategy to

concern, banks and general and life
insurance companies (aside from CLICO/BAICO) are well capitalized and remain profitable.
Banks also have substantially increased provisions. However, some non-bank financial
institutions—which account for almost half of financial system assets but have not been as
closely regulated and supervised as commercial banks—have been under stress recently because
of exposure to CL Financial. The authorities welcomed the strong assessment of the banking
system and acknowledged some uncertainty regarding the non-bank financial institutions, but
indicated the situation was now more settled. Moreover, they noted that credit concentration
risks are difficult to avoid for a small economy like Trinidad and Tobago. The mission urged the
government to accelerate the plans to extend supervision and expand the safety net to the nonbank sector. It also encouraged the authorities to quickly enact the proposed Securities Act to
improve regulatory co-operation and to strengthen onsite inspections by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
19.
The FSM recommendations focused on further improving banking supervision and
crisis preparedness (Box 3). The FSM assessment recommends fully implementing
consolidated supervision and strengthening capital requirements for banks; complementing the
draft insurance law with measures to bridge the tension between having both statutory funds and
risk-based supervision; introducing a law dealing with failed financial institutions; and
considering extending financial safety nets and the crisis resolution framework to certain nonbank financial institutions. The authorities welcomed the majority of the recommendations.
20.
The delay in resolving the CLICO liabilities has contributed to uncertainty. The
delay was in part related to concerns about implications of the government’s proposal for credit
unions, some of which were already facing financial challenges. The mission indicated that there
is a strong case for providing more favorable terms to credit unions, given that a large number of
small account holders could be affected, and potential spillovers in the current environment. In
late November, the government announced a liquidity window for credit unions to deal with their

CLICO liabilities although the mechanism has yet to be fully specified. It also opened a
compassionate window for particularly vulnerable individuals. It is considering providing
incentives to banks to reduce the discount on the government notes (for rescheduled CLICO
liabilities) in the secondary market. The mission supported the government’s intention to reach a
new agreement with CL Financial’s shareholders to provide for more scope to dispose of CL
Financial’s assets and recover some of the government’s cost of the CLICO restructuring.
C. Diversification and Structural Reforms
21.
Attention has returned to diversification efforts as the authorities look beyond the
crisis. The government is continuing to promote diversification by investing in physical and
human capital to support the development of a knowledge-based economy. It is also maintaining
strong incentives for downstream manufacturing industries linked to energy-based projects. The
government plans to secure bilateral investment agreements, double taxation treaties, and
reciprocal regulatory agencies arrangements, to encourage domestic and foreign investments. It
also intends to move rapidly to improve the business climate (including through a one-stop shop
for investors), strengthen the public enterprise sector by inviting private sector participation, and
accelerate privatization, with assistance from the International Finance Corporation. The 2010/11
budget also includes incentives aimed at promoting the use of alternative energy and revitalizing
the agriculture sector. Staff broadly support the authorities’ strategy and emphasized the
importance of prioritizing government investments in support of diversification as part of their
medium-term framework particularly in view of the increasingly constrained availability of
resources.

22.
The authorities are seeking to improve data quality. Staff highlighted the need to
strengthen macroeconomic statistics, in particular the calculation of the CPI and the GDP
deflator, where methodological issues can complicate the conduct of monetary policy, and may
lead to overstating fiscal balances and debt as a share of GDP. Staff welcomes the government’s
efforts to improve the timeliness of its data, to subscribe to the SDDS, and to develop a State
Agencies Performance Monitoring Information System (SAPMIS) to improve the monitoring of
public utilities and public enterprises.

13
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Trinidad and Tobago has been hit hard by the global economic crisis. The steep fall
in energy prices, slowdown in the United States and the region, and the collapse of the CL
Financial Group led to a prolonged slowdown. The fiscal savings of earlier years, together with
falling debt levels and the accumulation of assets, including international reserves, provided the
country with space to deal with the ensuing profound fiscal deterioration, the cost of the financial
crisis, and the rapid increase of the debt ratio.
24.
The economic recovery is expected to begin only in 2011. Uncertainty related to the
early elections, followed by delays in the implementation of public sector investment programs
delay in the resolution of CLICO, protracted wage negotiations, and arrears to the private sector
have led to a slower than anticipated economic recovery in 2010, notwithstanding some recovery
of energy prices.
25.
The immediate priority is to support economic activity. In this context, the
government’s proposed 2010/11 fiscal deficit target appears broadly appropriate. The large
increase in debt is manageable. Nevertheless, the implementation of the budget should be
accelerated, in particular, the government’s investment program. Furthermore, the government
should move quickly to appoint public enterprise boards which are critical for new project
approvals and remove other sources of uncertainty, including the public sector wage
negotiations, contractors’ arrears once verified, and extended delays of VAT refunds.
26.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy needs to reduce public debt and to rebuild
buffers. A strong and credible medium-term fiscal framework should place debt on a downward
trajectory. A key element of this would be to reverse the large increases in expenditures on goods
and services and transfers that took place during the boom years and to moderately strengthen
non-energy revenues through improved tax administration. In addition, the current limited
energy reserves call for a more ambitious fiscal plan over the longer term that would make
significant headway in reducing the non-energy deficit to avoid sharp future adjustments when
reserves are depleted.
27.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance is on balance broadly
appropriate. Given the weak non-energy sector activity, the risk of the continuation of the
already prolonged recession outweighs the possible reversal in the recent decline in headline
inflation. Inflation is likely to continue to decline in line with the fall in food prices,
notwithstanding the increase in the minimum wage, reflecting the weak economic outlook.
Moreover, actual inflation is likely to be significantly lower than reported once methodological
issues are addressed. The staff agree that the policy rate serves as a useful signaling device and
further reduction could be considered if inflation continues to fall.
28.
The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Nevertheless,
the persistence and increase in queues point to the need to manage the excess liquidity, increase
the sale of foreign exchange, or allow for some flexibility in the exchange rate. The staff

14
welcome the recent steps to reduce excess liquidity and eliminate the queues, which also address
additional pressures on the foreign exchange market from monetary easing. Over the longer
term, in the absence of adjustment or significant new energy reserve discoveries, the projected
decline in exports will lead to current account deficits. This may require greater exchange rate
flexibility to support the expansion of non-energy exports and rebalance consumption.
29.
The banking system has shown resilience in the face of the economic slowdown and
problems with CL Financial. Stress tests indicate that risks to the stability of the banking sector
are generally low in part reflecting the banking system’s strong capitalization, conservative
lending practices, and high interest rate spread. Nevertheless, the increase in NPLs and some
banks’ concentrated exposures to large clients are of some concern. Meanwhile, risks in the nonbank financial sector have also increased. Staff urge the authorities to act rapidly to bring some
of these institutions under the central bank’s supervision, expand financial safety nets, strengthen
the resolution framework, and enact new insurance legislation while addressing its weaknesses,
in line with the Financial Stability Module recommendations.
30.
The staff commend the authorities for moving forward with the restructuring of
CLICO liabilities while containing fiscal costs. The staff agree with the plan to provide
liquidity window to credit unions to reduce financial vulnerabilities and protect the most
vulnerable, and urges the government to move forward with completing the restructuring as
quickly as possible. The staff support the government’s intention to seek a new agreement with
CL Financial to provide for more scope to dispose of CL Financial’s assets and recover some of
the government’s cost of the CLICO restructuring.
31.
The medium- and long-term growth prospects are challenging as the country’s
energy resources are declining. The staff welcomed the government’s initiatives aimed at
improving the business climate, facilitating private sector entrepreneurship, and promoting
diversification. Going forward, the government would need to balance between saving energy
revenues for future generations with investing today to lay the foundations for sustained nonenergy growth. In this context, it will be important for the government to prioritize investment in
support of diversification.
32.
The government needs to improve the statistical infrastructure. Data weaknesses, in
particular with the CPI and GDP deflator, pose an obstacle to informed policy making and fixing
the related data problems is essential. The staff welcome the authorities’ planned move to the
SDDS.
33.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. The Collapse of the CL Financial Group and Government Intervention
The January 2009 collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group
represented a major financial shock to the Caribbean region, which was already reeling from
the global crisis. CL Financial’s subsidiaries were active in a wide range of sectors including
banking, insurance, energy, beverages, and real estate. The group’s assets stood at US$16 billion at
end-2007, about 30 percent of the Caribbean region’s GDP. It has majority ownership of the largest
commercial bank and owns the largest insurance company CLICO (Trinidad) in Trinidad and
Tobago, with assets of US$2.9 billion at end-2008 (11 percent of Trinidad and Tobago’s GDP).
The collapse of the group and especially the insurance arms has had spillover effects in all 15
CARICOM states except for Jamaica and Haiti, with exposures as high as 17 percent of GDP (in
the ECCU), leading to costly government interventions.
The group’s assets rapidly expanded in recent years through costly sources of financing. The
group’s assets grew by 32 percent during 2005 to 2007, mainly financed by deposit-like annuity
products through the group’s insurance subsidiaries—CLICO and British American Insurance
Company (BAICO). The returns offered on these were substantially higher than bank interest rates,
while not being subject to stricter banking regulation and supervision. These resources were then
channeled to finance real estate and other investments. With the deterioration of global economic
conditions in 2008, many of CL Financial’s subsidiaries faced liquidity and solvency pressures.
Methanol Holdings, one of the largest methanol producers in the world and a big contributor of
dividends to CL Financial, suffered losses following a collapse in methanol prices, and the group’s
real estate investments in Florida turned sour. As news of difficulties spread, investors rushed to
withdraw funds, triggering the collapse of its three financial subsidiaries in Trinidad and Tobago.
The collapse highlighted weakness in the region’s regulation and supervision of the insurance
industry. The insurance law in Trinidad and Tobago dates from 1966. Although the law required
that insurance companies pledge assets to the Statutory Fund to cover their liabilities, the
requirement only needed to be met at the end of the year, and the annual statement only needed to
be filed by mid-year, in the following year. A new insurance act was being developed at the time
that CL Financial collapsed.
The Trinidad and Tobago authorities intervened in January 2009 to limit contagion to the
rest of the financial system. In return for a capital injection of TT$5 billion to CLICO, the
government received preferred shares as well as 49 percent of equity of CLICO, and appointed four
of the seven members of CLF’s Board of Directors including the Chairman. Moreover, the
government provided TT$2.2 billion to facilitate the transfer of CLICO Investment Bank’s thirdparty deposit liabilities to the state-owned First Citizens Bank and its purchase of Caribbean
Money Market Brokers Limited. Despite government support, CLICO continued having difficulties
with the sale of new insurance and rolling over existing investments.
The government announced a restructuring plan in the 2010/11 budget aimed at protecting
small depositors while containing the fiscal cost. The announced plan would pay the claims of
investors (including investors in CLICO mutual funds) up to TT$75,000 as they mature, and the
remainder would be paid over twenty years with no interest. After review, the government is
proceeding with the plan with some modification, including a TT$830 million liquidity window for
credit/trade unions and educational institutions. Since the TT$75,000 cap applies to each policy
contract, the vast majority of investments by credit/trade unions and educational institutions
would have been rescheduled and credit/trade unions are not covered by the deposit insurance
scheme. The government also opened a compassionate window for particularly vulnerable
individuals. The authorities are now seeking a new agreement with CL Financial to provide for
more scope to dispose of its assets to recover some of the government’s costs.

16

Box 2. Background Information on the Energy Sector
The energy sector is the pillar of Trinidad and Tobago’s economy. In 2009, it accounted for 36 percent of
nominal GDP (49 percent in 2008) and 85 percent of merchandise exports. The sector is composed of crude oil
and natural gas production (57 percent), refining (18 percent), petrochemicals (13 percent), and services (13
percent). Despite its central role, the sector only employs about 3 percent of the labor force.
The energy industry has a mix of public and private sector participation with significant foreign
involvement.
 Petroleum. Three foreign oil companies (BP, BHP Billiton, and REPSOL) accounted for almost half of
the crude oil production in 2009, and the state oil and gas company Petrotrin (including its Trinmar operations)
for a little more than one third. The smaller players include several domestic private companies who hold subleases and farmouts from Petrotrin. About half of crude oil produced is exported and the rest is refined locally.
Petrotrin is the sole player in the petroleum refining business.
 Natural gas. Foreign companies dominate natural gas
production with three companies (BP, British Gas, and EOG
Resources) accounting for more than 90 percent of output.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export represents
60 percent of natural gas output, and the remainder is
mainly used for ammonia and methanol production and
power generation. Trinidad and Tobago is the largest
exporter of LNG into the United States, and it is the world’s
leading exporter of ammonia and methanol. Private
companies dominate the downstream industry.

In recent years, natural gas production has increased
rapidly while crude oil production has declined
(Figure 1). Oil production peaked in 1978 at 83.7 million
barrels and has been on a declining trend since. Natural
gas became the dominant sector beginning in the late
1990s, and as of end-2009, natural gas output (oil
equivalent) was seven times the magnitude of crude oil
output. Refinery and petrochemical output increased
significantly in recent years (Figure 2), reflecting the
government’s emphasis on investment in higher valueadded downstream products.

more costly gas exploration in deep water. Sixteen exploration wells were drilled in fiscal year 2007/08 and
total exploration cost amounted to US$879 million, about 3½ percent of GDP. Only one exploration well was
drilled in fiscal year 2008/09 as a result of the global slowdown. The government received bids for all but one
of the seven exploration blocks offered this year.

Box 3. Financial Stability Module Assessment: Key Findings and Recommendations
An MCM mission to Trinidad and Tobago conducted the first ever Financial Stability Module
(FSM) assessment under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The FSM mission
focused on the banking and insurance sectors but noted that other financial institutions outside these
sectors could also be systemically important.
The banking sector is resilient, despite the severe economic slowdown and problems associated
with the collapse of CL Financial. This in part reflects the banking system’s strong capitalization
and conservative lending practices. Notwithstanding the increase in nonperforming loans, banks
recorded strong profitability as the spread between the average lending and deposit rates has remained
high. Stress tests suggest that the banking system has adequate buffers to withstand a further
significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, owing to the high capital cushion and
slower credit growth, but the high degree of credit concentration risk is a concern.
The authorities have taken major steps to strengthen regulation and supervision of the banking
and insurance sectors. The 2008 Financial Institutions Act granted the central bank the power to
issue compliance directions and introduced limits on large exposures and connected party lending
among other changes. New insurance supervisory procedures have also been introduced including
more frequent reporting and on-site inspections. However, some trust companies and finance houses
could pose systemic risks, and warrant intensified supervision.
Specific policy recommendations:
Banking supervision: The framework for consolidated supervision should be fully implemented in
supervisory practices. In addition, regulations need to be issued to strengthen capital requirements, by
raising the risk weights on sovereigns, formalizing capital charges on market risk, and introducing
capital requirements for operational risk.
Insurance supervision: New legislation and the strengthening of personnel are required to deal with
problematic insurance companies in an expeditious manner. The mission recommended
complementing the draft insurance law with measures to bridge inefficiencies, duplication, and
inconsistencies from having both statutory funds and risk-based supervision. The mission also noted
that some small motor vehicle insurance companies are likely to be under-reserved for claims, and the
industry needs improvement on consumer protection and market conduct.
Crisis preparedness: A modern efficient law is needed to accelerate the resolution of insolvent
financial institutions and to maximize asset recovery. The mission strongly recommended improving
the regulatory and supervisory framework for credit unions before extending emergency liquidity
assistance and deposit insurance to these institutions. The authorities should also consider extending
the safety net for certain insurance products to provide stability in times of stress.
Additional Considerations. The CBTT should consider moving forward with the implementation of a
supervisory framework to review banks’ capital needs and improving the frequency and timeliness of
bank-by-bank information to promote market discipline in line with Basel II, and eventually adopting
Basel III.

APPENDIX I: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT AND EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
For non-renewable resource exporters, large improvements in the country’s terms of trade
can lead to large real appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate accompanied by large
current account surpluses. However, these large surpluses tend to be temporary, reflecting the
desire to save for the future when resources are depleted. This appendix describes the
assessment of the equilibrium exchange rate analysis and assumptions underlying the
external sustainability analysis.
Estimation of the equilibrium exchange rate
The estimation is based on a single country time-series regression of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) on its fundamentals. The fitted values from the regression can be used
to provide a guide to determine the “equilibrium” value of the REER. The gap between the
actual and fitted values is usually used to assess recent movements in the exchange rate
relative to movements in its fundamentals or the size of misalignments.
Dataset: The dataset for the analysis is on an annual basis during 1975–2009 and consists of
the log of the CPI-based REER (lreer), government consumption as percent of non-energy
GDP (gcons), log of manufacturing productivity relative to trading partners (lprod) and log
of real crude oil price (lrealoil). Standard unit root tests suggest all the variables contain a
unit root; therefore an error-correction model (ECM) is used for the analysis.
Estimation results: Cointegration tests suggest the set of variables are cointegrated, that
means the set of variables share a long run relationship and movements in at least some of
these variables will respond to any short-run disequilibrium. The ECM is estimated using
ordinary least squares (OLS) and the estimated equation is (t-values in parentheses):
leert  0.57(lreert 1  0.17lrealoilt 1  0.14lprodt 1  0.02 gconst 1  2.93)  0.47 leert 1 (1)
(-2.93)

(-2.86)

(-1.72)

(-2.09)

(-5.58)

(2.33)

The estimated equation implies that the long-run equilibrium REER appreciates by
0.17 percent in response to a one percent increase in the real oil price; 0.14 percent to a one
percent increase in relative productivity; and by 0.02 percent to a one percent increase in
ratio of government consumption to non-energy GDP. All the estimated coefficients are
significant at the 5 percent level except the coefficient on relative productivity which is
significant at the 10 percent level. There has been a sharp appreciation of the REER since
2005, around 20 percent between 2005 and 2009, coinciding with the boom in energy prices.

32
Policy implications and caveat: The estimated equilibrium REER, i.e., the fitted values of
regression, is slightly below the actual REER in 2009. The analysis suggests that the average
REER in 2009 is within the 95 percent estimated confidence interval. The 44 percent drop in
130
average real oil prices between 2008 and
Average real effective exchange rate
125
2009 explains a signficant part of the
(2003=100)
120
overvaluation. However, the continued
Average REER
115
recovery in energy prices in 2010 would
(Jan-Jun 2010)
110
offset the deviation from its equilibrium

value. One of the important draw backs of

the equilibrium exchange rate approach is
95
that it does not take into account the

value is projected based on historical

relationships.
External sustainability analysis using the balance-sheet based approach
Balance-sheet based methodologies for real exchange rate assessment seeks to determine the
required real exchange rate change that would bring a country’s current account and net
foreign asset (NFA) position to a desired or benchmark level. Bems and de Carvalho Filho
(2009) generalize this approach to countries where temporary income plays an important
role, in particular for oil exporting countries. The exercise derives a path for future current
account and NFA based on some rule for inter-temporal allocation of the temporary income.
Once temporary income is exhausted, annuity income from the stock of foreign assets can
help maintain a higher level of domestic absorption over and above conventional income.
Background: Consider the following inter-temporal budget constraint:
Ct  Bt  (1  i ) Bt 1  Yt  Z t

(2)

where Ct is domestic absorption, Yt is conventional income, Z t is temporary income
exhausted from some period T  t onwards and Bt is the stock of net foreign assets with
nominal return of i . To derive the path of net foreign assets, Bems and de Carvalho Filho
(WP/09/281) propose allocation rules for the desired level of domestic absorption in the
following form:

Ct  Yt  d  PV (i, Bt 1 ,{Z s }Ts t )

(3)

where PV (i, Bt 1 ,{Z s }Ts t ) is the present discounted value of non-conventional income and
d is the different type of allocation rules:

33



Constant real annuity ( d  i   ): the annuity is equal to the net return on the present
discounted value of non-conventional income. Under this rule, domestic absorption in
all periods exceeds conventional output by the same constant real amount.



Constant real per capita annuity ( d  i    n ): in this case, domestic per capita
absorption exceeds conventional output by the same constant real amount. With a
positive population growth ( n ), current account balances will need to be larger than
‘constant real annuity’ in order to support the same real per capita consumption in the
future.



Constant real annuity to conventional income ratio ( d  i    g ): in this case, the
ratio of domestic absorption to conventional output is constant. To support the
constant ratio in a growth economy at rate g , resources are reallocated from present
to future consumption. Consequently, the NFA position would increase during
periods of temporary income together with current account surpluses.



Given the income allocation rules, one can derive the future path of the current
account and NFA position that is consistent with the desired consumption level.



Data and model parameterizations: In applying the extended external sustainability
(ES) methodology to Trinidad and Tobago involves two steps. The first step expands
the static exercise to a dynamic setting using the current projection for real output
growth and WEO projection for US inflation over the 2009–2015 period. Beyond the
projection horizon, constant output growth and US inflation is assumed.

The second step introduces temporary income from oil and gas extraction, and
Table 1 summarizes the key data and parameter assumptions for the simulation
exercise. We use the projections for oil (excluding imported refineries) and gas
exports as a proxy for the share of temporary income in GDP. After 2015, both the
real price and the extraction quantity of each resource are assumed to stay constant

34
until exhaustion. The lifespan for resources is calculated using data on proven and
probable reserves from the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries. At current
extraction level, proven and probable reserves will run out in 22 and 15 years for oil
and gas respectively. WEO population projection is used to calculate near term
population growth. Beyond 2015, we assume a modest population growth of around
0.1 percent. The long run real return on the stock of NFA is assumed to be 3 percent.

Results: Table 2 presents the results of the simulation exercise for various income allocation
rules. The first row assumes there is no temporary oil or gas income, under this scenario,
there is very little need for inter-temporal income reallocation. Therefore, the required CA
surplus to maintain the same level of current income is very small. The next three rows of
Tables 2 summarize the three scenarios with temporary oil and gas income. All three
allocation rules suggest additional savings during periods with non-zero exhaustible income.

the large but temporary nature of nonconventional income for Trinidad and Tobago.

Policy implications and caveat: The results from the external sustainability simulations
incorporating temporary income shocks suggest Trinidad and Tobago will need to maintain a
relative high CA surplus over the medium term in order to maintain the same aggregate
income in the future. This is significantly above the CA surplus embedded in the current

35
projection unless there is a scope to grow exports outside the exhaustible resources. The high
dependency on temporary income and the short lifespan of exhaustible resources is the key
driver of this result. If the lifespan of both oil and gas reserves were extended by 10 years,
this would lower the required CA surplus to maintain a constant real annuity to about
20 percent of GDP in 2015.
One important caveat to this analysis is that investments that reduce the CA surplus account
in the medium term can help boost the non-energy sector’s export capacity in the future.
Therefore, they would help lower the required inter-temporal reallocation of current income
to the future.

36
APPENDIX II: SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Fund Relations. Trinidad and Tobago has no outstanding purchases and loans from the
Fund. The last financial arrangement was a Stand-by Arrangement totaling SDR 85 million
which expired in 1991. Recent technical assistance includes a STA multi-topic mission
(December 2009), institutional arrangements for a medium-term fiscal framework (FAD,
January 2008), and assignment of resident experts for insurance supervision (MCM, October
2007). An MCM Financial Stability Module mission took place in October-November 2010.
Relations with the World Bank Group. The last Country Assistance Strategy for Trinidad
and Tobago was discussed at the Board in 1999. Its current operation includes the HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control Program, with a total commitment of US$20.0 million. The
International Finance Corporation has invested US$75 million into Guardian Holdings
Limited, a financial conglomerate, to support the company’s expansion and to increase
access to insurance services in under-served areas of the Caribbean.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The IDB is the main source
of overseas development assistance for Trinidad and Tobago. The current loan portfolio
consists of 6 approved loan operations of US$216 million, and an undisbursed value of
US$111 million. The IDB is preparing a new country strategy for Trinidad and Tobago, with
a focus on improving quality of public expenditure and enhancing private sector
development. The IDB has approved two loans totaling US$140 million to finance public
sector expenditure management programs, and up to a further US$1.3 billion over 2011-15
for public sector management improvements and for infrastructure investments.
Statistical Issues. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Trinidad and Tobago
produces a wide range of economic and financial statistics generally based on sound
methodological principles but there are some significant shortcomings that should be
addressed promptly. The country has participated in the General Data Dissemination System
since 2004 and is moving towards participating in the SDDS.

APPENDIX II. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of November 2010)

The World Bank’s last Country Assistance Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago was discussed
at the Board in 1999 and covered the period 1999–2001. The current World Bank program
includes one project on the Nariva ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration with a
total commitment of US$50,000, of which US$ 8,254 has been disbursed. In September
2010, the World Bank concluded an HIV/AIDS prevention and control project with total
commitment of US$20.0 million.
I. PROJECTS
Nariva Ecosystem Restoration and Carbon Sequestration: The program supports an
ongoing project in Trinidad and Tobago which is funded under the World Bank’s BioCarbon
Fund (BioCF). The development objective is to contribute to efforts to restore and conserve
the Nariva wetlands on the eastern shore of Trinidad, through the recognition of the services
it provides as a carbon sink and a biodiverse ecosystem. This objective will be achieved
through actions designed to restore and conserve about 1160 hectares of its associated forest
stands. The Bank’s support to this project in Trinidad and Tobago under this new Trust Fund
is for US$50,000.

Financing

Since 2002, annual disbursements and approvals have averaged US$36 million and
US$16 million. Accordingly, net cash flow has been quite strongly negative as the portfolio
has gradually diminished in size. However, net cash flow is expected to increase in 2010
after a loan approval of US$140 million, of which US$100 million will be disbursed by the
end of 2010.

Portfolio composition

The current loan portfolio consists of 6 loans for US$216 million, of which US$104.4 million
has been disbursed. The main areas of Bank involvement are Trade, Public Sector
Modernization, Education and Citizen Security. Two new operations in 2010—a
US$40 million Neighbourhood Upgrading Program and a US$100 million Public
Expenditure Management Program—were approved. The IDB is in the process of elaborating
a new country strategy with Trinidad and Tobago and it is expected that the finanical support
will reach unprecedented levels, with a total envelope for 2011–2015 of up to US$1.3 billion.
The Bank also has a small portfolio of technical assistance grants, totalling US$2.6 million,
of which US$2.3 million remains undisbursed.

Areas of future focus

The IDB is currently preparing a new Country Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago for the
period of 2011–2015. The Bank expects to provide support to an ambitious reform program
announced by the new administration—whose importance to the Country has been supported
by technical analyses and the on-going dialogue—focusing on interventions to improve
efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of public investment, upgrade basic infrastructure,
promote dynamism in the private sector, and improve the country’s resilience to natural
disasters and the effects of climate change.
In addition, the Bank anticipates an expansion of its non-sovereign guaranteed (NSG)
financing to Trinidad and Tobago’s private sector, in the areas of improving regional
competitiveness and private sector capacity, general manufacturing, and infrastructure. At
present there is one NSG loan under preparation for US$30 million.

APPENDIX IV. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—STATISTICAL ISSUES

Trinidad and Tobago has indicated its intention to work towards subscription to the IMF’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) by 2011. One of the key issues impeding
subscription to the SDDS is the unavailability of current/constant price Gross Domestic
Product estimates on a quarterly basis (QGDP). Institutional arrangements need to be
strengthened to facilitate improved compilation and reporting as well as collaboration among
the central bank, the Central Statistical Office (CSO), and the Ministry of Finance (MoF),
and to avoid duplication of data production efforts and some inconsistencies across sectoral
databases.
Real sector statistics

The CSO has revised the GDP base year from 1985 to 2000, improved the methodology for
calculating value added at each sector level, and switched from valuation at factor cost to
market prices. The upgrading of the national accounts has involved, in particular, the
inclusion of the large gas sector production (which came on stream in 2000) in the GDP
calculations; and a review of the value added estimation techniques for the
telecommunications sector (using the number of call units instead of the number of callers)
and the financial sector (by constructing individual extrapolators for each sub-industry and
then aggregating them). The central bank produces quarterly GDP volume indicators.
Following the recommendation of a STA multi-topic technical assistance mission in
December 2009, the CSO has recently started compiling quarterly GDP data. The CSO has
also started recalculating the CPI index after a CARTAC mission in August 2010 identified
methodology deficiencies that led to an upward bias in the inflation data and is currently
reviewing the calculation of the GDP deflator. The public has direct access to inflation data
which are published in the central bank’s website.
Government finance statistics

Data on central government operations and debt are compiled separately by the MoF and the
central bank, and show significant differences. The MoF compiles fiscal data using a national
classification system for government transactions and debt of the central government. These
data are sufficiently detailed for use in compiling cash data according to GFSM 1986
methodology. Reporting of these cash-based data in the GFSM 2001 framework is also being
undertaken by the MoF.
Data on selected public enterprises and statutory bodies are compiled by the investment
division, the domestic debt division, and the budget division of the MoF. The data compiled
by these divisions are subject to differences, particularly with respect to transfers. Expense
data are sometimes misclassified, as the distinction between consumption of fixed capital and
use of goods and services is not made.

8
Monetary and financial statistics

The monthly monetary accounts for other depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers
only financial institutions that are licensed by the central bank under the 1993 Financial
Institutions Act. ODCs not licensed only report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. No data are
reported by credit unions. The lack of these data has prevented the compilation of a more
comprehensive Depository Corporation Survey. The authorities should also consider
developing systems for reporting balance sheet accounts for the mutual funds, with a view to
compiling a more comprehensive financial survey in the future. Trinidad and Tobago has not
yet migrated to the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the submission of monetary
statistics. In January 2008, a mission assisted the authorities in producing the SRF for the
central bank.
External sector statistics

Quarterly aggregate balance of payments estimates and annual balance of payments data are
disseminated by the central bank in its national publications. Annual balance of payments
data are also sent to STA, although with considerable delay. The presentation of the balance
of payments data is in broad conformity with guidelines outlined in the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The Private Sector Capital Flows and Investor Perception
survey needs to be improved on the quantity and quality of responses, and by estimating the
market value of shares. The Central Bank should expand its current debt reporting system to
include comprehensive coverage of external loans and debt of the entire public sector, as well
as publicly guaranteed debt.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Trinidad and Tobago
Executive Board Meeting
January 21, 2011

This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
1.
(SM/10/325) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The fiscal outturn for the 2009/10 fiscal year (October-September) was TT$3.5 billion
2.
(2.7 percent of GDP) better than projected (see Table 1). This stems from several factors:

Revenue was TT$1.2 billion higher than projected, primarily reflecting the finalized end-year tax
returns of energy companies.



Capital spending was TT$1.5 billion lower than projected, reflecting the new government’s shift
in priorities and its greater scrutiny of capital projects.



Current spending was TT$0.7 billion lower than expected, primarily reflecting interest savings
and lower spending on goods and services, notwithstanding higher transfers as a result of an
advance to the state power generation company which was not repaid as expected.

3.
The outturn underscores the importance of accelerating implementation of the
government’s investment program, as highlighted in the staff report.
4.
The central bank has delayed the policy rate announcement scheduled for December 23, as
November 2010 inflation data has not been released due to industrial relations problems.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 7, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On January 21, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2010 Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.14
Background
After 15 years of positive growth, Trinidad and Tobago was hit hard in 2009 by the global
financial crisis, the fall in energy prices, and the collapse of a large financial conglomerate. The
country entered this period of crisis with large fiscal surpluses and low debt, which provided
important buffers to help deal with both the external and domestic shocks. The fiscal balance
has turned negative, despite a real decline in expenditure in 2009. In addition, the debt-to-Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) ratio has increased significantly, in part reflecting the impact of lower
energy prices on nominal GDP. Inflation has surged despite weak economic activity, reflecting
weather-related increases in food prices, but has begun to fall back, and unemployment has
increased sharply, to 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010. The external current account
balance sharply deteriorated in 2009 as energy prices fell, but is projected to recover in 2010.
The net international reserves position remains strong at over US$9 billion (14 months of
imports).

14

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
After substantive monetary easing in 2009, the resurgence of inflation in 2010 stalled further
policy rate reduction until more recently, when unease about the prolonged nature of the
slowdown overtook concerns about inflation. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT)
has lowered the repo rate over time since March 2009, most recently to 3.75 percent during
August-November 2010. Despite the easing, credit market activity remains weak and private
sector credit continues to fall. Recent reports indicate bank profitability is down and nonperforming loans up, but financial soundness indicators remain robust, and banks remain well
capitalized with risk-adjusted capital at around 23 percent in September 2010.
The collapse of the CL Financial Group in January 2009 accentuated the economic slowdown.
A government intervention of three financial subsidiaries helped contain contagion, but has
been costly.
Growth is expected to pick up in 2011, with the near-term risks tilted to the downside reflecting
fragile confidence, the weak regional outlook, and global uncertainty. Even with the expected
firming of energy prices, economic prospects over the medium term are projected to be weaker
compared to the strong growth period preceding the economic crisis.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that Trinidad and Tobago has been hit hard by the global
financial crisis, and commended the authorities for the continued prudent macroeconomic
policies that helped mitigate the impact of external shocks. Directors observed that,
notwithstanding the improving global conditions and the rebound in commodity prices, economic
activity remains weak and the near-term outlook is affected by uncertainty. They recognized that
the immediate challenge is to restore confidence by providing a supportive policy mix and
addressing remaining weaknesses in the financial system.
Directors supported the 2010/11 budget, which is appropriately geared toward reinvigorating the
economy, and encouraged the authorities to accelerate its implementation. They agreed that
once the economic recovery is well established, fiscal policy should aim towards reducing public
debt and rebuilding buffers in the medium term. This objective could be achieved by reversing
the large increases in current expenditures that occurred during the boom years, while ensuring
adequate social spending and investment to promote economic diversification. They also called
for strengthening tax administration.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is broadly
appropriate. They suggested that, in case of further delays in economic recovery and weaker
inflationary pressures, the authorities consider additional interest rate reductions to signal their
commitment to a supportive policy. Directors welcomed the central bank’s recent efforts to
alleviate the pressures on the foreign exchange market and encouraged the authorities to

improve liquidity management. Over the medium term, greater exchange rate flexibility could be
considered to support the expansion of non-energy exports and to rebalance consumption.
Directors commended the authorities for moving forward with the restructuring of the failed
insurance company CLICO while containing the ensuing fiscal costs. They supported the
decision to provide a liquidity window for credit unions dealing with their claims on the company
and open a compassionate window for particularly vulnerable individuals.
Directors welcomed the resilience of the banking system and insurance sectors in the face of
the global slowdown and the collapse of a large financial conglomerate. They highlighted the
importance of remaining vigilant to possible spillovers of the financial distress into the non-bank
financial sector and encouraged the authorities to implement promptly the recommendations of
the first ever Financial Stability Module. They noted that major steps are needed to strengthen
the regulation and supervision of the financial sector, including implementing consolidated
supervision, broadening the perimeter of regulation, addressing the remaining problems in the
insurance sector, and improving legislation dealing with failed financial institutions.
Directors highlighted that the medium- and long-term growth prospects are challenging as the
country’s energy resources are declining. They observed that the authorities need to strike a
balance between saving energy revenues for future generations with investing today to lay the
foundations for sustained non-energy growth. They welcomed the government’s initiatives
aimed at improving the business climate, facilitating private sector entrepreneurship, and
promoting diversification.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to improve the statistical infrastructure.
They underscored the importance of reliable key macroeconomic data to provide a basis for
informed policy making. They welcomed the authorities’ planned move to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Trinidad and Tobago and
Nicole Des Vignes, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 21, 2011

1.

The authorities of Trinidad and Tobago thank Mrs. Gold and her team for the highquality dialogue during the Article IV Consultation mission and for their candid and
useful policy advice. They also thank the MCM mission team for the in-depth analysis
and recommendations on the financial system.

2.

Since the last Article IV Consultation in January 2009, the economic circumstances in
Trinidad and Tobago have changed. Trinidad and Tobago was well positioned to face
the crisis, having strong international reserves, significant accumulated savings in the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund, and ample fiscal space. Moreover, the unemployment
rate had fallen to only 3.9 percent at the end of 2008. As a consequence of the global
financial and economic crisis, real GDP declined for the first time in fifteen years and
both the fiscal and external balances turned negative. The collapse of CL Financial in
early 2009 added further to the challenges. Following a year of subdued economic
activity in 2010, the immediate focus of the authorities is on restoring growth while
maintaining fiscal and debt sustainability.

Recent Economic Developments

3.

Against the backdrop of a fragile global recovery, regional economic challenges and
uncertainty in the domestic economy, growth in 2010 remained flat. The energy sector is
estimated to have increased in 2010, while the rate of decline in the non-energy sector
has slowed. The unemployment rate doubled since end-2008 (staff estimates a rate of
7.8 percent at end - 2010). Despite weak domestic demand, inflation remained a
challenge in 2010, mainly due to higher food prices caused by weather-related supply
shocks in the agricultural sector. Staff has raised the issue of a possible upward bias in
the calculation of the Retail Price Index, which could lead to consistent overestimation
of headline inflation. Our authorities appreciated the advice and are taking steps to
revise the methodology and the index in 2011.

4.

The balance of payments returned to a surplus position in 2010 in light of the more
favorable energy prices. At the end of 2010, the level of gross international reserves in
months of imports stood at around 14. With a more buoyant external position, Central
Bank’s support to the foreign exchange market to ease periodic demand pressures in
2010 was lower than in 2009. Moreover, the exchange rate remained relatively stable
throughout the year, with the weighted average selling rate depreciating to US$1 =
TT$6.4234 at the end of December 2010 from US$1 = TT$6.3794 at the beginning of
the year.

2
5.

The authorities continue to monitor the developments in the foreign exchange market
with a view to identifying emerging imbalances as a basis for policy adjustment. The
data indicate that requests for foreign exchange are met relatively quickly and that
clients do not have to wait an inordinate length of time to obtain foreign exchange.

6.

On the monetary front, the authorities faced the dual challenge of containing inflationary
pressures while supporting the economic recovery. In light of the weak economic
recovery and the stabilization of core inflation around 4 percent, the monetary policy
stance for 2010 was accommodative. Accordingly, the repo rate was lowered from 5
percent in January 2010 to 3.75 percent currently. Further, there has been an involuntary
build-up of excess liquidity in the banking system which has served to depress shortterm interest rates.

7.

Recently revised data show that the outturn for the fiscal year 2010
(October 2009 – September 2010) was much better than anticipated, with the central
government deficit (excluding CLICO support) narrowing to 0.3 percent of GDP.
Revenue collection was much higher than projected due to more favorable energy
receipts while spending was lower. The public sector debt, which had been on a
declining trend, began rising in 2009. While the current debt levels are manageable and
well below those of many countries in the Caribbean, the authorities are concerned about
debt sustainability. Accordingly, they have requested technical assistance from MCM in
public debt management and a mission visited Trinidad and Tobago in December to
conduct a preliminary assessment.

Outlook for 2011 and Addressing the Macroeconomic Challenges

8.

The authorities largely agree with staff’s outlook for 2011. The economy is expected to
recover, although risks remain on the downside. The budget highlights several fiscal and
other measures aimed at stimulating activity, diversifying the economy, revitalizing the
energy sector, encouraging new investment, improving competitiveness, and nurturing
small business development and innovation.

9.

The fiscal deficit is expected to widen in 2011 as the authorities’ policy stance remains
expansionary. Over the medium term, the authorities are committed to fiscal prudence
and will seek to bring the fiscal position back into balance. They prefer a gradual
approach to fiscal consolidation as they must also balance this with the growth objective
while safeguarding the social safety net.

10. The authorities are working towards resolving a number of outstanding issues such as
the CL Financial/CLICO issue, settlement of public sector wage negotiations, payment
of outstanding arrears to contractors and VAT refunds to businesses to support private
sector confidence and the overall business environment. A loan from the IDB has been

3
secured to support the execution of the public sector investment program, which is
geared to improving the socio-economic infrastructure of the country and should boost
economic activity.
11. The authorities are taking steps to support the vitality of the energy sector given its
importance to economic growth, foreign exchange earnings, and government revenues.
Accordingly, the government has revised the Petroleum Taxes Act to help stimulate
activity in Deep Water Blocks and in the crude oil sector. The government also believes
that the country is well positioned to benefit from the export of energy advisory services.
The government’s energy policy also promotes the development of alternative sources to
supplement the exhaustible crude oil and natural gas resources. These measures, which
include lower taxes, investment tax credit, and other incentives, became effective
January 1, 2011.
12. Further, plans are afoot to improve the business environment and enhance private sector
development. To make it easier to do business, the authorities are in the process of
establishing the International Business Centre (IBC), which in conjunction with the
Economic Development Board and the Competitiveness and Innovation Council will be
responsible for designing an innovation and investment strategy for the country. Also, a
number of initiatives are being undertaken to help encourage small business
development and innovation.
13. Monetary policy will focus on supporting the economic recovery while carefully
monitoring inflation. The rate of inflation is expected to decline in 2011 as the
authorities implement measures in the agriculture sector to boost domestic food
production.
Financial Sector Developments

14. The first ever Financial Stability Module was conducted on Trinidad and Tobago’s
financial system and the findings of this mission are well documented in the Financial
System Stability Assessment. According to the findings, the banking and insurance
sectors remained resilient in spite of the global financial crisis, the CL Financial shock
and the slowdown in economic activity. Of note, stress tests show that with the present
capital and liquidity buffers the banks are well positioned to withstand severe shocks.
However, rising non-performing loans and concentration risk presents vulnerabilities. In
the insurance sector (excluding CLICO), the larger life and general insurance companies
are profitable and well capitalized. While areas of weaknesses remain to be addressed,
staff recognized that the authorities have taken major steps to strengthen the regulatory
and supervisory framework of the banking and insurance sectors since the 2005 FSAP.

4
15. The authorities are working quickly to resolving the issue of CL Financial and CLICO.
As highlighted in the budget, the authorities have separated CLICO’s insurance business
from its short-term investments and mutual funds business, with the intentions of
merging the insurance businesses of CLICO and British American Trinidad (BAT) into
a single entity for divestment. Further, they have decided on a payment strategy for the
CLICO and BAT policy holders, which has been amended since the passage of the
budget to accommodate the affected credit and trade unions, given their importance and
wide coverage. Payments in 2011 will be made to individuals holding short-term
deposits and mutual funds up to a maximum of TT$75,000. Those individuals with
policies valued in excess of TT$75,000 will be paid the remainder in the form of a
twenty-year bond at zero interest rate, which could be traded in the secondary market.
With respect to the affected credit and trade unions, they will be paid 50 percent of their
exposures in 2011 and the remainder in 2012. In addition, a compassionate window has
been established to assist individuals in emergency situations. The authorities are in the
process of reviewing the CL Financial and its subsidiaries to divest assets and recover
public funds.
Data Development

16. In late 2009, an IMF statistical mission visited Trinidad and Tobago to identify gaps in
Trinidad and Tobago’s macroeconomic data sets and to help the country prepare for
subscription to the SDDS. A national co-ordinating committee has been set up and key
data sets for the monetary, financial and balance of payments domains have been
prepared. The authorities are working to provide data sets on nominal GDP and the
fiscal statistics on a more timely and consistent basis. The Central Statistical Office will
also be rebasing the CPI and the Index of Domestic Production.
