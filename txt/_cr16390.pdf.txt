IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Burkina Faso
On December 16, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund concluded the
2016 Article IV Consultation with Burkina Faso.1 The Board also completed the sixth Review of
Burkina Faso’s economic performance under a three-year program supported by the IMF’s
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement; a press release on this was issued separately.
Economic activity started to rebound in 2016, after two years of weak growth. The January
terrorist attacks and delays in approving the budget weighed on activity in the early part of 2016,
but activity has rebounded and real GDP growth is now projected at 5.4 percent, improving from
4.0 percent in 2015. The recovery is being led by the coming on stream of two new gold mines
and a sharp projected rebound in agricultural output in late 2016-early 2017, after three
disappointing years. Inflation continued to decline and is expected to remain subdued at 0.6
percent at end-year. Private sector credit growth remained weak in 2015 at 7.0 percent, and is
only expected to gradually recover to 9.4 percent in 2016. The government approved an
ambitious five-year national economic and social development plan (PNDES) in July. The plan
aims at transforming the economy to achieve strong, sustainable and resilient growth that will
create jobs and raise living standards.
The recovery is expected to consolidate in 2017 with growth being projected to rise to 6.1
percent as domestic and external conditions remain supportive. In particular, a scaled up public
infrastructure investment program, a supportive monetary stance, higher agricultural output and
continued low international prices for energy imports should assist the recovery. Implementation
of the authorities’ PNDES will lead to an increase in public investment, notably aimed at closing
energy and transport infrastructure gaps. In that context, the fiscal deficit is set to widen to 3.6
percent of GDP.
Program performance remains strong and the authorities have advanced important reforms to
create the conditions for sustained medium-term economic performance and poverty reduction.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2
Reforms include, most notably, actions to improve tax administration, broaden the tax base, and
improve the management and financial health of the publicly-owned energy utilities. In addition,
the authorities have embarked upon a comprehensive five-year development agenda to tackle
growth bottlenecks and support job-rich, poverty-reducing, sustainable growth, which focuses on
increasing physical and human capital, improving the business environment, expanding financial
access, and lower the cost of energy.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued strong performance under their Fundsupported program and the improving economic outlook after two years of weaker growth.
Looking ahead, Directors emphasized that sustaining higher economic growth rates will require
sound policies that create fiscal space to sustainably and gradually scale up public investment
and address infrastructure gaps, and ambitious structural reforms that will reduce barriers to
higher and more inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the progress made in 2016 in mobilizing higher domestic revenue. They
noted that, in addition to continued enhancements in tax and customs administration, efforts to
expand the tax base will be needed to achieve revenue objectives. Directors welcomed the
envisaged measures to protect the tax base from transfer pricing practices, particularly in the
mining sector. They agreed that containing recurrent spending, particularly the wage bill, will
also be necessary to create adequate fiscal space for key public investment projects. Directors
recommended continuing with ongoing reforms in the energy and cotton sector to avoid the
buildup of contingent liabilities and the need for subsidies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ comprehensive National Economic and Social Development
Plan. They emphasized the importance of careful prioritization and sequencing of public
investment projects, as well as effective implementation of measures to improve absorptive
capacity. In particular, Directors cautioned against a too rapid increase in public investment that
would negatively impact its efficiency and debt sustainability. They recommended further
improvements in public financial and debt management, and noted that a Public Investment
Management Assessment could help identify bottlenecks and improve the rate of execution of
the investment budget.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue improving the competitiveness of the economy.
They welcomed the authorities’ focus on alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks, fostering more
dynamism in the agricultural sector, and enabling the financial sector to better support the real
economy. Directors noted that recent reforms in the energy sector have improved the financial

health of the state-owned energy companies and that these successes should be consolidated and
built upon to support critical investments to increase electricity supply.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso will take place in
accordance with the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycles for members with Fund
arrangements.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
SIXTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT, AND REQUESTS FOR MODIFICATION OF A
PERFORMANCE CRITERION, EXTENSION OF THE
ARRANGEMENT AND AUGMENTATION OF ACCESS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context. Growth is projected at 5.4 percent for 2016 and 6.1 percent for 2017, owing to
higher gold production and a rebound in agriculture and services. The authorities have
published their National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES), which envisages
an ambitious scaling up of investment over the next 5 years. Given limited financing and
absorption capacity, staff recommends a more gradual approach, consistent with mediumterm debt sustainability.
Risks. External conditions (oil and commodity prices, easy regional monetary policy, positive
spillovers from Côte d’Ivoire, abundant rainfall) are exceptionally favorable but could easily
reverse. On the domestic side, remaining security concerns, social pressures that could lead
to higher wages and transfers at the expense of investment, inadequate resource
mobilization or capacity bottlenecks could hamper PNDES implementation.
Policy recommendations:



Carefully prioritize, sequence and monitor implementation of public investments,
focusing on critical infrastructure projects.



Sustain reforms to mobilize domestic revenue, including by expanding the tax base



Implement a strategy to curb the growth of the wage bill. Perform job audits to
support recruitment and retrenchment decisions as well as performance-based pay.



Support structural transformation by continuing with energy reforms to boost
electricity supply, implementing an agricultural diversification strategy and enhancing
the population’s access to financial services.

Program performance and status. Program implementation remains strong. All
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets have been met, as well as most
structural benchmarks. The 4th/5th ECF reviews were approved on June 10, 2016. The current
ECF arrangement expires on December 26, 2016, but the authorities are requesting a small
augmentation of 3.7 percent of quota and a nine-months extension of the current
arrangement to allow for the disbursement of re-phased amounts.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. A New Strategy to Boost Growth in the Medium Term
1.
The government approved an ambitious five-year national economic and social
development plan (PNDES) in July 2016 (Box 1). Following two years of subdued growth
(estimated at about 4 percent in 2014-15), the new government is under pressure to deliver rapid
and tangible improvements in living standards. The plan’s total estimated cost is US$26 billion or 225
percent of 2016 GDP over 2016-20, of which over half or US$14.2 billion would be dedicated to
priority investments. The authorities intend to seek official and private financing for a list of about 80
PNDES projects totaling US$10½ billion at a roundtable scheduled for December 7-8, 2016 in Paris.
Box 1. Burkina Faso: The New National Development Strategy (PNDES)
The government approved an ambitious five-year national economic and social development plan
(PNDES) in July 2016. The plan aims at structurally transforming the Burkinabe economy, to achieve strong,
sustainable resilient and inclusive growth that will create jobs and raise living standards. The plan is based on
three strategic axes: (i) economic governance; (ii) human capital development; and (iii) structural transformation
of the economy and private sector development.
The plan aims at reaching a number of key objectives by 2020:


Achieve annual growth rates of about 7.7 percent over 2016-200 and create 50,000 jobs per year.



Reduce the poverty rate from 40.1 percent in 2014 to below 35 percent by 2020.



Lower the population growth rate from 3.1 percent in 2006 to 2.7 percent by 2020.

The PNDES envisages that public investment would increase from 9 to 17 percent of GDP in 2017 and
remain elevated thereafter. The plan thus

Recent incidents highlight remaining political and security risks, though the overall
situation is calm. On October 8 the security forces foiled a coup attempt by former presidential
guard soldiers who were also aiming to free the leaders of the September 2015 coup. Sporadic
terrorist attacks at the borders with Mali and Niger continue. In response, the authorities are
stepping up security.

Economic activity has started to rebound in the second quarter of 2016. The January
terrorist attacks and the delays in approving the 2016 budget weighed on activity in Q1 but output
rebounded at 8.3 percent in Q2 (y/y). Real GDP growth is now projected at 5.4 percent for the year.
The recovery is led by services (+11.3 percent), and followed by the secondary sector (+4.8 percent),
boosted by the onset of production of

(MEFP ¶18). The 2016 budget was

BURKINA FASO

revised a second time in July 2016 to include about 1 percentage point of GDP in additional revenue
compared with the program. About half of this increase was due to one-off dividend payments from
the state-owned hydrocarbon importer, SONABHY, and the remainder was reflected in a lower
deficit. Public investment budget execution stood at only 50 percent as of end-September despite an
acceleration in the pace of execution (Text Figure 2). The overall 2016 deficit is now projected at 2.5
percent of GDP, compared with 3 percent of GDP at the time of the 4th/5th ECF review (Figure 3,
Tables 2a-2b, MEFP ¶19).
5.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow only slightly from 8 to 7.7 percent of
GDP, given large intermediary goods’ imports. Ongoing mining construction and higher public
investment are expected to lead to a 7.9 percent increase in imports in 2016, only partially offset by
the increased values of gold exports resulting from the recovery in gold prices. Mining investment
and the return to political stability are also driving a projected rebound in FDI inflows, to 2.5 percent
of GDP compared with 2 percent of GDP in 2015 (Figure 2, Table 4, MEFP ¶2).
6.

Program performance remains strong.



All continuous and end-June quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets were met,
most by wide margins. Non-concessional borrowing amounted to CFAF 205 billion in June and is
expected to reach CFAF 229 billion by end-December, close to the CFAF 230 billion program
ceiling (Appendix Table 1, MEFP ¶5).



Six end-June structural benchmarks (SBs) were met on time, and one was implemented with
delay (transmission of quarterly financial accounts of the hydrocarbon company, SONABHY).
Progress is being made on the final SB, implementation of standardized VAT invoicing for large
and medium enterprises, and it is expected to be implemented by January 1st, 2017 (MEFP ¶5).



The July benchmark to transfer CFAF 5 billion in windfall profits from SONABHY to the state
electricity utility (SONABEL) was met, and the authorities have completed in advance the second
transfer of CFAF 35 billion from SONABHY to SONABEL, thereby clearing CFAF 40 billion in
arrears, out of a total of CFAF 66 billion. The authorities have requested to reprogram the
November benchmark on control of fuel losses during transport owing to delays in securing the
electronic tracking equipment. The bolting of manholes on all trucks and installation of seals and
electronic tracking equipment along the Benin and Niger corridor will be implemented by
December 2016, with the full deployment to be finalized in the first quarter of 2017 (Appendix
Tables 2-3, MEFP ¶6).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Policy discussions focused on near-term challenges and a medium-term policy
framework to support PNDES objectives. The immediate challenge is to overcome deep-seated
bottlenecks and accelerate execution of public investment, while tilting the composition of the
budget away from recurrent expenditure and towards productive investment in human and physical
capital. At the same time, inadequate energy supply, lack of economic diversification and low access
to credit are hindering private sector development and job creation. Accordingly, the Article IV

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

consultation’s two policy themes were how to create fiscal space to enable a sustainable scaling up
of public investment, and how to support structural transformation and inclusive growth. The mission
organized an outreach event to present analytical background work on investment scaling up,
options to contain the wage bill and the drivers of financial inclusion in Burkina Faso. The event
allowed for a frank exchange of views with a broad cross-section of the administration.
8.
Previous Article IV discussions focused on similar issues and the authorities have made
progress in implementing past recommendations in spite of disruptions associated with the
political transition. Positive outcomes include continued reduction in inequality and poverty, the
adoption of the 2015 Mining Code, and implementation of external audit recommendations by the
two state-owned energy companies (Table 9).

A. Outlook and Risks
Outlook
9.
The recovery is expected to gather strength in the near term, with growth reaching 6.1
percent in 2017 and remaining at potential at about 6.5 percent over the medium term.
Favorable agricultural prospects, the coming on stream of two new mining projects and higher
construction and services activity linked to the public investment program would consolidate the
recovery in 2017. Going forward, medium-term growth projections in the range of 6½ percent are
supported by the expected improvements in energy supply and new mining operations including,
gradually, the Tambao manganese project (Text Table 1, MEFP ¶14).
10.
The baseline fiscal framework
envisages a moderate widening of the
deficit to about 3.5 percent of GDP
over the medium term to support a
gradual scaling up of investment. For
2017, staff’s baseline is aligned with the
draft budget’s revenue, recurrent
spending and externally-financed
investment projections. However, the
draft budget also envisages a nearly 2½fold increase in domestically-financed
investment, from 5.2 to 12.4 percent of
GDP, predicated on optimistic
assumptions about budget support, and
implies a 1½ percent of GDP financing
gap. Staff noted that, based on
discussions with development partners,
current budget support commitments for
2017 were about a third of the budgeted
amount (CFAF 110 billion compared with

CFAF 336 billion in the budget). This constrains domestically-financed investment to about 7.3
percent of GDP, still a 2 percentage points increase from 2016. In this baseline scenario, the overall
deficit would widen to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2017. Over the medium term, efforts to raise domestic
revenue and contain recurrent spending would open up fiscal space for public investment, which
would reach 13 percent of GDP by 2019 (Text Figure 3).
11.
At the authorities’ request, staff prepared an alternative scenario including higher
investment based on additional donor financing and measures to enhance execution capacity.
The authorities indicated that they expected new official and private commitments to fund the
PNDES in the context of the December 7-8 donor round table in Paris and of the new IDA18
envelope. Staff and the authorities also agreed that higher public investment execution rates should
be possible based on measures already taken, including the timely adoption of the 2017 budget, the
announcement of all public tenders by November and the careful selection and close monitoring of
key infrastructure projects (MEFP ¶34). The alternative scenario thus assumes that investment would
return to its 2013 level and increase by an additional 2 percentage points, financed by higher budget
support (mostly grants) in line with historical averages of about 3 percent of GDP.1 In this scenario,
the overall deficit would widen to about 4 percent of GDP in 2017 with a small remaining financing
gap, but would converge to the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent of GDP by 2019. Boosted
by higher infrastructure investment, real GDP growth would increase to 6.8 percent in 2017 and
about 7 percent in the medium term (Text Table 1, Table 1a).

Both scenarios would be consistent with medium-term debt sustainability. Debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) results indicate that public debt would remain sustainable, with the
public external debt-to-GDP ratio increasing by less than 2 percentage points of GDP between 2015
1 The investment scaling up included in staff’s alternative scenario is an increase of about 5 percentage points of GDP
in 2017, compared with an increase of 7.6 percentage points in the authorities’ PNDES. The implications of the full
investment scaling up envisaged in the PNDES are discussed in Box 4.

and 2019. The risk of debt distress would remain moderate as the debt-to-GDP ratio would breach
the threshold under the historical scenario and most extreme shock in 2033. Under the alternative
scenario, Burkina Faso’s debt sustainability improves slightly as increases in GDP, revenues, and
exports offset additional borrowing over the medium term. The risk of debt distress would remain
moderate as the breaches of relevant thresholds occur at similar points than under the baseline
scenario.2 Nonetheless, the favorable outcome in the alternative scenario depends on several
assumptions for which there are downside risks. Specifically, the scenario depends on success in
mobilizing additional domestic revenues, access to significant new grant financing, and a high
growth impact from infrastructure spending. Results would be less positive with use of costly
domestic or external non-concessional debt financing and if capacity bottlenecks were to undercut
the growth impact of new infrastructure spending.
13.
Like the rest of the region, Burkina Faso is benefiting from the confluence of favorable
external conditions, but risks of reversal are high. The exceptional alignment of low oil prices,
firmer gold and cotton prices, easy ECB monetary policy and the euro depreciation, together with
abundant rainfall, support the positive short-term outlook. Since the end of the political crisis there,
rapid growth in Côte d’Ivoire is also generating positive spillovers given strong trade, FDI and
remittance linkages (Box 2). Given Burkina Faso’s narrow production and export base, the impact of
a reversal of any of these positive external factors would be magnified. Further terrorist attacks
would undermine confidence and investment. In addition, a crowding out of the regional debt
market by larger issuances from Côte d’Ivoire and/or Senegal could make it more difficult and
expensive for the government to issue domestic debt. Domestic risks are also significant. Social
pressures could lead to higher wages and transfers at the expense of investment, and inadequate
resource mobilization or absorption capacity could hamper execution of the public investment
program (Table 6).
Authorities’ views
14.
Given existing budget support commitments, the authorities agreed that domesticallyfinanced investment would be limited to the amounts presented in staff’s baseline scenario,
implying an overall deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP in 2017. They also indicated that they would
pursue investment in amounts larger than programmed only if additional concessional financing
could be identified, along the lines of the alternative scenario with the deficit expanding to no more
than 4 percent of GDP in 2017, but returning to 3 percent by 2019 (MEFP ¶28). They however
emphasized that new investments financed under Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) could bring
growth closer to the rates envisaged in the PNDES (see Box 1) with moderate budgetary implications.
They took note of the external risks associated with reversals in the favorable terms of trade and
financing conditions (MEFP ¶29). They also indicated that they have taken a number of measures to
mitigate domestic risks, including improving security and intelligence systems, enhancing social
cohesion and making the justice system work for all. Moreover, they are determined to continue

16.
Delays in budget support disbursements could complicate budget execution toward
the end of the year. An amount of up to CFAF 89 billion (1.3 percent of GDP) of budget support is
at risk of not being disbursed by the end of the year. In their efforts to ensure adequate liquidity to
conclude 2016 and to start implementing the 2017 budget, the authorities have issued T-bills and
bonds in the local and regional markets in excess of 2016 financing needs by CFAF 114 billion. This
liquidity could compensate for the temporary budget support shortfall, but at a higher interest cost.
As a precaution, the authorities are requesting an increase in the program adjuster for net domestic
financing from CFAF 65 billion to CFAF 90 billion so that this key performance criterion would not be
missed if the programmed budget support doesn’t materialize.
17.
The 2017 budget reflects the authorities’ goal to expand fiscal space for priority
investments.

together with new efforts to fight smuggling, would support higher revenue collection (MEFP
¶18, 23-24).



Recurrent spending would decline somewhat on account of measures to streamline
transfers and contain pressures on the wage bill. The authorities intend to continue to
rationalize payroll and recruitment management and to conduct regular payroll audits to
eliminate ghost workers.3 Expenditure on goods and services would decline slightly owing to
measures to limit utility and transport bills of State bodies. Transfers would benefit from a
reduction in energy subsidies driven by low world prices and ongoing energy sector reforms, as
well as a reduction in other categories of transfers (MEFP ¶26). Staff cautioned that more specific
measures to contain the wage bill would be needed to overcome the permanent base effects
associated with the 2016 wage increases.

18.
The 2017 fiscal program could however accommodate a larger investment plan than
envisaged in the baseline scenario, provided additional budget support financing becomes
available. Staff noted that existing budget support commitments amounted to only 1.4 percent of
GDP, less than half of their 2010-13 average of 3 percent of GDP (Text Table 4). On this basis,
domestically-financed investment would be limited to about 7.3 percent of GDP. However, provided
budget support financing increases back to historical averages and the measures taken to increase

Further improvements in budget and Treasury management are warranted to prevent
the recurrence of domestic arrears. Cash management has improved, with reported domestic
arrears stemming from pending payments eliminated by March 2016. Nonetheless, the full 2015
annual audit report (June SB) identified non-trivial domestic arrears of about 1.1 percent of GDP.
These include amounts due on mostly valid contracts and procurement procedures (about 0.5
percent of GDP) but which were not executed within the fiscal year, and another category of
“irregular” arrears, where not all procedures have been followed (about 0.6 percent of GDP). The
authorities noted that they aim at gradually regularizing legitimate arrears and have allocated an
amount of about CFAF 18 billion in the 2016 budget to that effect. They will conduct a careful review
of “irregular” arrears and decide on their treatment on a case-by-case basis (new SB), and are
committed to implementing the remaining audit recommendations (MEFP ¶37).
Structural Policies to Unlock Fiscal Space
Boosting Domestic Revenue
20.
The authorities are considering options to maximize domestic revenue mobilization
over the medium term, including the establishment of a semi-autonomous revenue authority
(SARA). Drawing on regional experience, the authorities hope to obtain efficiency gains by merging
the customs and tax administrations into a single entity with greater management autonomy. Staff
noted that the experience with SARAs appeared to have been most positive when existing
institutional structures were deficient, for example due to political capture, low staff morale or a lack
of information exchange between tax and customs administrations. However, in Burkina Faso’s case,
the customs and tax administration are making significant progress in recovering the ground lost
during the transition and are in the midst of comprehensive reforms, including plans to establish a
land registry to optimize property tax collection, the review of the tax code in 2017, and the
interconnection of SYDONIA with neighboring countries. Given the ambitious revenue objectives for
2017 onwards, it would be important to maintain this momentum before considering deeper

structural changes. Staff also cautioned that such a reform entails significant costs, and that careful
preparation would be essential to successfully transition to a new administrative structure.

If managed efficiently, natural resource revenue can be an important source of
investment financing. A recent FAD technical assistance mission on transfer pricing policy identified
a series of measures designed to increase the mining tax base. The authorities are considering these
recommendations as they draft the implementing regulations to the 2015 Mining Code, the 2017
budget law, and consequential amendments to the general tax code (Text Table 5).

the costs and benefits of establishing a single revenue authority. They also agreed that ongoing
reforms, in particular those aiming at strengthening the organization and systems of the tax
administration ought to be fully implemented before a new organizational structure could be
considered. They welcomed the Fund’s technical assistance on transfer pricing, noting that they

Tilting Spending Composition towards Investment
23.
Scaling-up public investment while maintaining project quality and debt sustainability
will require sustained efforts to strengthen project planning and implementation capacity.
Staff’s model-based analysis of the investment scaling up envisaged in the PNDES shows that the
size of the increase in investment could lead to a significant drop in efficiency as absorption capacity
constraints become binding. Furthermore, with limited availability of concessional financing, the
additional investment would have to be financed by resorting to higher domestic and nonconcessional external borrowing, which would not be consistent with medium-term debt
sustainability (Box 4, and Selected Issues Paper). In this context, reforms to address remaining
bottlenecks in the capacity to design, budget and execute investment projects are paramount to
ensuring that higher volumes of investment could be implemented without compromising quality
and cost-effectiveness. The authorities should however be mindful of the risks related to fast-track
procedures adopted to accelerate execution of public investment, particularly as regards complex
PPP projects. The resort to exceptional procurement procedures such as single sourcing should also
be discouraged as it could lead to poor project quality and/or high cost.

The authorities should design a medium-term strategy to contain the wage bill, while
addressing short-term pressures. Staff noted that, while the size of the civil service was below that
of other LICs, the wage bill was on
par or slightly higher (Text Figure 4

performance-based salary components or rationalizing allowances. As a first step, job audits could
be conducted to provide a basis for future recruitments/retrenchments, as well as for aligning pay
with performance.

Enhancing Debt Management Capacity. A key priority would be for the government to
provide additional resources to the debt office to develop its capacity to effectively manage
simultaneous increases in external and domestic borrowing, as well as the contingent liabilities
arising from public-private partnerships (MEFP ¶32). The authorities should also seek assistance in
preparing an integrated medium-term debt strategy to support PNDES implementation.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities recognize the importance of rebalancing expenditure in favor of the
capital budget and are taking steps to enhance investment efficiency and contain the wage
bill. The authorities have started to implement the recommendations from a recent FAD mission,
including the preparation of a new procurement code with World Bank support, and the
reorganization of the budget calendar to better integrate the investment plan in the overall budget
(new SB, MEFP ¶34). They noted that the move to program budgeting would support
implementation of multi-year investment projects. In addition, they are requesting a Public
Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) for early 2017, in order to prepare a detailed action
plan to further improve project selection and monitor their implementation, as well as a framework
for managing PPPs (MEFP ¶33). On procurement, they noted their commitment to respecting the
WAEMU standard of limiting the resort to exceptional procedures to no more than 15 percent of the
total value of public contracts (MEFP ¶34). They also reiterated a separate request for capacity
building in managing contingent liabilities arising from PPPs, and noted that they would be
preparing a standard PPP contract ahead of the donor roundtable. They welcomed staff’s
suggestions to contain the wage bill and indicated their openness to considering further medium
term reforms along these lines (MEFP ¶35).

Box 4. Burkina Faso: Scaling Up Public Investment and Investment Efficiency
This box presents key implications of a large and rapid increase in public investment on public debt, in the
presence of absorption capacity constraints, using a general equilibrium model (DIGNAR).1
The analysis compared staff’s baseline scenario with a scenario associated with full implementation of the PNDES’
investment objectives for 2017-19. Given the size of the envisaged investment scaling up in the PNDES, which is
about twice as large for 2017 as under staff’s more optimistic alternative scenario, investment efficiency (initially
calibrated at 50 percent based on the average for LICs) is assumed to drop in the PNDES scenario as a result of
capacity constraints relating to the lack of complementary infrastructure, insufficient provision for maintenance
and supply bottlenecks. GDP growth is consequently lower than in the baseline due to lower productivity in both
the traded and nontraded sectors resulting from the relatively lower increments to the public capital stock.
Given limited availability of external concessional financing, residual financing for the PNDES scaling up is
assumed by the model to occur on non-concessional terms, which results in a marked increase in total public
debt, beyond the WAEMU ceiling of 70 percent of GDP by 2030. This is different from staff’s baseline and
alternative scenarios, where the higher investment is financed by additional budget support, and where efficiency
remains at about 50 percent supported by the implementation of measures to address absorption capacity
constraints. The scaling-up scenario is also characterized by lower welfare levels (proxied by the growth rate of
private consumption) and lower private investment, as the public investment crowds out available resources.

education and health, and political pressures to tackle urban youth underemployment. At current
levels of public compensation, an increase in the ratio of public employment to working-age population to
2.4%, which is likely to be attained within the next 10 years based on historical trend, would increase the
wage bill ratio to 10.3 percent of GDP, far above the 6.5 percent criterion adopted by the WAEMU countries.
Implementation of measures to moderate wage bill growth, stronger output growth and efforts to boost
revenue mobilization would improve sustainability indicators gradually, and bring them in line with the
WAEMU convergence criteria. The Selected Issues Paper also discusses selected country experiences with
public employment and compensation reforms for Burkina Faso and policy options.

mechanism should ensure that tariffs remain consistent with cost-recovery in order to maintain
the financial viability of the energy sector and to reduce future outlays on subsidies.


The PNDES should prioritize critical energy production projects and seek donor support to
help cover the energy deficit. The authorities’ strategy to expand electricity supply while
reducing production costs relies on three main pillars, for which they are seeking external official
and private funding: (i) increase domestic thermal generation and move from diesel to less costly
heavy fuel oil; (ii) significantly scale up renewable energy generation, with the first solar power
plant set to start operating in mid-2017; and (iii) expand cheaper energy imports from
neighboring countries in the

be to develop a unified, transparent framework which limits state contingent liabilities.

Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities reiterated that improving energy supply lies at the core of their
development strategy. They noted that the external monitoring committees for SONABHY and
SONABEL would be operational shortly, and that they are working towards activating the automatic
fuel price adjustment mechanism that had been approved in 2013. At the time, its implementation
had been frozen in the context of high oil prices and social tensions. They noted that the success of
this measure hinged on social acceptance and understanding of increased price flexibility, and that
they would prepare a communication plan by the end of the year (new SB, MEFP ¶44). Increasing the
reliance on solar power would help to gradually lower SONABEL’s production costs, and they
planned to establish a new renewable energies’ agency to help set standards and regulations for the
sector (MEFP ¶45).
Boosting competitiveness to support economic diversification
29.
Although price competitiveness has improved, serious structural obstacles stand in the
way of economic diversification and private sector development. Price competitiveness
developments have been relatively favorable in light of recent trends in the real effective exchange
rate and commodity prices. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 18 percent between
March 2014 and October 2016, mostly driven by the depreciation of the euro against major
currencies, in the context of low inflation in Burkina Faso and trading partners. The external stability
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

BURKINA FASO

assessment using EBA-lite methodologies finds that the current account and real effective exchange
rates are broadly in line with fundamentals (Annex 1). The overall business environment and
governance compare favorably with peers, but inadequate energy supply, poor contract
enforcement, and the lack of access to credit, mostly in the informal and rural sectors, remain among
the most binding growth constraints.
30.
A medium-term strategy to increase value-added in cotton production while also
moving to other high-value agricultural products is urgently needed to protect rural incomes
and reduce future calls on the budget. The cotton sector is the main source of agricultural
employment, and the agricultural sector accounts for 15 percent of GDP. However, staff noted that
long-term world price trends remain unfavorable, in spite of the recent uptick. Already the cotton
price stabilization fund has practically run out of resources and, while withdrawals are not foreseen
for the current or subsequent campaign, the authorities and cotton producers ought to agree on a
strategy to recapitalize the fund over the medium term. The size of producer subsidies would
continue to grow rapidly (CFAF 20 billion in the 2017 budget). Thus, staff noted that implementing a
strategy to increase value-added in the sector and, ultimately, branch out to other high-value
agricultural exports was a matter of urgency.
Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities agreed that lack of economic diversification was a source of external
vulnerability and an obstacle to inclusive and sustainable growth. They pointed out that the
PNDES emphasizes investments in water management projects, fertilizers, insurance mechanisms, to
boost agricultural productivity and support diversification toward high potential agricultural products
such as soy, sesame, shea butter, etc. They also noted that the PNDES has defined specific objectives
in terms of electricity supply, access to credit, and improvements in transport and telecommunication
infrastructures, as well as in the area of governance and quality of institutions.
Boosting credit to the private sector and expanding access to financial services
32.
While there are no concerns about financial stability, weak credit growth and high
lending concentration raise questions regarding the ability of the financial sector to support
private sector development. Private credit growth is projected to reach 9.4 percent in 2016 and to
average only about 14 percent in 2017-19, well below historical rates of 20-25 percent. The banking
system is sound, relatively profitable and well-capitalized, but credit is highly concentrated to a small
number of clients and a few sectors of the economy (Table 5). Going forward, in terms of macrofinancial linkages, staff sees risks that the macroeconomic context could continue to affect both the
quality and the quantity of credit to the economy. Specifically, the planned investment scaling up
could lead to further concentration and crowd out availability of loanable funds through two
channels: (i) the financing of contracts to implement public investment projects remains a major
driver of the demand for credit (lending for construction and public works already accounts for over
a quarter of total lending); and (ii) continued accumulation of government bonds given the PNDES’
objective to increasing domestic financing.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

33.
To mitigate these risks, staff recommended to urgently address the underlying
structural, cost and information barriers to deeper and broader access to credit (Box 6). Easier
access by financial institutions to credit information, which currently still requires clients’ consent, as
well as the establishment of a collateral registry, vertical integration of more agricultural sub-sectors
following the model of the cotton industry, and developing rural insurance schemes would all help
lower banks’ perceptions of credit risk for small and medium enterprises and agriculture. The
authorities should also look to successful examples in East Africa to develop a regulatory framework
that would allow the development of mobile banking services to their full potential.
Box 6. Burkina Faso: Financial Inclusion
Lack of financial access is an important bottleneck to growth and poverty reduction. Only about 15
percent of the population has a bank account and a much smaller share is using that account to save or
borrow from a financial institution. Similarly, utilization of mobile banking services remains very low, despite
the large number of cell phone subscribers.
As in the rest of the WAEMU and SSA, individuals’ access to credit varies according to key
demographic characteristics. Women are almost 30 percent less likely than men to hold a bank account,
and differences in access based on education or income are much larger. Nearly three-quarters of
respondents indicated their lack of bank account was involuntary so there seems to be considerable unmet
demand, mainly due to structural barriers such as lack of income but also cost, distance, documentation
requirements, etc. Given low access to formal bank credit, the use of informal arrangements such as reliance
on borrowing from family and friends remains predominant.
The regional and national authorities are making efforts to enhance financial inclusion. Recent
initiatives include the following:

 Regionally, the Council of Ministers for the WAEMU adopted a financial inclusion strategy for 2016-20.
The strategy revolves around five pillars, including promoting effective regulatory and legal frameworks,
strengthening the microfinance sector, and strengthening financial literacy. Identifying adequate
financing for the strategy and effective monitoring will be the key ingredients to its success.

 The authorities will finalize a national financial inclusion strategy in 2017. This will be an opportunity to
consolidate the various financial inclusion and microfinance initiatives and to prioritize the key reforms
that will facilitate improved financial access.

Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities had a more sanguine view than staff regarding the pick-up of credit
growth and highlighted that their new financial inclusion strategies would address a number
of staff’s recommendations. They noted that credit tended to lag growth in the region and did not
see potential private sector crowding out given the low base. The authorities also indicated that the
recent establishment of commercial courts could help facilitate settlements of claims and realization
of guarantees, which would also promote credit. They highlighted efforts already made to reduce the
documentation requirements, costs and fees related to banking services, including the elimination of
fees to open an account. The new regional and national financial inclusion strategies envisage
financial literacy and education programs to promote access to financial services broadly defined,
also including microfinance institutions. They were not considering establishing a collateral registry
at the moment, and indicated that the current mobile banking regulations requiring ownership of a
bank account to use mobile services were intended to protect users.

D. Statistical Issues
35.
The quality of national statistics is adequate for surveillance purposes, but there is a
lack of high-frequency indicators to monitor economic activity. Staff noted in particular that
monthly trade data and quarterly financial stability indicators could be made available with shorter
lags. The authorities are producing quarterly GDP estimates but these are subject to frequent and
significant revisions. Most importantly, staff regretted the further delays in adopting a new base year
for the annual national accounts, given that the current base year (1999) and related sector weights
do not reflect the current structure of the economy. Staff welcomed the completion of the informal
sector survey, but emphasized that it would be important to start the survey on the informal gold
sector before the end of the year (new SB) to ensure that its findings could inform the rebasing
exercise, which is expected to be completed by 2018, with 2015 as the new base year (MEFP ¶46).

PROGRAM MONITORING AND RISKS
36.
The current ECF arrangement expires in December 2016 and the authorities are
requesting a small augmentation of access and a 9-month extension to allow for disbursement
of rephrased amounts. Based on the authorities’ strong commitment to continue with ongoing
reforms, staff proposes to add an additional disbursement of SDR 4.47 million (3.7 percent of quota)
at the time of the proposed 7th review (Tables 7-8). The authorities have expressed their intention to
request a successor arrangement in the first half of 2017, once remaining external financing needs
following the December donor round-table are firmed up. Staff and the authorities have initiated a
joint review of performance under the current arrangement to inform program design (Annex 2).
37.
Staff and the authorities agreed on a set of program targets for the 7th ECF review. New
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets in line with the revised macro-framework are
presented in Appendix Table 1 (MEFP ¶47). These include an increase in the ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing (continuous performance criterion) by an amount of CFAF 125 billion or
about 1½ percent of GDP until the end of the program to allow for loan conventions on key
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BURKINA FASO

investment projects already in the pipeline to be signed (Appendix Table 2). The bulk of these
planned new loans would be from the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and the African
Development Bank (AfDB) and on very soft terms. Based on historic disbursement rates, the DSA
rating would not be affected by this new borrowing. New structural benchmarks focus on measures
to accelerate investment, boost revenue, continue with energy sector reforms and support the
rebasing of national accounts (Appendix Table 3, MEFP ¶46).
38.
Program risks. Given the strong performance so far and the authorities’ commitment to the
program, risks of slippages through end-2016 and 2017 are relatively small. Possible budget support
disbursement delays are mitigated by the availability of a sizeable cash buffer given frontloaded
domestic financing. The outlook is less certain for the medium term, as the pressures to rapidly ramp
up domestic and external borrowing may derail macroeconomic stability.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The macroeconomic outlook is improving after 2 years of weaker growth attributable
to sociopolitical tensions and weak commodity prices. Growth is expected to recover to 5.4
percent in 2016 and remain in the range of 6-7 percent for the period of the PNDES on the strength
of increased agricultural output and mining activity, and improved investment budget execution
leading to a narrowing of the infrastructure gap. Achieving this level of growth will however require
that the composition of spending is tilted further towards the capital budget to create the fiscal
space necessary for the PNDES to be properly implemented. In this regard, there are three critical
policy areas for the authorities to monitor carefully, as indicated below.
40.
First, domestic revenue mobilization has increased significantly in 2016 but the
challenge going forward will be to ensure that this progress is maintained. In the short term,
resolute and timely implementation of planned tax and customs administration measures including
the standardized VAT invoicing and enhanced coordination between the tax and customs services
would be essential to reach the revenue objectives. Over the medium term, these efforts need to be
bolstered by policy measures to increase the tax base and protect it from the effects of transfer
pricing practices in the mining sector. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to revise the tax code
in 2017 and stands ready to support the authorities in this and other revenue reforms.

Second, containing recurrent spending will be critical to ensuring adequate fiscal space
for key investment projects to be implemented. There are significant pressures to increase
recurrent spending in the wake of the sociopolitical events of the past two years. In addition, the
planned investments in the social sectors but also physical infrastructure will generate significant
recurrent costs over time, which need to be considered in medium-term budgets. The sustainability
of the public wage bill is a particular concern in light of recent decisions to increase both salaries and
employment levels and staff encourages the authorities to implement reforms that would contain its
further growth. The authorities should also take the necessary steps to ensure that any buildup of
contingent liabilities arising from subsidies in the energy and cotton sectors is avoided and that no
new arrears are accumulated.

Third, careful prioritization and sequencing of public investment projects, together
with measures to address remaining absorption capacity constraints are key to ensure the
success of a gradual scaling up strategy. Staff’s analysis has sought to demonstrate the risks
involved in a too rapid and massive increase in public investment. At the same time, provided
measures to address remaining absorption capacity constraints are implemented and additional
financing is made available, the authorities could execute a somewhat higher volume of investment
than currently envisaged in the baseline scenario. The authorities are determined to build on recent
reforms in the area of procurement and count on the PIMA mission to provide further
recommendations to accelerate investment execution while maintaining quality and costeffectiveness.
43.
Inadequate electricity supply remains a key growth bottleneck and staff welcomes
continued progress with energy sector reforms. In particular, recent advances in improving the
financial situation of the two energy state companies should be consolidated to ensure the
sustainability of these reforms. As a result of careful management of the windfall arising from the fall
in international oil prices, the state electricity company is now practically covering its recurrent costs
and is in a position to implement critical investments to improve electricity supply going forward,
including in renewable energies. Ensuring adequate funding for these key projects, including from
the government’s budget, will be essential to the success of the government’s development strategy.
44.
The authorities are encouraged to pursue efforts to address fundamental barriers that
limit the overall competitiveness of the economy. Priority areas include alleviating infrastructure
bottlenecks, increasing productivity and value-added in the agricultural sector, diversifying the
economy, and enabling the financial sector to better support inclusive growth. While the REER is
broadly in equilibrium, the export base remains narrow, and the economy vulnerable to terms of
trade shocks. In addition to removing energy and transport infrastructure bottlenecks, structural
competitiveness indicators highlight that reforms to the justice system for more reliable contract
enforcement and trade facilitation measures could be prioritized. Enhancing access to financial
services is essential to support economic diversification and structural transformation. The
authorities’ financial inclusion strategies recognize existing challenges. Inasmuch as possible, efforts
should focus on addressing underlying structural, cost and information barriers to a broader
distribution of credit in the economy.
45.
The authorities’ performance under the ECF-supported program remains strong with
all continuous and end-June program targets met and all but two structural benchmarks
completed on time. On that basis, and given the strength of policy commitments going forward,
staff supports the completion of the 6th review of the current ECF-supported program. Staff also
supports the authorities’ request for a 9-month extension and a 3.7 percent of quota augmentation
of access under the current ECF arrangement, and for the modification of the continuous
performance criterion on non-concessional borrowing.
46.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation for Burkina Faso be held on the 24month cycle.

Likelihood

Potential Impact

Policies to Minimize
Impact

External
Rise in populism
contributes to
structurally weak
growth in key
advanced and
emerging markets and
sharp growth
slowdown in China.

Medium

Slow growth in advanced and
emerging economies might hit
the Burkinabè economy via
low prices and demand for key
exports (gold and cotton),
deteriorating the current
account.

Accumulate and preserve
adequate international reserve
buffers. Diversify economic
structure and export markets.

A slowdown in neighboring
Cote d’Ivoire could negatively
impact export demand and
remittances flows.

Lower growth in Cote
d’Ivoire

Domestic

Continuing terrorist
attacks

Pressures for higher
recurrent spending

Delays in PFM reforms

Medium

Economic growth would
remain relatively depressed, as
investors are discouraged and
productive public investment
is diverted into security
spending.

Accelerate efforts to restore
and strengthen functional
security services following the
political transition.

High

An accumulation of pent-up
demand for higher social and
infrastructure spending which
could destabilize budget
sustainability.

Limit spending proposals to
priority areas, particularly as
regards recurrent spending.
Ensure that domestic revenue
mobilization increases in step
with spending plans.

Medium–
High

Ineffective public spending
could also compromise the
recovery process by adding to
growth constraints, particularly
in the energy sector.
Recurrence of build-up in
arrears.

Encourage necessary reforms
to improve PFM to guarantee
benefits of oil price windfall.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline. The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Recommendation
Taking account of the sharp increase in gold mining
revenues in the previous five years, Burkina Faso looked to
be on course to reach the threshold for resource
dependency, raising the prospect of introducing fiscal rules
to manage the influx of additional mining tax receipts.

Inclusive growth

Outturn
The emphasis on natural resource revenue management as an initial program objective was predicated on an
assumption that Burkina Faso would soon become a resource dependent economy. While this still remains a
likely outcome over the medium term, developments since 2014 in terms of both gold production volumes and
prices have meant that discussions on a fiscal rule have not proceeded with the same urgency as originally
anticipated. Nevertheless, the passage of the new mining code in 2015 is a critical institutional development
which will benefit the long term development of the sector and the economy.
Low investment budget execution was partly the result of the macroeconomic management response of the
authorities to exogenous shocks and the accompanying decline in domestic revenues. This sharp curtailment of
investment spending meant that imports declined in parallel and pressure on the external sector was averted as
the current account deficit declined from 11 percent of GDP in 2013 to 8 percent in 2014. Both fiscal and external
stability were maintained but at the cost of severe import and investment spending compression.

Overall performance under the strategy has been somewhat unsatisfactory, due in large part to the difficult
political environment. Growth did not accelerate as projected and remained on average at 5.5 percent over 2011The program aimed to consolidate the country’s impressive
2015, well below the anticipated 10 percent. However, despite the volatile environment, a number of actions have

In response to the sharp deterioration in financial liabilities, the authorities proposed to carry out external audits
of both companies which found that the combination of variable cost structures and fixed revenue flows led to
chronic financial shortfalls and persistent under-investment in the sector. The reports recommended that
performance contracts be established for both SONABHY and SONABEL and that a technical memorandum also
needs to be drawn up between SONABHY, SONABEL and the State, covering financial and logistical operations
between the two companies, including outstanding debts and establishing rules covering the supply, payment
and subsidization of delivered goods. These recommendations have since been implemented. There have been
recent important reforms in the relationship between SONABHY and SONABEL which should result in both
significantly improved electricity supplies and reduced contingent liabilities going forward.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
Burkina Faso’s current account is mainly determined by gold exports, and by imports of capital and
intermediate goods. The deficit in most current account components is partially offset by the surplus in
private and public transfers. There is no indication of current account disequilibria or real effective
exchange rate misalignment. The analysis of qualitative indicators highlights a number of issues that,
if addressed, would improve the country’s competiveness.

A. Balance of payments
1.
Burkina Faso’s current account
deficit decreased from 2008 onwards,
mainly driven by higher gold exports. The
current account deficit averaged 10.8
percent of GDP in period 2000-2008 and fell
to an annual average of 6 percent of GDP in
period 2009-2015. The trade in goods deficit
that averaged 10.3 percent of GDP in period
2000-2008 declined to an average of 3
percent of GDP in period 2009-2015 (Figure
1).
2.
The composition of exports also
changed markedly starting in 2008. From
1992 to 2005 cotton represented 59.3
percent of total exports of goods. In 2007
cotton still accounted for 55.7 percent of the
exported goods, however in the following
years gold became the main export
commodity, spurred by a taxation code
designed to attract international investors
and high international gold prices (Figure 2).
The industrial exploitation of Burkina`s gold
mines and the related boom in exports
started in 2008, and stabilized around 61
percent of the value of exported goods and
35 tons in period 2013-2015 (Figure 3).
There is room for increasing regional trade,
since, excluding gold, WAEMU partners
absorb only 24 percent of Burkina`s exports,
with Cote d`Ivoire taking 9 percent and Togo
7 percent. A further 6 percent goes to

Ghana. Oil seeds and edible fruits and nuts represent 92 percent of the exported agricultural
products excluding cotton.
3.
The share of intermediary and capital goods in total imports has been increasing,
reflecting higher public and private investment.
This share is projected to reach 71 percent in 2016
(Figure 4). While the volumes of the imported
petroleum products grew by more than 3 percent a
year in 2013-16, the value of these imports
decreased in 2015 and 2016, thanks to the sharp
decrease in oil price. Looking at the geographic
distribution of imports, 11 percent come from
China, 9 percent from France and 8.4 percent from
Cote d`Ivoire. Overall, the WAEMU partners provide
only 14.8 percent of total imports.
4.
Surpluses in net private and public
transfers have always compensated part of the
current account deficit. Public current transfers
amounted to an average of 3.8 percent of GDP in
2006-12 and declined to an average of 1.9 percent
of GDP in 2013-16 (Figure 5). At the same time
inflows of private transfers, consisting mostly of
worker’s remittances from Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and
Europe, increased from 1.3 percent of GDP in 200612 to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2013-15.
5.
In 2016 the current account deficit is
projected to narrow slightly, from 8 to 7.6 percent of GDP. Over the period 2017-21, the current
account deficit is expected to remain moderate, at around 6.8 percent of GDP and to eventually
stabilize around its long-term projected average of about 6 percent of GDP by 2022. Exports of
goods are projected to increase in 2017, due to the start of operations of two new gold mines and
the rebound of cotton`s exports, linked to the abundant rainfall of 2016. Exports might receive a
further boost in the following years, when the existing large deposit of manganese of Tambao will
start production.
6.
Foreign direct investment is mostly directed toward the mining sector. Mining activities
are generally 90 percent owned by non-residents, generating important inflows of direct investment
in the mine-development period, and outflows of income when the mine becomes fully operational.
In 2014-15, likely related to the uncertain political situation, outflows of dividends climbed to almost
4 percent of GDP, from an average of about 0.7 percent in 2008-13. Canada is by far the largest
foreign investor, controlling at the end of 2015 almost 46 percent of the total FDI stocks; other
important foreign investors are France (12 percent), Morocco (6 percent) and Côte d`Ivoire (4
percent).

B. Reserves and external debt
7.
Regional gross international reserves coverage in WAEMU declined substantially since
2010 when it stood at 6.6 month of extra-regional imports, and stabilized at around 4.8 months of
imports in 2014-15. At the end of 2015 regional gross reserves covered about 63 percent of regional
broad money and 80 percent of short term debt.1
8.
Burkina Faso gross external debt is
low, at 23 percent of GDP at the end of
2015, and below that of most of the other
WAEMU countries. World Bank Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) show that
gross external debt is all related to
government and almost totally made of long
term loans, most of which are from
multilateral institutions, on highly
concessional terms.

C. Exchange rate developments
9.
Burkina Faso’s real effective exchange rate (REER) declined by 6.5 percent in 2015,
reflecting the depreciation of the euro against major currencies (Figure 6). The REER has
remained broadly stable between 2000

The External Balance
Assessment (EBA) provides a current
account benchmark based on the
country fundamentals relative to the
rest of the world. Burkina Faso’s current
account position is assessed using the
EBA-lite methodology.2 EBA-lite includes
3 different models that can be used
either separately or in conjunction to
perform a positive or a normative analysis
of the current account with the ultimate
purpose of assessing the misalignment of
the exchange rate. To assess Burkina`s
current account we used the EBA-lite
current account (CA) and REER Index
(IREER) models. In the CA model, the
approach suggests that the REER was
overvalued by 14 percent in 2015 (Figure
8 and Table 2), mainly reflecting an
overvaluation of the euro suggested by
the same model. The overvaluation is
projected to be fully unwound in 2016,
given the improvement in terms of trade.
The IREER model provides similar results,
signaling an 8 percent REER
overvaluation in 2015 and a much smaller
one (2 percent) in 2016. The findings are
broadly consistent with the WAEMU
exchange rate assessment results.3 Given
Burkina Faso’s monetary arrangement,
whereby reserves are pooled for all
WAEMU countries, the ES approach is

E. Structural competitiveness
12.
Structural competitiveness indicators suggest that there is significant room for
improving Burkina Faso’s standing. Burkina Faso has to overcome the obstacles of being a
relatively small, landlocked economy at least 500 miles away from the closest major port and with a
narrow export base. In the 2014-15 edition of The Global Competitiveness Report produced by the
World Economic Forum Burkina Faso ranked 135th out of the 144 countries considered (Figure 9).
This reflected perceived weakness in a number of subcategories, most notably in the quality of the
infrastructure and electricity supply, in the enrollment in all levels of education and in the access to
financing. The country ranked much better in terms of macroeconomic environment (83rd) and labor
market efficiency (70th) (Figure 10).

producers in sectoral networks similar to the
structure of the cotton sector might be the way to overcome many of the problems denounced by
the operators. The most problematic factors limiting imports were the burdensome import
procedures, the high costs and transportation delays and the tariffs at the port of entrance (Figure
11.2). The data related to Burkina`s external trade show the very limited role played by the regional
market, likely due to the high costs and inadequacy of land transportation infrastructure, the low
availability of regional air transportation and the heavy administrative procedures.

Burkina Faso has a privileged access to large markets that could be better exploited.
The Cotonou convention and the Everything But Arms agreements allow for duty free and quota
free exports to all the European Union countries. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)
gives a similar privileged access to the United States market. Agricultural products and
manufactured goods with local value added can also freely circulate among the members of the
WAEMU and ECOWAS. While the regional markets might be easier to exploit than the demanding
European or American ones, Burkina Faso is relatively close to Europe, which might provide
interesting opportunities to diversify the agricultural production and move upwards in the value
added chain, e.g. in the area of prepackaged fresh tropical fruits and juices. A railway built during
the colonial era covers the 783 miles between Abidjan and Ouagadougou, and plays a key role as
regards to the carriage of goods. It`s modernization might give a major push to the trade
development of the area.

Burkina Faso’s CPIA5 rating is higher than its peers’. Burkina Faso scores 3.6 (out of 6) in
2015, performing better than the SSA`s (3.2) and WAEMU (3.3) average. Burkina Faso is strong in
terms of economic management and policies for social inclusion but needs to improve the financial
sector, the social protection and labor market regulations and the extent to which private economic
activity is facilitated by an effective legal system in which property and contract rights are reliably
respected and enforced (Table 3).

Annex II. Lessons from Recent Program Engagement
1.
The ongoing ECF-supported program is coming to term. This annex seeks to evaluate
program performance relative to its principal objectives while recognizing that the difficulties caused
by major shifts in the sociopolitical context in the program period rendered some of these
objectives somewhat obsolete. This document reflects the staff’s perspective, but it also includes the
authorities’ views canvassed in the course of the 2016 Article IV Consultation. Lessons drawn from
this assessment could inform future Fund engagement with Burkina Faso.
2.
The ongoing program established initial objectives in the following areas after a
period of prior consultation with stakeholders:


Natural resource revenue management: taking account of the sharp increase in gold mining
revenues in the previous five years, Burkina Faso looked to be on course to reach the threshold
for resource dependency, raising the prospect of introducing fiscal rules to manage the influx of
additional mining tax receipts.



Inclusive growth: the program aimed to consolidate the country’s impressive recent track record
on economic growth while achieving wider distributional equity through support for
employment, particularly among the young, and addressing social needs based on the
objectives defined under the SCADD.



Improved investment budget execution: achieving the country’s long-term development
objectives would require significant public investment in the energy, transport and
telecommunications sectors and much-improved performance in budget execution through
streamlined procedures and revised procurement rules.



Enhanced energy supplies and reduced contingent liabilities: the energy sector had become the
main binding constraint to economic growth and would require reforms to the two public
enterprises in the sector, both to enhance energy supplies and contain sharply rising contingent
liabilities for the treasury.

3.
Significant progress was achieved against these objectives over the program period
bearing in mind that their individual relevance shifted somewhat in response to exogenous
developments.


The need for a fiscal rule was to some extent obviated by the decline in gold prices and
production from 2014 onwards. Nonetheless, the new mining code was approved by the
transition parliament in 2015 and provides for an enhanced fiscal contribution from the mining
sector by increasing the tax base while maintaining the attractiveness of the country to potential
investors.



Inclusive growth objectives were certainly impaired by the downturn in growth performance in
2014-15 as a result of political upheaval, shocks to commodity prices and the spillover from the
Ebola crisis in the region. Notwithstanding the difficult environment, the implementation of the
SCADD ensured that many of the key social objectives were reached nonetheless and social
spending was broadly maintained at program levels.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO



Investment budget execution however remained significantly below expectations, partly as a
result of the imperative to maintain fiscal and macroeconomic sustainability through the
downturn in the absence of sufficient available financing.



Prospects for the energy sector have begun to improve significantly as a result of recent declines
in international oil prices and a set of important reforms agreed to ensure that electricity
supplies increase while contingent liabilities for the treasury are largely eliminated.

The outturns for the key macroeconomic and financial indicators are compared with the initial
projections at the time of program approval in Figure 1.

The program was anchored on the efficient implementation of prudent fiscal policy.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework aimed to contain the deficit at around 3 percent of
GDP while providing space for higher social and investment spending. The program framework
targeted current spending adjustment, which would be complemented by modestly-growing
domestic revenues and financing. At the time of the first review, government revenues were
projected to reach 19.3 percent of GDP in each of the years 2014-16. By mid-2014 however, it
became apparent that slowing growth and falling gold prices were beginning to negatively impact
revenues. The loss of revenues was characterized in three principal ways.


Significant problems emerged at the level of revenue and customs administration. The popular
insurrection resulted in a long service interruption and the onset of widespread tax avoidance
practices.



The decline in gold prices began to affect royalties’ receipts in 2014, and while corporate taxes
took somewhat longer to show the effects of softer prices, it was nonetheless already clear that
2015 tax receipts from the mining sector would be well below initial forecasts.



The downturn in growth began to impact indirect taxes (principally VAT), particularly in the 4th
quarter of 2014. Overall by the end of 2014, domestic revenues reached 17.3 percent of GDP, 2
percentage points of GDP below the levels projected at the time of the first review before falling
by a further 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015.

5.
The authorities meantime were under considerable pressure to maintain recurrent
spending (including the wage bill) at budgeted levels. In response to the decline in available
resources and also reflecting financing constraints in the regional bond market, they cut investment
spending sharply to leave the deficit at 1.8 percent of GDP on a commitment basis. Financing
conditions eased somewhat in 2015 and as a result the authorities took a more expansionary policy
approach with the deficit increasing to 3.4 percent of GDP on a cash basis.
6.
The initial program’s quantitative performance criteria included ceilings on general
government net domestic financing, external non-concessional borrowing and the
accumulation of external arrears. While the ceiling on net domestic financing was never breached
as a performance criterion, it was breached once as an indicative target. The limit on nonconcessional external borrowing was initially set at CFAF 150 billion and has since been increased
twice, to CFAF 200 billion and CFAF 230 billion respectively to meet urgent infrastructural

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

BURKINA FASO

investment needs. There have been no breaches of this criterion nor of the zero limit on the
accumulation of external arrears.
7.
The program also established quantitative indicative targets for the ceiling on the
fiscal deficit, a floor on government revenues and on social spending and a zero ceiling on the
accumulation of domestic arrears. There have been no breaches of the deficit ceiling thus far in
the implementation of the program but this result is due at least in part to the compression of
investment spending undertaken in response to increasing pressures on the treasury position. These
pressures arose directly from the sharp decline in revenues resulting from deteriorating gold prices
and economic growth performance from the beginning of 2014. As a direct result, revenue targets
were missed throughout 2014-15, and by considerable margins (almost 1 percent of GDP as regards
the end-December 2015 target). Poverty spending targets were likewise universally missed in 2014
but the downward revision of the targets in 2015 enabled them to be met throughout 2015, albeit
on occasion by narrow margins. Following an FAD mission in April 2015, coinciding with the
combined second and third program reviews, and resulting in the identification of an internal arrears
issue, it was decided to monitor the accumulation of domestic arrears via structural benchmarks
requiring quarterly reporting on the issue and to set aside the quantitative indicator.
8.
The definition of structural benchmarks was largely in line with the stated objectives
of the program with consistent emphasis on energy sector and public investment budget
execution reforms. The real sector was also targeted (mining and cotton) by way of reforms
fostering inclusive growth. Revenue administration was also frequently identified in defining
program benchmarks. The track record of the

Lessons learned/Main achievements under the ECF-supported program
9.
One of the principal advantages of the ECF-supported program was its flexible
structure, in particular the potential to combine reviews and modify objectives in response to
evolving conditions. This flexibility was demonstrated in 2 main ways.


The program was implemented by 3 different governments through a popular uprising, a
transition administration and an attempted coup d’état without ever being derailed.



The initial objective of better managing natural resources wealth and improve spending
efficiency adapted to a new context of lower growth and declining revenues: the structural

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

reforms to be implemented didn’t need to change drastically in response to the evolving
context.
10.
The program was also quite successful in the area of curbing contingent liabilities
which had become a major issue for program implementation by 2013, arising mainly in the energy
sector but also from the cotton farming stabilization fund.


Energy sector reform: the program brought about significant reforms in the sense of modifying
the price paid by SONABEL for fuel inputs and in introducing a clearance plan on its arrears to
SONABHY. Both these measures will greatly enhance financial sustainability in the electricity
sector which should boost supplies in the medium term at the same time as significantly
reducing contingent liabilities on the treasury.



Cotton sector: the program has consistently monitored prospective contingent liabilities arising
from the cotton sector income stabilization fund, emphasizing that a strategy to reduce the
reliance on state subsidies for the cotton sector in the context of persistently falling prices is
urgently needed.

OF COOPERATION

Ouagadougou, November 30, 2016

N°2016______/MINEFID/SG/DGCOOP
Minister of Economy, Finance,
and Development
to
Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington DC 20431 (USA)
Madame Managing Director,
The government remains committed to implementing the 2013-16 economic and social program
supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Despite
a particularly difficult start to 2016 in terms of the security situation, which undermined the
achievement of strong economic growth, the government was able to implement the key
reforms planned. In particular, the adoption of two supplementary budgets helped strengthen
the tools at the government’s disposal to execute the program and safeguard poverty-reducing
social expenditures. Thus, monitoring of budget execution at end-September 2016 showed
excellent tax revenue performance, which was above the program threshold for the first time
since end-2013. Acceleration of the execution of public investment projects, which remained at
50 percent of the budget at end-September, owing essentially to the late adoption of the
budget, will be facilitated by measures aimed at streamlining the government procurement
process adopted in July 2016.
Burkina Faso adopted its national economic and social development plan (PNDES) on July 20,
2016, as the instrument defining the strategic guidelines for economic and social development
for the period 2016-20. The PNDES revolves around three strategic pillars: (i) institutional reform
and modernization of public administration, (ii) human capital development, and (iii) boosting
key sectors for supporting growth and employment.
The draft 2017 budget law was prepared closely in line with the strategic pillars of the PNDES,

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

and focuses on investment in backbone road infrastructure and energy projects, agricultural
transformation, youth employment, combating poverty, and improving the well-being of women.
To achieve these objectives, the government plans to continue the efforts already being made by
the revenue administrations. The planned measures, which include the roll out of a standardized
VAT invoice for large and medium-sized enterprises as of January 1, 2017, reestablishing the
electronic interface between the tax and customs administrations, strengthening provisions
related to transfer pricing, and the implementation of a project to collect fiscal-relevant data
from large retailers and shopping centers that deliver cashier’s receipts are expected to increase
revenue by more than one percentage point of GDP.
Non-interest recurrent spending is expected to decline as a share of GDP as a result of the efforts
made to curb the government’s rate of expenditure and measures taken to contain the public
wage bill. In addition, measures aimed at improving investment budget execution will be put in
place by end-2016. These include (i) the drawing up of a list of priority investment projects to be
included in the 2017 budget law amounting to at least 80 percent of the total amount included
in the budget, and (ii) the reorganization and adoption of the budget calendar to advance the
preparation of the public investment program.
We also plan to seize the opportunity of continuing low oil prices to pursue the reforms being
undertaken in the energy sector. In particular, the measures adopted in June 2016 that paved the
way for a flexible oil purchase price structure between SONABEL and SONABHY have already had
a positive impact on SONABEL’s financial position and have also reduced the need for
government subsidies in 2016. As regards SONABEL, the planned investments to facilitate energy
imports from neighboring countries and support the development of solar energy will help the
company to continue lowering its production costs and increase electricity generation. So as to
avoid the accumulation of new government contingent liabilities vis-à-vis SONABHY in the event
of an upturn in world oil prices, we are also considering to gradually implement the automatic
adjustment mechanism for hydrocarbon prices in the domestic market.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes the economic
and financial situation in 2016, sets out the economic and financial policies that the government
intends to implement over the rest of the year, and establishes the benchmarks and reforms for
end-December 2016. It also explains the country’s balance of payments financing needs.
All continuous and end-June performance criteria and indicative quantitative benchmarks were
met, most by wide margins. Most of the structural benchmarks were also met on time, except for
transmission of the financial position of the publicly-owned hydrocarbons company (SONABHY),
which was implemented with a delay. With regard to the requirement that large and mediumsized enterprises must use the standardized invoice, a contractor has been identified and the
contract will be signed by end-November. The July 2016 benchmark concerning the payment of
an initial amount of CFAF 5 billion to clear the arrears of the state-owned power company
(SONABEL) was met on time, and a second payment of CFAF 35 billion planned for 2017 has also
already been made. Moreover, with respect to the repayment of capital gains owed to the State,
an amount of CFAF 14.7 billion has been transferred by SONABHY to an account at the BCEAO.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

BURKINA FASO

Efforts are underway to implement the benchmark set for November 2016 concerning combating
fraud in the transport of fuel but there has been some delay. We are committed to finalizing to
make all the trucks tamper-proof and to putting in place a system of seals and electronic signage
at the borders with Benin and Niger by end-December 2016.
In view of this performance in an environment that remains difficult, we request the completion
of the sixth review under the ECF arrangement as well as the disbursement of Special Drawing
Rights (SDRs) in the amount of 4.47 million.
To ensure continuity, the government would also like to request an extension of the current
program by nine months and an augmentation of SDR 4.47 million to be disbursed upon
completion of a seventh review. The current Fund arrangement under the Extended Credit
Facility expires in December 2016. The government has already started thinking about the
direction of its future collaboration with the Fund. In that regard, a seventh review will take place
in June 2017 concomitantly with the request for a new agreement. The objectives of this seventh
review have been outlined in the attached MEFP along with the quantitative criteria and
benchmarks as well as the structural benchmarks for end-December 2017. Based on the loan
agreements signed in 2016, we will reach the non-concessional debt ceiling by end-December
2016. In order to support rapid implementation of the PNDES and based on our investment
program for 2017, we are requesting an increase in the ceiling of 125 billion CFA francs through
the remainder of the program. We have also become aware that about CFAF 90 billion in
programmed budget support for 2016 may not be disbursed by the end of the year. As a
precaution, we are thus requesting an increase in the program adjuster for net domestic
financing from CFAF 65 billion to CFAF 90 billion.
The government believes that the measures presented in the MEFP will serve to achieve the
economic and social objectives of its program. It is determined nonetheless to take any further
measures that may prove necessary to this end. The government will consult with the IMF before
adopting such measures, and before modifying the policies provided in the MEFP, in accordance
with applicable IMF policies. Furthermore, the government will provide the IMF with information
on implementation of the agreed measures and program execution, as provided in the attached
revised Technical Memorandum of Understanding or at the request of the IMF.
As in the past, the government agrees to publication of this letter, the attachments hereto, and
the related IMF staff report upon approval by the IMF Executive Board.
Very truly yours,

Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
For the Sixth Review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Memorandum provides an update on the Burkina Faso economic and financial
program supported by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement for 2016-17. This program aims to preserve macroeconomic stability and
strengthen the basis for sustained and inclusive growth, in line with the country’s development
strategy, the National Economic and Social Development Plan (Plan National de Développement
Économique et Social – PNDES), which replaces the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and
Sustainable Development (Stratégie de croissance accélérée et de développement durable –
SCADD). This Memorandum describes recent economic developments and takes stock of the
quantitative performance and indicative criteria and structural benchmarks at end-June 2016. In
addition, in light of the Government’s request to extend the program by nine months, it also sets
out performance criteria and structural benchmarks at end-2016 and the main economic policy
framework for 2017.

II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

A. Recent macroeconomic developments
2.
After a slowdown in economic growth to 4.0 percent in 2015, compared to 4.2 percent in
2014, economic activity picked up in the first half of 2016 and the outlook for the year is positive.
Growth stood at 4.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting the impact of the January terrorist
attacks, and reached 8.3 percent in the second quarter of 2016 (year on year), borne up by a
strong recovery in the tertiary sector. The key economic indicators reflect this generally
favorable situation:



Inflation was down 0.4 percent year-on-year at end-September 2016. The deceleration in
the general price level since July is due to drops in food prices, notably of unprocessed
cereals and vegetables. Average annual inflation stood at 0.6 percent at end-September,
compared with 0.7 percent the previous month.



The rate of growth in credit to the private sector seems to have begun a weak recovery,
though it lags behind the uptick in economic activity. After slumping to 3.9 percent in
April it recovered to 6.3 percent in September, which was still much slower than the
average for the preceding three years (17.4 percent). The slowdown in lending to the
economy at end-July relative to previous years is largely explained by the sluggishness in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

BURKINA FASO

economic activity at the beginning of the year and the drop in the oil price, which led to
an improvement in SONABHY’s cash flow. At the same time, banks continued to
accumulate foreign assets, which came to CFAF 902.9 billion in June 2016. The increase in
banks’ net foreign assets appears to be due principally to the rise in their outstanding
subscriptions for government securities issued by other WAEMU countries.



The current account is expected to improve in 2016 —thanks to new gold production
and rising gold and cotton prices —from a deficit of 8 percent in 2015 to one of 7.6
percent. In 2016, imports of goods are expected to increase to CFAF 1,661.9 billion a
year-on-year rise of 7.9 percent, chiefly attributable to imports of capital and
intermediate goods. Exports of goods would reach CFAF 1,501.1 billion in 2016, up 7.4
percent year on year, mainly on the strength of gold exports. By contrast, sales of cotton
fiber are down, in spite of the expected 7.6 percent rise in the average price.

B. Program Implementation
3.
Program implementation remains sound. All continuous and end-June quantitative
criteria were met, as were the indicative targets (Table 1).



As regards quantitative performance criteria, the ceiling on net domestic financing was
largely met, mainly because of a gap in budget execution in investment projects. In fact,
net domestic financing rose to CFAF 22.6 billion, against a cap of CFAF 111 billion. The
other quantitative benchmarks were also largely met. Non-concessional loans amounted
to CFAF 205 billion at end-June, on a cumulative basis since 2013.



The indicative targets at end-March and end-June 2016 were also met, including the
government deficit ceiling and the government revenue floor. Significantly, the latter
benchmark was met for the first time since 2013.

4.
Six of the eight structural benchmarks were met at end-June 2016 (Table 2). They
included (i) producing the quarterly activity reports of the Investigations and Intelligence
Directorate (Direction des enquêtes et de renseignement – DGR), (ii) consolidating the
segmentation of enterprises, particularly by putting into effect the new organization chart of the
Directorate General of Taxation (Direction générale des impôts – DGI), (iii) cross-checking
taxpayers between the DGI and the Directorate General of Customs (Direction générale des
douanes – DGD) using the unique taxpayer identification number, starting with big taxpayers, and
producing quarterly reports on the results and actions taken, (iv) providing a monthly forecast of
customs receipts by customs office on an annual and a monthly basis and comparing actual
receipts with the forecasts, (v) keeping active field 44 for input of references from inspection
notices for all customs declarations, and (vi) submitting the domestic debt audit report for the
Council of Ministers to adopt its recommendations.
5.
The audited annual accounts of SONABHY and SONABEL as at end-2015 were produced
and the two companies’ first quarterly reports were released, albeit three months late in the case
of SONABHY. However, the effective adoption of the standardized invoice by large and medium-

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

sized enterprises did not take place on schedule. Indeed, the procurement procedure has been
restarted twice following objections by tenderers. In spite of that, a new tender procedure is now
well advanced and the contract with the provider will be signed by November 30, as a result of
which the standardized invoice will be effectively adopted by large and medium-sized enterprises
starting on January 1, 2017 at the latest.
6.
As regards the benchmarks to be implemented between June and December, in July
2016 SONABHY made a first special dividend payment of CFAF 5 billion to the Government to
pay down SONABEL’s debt. The measure, to be jointly carried out by the DGD and SONABHY, in
order to limit the leakages during hydrocarbon transport, is under way but delayed. The securing
of all trucks and the introduction of a system of electronic tags and seals on borders with Benin
and Niger will be completed by December 2016.

III.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENT MODEL FOR 2016-2020

7.
On July 20, 2016, Burkina Faso adopted the National Economic and Social Development
Plan (Plan National de Développement Économique et Social – PNDES), which sets out strategic
guidelines for economic and social development for the period 2016–2020. The PNDES replaces
the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (Stratégie de croissance
accélérée et de développement durable – SCADD) and draws on the program “Building with the
People a Democratic, Economically and Socially Progressive, Free and Just Burkina Faso” (Bâtir
avec le peuple un Burkina Faso de démocratie, de progrès économique et social, de liberté et de
justice) devised by Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, President of Faso, the “Burkina 2025” vision and
international commitments (the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development
Goals) for which Burkina Faso has signed up. The overall objective of the PNDES is to structurally
transform the Burkina Faso economy into one of strong, sustainable, resilient and inclusive
growth that creates decent jobs for all and brings an improvement in social well-being.
8.
Designed in line with the principles of results-based management (RBM), the PNDES is
built on three strategic pillars, with their respective strategic objectives and expected outcomes.
Those pillars are: (i) institutional reform and administrative modernization, (ii) development of
human capital, and (iii) stimulation of sectors that are drivers of economic growth and job
creation.
9.
The overall cost of implementing the PNDES is estimated at CFAF 15,395.4 billion, which
comes to an average annual cost of CFAF 3,079.1 billion. Domestic resources will provide 63.8
percent (CFAF 9,825.2 billion) of the funding, with the other 36.2 percent (CFAF 5,570.2 billion)
coming from other sources. The share allotted for investment spending will be 54.6 percent,
amounting to CFAF 8,408.2 billion for the period overall, or CFAF 1,681.6 billion per year.
10.
The PNDES will be financed by means of a strategy to mobilize domestic and external
resources, focusing on new and innovative methods, in addition to the use of traditional official
development assistance (ODA). As regards innovative forms of financing, they may include
national tax systems, the issuance of government securities, voluntary contributions and lotteries,
methods of mobilizing Burkinabè funds from abroad, bonds guaranteed by donor countries sold

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

BURKINA FASO

on the financial market, allocations from funds generated by the sale of emission quotas, publicprivate partnerships, subsidized loans, crowd-funding, and popular shareholding, among others.
In the context of the mobilization of these funds, a donor roundtable (named Conference of
Burkina Faso’s partners for the financing of the PNDES) will be held on December 7-8, 2016, in
Paris, with the World Bank as the lead of the technical and financial partners. The next major
steps in implementing the PNDES include setting up a monitoring and evaluation mechanism,
conducting a strategic environmental assessment, and developing a communication strategy to
strengthen ownership of the Plan.

IV.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRAM FOR THE 2016-2017 PERIOD

A. Macroeconomic framework
11.
Real GDP growth is expected to reach 5.4 percent in 2016, a gain of 1.4 percentage
points over 2015. Taking into account the relatively low oil prices, the strong performance of
gold and cotton prices, as well as favorable rainfall, the recovery should extend to all sectors.
The primary sector is expected to rebound with an increase in value added of 3.8 percent in 2016
after contracting by 1.2 percent in 2015, mainly due to the recovery in agricultural output. In
addition, the sustained activity in the secondary sector (+4.1 percent) and services (+5.2 percent)
should consolidate the momentum of economic activity. The secondary sector should benefit
from the stability of mining activity, the ongoing socio-economic infrastructure investment
projects and the solid performance of the energy sub-sector underpinning the recovery in
manufacturing activity. As for the services sector, it is expected to benefit from the upturn in
telecommunications, financial services, and to a lesser extent non-market services in connection
with government transfers. Under a more optimistic scenario, cereal production could rebound
by 8 percent (6 percent in the baseline scenario), which would boost growth to 5.9 percent.
12.
Growth in credit to the private sector is expected to remain weak at 9.4 percent, below
the growth rates of 20 to 25 percent in recent years before the political transition. Net foreign
assets, on the other hand, could see a rise of around 15 percent, resulting in growth in money
supply of 13.3 percent in 2016 compared to 2015.
13.
Annual inflation is expected to remain moderate, at 0.7 percent at end-2016. These
developments appear to be the result of the sharp decline in "food and non-alcoholic beverages"
based on the expected good harvests and the decline in transportation prices. It also reflects the
decline in oil prices recorded over the year.
14.
With regard to 2017, growth should continue to strengthen to reach between 6 and 7
percent. The likely main factors contributing to this performance are mining, with the entry into
operation of two new gold mines, bringing the number of operating industrial mines to ten (10),
as well as the implementation of a full year of the public investment program in the areas of
energy, roads, irrigation schemes, telecommunications infrastructure, etc. In the medium term,
growth could remain at around 6.5-7 percent, driven by the implementation of the PNDES,
particularly as energy supply improves. The strengthening of activity would be sustained by the
60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

momentum in all the sectors set to benefit from the investment activities envisaged. Thus, the
secondary sector would experience the greatest increase in value added due to the expansion of
mining activity associated with a gold production increase of at least 41 tons of gold in 2017 —
projected to surpass 46 tons from 2018 — and the start-up of operations at the manganese mine
in 2020. Added to this is the increased investment, particularly in energy infrastructure with the
aim of gradually improving energy supply to manufacturing and transport infrastructure, both of
which should boost the recovery in construction and public works. The consolidation of
measures in the agro-sylvo-pastoral area through the further operationalization of growth poles
(Bagré, Samendenni-Sourou, Sahel) and vigorous activity in services are expected to help
strengthen economic activity over the period. Inflation should remain moderate (following
developments in import prices) and below the WAEMU 3 percent threshold, while credit to the
private sector is expected to pick up again. To help the private sector to perform in full its role as
a driver of growth as implementation of the PNDES moves forward, the Government intends,
among other things, to continue its policy of clearing the domestic debt, strengthening measures
for improving the business climate and securing investment, and accelerating the pace of the
reforms initiated in 2016 in order to speed up and boost efficiency in spending.
15.
The PNDES envisages an even more optimistic scenario that would see growth of 8.4
percent in 2017 and 8.2 percent on average in the period from 2018 to 2020. This scenario
assumes a significant level of public investment to support the structural transformation of the
economy. In such a context, the acceleration in economic growth would result from
consolidation of activity in services, gradual enhancement of the industrial fabric especially in
manufacturing, expansion in mining and increased productivity in the primary sector.
16.
These positive scenarios, however, involve a number of risks, both external and internal,
which are significant and could have an adverse impact on growth. They include a possible
deterioration of the security situation in the region, a fall in gold and cotton prices, an oil price
increase, poor rainfall resulting in lower agricultural output, a prolonged recession in Europe and
less favorable financial conditions in the regional market. The internal risks include a
deterioration of the social climate leading to an increase in wages and transfers at the expense of
investment and persistent bottlenecks in implementation or absorption capacity, or both, which
could slow budget execution. In addition, there is a potential financial risk associated with the
weak mobilization of both internal and external resources to finance the PNDES and muted
ownership by stakeholders in the national development process. However, to minimize such
risks, a number of mitigation measures have been identified:



Improve information and security systems and strengthen military and security
cooperation,



Promote a peaceful political environment and equitable justice,



Take steps to boost mobilization of domestic resources and control certain categories of
expenditure,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61



Diversify the export base with a focus on processing basic local goods,



Establish an appropriate institutional framework for steering and monitoring the PNDES.

B. Fiscal Policy
2016 Budget
17.
As regards public finances, a second supplementary budget law (Loi de Finances
Rectificative – LFR) was passed by the National Assembly on July 21, 2016. The LFR takes into
account on the one hand, new needs that have emerged after adoption of the first LFR and on
the other, the prospects of new resources. In addition, for urgent expenses the Council of
Ministers had issued a decree authorizing advances for their execution pending regularization by
the second LFR. Those expenses are related, among other things, to the organization of the
municipal elections in May 2016 and the clearance of student catering arrears.
18.
It should be recalled that the first LFR took into account both the new configuration of
the government in the wake of the presidential and legislative elections on November 29, 2015,
and the impact of the government’s measures to revive economic activity and appease the social
climate.

In line with the objectives, total revenue (excluding grants) is expected to improve to 18.3
percent of GDP, almost back to the levels before the decline in 2014 and 2015. The
return to a calm political climate helps promote more productive revenue collection.
However, lower retail fuel prices — that led to lower taxable bases for those products —
and strikes by IT workers — resulting in connection interruptions throughout the country
— have contributed to a significant decline in performance of the Customs
administration in the third quarter. To reduce the lag in relation to forecasts, about 2,600
manual records are being reprocessed to be re-entered into the ASYCUDA information
system to take account of related liquidations in customs revenues. Tax reforms and
measures to strengthen business capacity during the year will also help to broaden the
tax base and meet targets. These measures include: (i) intensification of control and
recovery actions; (ii) the adoption of a strategy to improve communication with taxpayers
and raise their awareness of the importance of tax compliance; (iii) continued
segmentation to better control taxpayer categories and improve their contribution; (iv)
activation of field 44 of ASYCUDA WORLD for mandatory input of references of the
COTECNA inspection certificate; (v) control of warehouses and final destination of goods;
(vii) completion of the project on the Virtual Liaison System for Import and Export
Operations (Système de liaison virtuelle pour les opérations d’importation et d’exportation
– SYLVIE); (viii) satellite tracking of goods in transit; (ix) monitoring of tax and customs
clauses in public contracts financed with self-generated resources; installation and
operation of the new Ouagadougou road scanner; and (x) a stepping-up of actions to

BURKINA FASO

combat fraud. Non-tax revenues also benefited from special dividends from SONABHY,
in the amount of about 0.5 percent of GDP.



Current expenditure is expected to rise from 14.6 percent to 15.2 percent of GDP
(compared with the first LFR), particularly as a result of a higher wage bill, which should
now increase to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2016 (versus 7.2 percent in the LFR and 6 percent
in 2013), and current transfers, which are expected to reach 5.1 percent of GDP in 2016
(compared with 4.7 percent in the LFR and 5.3 percent in 2013). The increased wage bill
is mainly due to the impact of Law 081 on the status of civil servants. This law ends the
two-tier system for public servants. Thus, the Government has opted to harmonize wages
by aligning staff with contractors. The law allows staff and contractors to be placed in a
new category, classification and scale. The financial impact of the implementation of Law
081, in terms of new expenditures (linked to the implementation of the new salary grid
and the regularization of pending promotions) is estimated at CFAF 29.096 billion, of
which CFAF 20.83 billion are linked to implementation of the new salary grid and CFAF
8.266 billion are linked to regularization of pending promotions. However, the financial
impact of the implementation of the law 081 on the 2016 budget amounts to CFAF 25.89
billion.



Investment spending is expected to increase from 7.6 to 9.4 percent of GDP following the
integration of new projects such as the Sahel growth pole; the financing project adapted
to family agriculture, the operationalization of the standardized invoice, the IDB-WAEMU
project and the ecosystem-based adaptation project.

19.
The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis) is projected at 2.5 percent of GDP in 2016, down
slightly compared to 2015. This deficit should be financed by net external resources of CFAF
124.7 billion and by domestic financing (excluding depreciation), including CFAF 165 billion in
bonds and CFAF 303.5 billion in treasury bills. This amount in bond issues would entail an overfunding, resulting in an accumulation of CFAF 114.3 billion in deposits on the Treasury's account
at the BCEAO, in the event of disbursement of all the budget support committed for. The reason
for this accumulation is the desire to ensure sufficient liquidity to execute the budget through
year-end, given the uncertainties related to the disbursement of budgetary support (the budget
includes CFAF 139.7 billion in budget support—program grants and loans—of which only CFAF
39.9 billion had been disbursed at end-September), and to start 2017.
20.
Monitoring of budget execution at end September 2016 indicates an excellent
performance in domestic revenues, which reached 98 percent of projections, including the
special dividend already received. Current expenditures are in line with projections, but
investment spending remains below 77 percent of the targets for end-September and 50 percent
of the annual budget. Accelerating execution of public investment projects by year-end should
be made possible by the measures designed to ease implementation of development projects,
programs and activities, which were voted through by the National Assembly in July 2016. Those
measures relate primarily to (i) raising public procurement thresholds, (ii) shortening the
competition time frame in public procurement tenders, public service license contracts and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

BURKINA FASO

public-private partnerships, (iii) reducing the approval time for contracts, (iv) eliminating double
review of contracts financed with external resources, and (v) the relaxation of the conditions for
the approval of the decisions of award commissions, contract selection, public service licensees
and private partners.

2017 Budget
21.
The draft budget law (projet de loi de finances) for fiscal year 2017 was developed based
on the priorities and fiscal policy choices made by the Government. Those priorities have been
identified in connection with the strategic pillars of the PNDES. Particular emphasis was placed
on structural reforms and investment in sectors such as:



Infrastructure through paving of roads, construction of rural roads and maintenance of
paved and unpaved roads,



Agriculture, on the one hand by promoting the processing of local goods, and on the
other by supporting rural areas with the introduction of new tailored financing structures.
By the same token, it is also worth noting that subsidies to the cotton sector for boosting
the competitiveness of our producers were beefed up,



Promotion of youth employment through adequate funding structures to encourage selfemployment for young people,



The fight against poverty and the advancement of women in general, and of maternal
and child health, in particular.

22.
With regard to fiscal receipts, the budget forecasts CFAF 1,438 billion in domestic
revenue, an increase of 12 percent compared to 2016. The DGI and DGD are considering a
number of reforms and concrete measures to achieve these objectives.
23.

64

For the DGD that will involve:



Continuing the implementation of the SYLVIE system and the connection of authorized
customs agents to the computerized customs system. For 2017, the customs
administration will ensure the connection to the electronic platform of all the public
administrations that issue certificates and attestations.



Implementing the COTEC project in 2017. This will make it possible to improve customs
clearance activities on used vehicles and thereby increase customs revenues.



As part of the interconnections of our IT system with that of neighboring countries, the
project with Togo is advanced and could be launched in 2017. This interconnection will
allow better tracking of the all merchandises declared in transit from the Port of Togo to
Burkina Faso.



Strengthening the control of operations in the mining sector through the development of
a standard protocol for the installation of customs posts at mining sites.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO



Ensuring application of the regulations on scanners, in particular by making the scanning
of shipments of goods transported by truck mandatory. Restoring the electronic
interface between the DGD and DGI databases to facilitate cross-checks and thwart fraud.



Implementing the fourth phase of satellite monitoring.



Implementing the anti-smuggling plan for motorcycles.

24.
For the DGI the emphasis will be on new tax provisions to combat fraud and tax evasion
and improve recovery, including:



Effective operationalization of the standardized invoice to combat fraud in VAT invoicing
(see above),



Implementation of the project “Fiscal data collection” targeted at large retailers and
shopping centers that deliver cashier’s receipts. The project aims to install at these
enterprises equipment that would collect data from cash registers and transmit them to
the revenue administration’s servers. This project is at the brainstorming stage, and
would require an agreement with enterprises, and eventually legal changes to render
using the proposed equipment mandatory.



Legal recognition of the unique financial ID (identifiant financier unique – IFU) as well as
the obligation for banks and financial institutions to include the IFU among the elements
for identifying holders of commercial and professional accounts,



Development and implementation of a land registry, for tax purposes,



Measures to protect the corporation tax base by strengthening transfer pricing
provisions, in particular the stipulation that will be introduced for corporation tax that the
turnover of companies selling products listed on a stock exchange must not be less than
that determined from the market prices on the day when the sales were made. This is to
combat fraudulent hedging contracts. Better limitations are also provided for on the
deduction of head office costs, which will affect all forms of establishment of foreign
enterprises in Burkina Faso (subsidiaries, branches, representative offices, and any other
form of permanent establishment),



Continued computerization of tax services along with strengthening of new
functionalities and better interconnection of software through development of interfaces.

25.
Extraordinary revenue (program grants and project grants) amount to CFAF 307.5 billion,
including CFAF 77.9 billion for program grants, based on announcements and commitments
made by partners as at end-October 2016. However, those announcements do not take into
account additional resources that could be raised during and after the Partners' Conference.
26.
The level of recurrent expenditure excluding interest payments will decline by about 0.5
percentage points of GDP, reflecting the Government's efforts to create fiscal space for
investment. Personnel costs will increase by around 6 percent in nominal terms, mainly due to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

BURKINA FASO

the impact of Law 081 on the wage bill, albeit mitigated by new measures to contain the payroll
and staff. The streamlining of the wage management system, the decentralization of the
processing cycle and the reorganization of the payroll should, in time, make it possible to
regulate the workforce and reduce undue payments. Aside from these measures, the
Government has taken strong action to improve the level of mobilization of internal resources, in
particular tax revenue, in order to improve the wage bill-to-tax revenue ratio. Operating
expenditures are also contained in real terms through measures taken to cut State costs. Such
measures include reducing the communication costs of ministers and presidents of institutions,
regulating the use of State vehicles, terminating certain administrative leases, and reducing
water, electricity and telephone use. Transfer expenditures are also seeing a slight decline in real
terms, from 5.1 percent of GDP in 2016 to 4.6 percent in 2017. These expenditures include a
subsidy to the cotton sector in the amount of CFAF 20 billion.
27.
Investment spending is expected to see a significant increase, mainly driven by
investments financed domestically, which would rise from CFAF 371.9 billion in 2016 to between
CFAF 560 billion and CFAF 700 billion in 2017. Investments financed with external resources will
grow to a lesser extent, from CFAF 288.6 billion in 2016 to between CFAF 340.8 billion and CFAF
391 billion in 2017.
28.
The financing of the budget is provided by CFAF 100.8 billion in external financing—
including CFAF 42.8 billion in amortization—and CFAF 168.5 billion in internal financing,
including CFAF 300 billion in bonds. Despite this, there remains a financing requirement of CFAF
3.7 billion in the baseline scenario, which could be covered by increased access under the ECF
arrangement. Based on current budget support commitments, the overall deficit would expand
to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2017. However, additional financing, mostly in the form of grants,
identified at the December donor conference and beyond could allow for higher investment
spending and the deficit could expand up to 4 percent of GDP.

C. Debt Policy
29.
The Government's debt policy aims to maintain a "moderate" risk of debt distress in
terms of the debt sustainability analysis based on a variety of indicators (including the ratios of
government debt to GDP, to tax revenue, and to exports) and diverse risk scenarios. Our portfolio
of PNDES projects includes structuring investments in the energy, road and hydro-agriculture
infrastructure, and telecommunications sectors. The chosen financing strategy will continue to
focus on concessional grants and financing and continued use of the regional financial market at
gradually longer maturities. Actions aimed at developing public-private partnerships (PPP’s) will
be pursued in a prudent manner in order to avoid the accumulation of contingent risks and
liabilities for the State. The use of non-concessional financing is envisaged but on terms more
favorable than market conditions such as Islamic finance.

31.
For 2017, we have preliminarily identified an amount of CFAF 520 billion in nonconcessional and concessional loans (Text Table 2).
32.
With regard to interventions on the regional bond market, there are two objectives: on
one hand, to continue to extend the maturity of the bonds to a period of 1 to 2 years for treasury
bills and 7 years for bonds and, on the other hand, to improve planning and monitoring of these
operations in order to control the timing of reimbursements and refinancing needs, and reduce
costs.
33.
In order to accompany the implementation of the PNDES while preserving the
sustainability of public debt in the medium term, actions to strengthen the capacity of the public
debt management will be carried out. The aim is to eventually create a modern debt
management unit capable of performing front, middle and back office functions as well as
monitoring and improving implementation of the debt management strategy in the medium
term. Sufficient qualified staff and close cooperation between DGTCP and DGCOOP will be
required to manage the external and regional/domestic debt as well as the PPP portfolio in an

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

BURKINA FASO

integrated manner. As part of the strengthening of debt management capacity, the following is
envisaged: (i) improve debt management tools (DSA, MTDS, etc.); and (ii) strengthen staff in
terms of both quantity and quality through training, particularly in managing the risks associated
with conditional debt.

In the Area of Public Finance
34.
The implementation of the PNDES-backed investment program poses many challenges,
in particular that of ensuring that the quality of investment planning and execution does not
suffer as a result of a significant increase in the volume of investments. Following the measures
adopted in July 2016, the Government submitted a new procurement code to the National
Assembly. The code’s implementation will aim at complying with the WAEMU standard on the
use of special procedures in public procurement management. The IMF's Fiscal Affairs
Department will conduct a Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) in early 2017 to

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

identify priority measures and prepare an action plan prioritizing the measures needed to
improve the execution of the investment budget.
35.
The other priority actions envisaged to accelerate the implementation of our investment
program are as follows:


Reorganizing the budgetary calendar to advance the preparation of the public
investment program and adopt a permanent circular on the budget calendar.



Facilitating project monitoring by preparing a list of the major investment projects,
representing at least 80 percent of the total investment volume under the 2017 initial
budget law (LFI). The list will include the name and description of each project, its total
cost, its method of financing, and its readiness/implementation status, in addition to the
expected completion date in the case of multi-year projects.



Switching to the program budget from January 2017 will eventually lead to a more
decentralized, efficient and prompt budget management. However, the switch also
presents challenges in terms of (i) strengthening stakeholders' capacities in relation to
the changes introduced by the Organic Law on the Laws of Finance (Loi Organique
relative aux Lois des Finances – LOLF) adopted in November 2015; (ii) adapting the
information system for the preparation, execution and reporting of accounts; (iii) practical
arrangements for decentralizing expenditure authoritizations (ordonnnancement des
dépenses); and (iv) appointing Program Officers (Responsables de programme – RP).

36.
With regard to payroll management, we will take steps to contain growth in both the
wage bill and the workforce so as to return to a wage bill-to-tax revenue ratio of approximately
35 percent by 2019 (WAEMU convergence criterion).
37.
We continued improving cash management and eliminated the arrears arising from an
accumulation of pending payments at end-March 2016. We intend to continue to prepare
quarterly reports thereon. Concerning treasury assets frozen in the postal accounts, the final
report of the audit commissioned by the Minister in charge of Finance and conducted by the
BCEAO is available. The minister in charge of postal services was notified by the Ministry of the
Economy, Finance and Development (Ministère de l'Economie, des Finances et du Développement
– MINEFID) in order to implement the recommendations of the audit mission that apply both to
the governance of SONAPOST and the reimbursement of the treasury holdings on its books. The
report proposed a schedule for repaying these holdings to the Treasury by 2019.
38.
The annual report of the national anti-corruption authority (Autorité supérieure de
contrôle d’Etat – ASCE) on the domestic debt nevertheless identified government debts in terms
of domestic debt for a total of CFAF 197 billion, including CFAF 75.9 billion for ministries and
institutions. This latter amount includes FCFA 35.9 billion in "regular" debts, resulting from
contracts in compliance with the procedures in effect but that have not been implemented within
the time frame initially envisaged. We are in the process of gradually regularizing these debts
and have entered an amount of CFAF 30 billion in the 2016 budget. As for the "irregular" debts

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

BURKINA FASO

of CFA 39.3 billion for which the proper procedures have not all been followed, a strategy for
their progressive validation will be adopted, subject to verification of the corresponding
amounts. A provisional amount of CFAF 30 billion is included in the 2017 budget for that
purpose. It is also envisaged to implement the other main recommendations of the ASCE audit,
including:



Streamline cash management and, in particular, the gradual closure of deposit accounts,



Include in the State budget appropriations in order to deal with the inability of
universities to honor the maturities of their loans endorsed by the State,



Avoid the use of state-owned enterprises to finance the activities of the State,



Formalize by a contract or agreement any services performed by state-owned enterprises
for the benefit of the State prior to any commencement of performance and respect the
commitments entered into through such contracts or agreements,



Review the budgetary procedures related to the follow-up of the expenditure cycle in
order to avoid the accumulation of new arrears and, in particular, to ensure strict
compliance with the rules governing the management of imprest accounts,



Adopt a text that regulates and rationalizes consumption of fuel and lubricants in public
administration.

Improve energy supply and control contingent liabilities in the sector
39.
One of the main objectives of the PNDES is to meet the challenge of rapidly improving
energy coverage in order to facilitate growth in the coming years. Reforms will be implemented
to further improve relations between the State, SONABHY and SONABEL, and to ensure the
sustainability of the energy sector – taking advantage of the current enabling environment
created by still relatively low oil prices. At end-September 2016, payments due to SONABEL
totaled CFAF 42 billion, those due to SONABHY came to CFAF 39.5 billion, and the arrears of
subsidies owed by the State to the two companies amounted to CFAF 81.6 billion.
40.
The Government intends to continue implementing the main recommendations of the
SONABHY and SONABEL external audits in order to ensure more efficient financial management
and reduced operating costs. Efforts to enhance transparency will also continue. The cash
position of the two companies will continue to be shared quarterly (summary balance sheet and
cash position), as will summaries of their financial statements after each reporting period. As
regards implementation of the performance contracts, the following progress has been made for
2016, and a number of actions are planned for 2017.
41.
With regard to SONABHY, the statutory members of the external committee for followup of the performance contract have been appointed but have not been able to meet.
Nevertheless, the internal monitoring committee was able to examine the status of the contractplan’s implementation, which can be summarized, among other things, as follows:

72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO



The level of execution of the construction of the Péni oil depot was estimated at 77
percent at end-September 2016,



Construction and opening of two new gas bottle filling carrousels at the beginning of
2016 at the Bingo depot,



Signing of the SONABHY/SONABEL Supply Agreement on September 16, 2016,



Deduction of financial expenses due by the State on the capital gains to be repaid in
respect of the first half of 2016.

42.
For SONABEL, the inter-ministerial committee for monitoring and evaluation of the
performance contract is currently being set up. Indeed, the representatives of the various
ministries have just been appointed to the committee. The internal monitoring and evaluation
committee of SONABEL was set up on June 20, 2016. The forthcoming appointment of the
missing members of the inter-ministerial committee, including its Chair, will enable monitoring
and evaluation of the performance contract to begin.
43.
Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of
Burkina Faso, SONABEL and SONABHY on financial relations and pricing of the transfer of
hydrocarbons to SONABEL, in particular the point concerning coverage of part of the debt of
SONABEL with SONABHY, had the following effects on the financial situation of SONABEL:



A decrease in operating liabilities vis-à-vis SONABHY of CFAF 40 billion, resulting in an
improvement in the creditworthiness of the company,



An increase in SONABEL's equity by that amount and, consequently, an improvement in
its financial structure.



The fall in fuel prices allows SONABEL to honor SONABHY's invoices at the new rates
within the contractual deadlines. Other operating liabilities and other short-term
liabilities are regularly paid on the scheduled dates.



Regarding the Government's commitments to clear CFAF 40 billion of SONABEL's debts
to SONABHY, in July SONABHY transferred CFAF 5 billion in dividends from 2015 and
CFAF 35 billion of capital gains realized during the first half of 2016.

44.
The Government's strategy is to increase the share of renewable and imported energy in
the energy mix and to reduce the use of diesel fuel for heavy fuel oil, which should help to lower
SONABEL's production costs. To that end, the Government decided to create the National
Agency for Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency (Agence Nationale des Energies
Renouvelables et de l’Efficacité Energétique – ANEREE), which has the following roles:
 Monitoring, supervising and promoting the renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency
(EE) market,
 Establishing a National Strategy for the Promotion of Energy Efficiency,
 Supporting, enhancing and piloting projects of national scope,
 Bringing together the private sector, NGOs, and technical and financial partners,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

BURKINA FASO




Performing commercial services and other public service missions in the RE and EE field,
and
Supporting research, innovation and training in the RE and EE field.

45.
The measures adopted in June 2016 aiming at a flexible structure of the hydrocarbons
purchase price agreed by SONABEL with SONABHY have already had a positive impact on the
financial situation of SONABEL and reduced the SONABEL’s government subsidy needs for 2016.
As far as SONABEL is concerned, the investments planned to facilitate energy imports from
neighboring countries as well as those in the area of solar energy will enable it to continue
reducing its production costs and improve energy supply, which may ultimately facilitate a
revision of electricity tariffs with a view to reducing them and making them more progressive. In
order to avert further accumulations of contingent liabilities to SONABHY in the event of rising
world oil prices, the gradual implementation of the automatic mechanism for adjusting
hydrocarbon prices in the domestic market is envisaged. A communication plan aimed at
explaining the rationale for this measure and the proposed mechanism, which will aim at
ensuring that pump prices remain consistent with cost-recovery, will be prepared by endDecember 2016.
Cotton sector and diversification of agriculture
46.
The Government wishes to restore the viability of the cotton price smoothing fund. The
smoothing fund no longer has sufficient resources to function. The available balance will be CFAF
2,076,167,969 when all three cotton companies have completed the repayment of CFAF 3.54/kg
of seed cotton as a rebate for the 2015/2016 season due to the implementation of the resolution
adopted at the General Assembly of the Inter-professional Cotton Association of Burkina
(Association interprofessionnelle du coton du Burkina – AICB) on April 20, 2016, which took
account of the exceptional support for the purchase price of seed cotton afforded by the
Burkinabe Government. The need to refinance the smoothing fund is acute in the medium term.
According to the recommendations of the study (carried out in December 2014) to consolidate
the mechanism and identify options for strengthening the financial resources of the smoothing
fund, a government subsidy of CFAF 23 billion is needed to give the fund the strategic reserve it
lacked at the outset and allow it to play its full role. Current forecasts indicate that world prices
should remain within the smoothing corridor for the 2016-17 season, but the preparation of a
replenishment strategy involving all relevant stakeholders is urgent given the long-term
unfavorable trend of world prices. This unfavorable development is also likely to lead to a rapid
increase in government subsidy requirements. For 2017, the Government has allocated a subsidy
of CFAF 35 per kilogram of seed cotton in the LFI, or about CFAF 20 billion on the basis of a
production target of 700,000 metric tons of seed cotton, to support the purchase price floor of
seed cotton to producers. However, the long-term negative outlook for the cotton sector makes
it imperative to have a strategy to improve value added in the sector as well as agricultural
diversification outside the cotton sector. This strategy is an important plank of our PNDES.

The Government supports the update of the base year for national accounts. The national
informal sector and employment survey has been carried out and the data are being analyzed.
The Government is also undertaking the study on gold panning, which is scheduled to start
before the end of December 2016; the findings of this study are expected to improve the
analyses for the base year update. Specific studies are also being carried out to improve the
estimation of national accounts. The new base year of the national accounts will be 2015 and the
compilation work will be carried out in 2017 in both the 1993 SNA and 2008 SNA.

V.

PROGRAM ARRANGEMENTS

48.
Considering the extension of the current program, the Government intends to take all the
necessary measures to achieve the objectives and criteria, as presented in Tables 1 and 3 of this
Memorandum. The program will be examined in keeping with the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU), which defines the quantitative performance criteria and requirements
regarding data reporting to Fund staff. The seventh and final review of the program is expected
to take place on or after May 15, 2017.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks that will serve to assess
performance under the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in 2016. It also
sets the framework and deadlines for the submission of data to IMF staff for assessment of
program implementation.
CONDITIONALITY
2.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2016 are
provided in Table 1 of the MEFP. The structural benchmarks set forth in the program are
presented in Tables 2 and 3 of the MEFP.
DEFINITIONS
3.
Government. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “government” means the central
administration of Burkina Faso and does not include local administrations, the central bank, or
any other public or government-owned entity with autonomous legal status not included in the
table detailing the financial operations of the state (TOFE).
4.
Definition of debt. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, the definition
of debt is set out in IMF Executive Board Decision No. 15688-(14/107), Point 8, as published on
the IMF website.
5.
Debt guarantees. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, a government
debt guarantee means an explicit legal obligation to service a debt in the event of nonpayment
by the borrower (through payment in cash or in kind).
6.
Debt concessionality. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, a debt is
considered concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent.9 The present value
(PV) of debt at the time it is contracted is calculated by discounting the borrower’s future debt
service payments on the debt.10 The discount rates used is 5.0 percent.
7.
External debt. For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, external debt is
defined as debt contracted or serviced in a currency other than the CFA franc. This definition also
applies to debt among WAEMU countries. The relevant performance criteria apply to the external
debt of the government, public enterprises that receive government transfers, and other public
entities in which the government holds more than 50 percent of the capital, and any private debt
This IMF webpage provides a tool to compute the grant element in a large range of financial arrangements:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator

9

The calculation of the concessionnality takes into account all aspects of the debt contract, including the date of
payment, the grace period, the schedule, the commissions and management fees.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

for which the government has extended guarantees that constitute a contingent liability for the
government.
QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
8.
The revised quantitative performance criteria proposed for 2015 are as follows: (i) a
ceiling on net domestic financing of the Treasury defined below in paragraph 9 and 10; (ii) a
ceiling on the contracting or guarantee of nonconcessional external debt by the government, as
defined in paragraphs 4 to 7, and (iii) a ceiling on the non-accumulation of payment arrears on
external debt service.
A. Net Domestic Financing of the Treasury
9.
For the purposes of the relevant performance criteria, net domestic financing is defined
as the sum of (i) net bank credit to the Treasury, including net bank credit to the Treasury as
defined below vis-à-vis the national banking institutions (claims associated with IMF
disbursements are included); (ii) the stock of unredeemed Treasury bills and bonds held outside
national commercial banks; (iii) privatization receipts and other Treasury claims and debts vis-àvis national nonbank institutions. Net bank credit to the Treasury is the balance of the Treasury’s
claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Treasury claims include the cash holdings
of the Burkinabè Treasury, deposits with the central bank, deposits with commercial banks, and
secured obligations, and Treasury deposits in postal checking accounts (CCP). Treasury debt to
the banking system includes funding from the central bank (including statutory advances,
consolidated advances, IMF financing, and refinancing of secured obligations), Treasury securities
held by the central bank, and funding from commercial banks (including Treasury securities held
by commercial banks). Net bank credit to the Treasury is calculated based on information
provided by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), whose figures are deemed valid for
program purposes. The foregoing items are calculated based on the Treasury budget execution
report presented each month in the Treasury flow-of-funds table prepared by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance.
Adjustment
10.
The cumulative ceiling on net domestic financing will be adjusted upward in the amount
by which external program support to central government, excluding project grants and project
loans, falls short of the amount projected, in the event the external program assistance is lower
than programmed, up to a maximum of CFAF 90 billion. The shortfall will be calculated in
reference to the projections in Table 1 below. The ceiling will not be adjusted downward in the
event the external program assistance is higher than programmed.

139.7

11.
The Ministry of the Economy and Finance will forward data on net domestic financing to
the IMF within six weeks after the end of each quarter.
B. Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government
Performance criterion
12.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee any nonconcessional external
debt beyond the ceiling indicated in MEFP Table 1. This performance criterion applies to external
debt as defined in paragraph 7 of this memorandum. It utilizes the concept of concessionality as
defined in paragraph 6 of this memorandum. This performance criterion also applies to any
private debt guaranteed by the government that constitutes a contingent government debt as
defined in paragraphs 4 to 7 of this memorandum. In addition, this criterion applies to public
enterprises that receive government transfers, local governments, and other public sector entities
(including public administrative, professional, scientific and technical agencies) unless excluded in
MEFP Table 1. However, this performance criterion will not apply to Treasury bills and bonds
issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market, to suppliers’ normal short-term credits, or
to IMF loans. This commitment is a performance criterion to be observed continuously. It is
measured on a cumulative basis from the IMF Executive Board’s approval of the ECF, and no
adjustment factor will apply.
Reporting deadlines
13.
Details on any loan (terms and creditors) contracted by the government must be
reported within four weeks of the end of each month. The same requirement applies to
guarantees extended by the government.
C. Non-accumulation of New External Payment Arrears
Performance criterion
14.
External payment arrears are external payments due but unpaid. Under the program the
government agrees not to accumulate external payment arrears on its debt, except arrears
arising from obligations being renegotiated with external creditors, including bilateral non-Paris

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

BURKINA FASO

Club creditors. No accumulation of new external arrears by the government is a performance
criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
15.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of external arrears will be
forwarded within six weeks after the end of each month.
OTHER QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
16.
The program also includes indicative targets for the ceiling on net domestic financing
beyond the Treasury, the overall deficit (commitment basis, grants included) as defined in
paragraph 18 below; total government revenue; poverty-reducing social expenditures.
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing beyond the Treasury
For the purposes of the indicative target, net domestic financing beyond the Treasury is defined
as the sum of (i) net bank credit to public bodies beyond the Treasury, including net bank credit
to these bodies as defined below vis-à-vis the national banking institutions (claims associated
with IMF disbursements are included); (ii) the stock of unredeemed bills and bonds held outside
national commercial banks; (iii) privatization receipts and other claims and debts of public bodies
beyond the Treasury vis-à-vis national nonbank institutions. Net bank credit to the public bodies
beyond the Treasury is the balance of the claims and debts of the bodies concerned vis-à-vis
national banking institutions. These include (i) deposits of public bodies (beyond the Treasury) at
the BCEAO, (ii) deposits of public bodies (beyond the Treasury) at the commercial banks, (iii)
commercial liabilities of public bodies beyond the Treasury, (iv) commercial bank liabilities of the
postal savings bank (CCP), (v) remaining Treasury deposits in postal checking accounts (CCP), (vi)
Treasury deposits at the CNE, (vii) other net liabilities of the State (secured obligations). Debt to
the banking system includes funding from the central bank (including statutory advances,
consolidated advances, IMF financing, and refinancing of secured obligations), government
securities held by the central bank, and funding from commercial banks (including any
government securities held by commercial banks). Net bank credit to public bodies beyond the
Treasury is calculated based on information provided by the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO), whose figures are deemed valid for program purposes.
B. Overall Deficit Including Grants
Definition
17.
For the program, the overall deficit including grants is valued on a commitment basis. It
is defined as the sum of the government’s net foreign and domestic financing, measured from
the financing side, plus a cash basis adjustment. Net foreign financing is the sum of new foreign
borrowing less amortization. Government net domestic financing is defined in paragraphs 9 and
10 above. The cash basis adjustment is defined as the sum of: (i) the total change in unauthorized

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

expenditure commitments, (ii) the change in pending bills, and (iii) the change in Treasury
deposits.
Adjustment
18.
The ceiling on the overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will be adjusted upward in the
amount by which external program support, excluding grants and project loans, falls short of the
projected amount, in the event the actual figures are lower than projected, up to a maximum of
CFAF 65 billion. The shortfall will be calculated in reference to the projections in Table 2 below.
The ceiling will not be adjusted downward in the event that actual external program assistance is
higher than projected.
19.
The ceiling on the overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will be adjusted downward in the
amount equivalent to the difference between projected and actual project loans in the event the
actual figures are lower than projected. The overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will be adjusted
upward in the amount equivalent to the difference between projected and actual project loans in
the event the actual figures are higher than projected. The difference in the amount will be
calculated in reference to the projections in Table 2 below.

C. Total Government Revenue
Definition
20.
Total government revenue is valued on a cash basis. It includes all tax and nontax
revenue collected by the Directorate General of Taxation, the Directorate General of Customs, the
Burkinabè Treasury, and revenue collection units at ministries and institutions. It also includes
revenue from treasury checks.
D. Poverty-Reducing Social Expenditures Definition
21.
Poverty-reducing social expenditures are defined as the expenditures of sectors
sponsoring the priority programs identified in the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and
Sustainable Development (SCADD) to accelerate the achievement of poverty reduction
objectives. Such expenditures cover all spending categories for the following ministries:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

BURKINA FASO

Promotion of Women and Gender Issues; Health; Social Action and National Solidarity; National
Education and Literacy; Agriculture and Food Security; Animal Resources; Environment and
Sustainable Development; Youth, Professional Training and Employment including the labor and
social security components of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Security; Water, Hydraulic
Improvements, and Sanitation. They also cover rural roads and Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative (Category 5) for Infrastructure, Integration, and Transport; and HIPC expenditures
only for Communication; Justice and Human Rights; Economy and Finance; and Mines, Quarries,
and Energy. Added to this is the allocation under section 98 “transfers to subnational
governments” from Health, Agriculture and Food Security as well as National Education and
Literacy. These expenditures are monitored directly through the budget, and the indicative
threshold for the program will be 90 percent of the amount established by the budget authority.
E. Non-accumulation of Domestic Payment Arrears
22.
The government will not accumulate payment arrears on domestic obligations during the
program period. This is a structural benchmark. Under the program, domestic payment arrears
arise when actual payment is made more than 90 days after liability is incurred for an undisputed
debt to a third party, except in cases where the terms and conditions of the transaction stipulate
a longer period. In the case of debt service, arrears arise 30 days after the due date. Payments are
deemed to be in arrears in keeping with the following definition:


Debt unpaid for more than 30 days after the due date stipulated in the agreement between
the parties (creditor/debtor).



Wages or pensions unpaid 90 days after their due date.



Payments for services rendered received more than 90 days after processing of the supporting
documents submitted by suppliers.

Additional Information for Program Monitoring
23.
To enable IMF staff to assess program performance, the government agrees to submit
the following data to them in paper format and/or MSC Excel electronic files, with the
frequencies and deadlines specified below.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion
point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point.
Hence these two amounts cannot be added. Burkina Faso owes a small amount of pre-HIPC Initiative arrears to nonParis Club creditors which continue to be deemed away under the revised arrears policy for official creditors, as the
underlying Paris Club agreement was adequately representative and the authorities make best efforts to resolve the
arrears.
2

3 Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The latest assessment of the BCEAO was
completed on December 13, 2013. The assessment found that the bank continued to have a strong
control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010 Institutional Reform of the
WAEMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit committee was established to
oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has increased with more timely
publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is committed to IFRS
implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in the external audit
process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through
selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits. All recommendations from the
assessment have been implemented.
Exchange System
Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
union's common currency, the CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1
= F 0.02. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 = F
0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Burkina Faso had not imposed measures that could give rise to
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund, if any such measure
is introduced. Burkina Faso maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. External sustainability, competitiveness
and exchange rate issues and were also discussed in the report “WAEMU: Common Policies of
Member Countries" (Country Report No. 16/96 of April 1, 2016).
Article IV Consultations
Burkina Faso is on a 24-month consultation cycle. Discussions took place in Ouagadougou
during October 18-29, 2016 for the 2016 Article IV Consultation and the Sixth Review under the
Extended Credit Facility. The latest Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on
July 3, 2014 (Country Report No.14/215).
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) Participation
A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund conducted a mission
under the FSAP program in 2008. A regional FSAP for the WAEMU was undertaken in 2007. A
ROSC on the data module was published in 2002.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The data
categories most affected are the national accounts and price statistics. Burkina Faso is receiving technical
assistance (TA) from the IMF on an ongoing basis, which is being partially financed by Japan.
National accounts: Annual GDP estimates are compiled by economic activity, by institutional sector
accounts and by expenditure categories at current and constant prices (1999=100). Data quality is
affected by the scarcity of suitable sources and deficiencies in statistical practices. Weaknesses include:
coverage of the informal sector (due to limited, out of date surveys, and a failure of small enterprises to
submit accounting statements or tax declarations); private household consumption data, which is not
adequately validated with supply-use tables and updated household budget-consumption surveys; and
delayed rebasing of NA. The national informal sector and employment survey was delayed to 2015 as a
result of the 2014 popular uprising. Data were collected at end 2015. Data cleaning work has begun and
is now completed. Work on the survey on the informal gold sector is expected to start before the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BURKINA FASO

end of the year and its findings will inform the rebasing exercise, which is expected to be completed
by 2018. The new base year will be 2015.
Price statistics: The CPI (2008=100) only covers African households in the capital; it excludes various
types of purchased goods and services, and services of owner-occupied dwellings and prices of
unavailable products are presumed unchanged for up to three months rather than imputed from
recorded prices changes of closely related products. The producer price index and the wholesale price
index are neither compiled nor envisaged due to budgetary constraints.
Government finance statistics: A committee oversees the compilation of government finance statistics,
strengthening coordination among fiscal agencies. The provision of expenditure data has also improved
with the adoption of functional presentation of expenditure. The remaining areas for improvement
include mainly the extension of the TOFE coverage to the general government and basing its compilation
on the Treasury ledger.
Monetary finance statistics: Most of the problems in monetary statistics are not specific to Burkina Faso
but affect all member countries of the WAEMU. The BCEAO has encountered difficulties in estimating
currency in circulation in each WAEMU member country due to large backlogs of unsorted banknotes
held by the central bank in its various national agencies.
Balance of Payments: The informal cross-border trade in goods is not estimated and could be large.
Information on remittances should be improved. Consistency between balance of payments (BOP) and
international investment position (IIP) should be checked. External debt statistics as reported to QEDS
cover only public debt.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Burkina Faso participates in the General Data Dissemination Standard since December 28, 2001. A data
ROSC visited Burkina Faso during May 8-21, 2003.

III. Reporting to STA
Balance of payments (BOP): The BCEAO`s National Direction located in Ouagadougou is compiling
annual BOP, IIP and CDIS data for Burkina and reporting them to STA. The reported BOP and IIP data are
in line with the BPM 6 format. Burkina Faso participates in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey
(CDIS) and reports to STA annual direct investment data by partner country. The reported CDIS data are
based on an annual survey of transactions, crosschecked with the annual Financial Reports of the
companies, as available in BCEAO. The BCEAO does not provide any metadata (describing the
methodology used for data collection) in relation to any of the datasets reported to STA.
Government Finances: Since October 2010, annual data and quarterly data covering the budget of the
central government are reported to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics and the
Government Finance Statistics yearbook. The latest reported data cover 2014. The BCEAO reports
monetary data to STA with a lag of at most three months.

SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde

Prepared jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association
(IDA)

This joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared in the
context of the 6th Review under the program supported by the IMF’s Extended Credit
Facility (ECF). It is based on new end-2015 debt data. The major change since the last
DSA update in June 2016 is the updated CPIA rating, which places Burkina Faso into the
medium-strength policies and institutions category and results in lower debt
sustainability thresholds. Nonetheless, Burkina Faso remains at moderate risk of debt
distress, as higher WEO projections for gold and cotton prices and improved prospects
for domestic gold production have improved the export and current account paths.1

1

Burkina Faso’s three-year average CPIA score is 3.68, which yields a policy performance category of medium.

BURKINA FASO

BACKGROUND AND UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Burkina Faso’s nominal stock of debt as of end-2015 was 32.5 percent of GDP (Text
Table 1). This is in line with the estimates from the 4th/5th ECF Review (32.2 percent) and the 2014
DSA (31.2 percent). The composition of
Text Table 1. Burkina Faso: Public Debt Stock
debt has continued to shift slowly
(2013–15)
towards domestic debt as external
support has not kept pace with GDP
growth and there has been a
pronounced increase in domestic
borrowing during the period of
political uncertainty. External debt still
comprised approximately 73 percent of
the total debt stock at end-2015, down
slightly from 75 percent in 2013.

2.
The most important change since the June 2016 DSA update is the incorporation of
updated CPIA ratings that now run until 2015.While Burkina Faso has consistently been assessed
as having strong policy and institutional frameworks through 2013, the popular uprising and political
transition in 2014 and 2015 have led to some deterioration in this overall assessment. The annual
CPIA rating declined from 3.77 in 2013 to 3.61 in 2015, with the rolling three-year average declining
from 3.77 at the time of the last joint DSA to 3.67 in the current DSA (Text Table 2). It must be noted
that the transition authorities were able to maintain macroeconomic stability under difficult
circumstances, and that the political transition ended successfully. Peaceful and fair elections were
held in November 2015 and a new government was in place by early 2016, with political stability
maintained since then. Against this background, policies and institutions are expected to improve,
which should translate into higher CPIA ratings going forward.

3.
Text Table 3 and Box 1 summarize the main differences in macroeconomic assumptions
between the previous full DSA (2014), the June 2016 DSA update for the 4th/5th ECF Review
and the current DSA. The most significant changes come from the volatility in the international
price of gold, Burkina Faso’s primary export. While gold price forecasts remain below the estimates
for the 2014 DSA, they have meaningfully rebounded from their end-2015 lows and are on a higher
trajectory than at the time of the 4th/5th ECF review. Real GDP growth is projected to remain broadly
similar to previous projections and to converge to about 6 percent over the long term.

Box 1. Burkina Faso: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Gold and cotton prices have continued to recover since
the last DSA. WEO gold price projections have rebounded 25
percent since their end-2015 lows and approximately 8
percent when compared to the previous DSA. Cotton price
projections have also improved since the previous DSA, with
2016 prices about 28 percent higher in the current DSA.

Gold production is expected to rise steadily over the
1100
medium term as new mines start operating. The coming
1000
on stream of new gold mines and upward revisions in
estimated gold reserves have led to an improved outlook for
the sector. Nevertheless, mining revenues are inherently volatile and subject to uncertainties regarding both
volume and prices.

GDP growth assumptions are somewhat higher than the baseline forecast during the 4th/5th ECF review,
largely resulting from an expected rebound in agricultural output, improved prospects in the gold sector,
and a significant scaling up of public investment.
The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) has increased slightly in the near term and is based on
relatively stable, but higher recurrent spending levels, but also a planned scaling up in domestically financed
public investment to tackle high infrastructure needs. The authorities are committed to improve domestic
revenue mobilization and to moderate recurrent spending to increase available fiscal space that can be
devoted to more growth-friendly spending and investment. Domestic revenue is expected to reach about 20
percent of GDP in 2019, from 15.9 percent in 2015. This along with upwardly revised assumptions on gold
revenue mitigate the increase in expenditures and lead to only moderately higher deficits through to 2020.
Debt composition: Domestic debt is assumed to continue to increase consistently throughout the forecast
horizon, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to deepen the domestic financial market and to continue to tap
into the regional market. The remainder of the deficit is financed via external debt, but on less generous
terms to reflect some non-concessional financing and a cautious assumption about the availability of
concessional financing going forward.
The current account deficit is forecast to continue shrinking from the unusually high level of 11.3 percent
of GDP in 2013 and eventually stabilize around its long-run expected average of about 5-6 percent by 2022.
Nevertheless, upside and downside risks to the current account are high and mainly relate to the evolution
of international commodity, hydrocarbon, and mineral prices.

4.
This DSA assumes continued modest use of non-concessional financing over the
forecast horizon. Text Table 4 depicts the authorities’ non-concessional borrowing plan for 2016. If
all the planned loan conventions are signed within the year, non-concessional borrowing should rise
to close to the program ceiling of CFAF 230 million.
5.
The DSA includes both already-contracted and anticipated borrowing on a
disbursement basis. The authorities have reiterated their ongoing commitment to rely as much as

possible on available concessional financing, but, in light of limited concessional resources, this DSA
includes an assumption that nonconcessional borrowing will be continued, at modest levels, through
the DSA horizon. Consistent with this and the conservative assumption of less concessional financing
going forward, the grant element of new borrowing is assumed to decrease gradually over the
forecast horizon. For 2017 it is assumed the authorities investment plans are constrained by a lack of
available affordable financing, thereby reducing public investment, the government deficit, and gross
borrowing requirements compared to the PNDES and the authorities draft 2017 budget.
6.
Strengthening debt management capacity will be essential to ensure that the planned
investment scaling up remains consistent with medium-term debt sustainability. The capacity
of the debt office to oversee the build up of external and domestic debt, as well as contingent
liabilities related to public-private partnerships implied by the government’s investment program
needs to be urgently strengthened. In particular, the authorities are invited to seek support to design
and implement a comprehensive debt management strategy, and to provide additional resources to
the debt office.

DSA RESULTS
A.

External Debt

7.
Compared with the previous DSA update, the DSA results are mainly affected by the
use of lower thresholds, though Burkina Faso remains at moderate risk of debt distress. A less
pessimistic external environment, in particular more favorable price projections for commodity
exports, along with the prospects of increased gold production help offset the additional borrowing
caused by a looser fiscal stance. Thus the baseline debt profile remains similar to that projected at
the time of the 4th/5th ECF review, and remains below all risk thresholds. There are however several
threshold breaches in the alternative scenarios caused by the move to the lower DSA thresholds.
8.
In particular, under the standardized stress tests, the debt-to-exports ratio breaches
the debt distress threshold in 2031 under the historical scenario and 2026 under the most
extreme scenario. The breach is wider than that under the 2014 DSA as the risk threshold for the
debt-to-exports ratio is revised from 200 to 150 percent under the current DSA, consistent with the
change in Burkina Faso’s CPIA rating. The volatility and sensitivity of exports can be largely
attributed to the volatility of gold prices in international markets, which is exacerbated by Burkina
Faso’s narrow export base.

B. Total Public Debt DSA Results
9.
The current DSA assumes continued increases in domestic financing, consistent with
the desire to deepen the domestic financial market and further tapping regional markets. The
region benefits from the ECB’s easy monetary stance and financing terms are historically fairly
favorable. In addition, the authorities continue to extend the maturities of domestic and regional
borrowing and are gradually working towards a goal of issuances of up to 6 years on regional bonds
in 2017. However, the projected increase in domestic debt remains modest. Nonetheless, in the
current environment of weak private sector credit growth, larger public debt issuances by the
authorities could further limit the availability of loanable funds and thus hamper private sector
development. The public debt-to-GDP ratio slowly rises over time and is estimated to peak at 50.9
percent of GDP in 2036.

C. An Alternative Scenario
Staff and the authorities collaborated to develop an alternative scenario that is more
optimistic than the baseline, but still constrained by the level of available financing and
implementation capacity (Text Table 5). The alternative scenario begins in 2017 with a more
optimistic assumption on external financial support, which includes higher grants and concessional
financing amounting to 1.9 percent of GDP. The increase is predicated on a successful December 7-8
round table in Paris and potentially higher commitments by development partners during 2017.
Domestically-financed investment is increased to 9.2 percent of GDP, up from 7.3 percent in the
baseline. GDP growth in 2017 rises to 6.8 percent, compared with 6.1 percent in the baseline, and
over the medium term trends at 7 percent versus 6.5 percent in the baseline. Steps taken by the

authorities to boost project execution in 2017, including streamlining and acceleration of
procurement processes, as well as close monitoring of the largest infrastructure projects, are
expected to facilitate the large increase in public investment.

10.
Under the alternative scenario, Burkina Faso’s debt sustainability improves slightly as
increases in GDP, revenues, and exports offset additional borrowing over the medium term.
The additional external support is assumed to consist mostly of grants and highly concessional
borrowing, resulting in a very moderate impact on the present value of debt. The alternative scenario
maintains the same assumptions as in the baseline regarding investment efficiency and growth
multipliers, taking into account the authorities’ efforts to improve investment execution and
prioritization. Furthermore, PNDES priority investments are heavily tilted towards filling key physical
infrastructure gaps, in particular in the energy sector, and are thus anticipated to have a positive
growth impact. Figure 1b plots the evolution of key debt sustainability indicators under the
alternative scenario. A caveat on the analysis remains that changes to key assumptions on the terms
and volume of additional financing, as well as the execution capacity during a scaling up of public
investment, can alter the results. In this regard other tools are better equipped to investigate the
long-term fiscal and debt sustainability implications of investment scaling up episodes, in particular
the debt-investment-growth nexus. The analysis in the Selected Issues Paper on scaling up public
investment makes use of the DIGNAR2 model to better capture the impact of higher capital spending
on growth, execution efficiency, fiscal space and debt sustainability.

CONCLUSION
11.
The DSA results indicate that Burkina Faso’s risk of debt distress remains “moderate.”
The baseline scenario shows no breach of debt distress thresholds for any of the indicators, despite a
reduction in the thresholds compared to the last DSA due to a change in Burkina Faso’s CPIA
categorization, but there are meaningful and sustained breaches under shock scenarios, which, taken
together, form the basis of maintaining a debt distress rating of ‘moderate’. Going forward, the

return to political stability ought to lead to improvements in the CPIA ratings. Nonetheless, even in
staff’s relatively conservative baseline scenario, there are risks associated with steadily rising external
and public debt levels. A reversal of the favorable external conditions including domestic and
regional financing terms and availability would raise the costs of domestic debt, and a terms of trade
shock would affect the current account and fiscal deficits. Other shocks (weather, security) could lead
growth or revenue collection to underperform and would lead to a more rapid debt accumulation.

Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities generally concurred with the DSA results and noted that the change in
CPIA score, and associated DSA thresholds, comes at an inopportune time given their
ambitious medium-term development strategy. The authorities felt that the deterioration in
Burkina Faso’s CPIA score was a result of the political transition of 2014-15. Going forward, they
noted that the return to political stability in a fair and free election, together with their
comprehensive structural reform agenda ought to lead to fairly rapid improvements in their CPIA
ratings. The authorities also emphasized their strong track record of macroeconomic management,
with prudent deficits and a relatively low level of indebtedness. Given the high expectations from the
population for swift reforms, the authorities saw the necessity to utilize some fiscal space to finance
public investment and catalyze sustainable economic growth. They nevertheless reiterated their
commitment to maintaining prudent debt levels and keep their assessed level of debt distress at a
‘moderate’ rating. The authorities maintained that the more optimistic alternative scenario better
reflects the likely path of the economy and have an expectation that this can even be exceeded,
provided additional external support, along with improvements in public investment execution, in
line with the PNDES’ objectives.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Mr. Sembene, Executive Director for Burkina Faso and
Mr. Nguema-Affane, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
December 16, 2016
Our Burkinabe authorities are thankful to Management and staff for Fund’s continued
program engagement with Burkina Faso as well as the constructive policy discussions that
have been maintained with them. The staff report gives a good account of these discussions,
which focused on addressing the countries’ infrastructure investment needs to foster higher
growth and structural transformation of the economy.
The Burkinabe authorities have continued to implement their Fund-supported program
satisfactorily amid a challenging domestic and external context. All end-June 2016
quantitative performance criteria and indicative benchmarks were met, most by wide margins.
At the same time, most of the structural benchmarks were met. This continued progress shows
the authorities’ commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability and strengthen the
foundations of growth in accordance with the national development plan.
Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the ECF arrangement
Economic activity picked up in 2016, following two years of weak growth.
Preliminary estimates indicate that while growth in the first quarter was negatively impacted
by the January terrorist attacks, it reached about 8.3 percent in the second quarter of 2016.
Overall, economic growth is projected to reach about 5.4 percent this year, driven by a
strong recovery in the services and the production of the two new gold mines. Inflation
declined at end-September 2016 on account of lower transport and energy prices and is
expected to be contained below 1 percent at end-2016. The overall fiscal deficit is projected at
2.5 percent of GDP in 2016, slightly below its 2015 level. The current account balance is
projected to improve this year, notably as a result of gold production and higher gold and
cotton prices.
Program implementation remains strong, as noted in the staff report. All quantitative
performance criteria and indicative benchmarks were met, most by wide margins. In the fiscal
sector, the overall fiscal deficit at end-June 2016 was met with a wide margin as total revenue
overperformance more than offset spending overruns caused by the implementation of the new
civil servants’ employment framework and other public wage agreements.
On the structural front, six of the eight end-June 2016 structural benchmarks were met
in a timely manner. In addition, the SONABHY’s quarterly financial report was transmitted as
expected—albeit with delay. While the use of a standardized invoice by large and mediumsized enterprises did not take place as scheduled, progress is being made on this front and
expected to completed by early 2017, as noted by staff.

As regard benchmarks set for the second half of 2016, the July 2016 benchmark
concerning the payment by SONABHY to the government to clear the arrears of the stateowned power company, SONABEL was met as scheduled, and a second payment planned for
2017 has also already been made. Moreover, with respect to the repayment of capital gains
owed to the State, an amount of CFAF 14.7 billion has been transferred by SONABHY to an
account at the BCEAO. The authorities are requesting that the benchmark concerning
combating fraud in the transport of fuel initially set for November 2016 be reprogrammed for
end-December 2016, due to delays in its implementation.
As a result of the implementation of the program’s structural measures, significant
inroads were made toward the program objectives of improving revenue mobilization, public
financial management, and transparency and the financial position of publicly-owned energy
sector enterprises.
Program for the remainder of 2016 and beyond
The authorities remain committed to implementing their economic and social program
supported by the ECF. For the remainder of the program period, continued focus will be made
on preserving macroeconomic stability and promoting sustained and inclusive growth, in line
with the country’s PNDES. The authorities expect growth to be higher in 2017 with notably
the implementation of the larger investment program envisaged in the PNDES, and the
expected rebound in the agricultural output following abundant rainfall in 2016.
The draft 2017 budget, which is consistent with the PNDES, is geared notably towards
creating fiscal space to increase public investment while preserving social expenditure and
maintaining debt sustainability. In this regard, the efforts already being made by the revenue
administrations will be pursued to increase mobilization of domestic revenue. The authorities
intend to implement the recommendations of the Fund technical assistance mission on transfer
pricing in 2017, and look to forward to further Fund support in the context of the tax code
revision. Recurrent spending is expected to decline as a share of GDP, notably as a result of
lower oil subsidies and measures taken to contain growth in both the wage bill and the
workforce with the objective to return to a wage bill-to-tax revenue ratio of approximately 35
percent by 2019, which is a WAEMU convergence criterion. Fiscal reforms to improve cash
management and accelerate the implementation of the investment program will be pursued.
Steps will be taken to further strengthen public financial management, building on
recent reform measures implemented on this front. These include measures to ease
implementation of development projects, programs and activities that were adopted by the
National Assembly in July 2016 and which relate primarily to (i) raising public procurement
thresholds, (ii) shortening the competition time frame in public procurement tenders, public
service license contracts and public-private partnerships, (iii) reducing the approval time for
contracts, (iv) eliminating double review of contracts financed with external resources, and (v)
the relaxation of the conditions for the approval of the decisions of award commissions,

contract selection, public service licensees and private partners. Following the adoption of
these measures, a new procurement code was submitted to the National Assembly with the aim
of complying with the WAEMU standard on the use of special procedures in public
procurement management. Going forward, the authorities have requested a Public Investment
Management Assessment (PIMA) in early 2017, to identify priority measures to improve the
execution of the investment budget.
While Public debt remains sustainable with the debt sustainability analysis showing
that Burkina Faso remains at a moderate risk of debt distress, the authorities are determined to
continue strengthening debt management. In this regard, they will particularly seek to improve
planning and monitoring of interventions in the regional markets and extend maturity of
securities. A strategy to validate ‘irregular’ domestic debts identified in the annual report of
the national anti-corruption authority will be adopted, upon verification of the corresponding
amounts. The External Stability Assessment reported in Annex I shows that Burkina Faso’s
CPIA rating is higher than its peers, illustrating the relative strength of the country’s policies
and institutions. In this light, we encourage staff to continue working closely with the
authorities strengthen institutional and debt management capacities further, notably with a
view to improving the country’s debt distress rating.
The authorities plan to take advantage of continued low oil prices to pursue the
reforms being undertaken in the energy sector. They will continue implementing the main
recommendations of the SONABEL and SONABHY external audits, to ensure more efficient
financial management and reduced operating costs. As regards SONABEL, the planned
investments to facilitate energy imports from neighboring countries and support the
development of solar energy will help the company to continue lowering its production costs
and increase electricity generation. To avoid the accumulation of new government contingent
liabilities vis-à-vis SONABHY in the event of an upturn in world oil prices, the authorities are
also considering to gradually implement the automatic adjustment mechanism for
hydrocarbon prices in the domestic market.
The authorities will pursue reforms to improve the competitiveness of the economy as
envisaged in the PNDES. In particular, the authorities will finalize a national financial
inclusion strategy in 2017. This will provide an opportunity to consolidate the various
financial inclusion and microfinance initiatives and to prioritize the key reforms that will
facilitate improved access to financial services. While the banking system remains sound,
relatively profitable and well-capitalized, vulnerabilities related weak credit growth and credit
concentration need to be addressed. Against this background, ongoing efforts to promote
financial sector development and stability will thus be sustained in close collaboration with
the BCEAO.
Request for Access Augmentation and Future Engagement with the Fund
In July 2016, the authorities adopted a new national development plan (Plan National

4

de Développement Economique et Social, PNDES), which sets out strategic guidelines for
economic and social development for the period 2016-2020. The PNDES draws on the
presidential program, the “Burkina 2025” vision, and regional and global initiatives such as
the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The overall
objective of the PNDES is to structurally transform the Burkina Faso economy into one of the
strong, sustainable, resilient and inclusive growth that creates decent jobs for all and brings an
improvement in social well-being. The plan is built on three strategic pillars: (i) institutional
reform and administrative modernization, (ii) development of human capital, and (iii)
stimulation of sectors that are drivers of economic growth and job creation. The plan
envisages a notable increase in public investment to upgrade energy, transportation, and water
management infrastructure. The plan also includes a strategy to improve value added in the
cotton sector as well as agricultural diversification outside the cotton sector, to reduce the
country’s external vulnerability.
To mobilize the financing needed for the PNDES a donor roundtable was held in Paris
on December 7-8, 2016, with the World Bank acting as the lead of the technical and financial
partners.1 Significant donors’ pledges were received on that occasion, demonstrating the
interest of the country’s partners in assisting the authorities in the implementation of their
development plan. The Burkinabe authorities greatly appreciated the contribution of the Fund
at this event.
In order to support the PNDES and ensure continuity, the Burkinabe authorities are
requesting an extension of the program by nine months until September 2017 and an
augmentation of SDR 4.47 million to be disbursed upon completion of a seventh review in
June 2017. The authorities have expressed an interest in a successor arrangement which is
likely to be requested at the time of the seventh review of the current arrangement.
Conclusion
Our Burkinabe authorities have continued to implement the ECF-supported program
satisfactorily. Despite a difficult security situation in early 2016, the government managed to
keep the program on track. In particular, the adoption of two supplementary budgets helped
strengthen the tools at the government’s disposal to execute the program and safeguard
poverty-reducing social expenditures. Going forward, the authorities are committed to
implementing prudent policies in the context of the newly adopted PNDES, which notably
envisages a scaling-up of public investment.
In light of the good progress made in the implementation of the program, they are
requesting the completion of the sixth review under the ECF as well as the modification of the
performance criterion on non-concessional borrowing, an extension of the current
arrangement by nine months until September 2017, and an augmentation of access under the
current arrangement that will be disbursed at the time of the seventh review. We would
appreciate Directors’ favorable consideration of the authorities’ requests.
