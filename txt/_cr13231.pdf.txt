STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
WITH MEMBER COUNTRIES

KEY ISSUES
Context. Substantial collective actions have addressed important tail risks. But the
recovery remains elusive. Growth has weakened further and unemployment is still rising,
and the risks of prolonged stagnation and inflation undershooting are high. Mounting
social and political tensions pose an increasing threat to reform momentum.
Policies. Further efforts are needed to address the twin challenges of reviving growth
and creating jobs. This requires actions on multiple fronts, which are mutually
reinforcing:
Repairing banks balance sheets. This is essential to restore confidence and revive credit
growth. A comprehensive, forward-looking assessment of banks’ asset quality should
quantify any capital shortfalls. A clear plan is needed on how potential capital
requirements will be met—including through a common backstop such as European
Stability Mechanism direct recapitalization. The involvement of an independent third
party is essential to ensure the transparency and credibility of the exercise.
Making further progress on banking union. This is critical to prevent ring-fencing, sever
bank-sovereign links, and, ultimately, reverse fragmentation. The Single Supervisory
Mechanism legal framework should be finalized without delays. A strong resolution
mechanism, based on a centralized authority with power to trigger resolution and make
decisions on burden sharing, is critical to ensure timely and least-cost resolution.
Providing sufficient near-term support. Additional unconventional monetary support
(targeted long term refinancing operations, lower collateral haircuts) could also help
reduce fragmentation. Given the weak growth and subdued inflation outlook, further
monetary easing will likely be necessary to support demand as well. And fiscal
adjustment should be paced to avoid an excessive drag on growth.
Advancing structural reforms. A targeted implementation of the Services Directive would
remove barriers to protected professions, promote cross-border competition, and,
ultimately, raise productivity and incomes. A new round of Free Trade Agreements could
provide a much-needed push to improve services productivity through deeper
integration. Improved portability of pensions and unemployment benefits would further
increase labor mobility across the region. And continued labor market reforms would
facilitate the needed adjustment in relative prices in the periphery, which should be
supported by rebalancing efforts of the surplus countries.

THE EVOLVING LANDSCAPE
Imminent tail risks have been addressed, but the growth crisis has deepened
1.
Policy actions at the euro area and national level have reinforced the collective
commitment to the euro. The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) framework has
removed dangerous tail risks related to euro area breakup (Box 1). Initial progress on banking
union—the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) agreement, the European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) framework for direct bank recapitalization,
the Bank Recovery and Resolution directive
(BRRD)—has demonstrated the commitment to
improving EMU architecture. Other critical steps
to address the crisis have included: the
completion of the ESM firewall; the extension of
official loan maturities to program countries; and
the agreement on Greece and Cyprus. These
actions, along with reductions in external
imbalances
and
progress
by
national
governments in restoring the health of public
finances, have boosted confidence in the longterm viability of the monetary union.
2.
Severe market stresses have subsided, although private borrowing costs have
remained too high in the periphery. In these economies, sovereign borrowing costs have declined
from unsustainable levels. This has led to slightly lower private borrowing costs, spurring bond
issuance among some banks and firms. Capital flight has gradually eased, bank deposits have
stabilized, and Target 2 imbalances have narrowed. This has contributed to some early repayment of
official liquidity support (LTROs) by stronger banks, though largely from core countries. Still,
periphery bank risks are significantly higher than in the core. And lending rates to corporations
continue to vary widely among euro area members, especially for smaller enterprises.

Periphery: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Core: Austria,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium

EURO AREA POLICIES

Box 1. The Impact of OMTs
Financial market stresses in the euro area reached unsustainable levels by mid-2012. Sovereign yields
for some large periphery economies were effectively on an unsustainable path that was reinforced by market
panic. The liquidity crisis made monetary policy dysfunctional and generated tail risks of euro area exit. In
this context, the ECB’s commitment to do “whatever it takes”—including by establishing the OMTs
framework—improved the functioning of monetary policy and safeguarded the viability of the euro.
The announcement of OMTs reduced tail risks (see Spillover Report). Spreads on periphery government
bonds declined from unsustainable levels, translating into lower private borrowing costs in these economies.
As perceptions of redenomination risk receded, capital flight from the periphery gradually reversed, and
Target 2 imbalances narrowed. Outside the euro area, funding costs of emerging European sovereigns
declined to record low levels; safe haven flows to small advanced European countries (Switzerland, Denmark)
subsided. Financial market volatility declined across large systemic economies.

3.
Notwithstanding substantial stabilization over the last year, the recent turbulence in
global markets has tightened financial conditions in the euro area. The prospect of scaled-back
U.S. monetary support—observed in the wake of the May 2013 Federal Open Market Committee
meeting—has led to higher sovereign yields across the region, reversing some of the gains achieved
in the periphery since the OMTs announcement. Unlike previous bouts of stress, German yields have

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

also increased, limiting the scope for periphery yields to decline without a further compression in
their relative spreads. At the same time, euro area money market rates have also increased, raising
expectations of higher interbank funding costs and leading to tighter monetary conditions.
4.
Growth has continued to disappoint. GDP contracted by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of
2013, after declining by 0.6 percent in 2012. Real activity in the euro area remains below pre-crisis
levels. Recessionary forces have persisted in most periphery countries, as households and firms
continue to struggle with heavy debt, high borrowing costs, and contracting credit. The growth
weakness has also spilled over to core economies (France, Germany) added to budgetary pressures,
and weighed on banks’ asset quality across the area.

5.
Inflation has fallen below the ECB’s primary objective and is expected to remain
subdued, raising concerns about underlying deflationary trends. Headline inflation, at 1.6
percent in June 2013, has declined to levels last seen in mid-2010. Inflation in the large economies
(Germany, Italy, and Spain) is now close to the euro area average, while it is significantly lower or
even negative in program countries. Core inflation has also moderated since early 2012—to about
1½ percent in the first quarter of 2013—reflecting increasing slack throughout the euro area.
Although survey-based inflation expectations remain broadly anchored, market-based indicators for
some large euro area countries have begun to drift downward. In turn, below-objective inflation has
complicated relative price adjustment and the reduction in debt burdens.
6.
At the same time, mounting social and political tensions pose an increasing threat to
reform momentum. With real activity shrinking, the euro area unemployment rate has reached
record highs (over 12 percent in May), especially among the youth. Rising social stresses threaten
the political commitment to sustain adjustment efforts at the national level, especially in countries
where policy space to support growth and tackle unemployment is limited.

Box 2. Indebtedness and Deleveraging in the Euro Area
High debt and the simultaneous deleveraging of firms, households, banks, and the public sector can
weigh on growth through various channels. High debt increases agents’ vulnerability to asset price
shocks, financial volatility, and uncertainty. Negative feedback loops between highly-indebted private
sectors, a weak financial sector, and a sovereign under stress may constrain demand and credit conditions.
In particular, uncertainty about the private sector’s ability to service its high debt burden can raise questions
about banks’ asset quality, and impair financial sector intermediation. Asset holdings could buffer the
impact, but they are often illiquid or unevenly distributed across agents.

Balance sheet adjustment in the euro area may prove more challenging now than in other episodes
and regions in the past.

 A look at previous episodes of household deleveraging is revealing: historically, almost all of the run-up in
household debt (during the boom period) tends to be reversed. But in the euro area, the reduction in
debt-to-GDP ratios has barely started, and the boom was more pronounced. Furthermore, in past
deleveraging episodes, the debt reversal was largely facilitated by high inflation and growth, and
supported by expansionary fiscal policy. Because these factors will not contribute much to the ongoing
deleveraging process in the euro area periphery, the adjustment is likely to be protracted and have to rely
more on reductions in nominal debt. The contrast with history is similarly sobering when it comes to
corporate debt.

 Econometric analysis suggests that when all three sectors (government, households, and firms) are highly
indebted, the negative growth impact of debt is highest. In addition, high corporate and household debt
is associated with worse growth outcomes than public sector indebtedness. This suggests that headwinds
are likely to be particularly strong in the periphery where all sectors are highly indebted.
Policies that directly support the workout of bad debt in the financial and private sectors can help
avoid a protracted period of stagnation. While the policy space to support private sector deleveraging is
more constrained than in the past, experience suggests that direct and decisive policy actions can support
deleveraging. More specifically, at the national level, insolvency regimes need to be made more effective
(e.g., by facilitating out-of-court settlements, reducing time for insolvency proceedings) and provide more
flexibility in dealing with personal or corporate bankruptcy. Policies to encourage debt write-offs and help
facilitate the transfer of non-performing assets to new owners would also support the repair of bank balance
sheets (e.g., by fostering a market for NPL-backed securities).

in borrowing costs within the euro area. This could further complicate the conduct of monetary
policy and potentially damage area-wide demand and growth. Financial market stresses could
also quickly reignite, not only because sovereign debt levels remain high but also from
incomplete or stalled delivery of policy commitments at the euro area level—progress on
banking union, single rulebook, and final agreement on ESM direct recapitalization—or delays in
fiscal adjustment and structural reforms at the national level.

In the medium-term, there is a high risk of stagnation, especially in the periphery. This could
stem from larger-than-envisaged effects from private and public sector deleveraging,
entrenched fragmentation, and delayed structural reforms. Such an outcome could push the
periphery toward a debt-deflation spiral. In the core, real activity could also suffer due to
confidence effects and trade links. Persistently high unemployment and subdued investment
would erode the region’s growth potential. In such a scenario, euro area and global GDP levels
might be about 4 percent and 1 percent below the baseline by 2018, respectively (see Spillover
Report).

A. Reversing Fragmentation
Repairing banks’ balance sheets is a prerequisite3
13.
Restoring banking sector health is essential for the recovery. As discussed in the recent
EU FSAP, the crisis has shown that frail banks have been unable to function as proper financial
intermediaries during the recovery. Instead, they have relied on elevated lending rates to boost
profitability and enhance capital buffers—especially where funding costs remain high. In addition,
these banks have been either unable or unwilling to recognize and provision for higher losses,
leading to further balance sheet weakness, limiting their ability to lend, and reinforcing
fragmentation.4 Reversing these dynamics means recognizing losses, filling capital holes, closing or
restructuring nonviable banks.
14.
By lifting confidence in the euro area banking system, a credible assessment of banks’
asset quality would help lower funding costs and address fragmentation. Such an exercise
would help resolve the uncertainty about bank balance sheets and improve the prospects for
attracting private capital to weak banks. This, in turn, would help unclog credit flows.


The forthcoming Balance Sheet Assessment (BSA) of euro area banks, required ahead of the
start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), to be followed by stress tests, provides such an
opportunity. It is also critical to establish the ECB’s credibility as a supervisor. Key elements to
ensure the effectiveness of this approach include: (1) a forward-looking framework that
incorporates risks to growth and is clearly communicated well in advance of the exercise; (2)
harmonized methodologies and stringent standards for nonperforming loans, provisioning rules,
and risk weights (as proposed by the EBA); and (3) full coverage of banks coming under direct
supervision of the SSM.



Independent third-party involvement (preferably from the private sector), along with the ECB,
the EBA and national authorities, would be essential to ensure full credibility and transparency of
the exercise. In the absence of such involvement, prospects for raising private capital would be
jeopardized.

15.
An agreed strategy on how to address capital shortfalls would be critical to prevent
pro-cyclical deleveraging. Absent such a strategy, there is a high risk that the BSA and the
following stress tests would be counter-productive: if banks shed assets to preemptively build
buffers, this would reinforce fragmentation rather than resolve it. In addition, the incentives to
conduct a thorough and credible exercise could be skewed. Conversely, a clear plan on filling capital
gaps would encourage a realistic write-down of assets and full recognition of losses, which would
encourage private capital. Where private funds are insufficient, the public sector would need to
provide capital in countries with available fiscal space. However, in the event both private capital and

FSAP, completed earlier this year.

EURO AREA POLICIES

fiscal space are limited, clarity on a common backstop would be critical. In particular, it would avoid
the re-ignition of adverse bank-sovereign links and improve incentives for regulators to recognize
losses. Competition and state-aid rules may also need to be reassessed to ensure that conditions
attached to public support do not lead to excessive deleveraging.
16.
The ESM can serve as an effective common backstop. The recent agreement on the main
features of the ESM direct recapitalization framework—including the conditions for access, time of
entry, burden sharing, valuation, conditionality, and governance—is an important step forward.
Nevertheless, several issues remain:


Timing. The timing of the final agreement on the ESM direct recapitalization is still uncertain, as
it is linked to the legislative processes of the BRRD and DSG Directive.



Conditionality and burden sharing. State aid conditionality would be a prerequisite for ESM
direct recapitalization, which could raise issues about the use of bail-ins under the forthcoming
EC rules. The role of bail-ins in ensuring burden sharing with the private sector has been clarified
usefully in the BRRD (see discussion in ¶21). But if its early activation is required for ESM direct
recapitalization, the new regime should be applied consistently across countries and with due
regard to any adverse consequences for financial stability, especially in the event of resolution of
large systemic institutions.



Size and access. Although it is difficult to pre-judge the eventual needs, the limit for ESM
resources available for direct recapitalization has been set at €60 billion (subject to review by the
ESM Board). However, when needed, ESM direct recapitalization should be available on a timely
basis, so that the ESM can be seen as an effective and credible common backstop.

In parallel, policies at the national level can help address high private debt
17.
Improved national legislative and judicial frameworks could support an orderly
deleveraging of the non-financial sector. Where needed, addressing high private sector debt
directly can facilitate the early rescue of viable firms and a speedy exit of nonviable ones, opening
the door to a rebound in investment and a reallocation of resources to more productive sectors.
Doing so would also strengthen the quality of banks’ assets beyond the BSA, allowing for a revival in
credit. If effective, national insolvency regimes would also support the clean-up of banks’ balance
sheets by accelerating the workout of bad private sector debt. Yet, out-of-court restructurings—a
speedy, cost-effective alternative to court-supervised proceedings—are still underutilized tools in
many jurisdictions, notwithstanding recent advances in insolvency regimes in several euro area
countries. A stronger institutional infrastructure and supporting bank regulatory policies could
provide further incentives for debtors and creditors to engage in debt restructuring.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

A fuller banking union would solidify efforts on banks’ balance sheets
18.
The banking union has an essential role to play in supporting bank balance sheet
repair and reversing fragmentation.5 The recent agreement by the European Council on the BRRD
is welcome. But swiftly advancing the roadmap for the banking union, outlined by the Council in
December 2012, is key to ensure that all elements are in place—the SSM, the SRM, common safety
nets, and the accompanying directives. Further delays and dilution of the roadmap, including on the
SRM, would preserve an unsatisfactory status quo and run the risk of destabilizing confidence again.
19.
An effective SSM is a precondition to a systematic approach to supervision, as
highlighted in the EU FSAP. This would, in particular, help reverse fragmentation by restricting
ring-fencing imposed at the national level.


While posing significant challenges, the remaining steps to make the SSM operational need to
be finalized without delay. These include: passing the SSM legislation through the European
Parliament (expected in September); clarifying outstanding legal uncertainties (e.g., on the
respective responsibilities of the ECB and national authorities); finalizing a common supervisory
model and detailed manual; and ensuring full cooperation of national supervisors. Guaranteeing
full sharing of supervisory information (between national supervisors and the ECB) and building
up supervisory capacity at the ECB would be critical to establish the credibility of the new
supervisor in the forthcoming balance sheet review.



Early intervention powers are essential to prevent banks’ problems from becoming systemic. The
current crisis has shown the deleterious effects when those are lacking, especially in the absence
of a robust resolution mechanism. To be fully effective, the ECB would need to be able to bring
any bank under its direct supervision, take early intervention measures (e.g., capital conservation
measures, the replacement of management, or sale of bank activities), and initiate resolution.

20.
But without a strong SRM complementing the SSM, the credibility and effectiveness of
the banking union would be jeopardized. As recommended by the EU FSAP, an SRM should
become operational by the time the SSM becomes effective. Leaving resolution responsibilities at
the national level while supervision is centralized carries significant risks, such as perpetuating banksovereign links and creating potential conflict (and deadlock) among national authorities in crossborder resolution. In that respect, such a framework would fail to break away from the current
ineffective setting. Conversely, an SRM based on a centralized resolution authority—Single
Resolution Authority (SRA)—would allow for swift decisions on burden sharing arrangements and
ensure least cost resolution.6 To effectively break bank-sovereign links, the SRA would need to have
access to an effective common fiscal backstop, ultimately backed by a combination of ex ante and
ex post industry levies. A credit line by the ESM could be a bridge to that permanent solution.
5

This builds on the recommendations of the 2012 Article IV Consultation for the Euro area that the immediate priority
is a banking union for the euro area, with a common supervisory framework, deposit guarantee scheme, and bank
resolution authority. See also Staff Discussion Note 13/1 A Banking Union for the Euro Area.
6
The powers and tools of SRM should be aligned with emerging best practices, as described in the FSB Key Attributes
of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21.
Clear rules on the role of bail-ins will reduce uncertainty for private investors. In
particular, spelling out the pecking order in the event of bank intervention helps provide the right
incentives for investors, allows for market discipline, and minimizes the cost of resolution to
taxpayers. In this context, the Council’s recent agreement is an important milestone.7 It confirms the
role of bail-ins as an instrument to ensure burden sharing for nonviable banks and specifies a
minimum amount of “bail-in-able” instruments (8 percent of total liabilities). In addition, the bail-in
provisions allow flexibility in application to allow for specific threats to financial stability or
institutional factors. Keeping such flexibility to a minimum level will help promote a level-playing
field across banks and countries. While allowing exceptions could open the door to inequality of
treatment across countries, the “constrained discretion” will also make the framework more credible
by addressing concerns about systemic cases and minimizing value destruction and risks to financial
stability.
22.
Enforcing depositor preference across EU member states will also play an important
role in ensuring financial stability, along with progress on the DSG Directive. The BRRD and its
new bail-in rules introduce tiered depositor preference—a major step forward that has been
supported fully by IMF staff.8 These rules are expected to come into force in 2018, but they may be
applied on a case-by-case basis before then. Details on the mechanisms to constrain discretion and
the criteria for exempting liabilities may need to be clarified. In this context, strong powers at the
center (SRM) will make sure that the bail-in rules are applied predictably and consistently across
countries. This will improve incentives for early intervention, sever the bank-sovereign links, and
ensure least-cost resolution.
Targeted monetary policies are necessary to reduce fragmentation in the shorter run
23.
While efforts to clean up bank balance sheets and strengthen the banking union
proceed, the ECB should play a role in preventing an escalation in fragmentation. 9 At the
current juncture, support to the corporate sector through reduced borrowing costs is critical to
prevent a further deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook. On current plans, the BSA will not be
conducted until early 2014, and the benefits of better capitalized banks and a more complete
banking union will take even longer to accrue. Meanwhile, the risk of a vicious circle is setting in,
with the recession and higher non-performing assets leading to further bank losses, and deeper
fragmentation. To stem that risk, the ECB could provide additional term funding to avert a more
severe contraction in credit and target measures to support SME financing—as a temporary bridge
until the banking sector is in a position to intermediate growth again. While this strategy would
require the ECB to take additional credit risks onto its balance sheet, these could be mitigated by
offsetting measures or a potential backstop provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES



Providing term funding. One possibility is for the ECB to build on the existing approach to
provide term funding for weak but solvent banks, to better match the duration of their assets. A
new LTRO of longer tenor (3-5 years) combined with a review of current collateral policies to
lower haircuts on specific assets (e.g., additional credit claims linked to SME loans and asset
backed securities) would achieve such a target. And taken together, these measures would be
akin to credit easing.



Targeted credit easing. Another complementary avenue is for the ECB to undertake targeted
credit easing measures, by explicitly linking additional liquidity to new SME lending, along the
following two options:
i)

Targeted LTROs, akin to the Funding for Lending Scheme implemented in the U.K., but with
stronger incentives for banks to participate by keeping the cost of funding through the
scheme low. In particular, costs close to ECB policy rates are likely to elicit interest from
banks in stressed countries where term funding costs remain elevated, thereby supporting
monetary policy transmission and credit.

ii)

Direct ECB purchases of private assets: Such purchases would have the advantage of
bypassing the banking system while balance sheets are being repaired. Private assets
could include: securitized assets (supporting SME financing), corporate bonds, commercial
paper, and covered bonds. However, the impact would be constrained, at this stage, by the
small size of the securitized market and regulatory hurdles that would take time to
overcome.

B. Supporting Demand
The weak growth and inflation outlook warrants further conventional monetary policy action
24.
Further policy rate cuts, including negative deposit rates, would help support demand
and bring inflation back in line with the primary objective. The room for cuts remains limited.
Yet reducing the interest rates on the deposit facilities (marginally) below zero could help anchor
expectations of a looser monetary stance and would be a strong form of forward guidance (see
below). In particular, this would lower expectations of future increases in policy rates and further
encourage banks with excess liquidity to reengage in the interbank market and extend credit. While
lower bank profitability may either drive up interest rates on loans or fees on certain banking
services for those banks (the “unintended consequences”), this is likely to affect mostly core banks,
which on average are stronger at this juncture.
25.
Explicit forward guidance would help anchor interest rate expectations and reduce
funding uncertainty. The ECB’s forward guidance introduced in early July is helpful in this regard,
but it may need to be relied upon further if conditions worsen. This is particularly relevant given the
ongoing decline in excess Eurosystem liquidity and risks to interbank rates from global monetary
shocks (i.e., uncertainty about the exit from unconventional monetary policies in the U.S.). In this
context, the ECB could consider various additional actions, including reducing interest rates into
negative territory, continuing full allotment MROs at fixed rates beyond mid-2014, or extending this

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

EURO AREA POLICIES

to additional LTROs. Intervening directly in short-term euro area money markets could be another
(and potentially powerful) option to signal the intended policy stance.
Box 3. Fragmentation and Monetary Transmission in the Euro Area
Euro area financial markets remain fragmented, despite the range of ECB actions to address bank funding
problems and eliminate excessive risk in sovereign
markets. Following the introduction of OMTs, sovereign
and corporate risk has fallen, but bank CDS spreads
remain elevated. Term funding costs are still high for
periphery banks, weighing on bond issuance, while
declining asset quality is raising provisioning needs.
Cross border banking flows remain low, and lack of
market finance makes weak banks highly reliant on
official liquidity. These factors have contributed to
driving

markets

significantly above those in the core, impeding the flow
of credit, and undermining the transmission of monetary
policy.
Interest and credit channels are impaired. Declining interbank activity has undermined the interest rate
channel. The bank lending channel is still impaired as a result of lack of term-funding for certain banks and
weak bank balance sheets. In addition, ongoing corporate and household balance sheet adjustment is feeding
into low demand for credit and higher nonperforming loans.
Fragmentation and the broken monetary transmission mechanism impact SMEs disproportionately, as
evidenced by higher lending rates for small loans and high loan rejection rates for SMEs as compared to
larger entities. Ensuring credit availability to viable SMEs is essential to support the recovery in the euro area,
particularly as they account for about 80 percent of employment and 70 percent of value added in Italy, Spain,
and Portugal.
A simple econometric model finds that interest rate pass-through has been affected by the above
factors. In particular, the regression results support the notion that funding costs, credit risk, and leverage
have become important determinants of lending rates since the onset of the crisis, particularly for stressed
countries, and that these factors appear to be more relevant for small loans, typically associated with SMEs.
These findings highlight the importance of cleaning up bank balance sheets and other measures to
increase access to credit to SMEs. Repairing bank balance sheets and making further progress on a banking
union are essential to restore confidence in the financial system, weaken bank-sovereign bank loops, reduce
fragmentation, and support credit and growth. At the same time, given that bank balance sheet repair will
take time to complete, it is important to stem the decline in the real economy through various measures to
support credit supply.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

Pacing fiscal adjustment would also restrain headwinds to growth
26.
For the area as a whole, the negative growth impact of consolidation could reach as
much as 1-1¼ percentage point this year. Across the EMU, the pattern of adjustment remains
highly pro-cyclical, with larger consolidations in the periphery and broadly neutral (or mildly
expansionary) stances in Germany and Austria.
27.
In this context, the challenge is to avoid excessive damage on demand while putting
debt levels on a sustainable downward path. To ensure that negative growth surprises do not
trigger additional consolidation, defining and assessing adjustment in structural terms is key, as was
done in the context of the recent postponement of the EDP deadline. Nevertheless, given weak
growth prospects, these deadlines may still prove to be overly ambitious in some cases, and even
more flexibility may be useful, particularly if countries use that fiscal space to implement ambitious
structural reforms (e.g., entitlement and tax reforms), or to recapitalize viable banks. In this context,
the small projected loosening of the fiscal stance in Germany is appropriate. If downside risks
materialize, countries that are not under market pressure would benefit from a slower pace of fiscal
adjustment.
28.

A credible medium term framework is a precondition to pace fiscal adjustment.



Budgetary frameworks. To preserve credibility in the coordination process and ensure that
consolidation is sustained over a longer horizon, there is a strong argument for using welldefined, multi-year budgetary frameworks—with fiscal measures identified in advance—and
realistic macroeconomic assumptions underlying medium-term adjustment plans.



Implementation and enforcement. Ownership of medium term objectives is expected to improve
as national legislation and independent fiscal agencies assume a stronger role in the future,
following the entry into force of the Fiscal Compact, Six Pack, and Two Pack. In this setting, the
credibility of the framework would only be as strong as its implementation, especially regarding
enforcement provisions. Therefore, achieving a timely implementation, a uniform degree of
ambition across national setups, and consistent objectives between national and supranational
layers would be important tests for the governance framework.



Complexity. More broadly, the growing complexity of the current framework, in which the center
has relatively weak enforcement capabilities, may cast doubt on its efficiency and acceptability
by the public. Over time, a potential remedy could be to strengthen the role of the center and
lay the foundations for greater risk sharing. This would help prevent idiosyncratic shocks (or
policies) from morphing into a systemic crisis in the future.

C. Carrying on with Structural Policies
Ambitious structural policies are instrumental for growth, jobs, and rebalancing
29.
A new growth agenda could help catalyze efforts at both the area-wide and national
levels. Although the benefits from reforms will take time to accrue, a firm commitment to attainable
targets could lift confidence, even in the short term.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

EURO AREA POLICIES



Fostering job creation. The ongoing rebalancing in the periphery has been skewed toward labor
shedding, disproportionally affecting the young. Labor market reforms should be aimed at
tackling labor market duality, promoting bargaining arrangements conducive to sustainable
wage developments, and enabling firms to absorb shocks. Meanwhile, severance costs for
permanent job contracts should be aligned with EU norms where they are significantly higher. At
a minimum, employment protection should be more systematically linked to the length of
employment in the firm, and increase continuously with tenure to avoid the threshold effects
that characterize dual systems.10 By promoting the incentives for companies to hire, these
reforms would facilitate the reallocation of resources to exporting sectors and increase trend
growth, thereby fostering job creation and more sustainable adjustment. Area-wide, improved
portability of pension and unemployment benefits would contribute to increasing labor mobility
across the region. Bilateral national initiatives can also support migration from regions of high
unemployment to areas with skill shortages (e.g., through job and language training). Across the
euro area, incentives targeted at female and older workers would help raise labor force
participation rates where they are particularly low.



Promoting greater integration. Although the Single Market has fueled European growth over the
past decades, labor mobility and cross-border competition in services remain limited. A targeted
implementation of the Services Directive would help reduce barriers to entry in protected
professions, foster competition by promoting cross-border provision of services, and enhance
productivity and living standards. In addition, a new round of Free Trade Agreements could
secure access to growing markets, including in emerging Asia. It could also provide a muchneeded push to improve services productivity through deeper integration, which is under
discussion in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership.



Boosting competitiveness. Allowing firms’ wages to respond more flexibly to collective
agreements and adjusting wage floors at the industry level would also foster internal
devaluation. Lowering regulatory barriers to entry and exit of firms, simplifying tax systems, and
tackling vested interests in the product markets—including measures to increase competition in
the transportation, energy and other network industries—would support competitiveness and
raise purchasing power throughout the euro area. (For instance, electricity prices for industrial
users in Italy are some 50 percent higher than the European average.)



Supporting credit provision and investment. The securitization schemes proposed by the EC and
the EIB would provide some credit support to SMEs and therefore help reduce fragmentation. In
the proposed options, SME loans would be securitized, using funds from EU and EIB amounting
to €10.4 billion. The funds could be leveraged up to 10 times, depending on the degree of risk
pooling among member countries. These options would support bank capital, SME lending, and
capital market development over the medium term. However, the initial impact is likely to be
limited, unless the scheme is front-loaded, covers new and existing loans, and risk pooling is

the order of 5-15 percent according to the 2013 External Stability Report—are estimated to be
necessary for some peripheral countries to regain competitiveness. Staff estimates suggest that the
nominal exchange rate and the relative price adjustment have played a role in explaining recent
export performance, although the magnitude of these effects is somewhat uncertain.
32.
Further policy actions in both surplus and deficit economies are necessary to rebalance
the euro area. In surplus economies, increasing productivity in non-tradable sectors would improve
disposable incomes and consumption in these economies and lead to higher external demand,
which could support the rebalancing efforts of the deficit countries. In addition, reducing euro area
uncertainty would support a recovery in private investment, which would help narrow current
account surpluses (notably in Germany). In deficit economies, continuing structural adjustment would
deliver a shift of resources to tradable sectors where consumption booms led to excessive growth in
non-tradable sectors in the run-up to the crisis (see 2013 External Sector Report).

Box 4. Rebalancing the Euro Area: Where do We Stand and Where to Go?
Background: Before the crisis, large net foreign liabilities accumulated in the periphery (Greece, Ireland, Portugal,
and Spain) as a result of deteriorating competitiveness and domestic demand booms fueled by intra-euro area
capital flows. Meanwhile, export-oriented economies (Germany, Netherlands) experienced rising external
surpluses. Since the crisis, current account deficits in the periphery economies have narrowed markedly, but these
external adjustments could reflect depressed demand or more structural developments. Given downward
pressures on demand (associated with public and private deleveraging) and limited policy space, the challenge for
the euro area is to reduce internal imbalances while restoring growth and employment.
Main findings:



Substantial REER adjustments have taken place in deficit economies, largely driven by declining unit labor
costs through wage adjustments and labor shedding. CPI deflators have been sticky, while GDP deflators have
declined in the periphery relative to trading partners.



Nevertheless, there is limited evidence of reallocation of resources across sectors. And ongoing adjustment in
current account balances is partly driven by cyclical factors, especially in Greece.



While relative price adjustment plays some role, improvements in export performance are very dependent on
external demand, including from within the euro area (Italy and Portugal), and remain partly determined by
initial trade specialization.



Further adjustment in relative prices would be needed to restore competitiveness (in the order of 5-15 percent
in deficit economies based on current account or REER targets).



Beyond price adjustments, resources need to be reallocated to more productive sectors and countries need to
move up in the value chain, while labor and product markets need to become more flexible.



Going forward, converging to net foreign asset positions considered safe elsewhere will prove challenging for
some countries, while others are projected to continue accumulating large foreign surpluses.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

Policy implications: Further improvements in competitiveness are important for deficit economies, which need to
lower costs and shift resources to tradable sectors to spur growth and rebalance their external position. In addition
to continued efforts to reform labor and product markets, easing credit constraints affecting SMEs would help
support entry and investment in tradable sectors. In surplus economies, product market reforms would ease entry
in non-tradable sectors and boost domestic demand, which could help support rebalancing the euro area. Also, a
decrease in euro area uncertainty would support a pick-up in investment and domestic demand, notably in
Germany. This would contribute to a sustained reduction in current account surpluses over the medium term.

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
33.
There was broad agreement between staff and authorities that more credible progress
is needed on bank balance sheet repair and EMU architecture. With differences of views among
member states becoming increasingly prominent in these areas, the authorities—the ECB and the
European Commission (EC)—stressed the importance of decisive policy actions in boosting
confidence in the euro banking system and the long-term viability of the monetary union. They
concurred that while the situation is substantially better than in mid-2012, the challenge to restart
growth and reduce policy uncertainty remains. The authorities agreed that more progress was
needed to complete the EMU architecture, including by providing a fuller banking union and
achieving greater fiscal integration, to address the underlying weaknesses, fully restore confidence,
and lay the foundations for higher durable growth.
34.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of economic developments in the
euro area, and the downside risks to growth. The authorities noted the strong headwinds to
growth from ongoing fragmentation, private sector deleveraging, and still-weak confidence. They
elaborated that while significant progress in deleveraging had been achieved in some countries, and
stronger asset positions may lessen the overall need to deleverage (particularly in the household
sector), overall balance sheet weakness is restraining growth.
35.
A credible assessment of bank asset quality is essential to restore confidence in the
euro area banking system. The BSA and following stress tests are seen as critical elements that will

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

EURO AREA POLICIES

establish the credibility of the SSM, and that the quality and comprehensiveness of this exercise
should not be compromised, though this will be challenging. The authorities underlined the
importance of having the ESM backstop in place ahead of the BSA to motivate national authorities
and to address capital shortfalls where fiscal space is insufficient. But they also recognized that full
approval of the BRRD and the DGS directive is a pre-requisite for finalizing the ESM direct
recapitalization framework, and this could take some time. Nevertheless, they agreed that procyclical outcomes should be avoided by effectively communicating the exercise, involving third party
expertise, and having in place clear strategies for recapitalization and restructuring.
36.
The ECB and EC strongly prefer a centralized resolution mechanism to make a banking
union work. They stressed that a single resolution authority with strong powers was essential for
the credibility and effectiveness of the SSM.


The EC noted that such an authority could be established within current EU Treaties, under the
condition of giving the decision-making power to the EC since it is the only institution apart
from the ECB that can lawfully take decisions at the European level. But some member states
hold the strong view that a treaty change is necessary, and this could significantly delay
establishment of a single resolution authority.



There was common concern that a weaker proposal, based on a network of national resolution
authorities, could prevail, limiting the SRM’s ability to act in an efficient manner. In addition, the
authorities fully supported the introduction of bail-ins as best practice resolution tools, but
noted that this should only be deployed when a bank is deemed nonviable, and not as a
recapitalization tool.



The authorities welcomed the finalization of the CRR/CRDIV and Council agreement on the
BRRD. However, they stated that other elements of the single rule book (e.g., the DGS Directive)
should be agreed upon and transposed in national legislations as soon as possible. In late June,
the European Council reiterated its goal of reaching agreement on adopting the BRRD and DGS
directives by end-2013 for transposition into national law by end-2014. The authorities
supported depositor preference (with full protection of insured depositors and a clear pecking
order ranking uninsured depositors as the last to suffer losses among uninsured unsecured
claimants), and favored minimizing the degree of flexibility left to national authorities in the
application of resolution tools.

37.
There was broad agreement on the potential need for further monetary policy action,
particularly if conditions worsen substantially, although not all of staff’s proposals could be
implemented easily. The ECB introduced explicit forward guidance for interest rates in early July and
would consider further standard and non-standard measures (including negative deposit rates) if
domestic and external conditions worsen. At the same time, the authorities cautioned that the
impact of such measures are likely to be more muted, particularly in comparison with the OMTs,
given that fragmentation is not only due to capital market failures but also to higher overall
macroeconomic risks. The authorities noted therefore that while monetary policy plays a role in
demand management, structural policies play a more important role in managing overall
macroeconomic risks. In addition, they stressed the risk that further monetary policy actions to

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

relieve demand pressures could blunt incentives to take difficult measures at the national level. On
direct asset purchases, the authorities emphasized that the small market size of securitized assets
and regulatory hurdles could limit its effectiveness.
38.
The authorities broadly acknowledged the importance of setting EDP targets in
structural terms. They explained that while the targets are set in nominal terms, structural
adjustment has always been critical for assessments. In this context, the European Commission
noted that if the outlook worsens, they would be ready to extend the deadlines accordingly. The
authorities cautioned that linking EDP extensions to structural reforms should not be seen as a
tradeoff, as these extensions were justified on economic grounds. Nevertheless, they emphasized
that structural reforms are being pushed through the European Semester, where the extensions
have been granted.
39.
Substantial progress has been made in strengthening governance over the past year.
At the same time, the authorities concurred with staff on the need for ensuring strong
implementation of the new governance frameworks at both the national and European levels.


To strengthen the credibility of fiscal frameworks in the medium term, implementation of
country specific recommendations, and evenhandedness in applying the frameworks were of
particular importance. While acknowledging the complexity of the frameworks, the authorities
pointed out the need to address country specific issues and changing economic circumstances
within the current legal setup.



There was agreement that greater fiscal integration, combined with stronger governance
frameworks, including a stronger role for the center, could in principle provide the basis for
more risk sharing, making the euro area more resilient to future shocks.



The authorities argued that targeted and limited contractual arrangements, such as the
proposed Convergence and Competitiveness Instrument (CCI), could provide a useful
mechanism to incentivize reforms. The CCIs could be linked to the European Semester and the
Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP). It was noted that financial support would have to
rely on existing budgets and that moral hazard would have to be addressed. The authorities
called for a strong implementation and follow-up on recommendations issued in the MIP, in
particular for those countries where imbalances were deemed excessive (Spain and Slovenia).

40.
The authorities agreed that the ongoing rebalancing is incomplete. While wages are
adjusting and exports are improving in the periphery, there are limited signs of symmetric
adjustment in surplus countries. The authorities highlighted that higher total factor productivity is
essential to boost competitiveness. They noted that adjustment would be facilitated by the
implementation of the Services Directives, which will generate higher productivity and stronger
demand in the surplus countries, while facilitating the provision of credit to SMEs.
41.
On structural reforms, the authorities highlighted key priority areas. On labor markets,
they noted that pan-European training initiatives would signal solidarity and enhance firms’

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

EURO AREA POLICIES

incentive to hire young workers. Other priorities included implementing the Services Directive,
reforming the energy sector, improving lending to SMEs, and fostering cross-border labor mobility.
42.
There was general agreement with staff’s risk assessment. The authorities noted that
renewed financial market stress could result from policy complacency and still rising sovereign debt
ratios. These could be compounded if stress triggered additional fiscal consolidation. In the medium
term, they shared the view that the drag from private and public sector deleveraging could be
higher than expected, but noted that a slow labor market response could be expected given euro
area labor market institutions, and that hysteresis effects were unlikely. The authorities emphasized
that they considered the likelihood of a stagnation scenario to be relatively low, because they saw
adjustment well advanced in many countries. On external risks, they noted that a larger than
expected slowdown in demand from emerging economies, coupled with a fall in commodity prices,
could weaken external demand prospects for the euro area and exert downward pressure on prices.
A rise in long term interest rates, particularly in excess of what may be warranted by a pickup in
world or U.S. growth could have a very detrimental impact on sovereign financing costs for the euro
area, though they noted that the impact would not necessarily discriminate against yields of crisis
economies. While the authorities saw risks to inflation outlook as balanced, they expressed concern
that in a negative scenario of protracted low inflation, inflation expectations could become
unanchored.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Substantial collective actions have reinforced the commitment to the monetary union.
The ECB introduced the OMTs framework to address severe distortions in sovereign bond markets
and thereby increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. The completion of the ESM firewall, the
extension of official loan maturities to program countries, the improvement in the policy
coordination framework, and the agreement on Greece and Cyprus have been equally important
steps in combating the crisis. In addition, national governments continue to make progress in
restoring the health of public finances and advancing structural reforms. These actions helped tackle
dangerous tail risks related to the breakup of the euro area.
44.
But the macroeconomic environment continues to deteriorate. Demand is weak and
unemployment is increasing, stoking social and political tensions in parts of the euro area. Financial
market fragmentation persists, hampering monetary transmission and the flow of credit to where
growth is weakest. At the same time, consumers and businesses are restrained by large debt
overhang and ongoing balance sheet repair, while fiscal policies are pro-cyclical. Structural
weaknesses in labor and product markets are making it difficult to restore competitiveness. In turn,
the risks of stagnation and long-term damage to potential growth are increasing, and this would
cause broad negative spillovers to the rest of the world, particularly to other EU and southeastern
European countries.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

45.
Further policy efforts are needed to address the twin challenges of growth revival and
job creation. This requires policy actions on multiple fronts, many of which are mutually reinforcing
(and cannot be effective if implemented in isolation): repairing banks’ balance sheets and facilitating
the resolution of private debt, making further progress on banking union, providing sufficient
demand support, and advancing structural reforms.
46.
Although hard to achieve, undisputed resolve and steadfast support for deeper
integration will go a long way toward restoring confidence. Undivided support at the national
level for collective initiatives can bolster area-wide stability. On the other hand, significant delays
and perceived frictions among member states can create uncertainty for investors and consumers.
Therefore, demonstrating swift progress on the remaining elements of the banking union and
advancing toward greater fiscal integration would send a strong positive signal and underpin
confidence.
47.
Sound bank balance sheets are essential to reduce fragmentation and revive credit
growth. A comprehensive, forward-looking balance sheet assessment is needed to quantify any
potential capital needs before the SSM in place. But a clear plan on how capital shortfalls will be
addressed must be in place before the results are announced. Clear communication, and the
involvement of an independent third party, would ensure transparency and boost confidence. Losses
should be fully recognized, failed banks should be closed and restructured, and frail systemic banks
should receive public support where private capital is insufficient. For this, a credible national fiscal
backstop needs to be available ahead of time. But where both private capital and fiscal space is
limited, a common backstop, such as that provided by the ESM, should be used, making it necessary
to reach agreement as soon as possible on its availability for direct recapitalization. If needed, the
flexibility in the recently agreed framework should be used to the fullest to prevent a flare-up of
negative sovereign-bank loops in the context of the BSA and stress test exercises. At the national
level, efficient insolvency regimes and strong institutions are needed to facilitate the work out of
excessive private debt, which would complement the cleanup of bank balance sheets.
48.
A strong banking union is essential to reduce fragmentation. The SSM regulation should
be approved without delay. A centralized and more systematic approach to supervision would
prevent ring-fencing by national authorities, help reverse fragmentation, and reinforce incentives for
early intervention in frail banks. A strong SRM, based on a centralized authority with the
independent power to trigger resolution and make decisions on burden sharing, is critical to
minimize risks to the credibility of the SSM and to ensure timely and least cost resolution while
protecting financial stability. By contrast, compromise solutions that leave resolution at the national
level while supervision is centralized carry significant risks, including of perpetuating bank-sovereign
links and potential conflict between national authorities in cross-border resolution. The SRM should
become operational at around the time when the SSM becomes effective in 2014. This will enhance
the ECB’s effectiveness as a supervisor. The ESM can initially provide a fiscal backstop, and access to
its funds for direct recapitalization should not be unduly restrictive. Ultimately the SRM should also
be backed by ex ante and ex post levies on industry resources. In addition, swift adoption of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

EURO AREA POLICIES

BRRD and the DGS Directive—including clarification on bail-ins, depositor preference, and deposit
limits—is essential to advance the banking union.
49.
In the meantime, additional unconventional monetary support could help reverse
fragmentation. Taking its current approach forward, the ECB should ensure term funding needs for
weak but solvent banks through an additional LTRO of sufficient tenor. This would be most effective
if accompanied by lower collateral haircuts, particularly on SME loans. To tackle fragmentation and
repair monetary transmission more decisively, the ECB should consider further unconventional
policies, including through a targeted LTRO (linked to new SME lending), or direct purchase of select
private assets.
50.
Additional monetary easing will likely be necessary, given the very benign inflation
outlook. Further policy rate cuts, including negative deposit rates, would support demand across
the euro area and address deflationary pressures. The ECB’s forward guidance will help anchor
interest rate expectations, which is now even more necessary because of market uncertainty about
the exit from unconventional monetary policies in the United States.
51.
Pacing fiscal adjustment remains key. The extension of EDP deadlines is welcome, but
current targets could still prove too ambitious. Additional flexibility may need to be given to
countries, especially if that fiscal space is used to implement ambitious structural reforms (including
to entitlement and taxes) or to recapitalize viable banks. Moreover, if downside risks materialize, the
pace of fiscal adjustment should be slowed further.
52.
Recent reforms have strengthened fiscal governance, but there are several
outstanding issues that need to be tackled. The super-imposition of different layers of rules has
made the overall framework increasingly complex. Moreover, concerns remain about the
implementation, enforcement, and transparency of the various rules, including at the national level.
In this context, proving by practice the capability of the framework to deliver credible medium-term
fiscal anchors will be critical, not least to allow for sufficient short-term flexibility. In the longer run,
fiscal governance will need to evolve further to strengthen the role of the center and lay the
foundation for greater fiscal risk sharing.
53.
There is also a pressing need for further structural reforms. Efforts at both the area-wide
and national levels should be catalyzed, including through fostering greater integration. A targeted
implementation of the Services Directive should be undertaken to remove barriers to protected
professions, raise productivity, and promote cross-border provision of services and competition. A
new round of free trade agreements could provide a much-needed push to improve services
productivity. And within countries, labor market rigidities should be tackled to raise participation,
address labor market duality, and promote more flexible bargaining arrangements.
54.
While the euro is assessed to be broadly in line with fundamentals, there are still
substantial competitiveness gaps between countries. Meanwhile, further productivity gains in the
tradable sector and adjustment in relative prices should help rebalancing in the periphery. And

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

increasing productivity in non-tradable sectors would improve disposable incomes in surplus
economies, which could support the rebalancing efforts of the deficit countries.
55.
The staff proposes that the next consultation on euro area policies in the context of the
Article IV obligations of member countries follow the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix. Statistical Issues1
Statistical data for the euro area are produced by Eurostat and the ECB in collaboration with national
statistical institutes (NSIs), and the national central banks (NCBs) of countries participating in the
Economic and Monetary Union. The statistics are of sufficient quality, scope, and timeliness to allow
for effective macroeconomic surveillance. This appendix summarizes developments and desirable
improvements.
1.
Strengthened cooperation on European statistics. The European Statistical System (ESS)
and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) cooperate under separate legal frameworks
reflecting their governance structures. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has recently been
established between the ESS and the ESCB creating a new body—the European Statistical Forum,
which includes the heads of the NSIs and the statistics departments of the NCBs—to further
strengthen cooperation. The Forum will also ensure consistency of the statistical work programs of
the ESS and of the ESCB. The MoU preserves the role of the Committee on Monetary, Financial and
Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB) to implement cooperation on transversal or cross-cutting
issues between the two statistical systems.
2.
Developments in statistics to enhance fiscal and economic governance. The Enhanced
Economic Governance Package (so called “Six Pack”) 2 contains legal requirements that have
implications for the collection and dissemination of fiscal data and statistics.


Enhanced fiscal data reporting. Eurostat established a Task Force on the implications of the
Directive under the “Six Pack” on the collection and dissemination of fiscal data. The objective is
to provide timely, regular and publicly accessible monthly and quarterly fiscal data based on
public accounts for all sub-sectors of general government, data on contingent liabilities, and
other indicators with potential impact on the general government deficit and/or debt.
Conceptual frameworks to publish monthly and quarterly fiscal data and annual data on
government contingent liabilities have been adopted. A detailed reconciliation table describing
the link between nationally based fiscal data and the ESA95 based data will also be published.
Eurostat intends to collect and publish selected indicators (contingent liabilities, non-performing
loans). The publication of data will start in 2014.



Proposal for a regulation on the provision and quality of statistics for the Macroeconomic
Imbalances Procedure (MIP). The Commission recently submitted a draft proposal for a
regulation on the provision and quality of statistics for the MIP to the Council and the European
Parliament. The draft regulation introduces new tasks for the Commission (Eurostat) on
assessing and validating relevant data against various quality criteria. The proposal includes

European Parliament and Council in November 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

analyzing member states’ inventories of the sources and methods used to compile the MIP data,
and developing and implementing an improvement action plan.
3.
Improved compilation and reporting of national accounts. The revised European System
of Accounts (ESA 2010) is to be implemented by member states by September 2014. It is an
important contribution to reinforcing economic governance with efforts to update and improve the
current methodological framework. The main methodological changes and challenges in the
implementation of ESA 2010 are:


Recognition of the investment nature of expenditure on research and development.
Research and development expenditure is to be recorded as gross fixed capital formation and
no longer as current expenditure. The identification and treatment of research and development
expenditure as investment is consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy.



More detailed analysis and presentation of pension schemes. A compulsory supplementary
table on pension entitlements will be required to show the liabilities of all pension schemes,
including those of government, whether they are unfunded or funded. This will improve
comparability across countries and quantify the implicit government liabilities from future
pension obligations. These implicit government liabilities will not be reported in the core
financial accounts and will not impact the Maastricht debt.



Challenges ahead: The challenges ahead include improvements in the timeliness for the main
national accounts aggregates (from t+70 to t+60 days) and quarterly sector accounts (from t+90
to t+85 days), and the backward calculation of time series.

4.
Recent developments in European statistics to support monetary policy. Several recent
advances in European statistics help to improve the calibration of conventional and unconventional
monetary policy:


Financial sector surveillance supporting monetary policy decisions. Since 2013, individual
balance sheet information on some 246 large euro area banks is transmitted on a monthly basis
to the ECB. This supports the analysis of deposit and lending decisions of the non-financial
private sector, and provides insights into the sources of bank funding. Quarterly data on the
activities of non-bank financial institutions, including investment funds other than money market
funds and including hedge funds, financial vehicles engaged in securitization and insurance
companies and pension funds, are now collected by the ECB, complementing existing data
relating to money market funds. These data facilitate the study of the shadow banking system.



Further improvements in data reporting. The ECB and the IMF Statistics Department are
finalizing the migration of the balance sheet data for depository corporations to the IMF’s
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics. Work continues on mapping data for
Other Financial Corporations.



Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Complementing existing surveys of the nonfinancial corporate sector, the ECB published first results of the Household Finance and
Consumption Survey (HFCS) in April 2013, which provides detailed household-level data on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

EURO AREA POLICIES

various aspects of household balance sheets and related economic and demographic variables,
including income, voluntary pensions, employment and measures of consumption. Subsequent
data collection should aim to increase coverage to all euro area countries and comparability of
cross-country data.
Sector accounts.3 The euro area quarterly institutional sector accounts have further improved,
showing euro area non-financial assets by institutional sector, total euro area economy data on
produced non-financial assets are available by main asset type as well as household housing
wealth and from-whom-to-whom data for loans and deposits, which support the analysis of
interconnectedness. At the country level, gaps remain regarding the non-financial assets
position of sectors. The ECB is part of a research project led by the IMF Statistics Department on
global flow of funds and balance sheet approach matrices. Matrices for the euro area and for the
17 countries of the euro area have been agreed. These provide metadata on data availability of
international investment position data broken down geographically.



European statistics that support financial stability.



Risk dashboard for the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). To provide statistical support
to the ESRB, the ECB has developed a risk dashboard released in September 2012. The initial set
of 45 indicators will be regularly updated and revised.



ESCB Register of Financial Institutions and Affiliates (RIAD). Further to its function to set up
lists of individual financial institutions in the euro area, the RIAD has been recently upgraded to
include information on banking groups and conglomerates to support financial stability analysis
and the management of collateral in market operations.

6.
Prospects for the banking supervision. A new European Parliament and Council
Regulation is expected to confer to the ECB the sole responsibility for the prudential supervision of
all banks located in the euro area and in those EU member states that voluntarily would adhere to
the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) New statistical reporting will be required to enable the ECB
to perform its expected duties within the SSM. The ECB will collect supervisory data for the banking
groups under ECB’s direct supervision, based on the harmonized Implementing Technical Standards
(ITS) of the EBA, which has six parts: financial reporting, consolidated reporting, asset encumbrance,
large exposures, liquidity ratios, and leverage ratios. Additional ad hoc datasets, including but not
limited to those required for stress-testing purposes, may also be requested.
7.

Transition to BPM6. Both Eurostat and the ECB are engaged with member states to implement
the new methodology. The new ECB data requirements related to the BPM6 implementation are
due by mid-2014. It is envisaged that members will gradually move their national compilation
systems to the new methodology between 2013 and mid-2014.



Steps to improve Balance of Payments statistics:

The sector accounts integrate the flow-of-funds and the non-financial assets, transactions and other flows.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES



Aggregation of EU/EA current account and adjustment of intra-EU/EA trade. Asymmetries
in intra-EU/EA exports and imports persist, but they are relatively stable over time.
Methodological differences arise for two main reasons: the partner country allocation and the
treatment of goods in transit. Eurostat and the ECB engage with countries in regular
“reconciliation rounds” that facilitate the exchange of bilateral data.

8.
Data Gaps Initiative (DGI). The ESS and the ESCB are working closely to implement the
amended legal acts on European statistics that are aligned to the ESA 2010 and BPM6. The new
European statistics also supports the SDDS Plus and G-20 DGI Recommendations. Going forward,
European economic and financial statistics will be fit to support the G-20 Mutual Assessment
Process and similar global surveillance exercises.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation on Euro
Area Policies
On July 23, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Euro Area.1
Background
Substantial collective actions have addressed important tail risks, and extreme market stresses
have subsided. The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) framework has helped
address severe market distortions and improved the effectiveness of monetary policy. Initial
progress on banking union—the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) agreement, the
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) framework for direct bank recapitalization, and the Bank
Recovery and Resolution directive (BRRD)—has demonstrated the commitment to improving
EMU architecture. Other critical steps to address the crisis have included: the completion of the
ESM firewall; the extension of official loan maturities to program countries, and the agreements
on Greece and Cyprus. These actions—along with reductions in external imbalances and
progress by national governments in restoring the health of public finances—have boosted
confidence in the long-term viability of the monetary union.
But the recovery remains elusive. Financial markets are still fragmented along national borders,
and the cost of borrowing for the private sector is high in the periphery, particularly for smaller
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
enterprises. Ailing banks continue to hold back the flow of credit. In the face of high private debt
and continued uncertainty, households and firms are postponing spending. Needed fiscal
consolidation is also weighing on growth. As a consequence, Euro area GDP is expected to
contract by 0.6 percent for a second consecutive year in 2013, before expanding modestly by
0.9 percent in 2014. Headline inflation is expected to remain subdued, highlighting risks of
underlying deflationary pressures. And with unemployment, especially among the youth—at
record levels, there is a risk of long-term damage to potential growth and to political support for
reforms, including for further progress on EMU architecture. In turn, lack of reforms would
undermine growth and job prospects
Risks to growth remain tilted to the downside. Because policy space is limited, public debt ratios
are very high (and still rising), and economic slack is already substantial, further negative
shocks—domestic or external shocks—could severely impact growth. The recent turbulence in
global markets has tightened financial conditions in the euro area, although the recent
introduction of forward guidance by the ECB has had a mitigating effect. Continued
turbulence—related, for example, to expectations of earlier-than-anticipated exit from
unconventional monetary policy in the U.S.—could aggravate fragmentation and complicate the
conduct of monetary policy. Incomplete or stalled policy commitments at the national or euro
area level could also reignite financial market stresses. Over the medium-term, there is a high
risk of stagnation, especially in the periphery.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended euro area authorities for the actions taken at both the regional
and national levels, which have stabilized financial markets and reduced tail risks related to a
euro break up. They acknowledged, in particular, progress toward building a banking union,
enhancing the firewall, and strengthening fiscal governance. Directors noted that these efforts
have reinforced the authorities’ commitment to preserve the integrity of the monetary union.
Directors observed, however, that despite the policy actions on many fronts, growth remains
elusive and high unemployment persists, especially among the youth. At the same time,
household and corporate indebtedness remains elevated in a number of countries, holding back
domestic demand. Given narrowing policy space and still fragile and fragmented banking
sectors, these developments have increased the risks of stagnation, social and political
tensions, and spillovers to the global economy.
Against this backdrop, Directors considered it imperative to revive growth and create jobs
through a comprehensive strategy aimed at repairing bank balance sheets, making further
progress on banking union, and supporting demand, while advancing structural reforms. They
stressed that unwavering political backing for institutional reforms remains critical and in the
interests of all EMU members.
Directors recognized that the first priority is to restore sound bank balance sheets to revive
credit. Immediate steps include full recognition of losses, recapitalization of weak but viable
banks, and closure or restructuring of non-viable banks. In this context, Directors supported

3
plans to conduct a comprehensive balance sheet assessment followed by stress tests to assess
the potential capital needs of the banking sector, complemented with a clear strategy for
addressing capital shortfalls. They pointed to the benefits of involving an independent third party
in ensuring the transparency and credibility of the exercise. Directors also emphasized the
importance of a credible backstop, including through direct recapitalization by the European
Stability Mechanism, and looked forward to early agreement on this matter.
Directors urged further progress toward a fuller banking union to help reduce fragmentation.
Stepped-up efforts are needed to adopt the enabling legislation for the Single Supervisory
Mechanism, agree on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, and make progress on the
Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. Directors stressed the importance of establishing a
strong, centralized Single Resolution Mechanism, with the independent power to trigger
resolution and make decisions on burden sharing.
Directors generally considered that, given weak growth and subdued inflation, further monetary
support, including through policy rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB), would likely be
necessary, especially if conditions worsen substantially. Directors also saw a role for explicit
forward guidance in anchoring expectations, while additional unconventional support from the
ECB, including that targeted at lending to small- and medium-size enterprises, could help repair
monetary transmission, preventing a further credit contraction as measures to restore banking
system health are being implemented.
Directors agreed on the need for a flexible, differentiated pace of fiscal adjustment within a
credible medium-term framework. In this regard, they welcomed the recent extension for some
countries to meet fiscal deficit targets. Directors noted nevertheless that additional flexibility may
still be needed in some cases, especially if that available fiscal space is used to implement
deeper structural reforms or recapitalize viable banks. In the longer run, it would be desirable to
facilitate greater fiscal risk sharing.
Directors urged further structural reforms at all levels, with a view to enhancing the growth
potential and further rebalancing demand within the euro area. In particular, a targeted
implementation of the Services Directive would remove barriers to protected professions,
promote cross-border competition, and raise productivity. Within countries, labor market reforms
should continue to remove rigidities, raise participation, and, where necessary, promote more
flexible bargaining arrangements.

Statement by Mr. Snel on Euro Area
Executive Board Meeting
July 23, 2013

In my capacity as President of EURIMF, I submit this Buff statement on the Article IV
consultation with the euro area. It reflects the common view of the Member States of the euro
area and the European Union in their respective fields of competence.
The authorities of the euro-area Member States are grateful for open and fruitful consultations
with staff and for their constructive policy advice.
The authorities are in broad agreement with staff findings and recommendations. Policy actions
over the past year have addressed important tail risks and stabilised financial markets. Concerted
policy actions to restore financial sector health and complete the banking union are now essential
to tackle the financial fragmentation along national borders and support the recovery.
The authorities are making continued efforts to ensure deeper structural reforms throughout the
euro area in order to raise growth potential and create jobs. Policy arrangements under the
European Semester guide the countries' structural reforms agenda and put forward appropriate
policy plans for correcting external imbalances. The analysis undertaken in the context of the
European Semester, the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure and the countries´ in-depth
reviews, has improved considerably the understanding of the challenges that need to be
addressed and has translated into specific policy advice provided to the countries on structural
and fiscal policies. The authorities reiterate their commitment to take all necessary actions to
preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area and enhance medium-term growth prospects.
Short-term economic outlook
The authorities broadly share staff's view on economic prospects, particularly the assessment of
the weakness in economic activity in 2013, with an only gradual return to growth in the course of
the year and a more optimistic outlook for 2014. A successful handling of the sovereign-debt
crisis and other crisis-related policy challenges remains essential for raising investor and
consumer confidence and the return to a recovery path. The Commission services' spring forecast
suggests that, for the year 2013 as a whole, GDP is expected to shrink by about 0.4 percent. In
2014, a recovery of economic growth to a rate of around 1¼ percent is forecast, reflecting
stronger global growth and moderate growth of private consumption and gross fixed capital
formation. However, given subdued output growth, unemployment rates are expected to fall only
in 2014 and then only marginally below current levels. The on-going deleveraging and
adjustment processes as well as the fragmentation of financial markets are setting the stage for
only a modest recovery. Risks to the outlook for European growth are elevated and remain tilted
to the downside, which is compatible with staff's views. The predominant risk remains a renewed
intensification of the sovereign-debt crisis and the persistence of the monetary policy
transmission mechanism impairment. Other downside risks are linked to the external
environment, combined with short-term risks related to political and social tensions.

The real economy continues to suffer from the impact of the European sovereign-debt crisis.
Since mid-2012, tensions in financial markets have eased in the wake of major policy decisions,
in particular the ECB's announcement of the modalities for Outright Monetary Transactions, the
finalization of the European Stability Mechanism, and the agreement on the second program for
Greece, but developments in the first half of 2013 show that the situation in financial markets
remains fragile and that there is no time for complacency. In the first quarter, output fell by 0.3
percent after having already declined by 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012. Nevertheless,
the external and internal adjustments continue to progress and in mid-2013 some early signs of
an easing of the downturn were visible, notably in the latest readings of survey indicators (e.g.
Economic Sentiment Indicator, euro area PMIs). The assumed further progress on the path of
structural reforms and policies to strengthen the framework of EMU is expected to slowly
dissipate lingering policy and economic uncertainty and pave the way for a pick-up in activity.
Financial markets and fragmentation
The Staff Report rightly points to continued weak macro-economic growth. This in turn risks
reinforcing adverse feedback loops between weak bank balance sheets, tightening lending
standards and debt sustainability concerns. Despite some recent signs of improvement, some
segments of the euro area financial markets remain fragmented with funding costs still different
depending on the geographical location of a bank or its size. More clarity on the quality of bank
assets across the euro area's banking sector is necessary since many European banks may be
perceived to experience high ratios of non-performing loans and low profitability. Although
larger banks in stressed euro area countries have managed to regain access to wholesale funding
markets, funding costs remain significantly high for several smaller banks in those countries. In
this regard, the asset quality review (AQR) to be carried out before the operationalization of the
Single Supervisory Mechanism will be useful to reassure investors.
The on-going deleveraging process of European banks magnifies the challenges faced. As a
consequence, the amount of lending to businesses continues to display significant heterogeneity
across the euro area. In addition, the cost of borrowing of non-financial corporations (NFCs)
located in countries such as Germany and France remains significantly lower than those faced by
NFCs operating in Greece, Italy, Portugal or Spain. The overall weak credit growth in the euro
area results both from demand and supply constraints. On the demand side, low appetite for
investment and high leverage in some Member States has depressed borrowing. The main
challenge on the supply side consists in further repairing the monetary transmission channel and
bank balance sheets of vulnerable banks. Improving market confidence in the quality of banks’
balance sheets should help weaker banks regain market access and would also improve investor
confidence and banks’ willingness to lend to corporates, SMEs and households.
Further progress to repair lending in the euro area was made at the European Council of June. To
boost investment and improve access to credit, the European Council called for the mobilisation
of European resources including that of the EIB, and launched a new "Investment Plan" to
support SMEs and boost the financing of the economy. The Staff Report rightly points out that
restoring banking sector health is essential to address fragmentation and lower costs. While the
issues raised by deleveraging by banks is problematic in some cases, it cannot be ignored that
part of this painful process is also unavoidable and that along with other measures it is a

necessary ingredient in the restoration of bank balance sheets. The authorities acknowledge that
the high bank lending rates prevailing in some Member States may partly reflect banks' efforts to
boost margins and offset high provisions. However, there could be other important factors
behind high rates that need to be emphasised. First, banks’ cost of private (unsecured) funding in
some Member States remains high. Second, the bank funding structure needs to change. In the
pre-crisis period, bank funding relied very much on cheap short term funding for financing long
positions. Changes in the banks’ funding model may require further adjustments in bank balance
sheets and lead to more conservative lending policies. Moreover, a re-pricing of risk after a burst
in a credit bubble during the downturn might be seen as a rational behaviour.
In order to lift confidence in the euro area banking system, the authorities would like to also
highlight that following the forthcoming assessment of banks' asset quality, which will identify
banks' vulnerabilities in a comprehensive manner, the new EU-wide stress tests planned by EBA
in 2014, in coordination with the ECB for banks covered by the SSM, will provide an
opportunity to strengthen banks' balance sheets, reducing uncertainty surrounding banks'
capacity to withstand a further deterioration of the economy.
The Report rightly emphasises that the recent agreement at the EU level on the main features of
an operational framework for the ESM's direct bank recapitalisation instrument is an important
element addressing the adverse sovereign–banking link and - together with the general approach
in the Council on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) - represents an important
step forward in improving financial market conditions. In this context, the authorities agree with
the staff's view that clear rules on the role of bail-ins are needed to reduce uncertainty for private
investors. As agreed by the Eurogroup, when applying ESM direct bank recapitalisation an
appropriate level of write-down or conversion of debt will have to take place in line with EU
State aid rules, and applying the principles of the forthcoming BRRD as of the start of the
supervision of the ECB/SSM.
Overall, the most important pillar of EMU's new architecture and the key policy priority is to
complete the Banking Union in line with the European Council conclusions of December 2012
and March 2013. This is essential to ensure financial stability, break the vicious circle between
banks and sovereigns, reduce financial fragmentation and restore normal lending to the economy.
The legislative package on the new Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is expected to be
adopted and enter into force by September 2013 allowing for the SSM to become fully
operational by September 2014. A fully effective SSM requires a Single Resolution Mechanism
(SRM) for the banks covered by the SSM. The Commission therefore presented a proposal for
establishing an SRM with a view to reaching agreement in the Council by the end of the year so
that it can be adopted before the end of the current parliamentary term.
Monetary policy and the outlook for price stability
Early May, the ECB decided to lower two of its key interest rates. As a result, its main policy
rate (MRO rate) now stands at 0.50 percent, the marginal lending facility rate stands at 1.00
percent, while the deposit rate remains unchanged at 0.0 percent. These policy decisions took
account of subdued underlying inflationary pressures over the medium term. Moreover, the ECB
announced in July that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels

for an extended period of time. This expectation was based on the overall subdued outlook for
inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy
and subdued monetary dynamics.
Euro area annual inflation was 1.6 percent in June 2013 (Eurostat flash estimate), up from 1.4
percent in May. Annual inflation rates are expected to be subject to some volatility throughout
the year owing particularly to base effects. However, underlying price pressures are expected to
remain subdued over the medium term, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate
demand and a modest pace of recovery. Medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly
anchored in line with price stability. Risks to the outlook for inflation are still broadly balanced
over the medium term: on the downside they relate to weaker than expected euro area growth; on
the upside risks could stem from further increases in administrative prices, indirect taxes and
higher commodity prices. Information from the monetary analysis confirms the picture of price
developments remaining in line with price stability over the medium term. On-going weak loan
growth largely reflects the current cyclical situation, heightened credit risk, and balance sheet
adjustments in the financial and the non-financial sectors.
As regards non-standard monetary policy measures, the ECB decided in May that all ECB
refinancing operations will continue to be conducted as fixed-rate tender procedures with full
allotment, at least until mid-July 2014, ensuring that funding constraints will not be an
impediment to banks’ lending decisions. Moreover, the OMT-announcement has proven to be an
efficient backstop against unfounded fears of a euro break-up.
Fiscal policy
The authorities share the general view reflected in the staff's assessment of the fiscal situation of
the euro area, especially as far as the need for a differentiated pace of the fiscal adjustment is
concerned. The recently submitted Stability and Convergence Programmes reveal that fiscal
efforts are larger for countries with a lower fiscal space. While it is true that across EMU the
pattern of adjustment remains pro-cyclical, the pro-cyclicality of the fiscal stance is expected to
be reduced in 2014, when the output gap begins to close and the structural adjustment decelerates
thanks also to progress already made. The authorities would also like to stress that adhering to
sound medium term deficit reduction plans is key to preserve hardwon fiscal credibility and low
interest rates. The growth impact of consolidation presented in the staff document of more than 1
percentage point in the aggregate euro area seems on the high side in the authorities' view,
especially taking into account that the largest euro area economy will have a neutral stance in
2013.
While in staff's view some of the current EDP targets could prove too ambitious, the authorities
would like to stress that the assessment of effective action in the context of the EDP is made on
the basis of the effort implied by the adjusted changes in the structural balances. Such adjustment
accounts for revenue windfalls/shortfalls, forecast errors in output gaps. Ultimately, if a country
has taken effective action and unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable
consequences for public finances occur the Stability and Growth Pact provides for the possibility
to extend deadlines. In the authorities' view, the EU framework is flexible enough and responds
to the characteristics proposed in the Staff Report. It focuses on both structural and (headline)

nominal balances. Moreover, Member States for which the EDP is abrogated need to pursue
fiscal consolidation towards the 'benchmark' 0.5 percent annual structural improvement
envisaged by the 'preventive' arm of the SGP with no further consolidation being required of
countries having reached the Medium Term Objective.
The authorities agree on the need of ensuring strong implementation of the new governance
framework and of delivering credible medium-term fiscal anchors. Fiscal frameworks, both at
EU level and domestic, have a clear role to play. The surveillance framework of the EU is
characterized by the existence of Medium Term Budgetary Frameworks (MTBFs) as also
evidenced by the medium-term budgetary strategies outlined in Stability and Convergence
Programmes. The 2011 “Six Pack” legislation also contains a Directive on budgetary
frameworks introducing minimum requirements of the MTBFs and their relation with annual
budgets. The implementation of this Directive has been followed up by a peer review, discussing
the design of such frameworks, which has asked in many cases for the introduction of binding
changes. Moreover, the "Two Pack", which entered into force in May 2013, integrates the annual
national budgetary process within the EU framework, by requiring that euro area Member States
submit their draft budgetary plans to the Commission for an opinion before the Member State
budgets are adopted or fixed upon. This allows a better appraisal and a deeper discussion of the
implications of the EU framework for fiscal policy at the national level.
Structural Reforms and External Imbalances
The authorities would like to emphasise that after having a roughly balanced current account
position since the launch of the euro, the current account balance of the euro area shifted into a
mild surplus of around 1.2 percent of GDP in 2012. According to the Commission Spring
Forecast, the surplus may still increase by around 0.8 percent of GDP over the forecast horizon
(2012-14). While this is not a negligible amount, it is still in line with the structural
characteristics of the euro area, which suggest that it should have a moderate surplus. Most of the
strengthening in the current account is the result of significant adjustment in the vulnerable
countries, which previously recorded high deficits. These countries are actually expected to reach
a collective surplus of around 0.5 percent in 2013. The IMF staff analysis ascribes a large part of
this adjustment to cyclical developments. While the authorities agree that much of the adjustment
is driven by suppressed internal demand, they also find that the strong export performance of
many crisis-stricken countries contributes considerably to the adjustment. Therefore, the
authorities consider that the adjustment is largely non-cyclical in nature in most of the vulnerable
countries. The reasons are permanent contractions in domestic demand and imports induced by
reductions in overblown housing-construction investments, corrections in future income
expectations and increases in structural unemployment. Moreover, the dynamism of a number of
countries' exports is encouraging and adds to the permanent nature of the adjustment. In the case
of Greece, the authorities concur that the adjustment in the current account appears to be more
cyclical. These results are sensitive to the correct estimation of output gaps and therefore some
uncertainty remains regarding their exact values.
The external adjustment has mainly been due to developments in deficit countries. In deficit
countries, structural improvements in exports are required to resume potential growth and reduce
the social cost of rebalancing. To achieve this, reallocation of resources towards the tradable

sectors, supported by appropriate changes in relative costs and prices as well as better integration
into euro area value chains, is warranted. Surplus countries can contribute to the rebalancing of
external position of deficit countries by increased domestic demand through addressing market
failures and structural reforms, and wages growing in line with productivity growth.
The euro is broadly at its equilibrium value. Estimates based on different methodologies point to
a slight but insignificant overvaluation of the euro. While the euro exchange rate is not therefore
expected to contribute to rebalancing, further adjustments in relative prices within the euro area
are still needed. Recent improvements in unit labour costs and nonprice/cost competitiveness as
well suppressed domestic demand, have given incentives to firms in the vulnerable economies to
turn to export markets. They have managed, as a result, to regain a large part of the
competitiveness lost prior to the crisis. Labour costs adjustments are expected to continue in
order to close the large unemployment gaps. At the same time firms' operating margins have
increased as wage declines have not fed fully into prices. This is expected to attract more firms
into the sectors in the future and hence help increase the share of tradables. Developments in this
direction will be an important issue to monitor. Full implementation of flexibility enhancing
structural reforms will be key in facilitating the resource reallocation towards tradable sectors.
Policy arrangements under the European Semester have included country-specific policy
recommendations in the structural domain for each Member State plus the euro area as a whole.
The authorities are committed to follow the country-specific policy recommendations as
endorsed in June under the European Semester. In the area of product market and labour market
reform, many country-specific recommendations refer to the implementation phase of the
reforms, as several of the structural reform plans put forward in the Staff Report have already
been adopted. Furthermore, financing from EU Budget through the EU structural funds is
providing additional support for the implementation of a much broader structural agenda than
presented in the Staff Report. The reform agenda includes product and labour market reforms,
but also measures to improve framework conditions such as the functioning of the judicial
systems, and strengthening of independent sectora l regulators.
