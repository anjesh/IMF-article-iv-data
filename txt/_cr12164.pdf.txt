STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 31, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Near-term growth outlook. Led by high commodity prices, economic performance
continues to be strong, and growth has become more broad-based. Staff projects
robust growth in 2012–13, with a continued rebound in non-oil activity.
External stability. The external position has strengthened further, with the current
account surplus reaching record high levels. Combined oil fund resources and central
bank international reserves provide an ample external buffer.
Financial stability. Restoring the health of the banking system remains a key
short-term policy priority. The new mechanism adopted by the authorities is
insufficient to resolve problem loans. Success depends on the willingness of banks to
accept realistic asset valuation and recognize losses, and on the readiness of the
regulatory authorities to enforce proper provisioning and adequate bank capitalization.
Interconnectedness and risks. A protracted global slowdown, in particular if it affects
China and Russia and is combined with a decline in commodity prices, could hurt
Kazakhstan through trade, finance, and investment channels. The weak domestic
banking system and the changing socio-political environment are other sources of
vulnerability.
Recent macroeconomic policies. Consistent with the recommendations of the
2011 Article IV Consultation, the authorities have achieved a reduction in the non-oil
fiscal deficit, and allowed some more flexibility of the tenge. However, action to
forcefully resolve banks’ problem assets has not been taken.
Recommended policies. A return to potential growth calls for continued fiscal
adjustment and control of inflation. Premature or excessive reaction to shocks could
unnecessarily invigorate demand and result in overheating. Greater exchange rate
flexibility and healthier banks would be key complements to the existing buffers.
Medium-term prospects. The authorities’ plans rightly focus on diversification.
Success would require further enhancements in competitiveness, governance, and the
quality of institutions. The key challenge is to ensure that the oil wealth benefits the
whole economy, and to promote job-creating and inclusive growth.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

CONTEXT
1.
Ample savings from the oil boom helped limit the impact of the 2007–09 crisis on the
real and financial sectors, but banking sector weaknesses and vulnerabilities persist. A sudden
stop of foreign exchange inflows in 2007 resulted in an abrupt halt of the unsustainable credit boom
and a bursting of the property bubble, exacerbated by a large devaluation of the tenge. Four
overleveraged financial institutions, including the largest bank at the time, BTA, defaulted on their
external obligations, were forced to restructure their debt, and were de facto nationalized. The
authorities responded with substantial support to the banking sector and the real economy that
helped lessen the impact of the crisis on incomes and employment. More recently, with high
commodity prices, the external buffer has been rebuilt and the economy has recovered rapidly, but
the rebound has not helped to restore the quality of the banks’ portfolio. Furthermore, the
credit-to-GDP ratio continues to fall.
2.
The socio-political situation presents challenges. Two early electoral processes—a
presidential election in April 2011 and a parliamentary one in January 2012—resulted in
overwhelming victories for the president and the ruling party. Social stability was affected, however,
by unprecedented and violent labor disputes in the oil industry in late 2011 that spread to other
areas, signaling underlying discontent. Against this backdrop, the government has announced
increased social spending, large investment projects in non-oil sectors, and creation of employment
programs.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. High Oil Prices Have Driven Favorable Macroeconomic Developments
3.
The economic rebound has been
impressive. Real GDP expanded above
estimated potential during the last two years,
reaching 7½ percent. While growth of oil
production slowed, high commodity prices
helped spur domestic demand and activity in
transport and communications. Agriculture
recovered from a severe drought, but activity in
construction and real estate, the sectors to
which the banks are highly exposed, remained
flat. Official statistics show that the
unemployment rate, at 5¼ percent, continued to
be unaffected by real growth, as was the case at
the time of the slowdown.

4.
A combination of external factors and administrative measures helped to ease
inflation pressures in recent months. Driven by rising global food prices and large increases in
public sector wages, inflation peaked at 9 percent in mid-2011, exceeding the official objective

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

range of 6–8 percent. More recently, however, slowing international food prices, an exceptionally
high harvest, and the use of administrative measures to limit food and fuel price increases helped to
bring inflation below 5 percent.1 Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, remains subdued.
5.
With high export prices, the external position strengthened further. The current account
surplus rose to 7½ percent of GDP, the highest level in recent years, as robust exports outpaced the
demand-driven rebound in imports. Commodities-related FDI picked up, while portfolio flows
fluctuated with market sentiment and showed a net outflow during the year. CDS spreads remained
at 150–200 bps, with some volatility in reaction to uncertainty in the Russian and global markets.
Assets in the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) rose rapidly, and together with
National Bank of Kazakhstan’s (NBK) international reserves, reached a comfortable level equivalent
to 17 months of imports and 110 percent of broad money.

B. The Policy Stance Adapted to the Economic Recovery
6.
While assessing the underlying fiscal stance is not straightforward as some spending is
conducted off budget, the fiscal tightening trend continued in 2011. An expansion of non-oil
revenues from improved tax collection combined with expenditure restraint resulted in a fall in the
non-oil deficit from 10¼ to 9¼ percent of GDP (a decline of 0.9 percent of GDP if cyclically
adjusted). The non-oil deficit, however, was still higher than the staff-estimated long-term
sustainable level of 6–6½ percent of GDP.2

In addition to limits on price increases for staple food items, the periodic adjustment of utility tariffs was postponed
until July 2012, after the parliamentary election.

The authorities’ estimated level of sustainable non-oil deficit of 3 percent of GDP is consistent with staff’s estimate,
which excludes all oil-related revenues (including export duties) from the non-oil balance.

Reflecting weak money demand, monetary and credit indicators continued to grow at
a slower rate than the economy. Bank credit—still partially supported by public sector funding and
subsidies—grew by 15 percent year-on-year at end–

accommodative monetary policy stance earlier this
year by cutting its policy rate twice in three months by a total of 100 bps to a level of 6½ percent,
reversing the increase in the rate implemented a year before, when inflation was rising.
8.
The tenge has started to show some more flexibility. During the year, market sentiment
toward the currency shifted repeatedly—in line with exchange rate movements in neighboring
Russia. The NBK continued to intervene to avoid large exchange rate movements in either direction.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 3½ percent year-on-year, and staff’s preliminary
assessment finds, on balance, no evidence of significant deviation from the long-run equilibrium
(Appendix 1).

C. The Return to Strong Growth Did Not Restore Banks' Credit Quality
9.
Notwithstanding the rebound in economic growth, the banking sector continues to be
fragile. Banks have generally not benefited from the upturn given that the most dynamic sectors
rely little on bank funding. The legacy of past poor lending, particularly to real estate and
construction, has burdened banks, especially some of the large ones, with high and increasing
nonperforming loans (NPLs). The system’s total NPLs amount to 11 percent of GDP, the NPL ratio
reached nearly 32 percent of total loans in March (21 percent excluding the especially hard-hit BTA),
and banks are reluctant to write bad debts off to avoid recording losses (Box 1). Reported capital
adequacy ratios remain strong, aggregate liquidity is ample, and provisioning of overdue loans is
still relatively high (although decreasing). However, capital adequacy and provisioning ratios may be
overstated by doubtful recoveries of already restructured loans and possible under-recognition of
NPLs. Several banks, in particular those that underwent restructuring in 2009, may require additional
capital. Profitability is undermined by the negative carry from excess liquidity and low levels of
lending, limiting the ability to replenish capital and support new lending activity.

Box 1. Banking Sector Indicators Before and After the Crisis
The crisis has forced banks to implement significant changes in the structure of their balance sheets.
A fundamental fall in external liabilities now limits banks’ exposure to shocks. As funding from foreign banks
became unavailable or prohibitively expensive, reliance on it decreased significantly, while the share of retail
deposits and issued securities went up. This helped banks to reduce the vulnerabilities that were exposed by
the crisis. At the same time, however, the quality of assets deteriorated sharply.

These changes were reflected in the structure of the balance sheet:


An increase in provisioning and reduced willingness to take risks led to a fall in the share of net
loans.



Excess liquidity was reflected in an increase in claims on the NBK and correspondent accounts.



Interest income and profitability declined following limited lending activity, although interest
margins remained relatively stable.



Notably, accrued but not received interest increased from 2 to 7 percent of total assets even for
non-restructured banks (for restructured banks, this share increased from 3 to 17 percent),
suggesting that the underlying NPL ratio may be higher than the one reported.

10.
BTA’s post-restructuring business plan has proved unsuccessful. The bank is now the
third largest in the system, accounting for about 11 percent of total gross assets and 8 percent of
deposits, and is majority owned by Samruk Kazyna (SK), the state investment holding company, as a
result of the intervention during the crisis. Continuing problems in dealing with bad assets—both
domestic and external—have driven NPLs to 80 percent. Persistent losses have further eroded the
bank’s capital position, and the shortfall is estimated at around $5 billion (2½ percent of GDP). BTA
defaulted again on its external obligations in January 2012 and has started difficult negotiations on
a second debt restructuring requesting external creditors to accept another significant haircut. A
number of aggravating factors derived from BTA’s first debt restructuring, such as complex legal
issues related to creditor rights, limit the ability to undertake more comprehensive action, including
closure. The bank still operates with a full license, but remains dependent on public sector funding
and on regulatory forbearance.
11.
Action taken to reduce bad debts has been insufficient. Hopes that economic recovery
and government-funded support would generate loan recovery, and on the other hand concerns
about loan valuation and management of collateral, have hampered swift resolution of the NPL
problem. Repeated attempts to solve it including by creating a distressed asset fund in 2009 (that
was later diverted to other uses) and removing tax disincentives to write off bad debt have been
unsuccessful. In the end, restoring the banking systems’ health requires recapitalizing viable banks
and restructuring or closing unviable ones. Capital shortfalls represent public contingent liabilities,
given the need to protect depositors and the fact that SK is the biggest shareholder in several large
banks.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Favorable commodity prices underpin a positive economic outlook for 2012 and
beyond. Staff projects real GDP growth of 6 percent in 2012, with a continued rebound in non-oil
activity. Oil output is expected to grow only slightly as existing fields are close to full capacity, and
the first phase of Kashagan, a large hydrocarbon extraction project, has been postponed to 2013.
The external current account would continue to benefit from favorable commodity prices, but
non-oil export prices are set to decline. Possible upward revisions in administered prices and
demand pressures could reignite inflation later in the year, but it is expected to remain within the
authorities’ objective range. Over the medium term, growth is expected to converge to the
estimated potential of 6 to 6½ percent. The authorities shared staff views of near-term prospects,
but expected growth to stabilize at over 7 percent in the medium term.

13.
Risks to the economic outlook are mainly on the downside and come from external
shocks and domestic vulnerabilities (Appendix 2). A prolonged global slowdown, particularly if it
affects market conditions in Russia and China, is the main risk to the outlook. Spillovers through
trade, finance, and investment channels would hit the external position and growth prospects. If
deteriorated global conditions result in a decline in oil prices, further downward risks to the outlook
would be expected (Box 2). The fragile situation of the banking system, and, in particular, the
delicate BTA negotiations in uncertain times, brings additional confidence-related risks that may
limit capital inflows and trade financing. In the context of continued deleveraging, directed and
subsidized lending may further weaken banks’ balance sheets. Moreover, any misalignment between
political incentives and economic priorities may hinder effective policymaking and affect
macroeconomic and social stability. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment of
risks. They expected external conditions to deteriorate in late 2012, and were prepared to use part of
the accumulated buffers to withstand the shock without a sharp deceleration of growth.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

Box 2. Possible Spillovers from a Prolonged Global Slowdown
Inward Spillovers
Given the economy’s international integration, Kazakhstan is subject to spillovers from deteriorating global
conditions. The extent of these spillovers depends on the nature and magnitude of the shocks. Four
illustrative scenarios can be considered (based on the April 2012 IMF World Economic Outlook).
1.
Re-escalation of the euro area crisis leading to a moderate decline in oil prices:
Growth in Europe would slow by 2½ percent and result in a decline of 17 percent in the real price of oil
(deflated by the U.S. CPI), compared to an 8 percent increase in the baseline scenario.


Growth in Kazakhstan would fall by 1¾ percent. One percent would be explained by structural
co-movements between real GDP and the real price of oil, if the bulk of oil revenues would continue
to be saved. Lower exports to Europe (now 20 percent of GDP) would explain the difference
(¾ percent).



Financial spillovers would lead to lower availability and higher costs of credit, though banks’ rollover
needs on external loans are now significantly lower than at the time of the 2007–09 crisis. Foreign
investment and portfolio flows would also be affected.

2.
Slowdown affecting EMEs and involving a larger decline in oil prices:
Banks and authorities in EMEs would tighten lending standards to clean up the legacy of the extended credit
boom, lowering global demand by 2¼ percent and generating a fall in oil prices of 25 percent.


The downturn would lower Kazakhstan’s growth by 2¼ percent. This estimate is underpinned by
1) the higher decline in oil prices; 2) larger trade spillovers from Russia and China (two important
trading partners with combined exports of 15 percent of GDP); and 3) financing needs forcing a
higher-than-currently-envisaged use of oil savings.



Global risk aversion could lead to increased sovereign risk (in line with possible developments in
Russia), adverse impacts on FDI and portfolio inflows, and depreciation pressures.

3.
Faster than anticipated recovery in the euro area and a mild fall in oil prices:
A recovery in the euro area would result in easing of credit conditions.


The impact on growth would be likely negligible as the effect of a faster global recovery would
offset the mild fall in oil prices.



Lower risk aversion, however, may imply inflow flight to buoyant emerging economies, including
Kazakhstan, creating policy challenges related to currency appreciation and overheating.

4.
Adverse supply shock triggered by geopolitical tension in the Middle East:
Renewed tensions in the Middle East would lead to a 50 percent rise in oil prices.


The impact on growth would be uncertain and likely negative even if Kazakhstan is a large oil
exporter.



In principle, growth would be higher by 3 percentage points from spillovers to the domestic
economy even though most windfall revenue would be saved.



Nonetheless, the increase in oil price would depress global demand and financial markets, with
large adverse spillovers to Kazakhstan’s real and financial sectors.

Outward Spillovers
Deteriorated conditions in Kazakhstan would be transmitted to neighboring countries via trade, remittances
and capital flows. The most serious impact is likely to be on trade with the Kyrgyz Republic (imports from
Kazakhstan are 10 percent of GDP), and remittances to Tajikistan (2 percent of GDP). In addition, subsidiaries
of Kazakhstani banks are present in these countries.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
D. Financial Sector: Resolving Bank Asset Weaknesses
14.
The authorities have developed a new mechanism to deal with impaired bank loans,
but its implementation has been slow. The strategy combines a centralized problem loans fund
established and funded by the NBK and other investors (including pension funds and banks) and
bank-run Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). The centralized fund is expected to deal with a small
fraction of NPLs (up to $2 billion compared to $22 billion) and to exclude real estate loans where the
bulk of the problem is concentrated. Loans to real estate and construction are to be addressed by
individual banks through the SPVs. The SPVs are separate accounting entities that seek to allow
better management of troubled assets and collateral by banks, and will have preferential
provisioning requirements. The strategy was announced in early 2011, but the enabling legislation
was adopted only at the end of the year, and the mechanism is now expected to begin operating in
the second half of 2012.

15.
Staff cautioned the authorities about the insufficiency of this approach. The NBK will
need to ensure that the centralized fund manages bad loans efficiently, as their further deterioration
would result in losses for the NBK and other investors. In addition, banks should actively seek to
resolve NPLs by writing them off or selling them at market prices with the help of professional
managers and specialists, rather than simply moving them off the banks’ unconsolidated balance
sheets into the SPVs. Furthermore, provisioning rules for SPVs should not be different from those for
the banks, to eliminate the incentives to window-dress the balance sheets instead of pursuing true
resolution. Staff also noted the need to make permanent the removal of tax disincentives for banks
to write off NPLs, eliminate tax liabilities for potential purchasers of bad loans at a discount, and give
banks the possibility of sharing the upside gains if assets become performing. Ultimately, successful
resolution of problem loans will depend critically on the willingness of banks to accept realistic asset
valuation and recognize losses. Neither the centralized fund nor the bank-run SPVs solve the
valuation problem.

16.
The NBK saw no urgency to take additional action based on the belief that economic
recovery is bound to encourage lending and improve bank profitability. The authorities
acknowledged that the combination of strong economic growth, recovery in bank lending, and the
newly created mechanism are not sufficient to immediately resolve the problem of impaired assets.
The NBK also felt, however, that reporting requirements, in particular those related to NPLs and
provisioning, are more stringent in Kazakhstan than in most other countries, and thus the soundness
indicators reflect reality more accurately. They saw no need for an additional diagnostic assessment,
noting that in many advanced economies and other emerging markets, banking sector problems
had been resolved through more interventionist support operations and forbearance.
17.
Staff stressed the need to strictly enforce regulations, ensuring proper valuation and
adequate provisioning of loans, as well as recognition of bank losses. An independent,
forward-looking and comprehensive assessment of asset quality and capital adequacy would be
crucial. Rapid action should then be taken to replenish bank capital where needed, ideally from
existing shareholders and other private investors. If these funds are insufficient, the use of budgetary
funds may be required. Otherwise, banks will remain risk averse and not supportive of the
government’s objectives of growth and diversification. In parallel, the NBK, as the banks’ regulator
and supervisor, should strictly enforce existing regulations, refrain from forbearance, and ensure that
banks adopt and implement better practices in governance, accountability, and risk management.
While a cohesive framework for crisis management and bank resolution exists, the NBK should make
full use of its mandate to conduct effective supervision. Following the recent incorporation of the
supervisory agency into the NBK, supervisory responsibilities need to be fully integrated with
monetary and regulatory functions. It is also crucial that supervisory staff has the necessary training
and budgetary resources to credibly perform its role.
18.
To mitigate further risks, a quick and definitive solution to the BTA problem is a key
priority. Staff noted that continuing to allow BTA to operate while violating many prudential norms
creates costs and distortions. The bank has a large negative interest margin, resulting in growing
losses and contingent liabilities to the public sector. Furthermore, with an implicit government
guarantee, continuing to offer high deposit rates creates moral hazard and may distort the market.
Substantial funds of state companies are deposited at BTA, tying up their working capital or
imposing liquidity risks. Protracted negotiations to share costs of the needed recapitalization with
external creditors could involve risks of confidence loss, making trade finance and foreign loans
more difficult to obtain.
19.
On a more positive note, the NBK is interested in strengthening macroprudential
policy tools to support monetary and financial stability. Following the crisis, regulations to
contain systemic risks were introduced, discouraging cross-border borrowing and foreign currency
lending, increasing minimum capital requirements, and requiring better governance and
transparency practices, including stricter limits on related parties’ activities. In the context of moving
to the proposed Basel III framework, the NBK is considering additional countercyclical measures
focused on instruments that are conditional on aggregate events and limit the impact on banks of
excessive financial cycles, such as dynamic capital and provisioning requirements. Staff supported

this intention, emphasizing that these tools should be useful to prevent a renewed expansion of
low-quality credit. However, it is important that such measures are openly discussed with the banks
and implemented in a consistent and time bound manner.

E. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Refining the Policy Instruments
20.
As the financial crisis has evolved, the NBK has adapted its monetary policy to
changing conditions. At the peak of the crisis, monetary policy was focused on financial stability
considerations, including providing liquidity support to banks and promoting exchange rate stability
to avoid the impact of devaluation on weak banks. Given the weak demand for credit and risk
aversion by banks, liquidity has been de facto sterilized by the NBK with no inflationary impact, since
movements in international food and fuel prices have been the main drivers of inflation. As
conditions improved, the NBK first abandoned the temporary exchange rate peg by transitioning to
a trading band, then widened the band, and finally moved to managed float in 2011. While more
flexibility has been observed, NBK’s interventions in the market have kept fluctuations within a
narrow range. At the same time, high dollarization, limited interbank transactions, and shallow
money and credit markets have impaired the impact of the policy rate on either monetary
developments or inflation.
21.
With the worst of the liquidity problems behind, it would be important for the NBK to
prioritize the inflation objective and allow greater exchange rate flexibility. The authorities
noted that monetary policy will continue to aim at preventing sharp fluctuations of the exchange
rate, while keeping inflation within the 6–8 percent objective. Staff pointed out that greater two-way
flexibility would help the economy adjust to external shocks, reduce reliance on fiscal policy that is
relatively inflexible in the short term, and avoid excessive speculative inflows. A full rehabilitation of
banks would be a prerequisite to improve the efficiency of the monetary transmission mechanism by
strengthening the credit channel. Staff also recommended developing money and foreign exchange
markets, promoting long-term tenge liquidity, facilitating risk management and hedging practices,
and refining the policy tools to control inflation. At the same time, the use of administrative
measures to control price increases should be avoided. The authorities indicated that while they
have abandoned plans to formally introduce inflation targeting, they continuously assess the
efficacy of their policy instruments in controlling inflation.

22.
In the short term, the NBK should keep its options open, given the uncertainties, and
tighten policies if demand pressures arise. The NBK has signaled its readiness to further cut the
indicative policy rate should inflation remain low after the forthcoming increases in utility tariffs.
Staff argued that, given the economy’s position in the cycle, implementation of the announced fiscal
spending plans could cause demand pressures. This possibility would call for postponing any further
monetary easing until the weakening of inflation pressures becomes evident, or it would even
warrant tightening policies through more active open market operations and increased reserve
requirements, should demand pressures arise. Given the changing external conditions, however, it is
also possible that spillovers from a deeper global slowdown would call for domestic monetary
support.

F. Fiscal Policy: Rebuilding the Fiscal Buffer to Deal with Uncertainty
23.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal plans envisage gradual consolidation. The
authorities remain committed to reducing the non-oil deficit to the medium-term sustainable level,
primarily through expenditure reduction, to rebuild their fiscal buffer and ensure intergenerational
equity. Staff supported this approach, but stressed the need for a well-defined fiscal strategy to
achieve the target. In this regard, broadening the tax base, making the personal income tax more
progressive, limiting the use of tax exemptions, and increasing the relatively low VAT rate, would
bring efficiency gains over the medium term. These measures would also make the attainment of
the medium-term target more credible, and help reduce the budget’s dependence on oil, thereby
mitigating the economic risks related to a potentially prolonged decline in oil prices.
24.
In the near term, however, a planned fiscal expansion would likely shift the path away
from the sustainable goal. Based on budgetary plans, staff estimates that the non-oil fiscal balance
would deteriorate by some ½ percent of GDP in 2012 and improve only marginally in 2013. Given
global uncertainty and the anticipated modest slowdown in growth, the authorities feel that a fiscal
expansion is consistent with the needed counter-cyclicality. Non-oil revenue is expected to decline
somewhat, reversing part of the one-off increase last year, and the annual transfer from the NFRK is
set to increase by 15 percent as a result of amended legislation. While wages and pensions are to
remain constant in real terms, higher capital outlays in line with the diversification and
industrialization strategy have been announced.3 Staff cautioned against fiscal policy loosening, as it
would shift the non-oil position from the desirable path and risk unduly stimulating demand, and
urged the authorities to treat the spending plans as contingent. After two years of strong economic
expansion, the projected return to potential growth calls for gradual but continued fiscal
consolidation.
25.
While supporting flexibility in the use of oil resources, staff urged proper integration
of the NFRK into the fiscal framework. The authorities see the disconnection of the NFRK from
the fiscal accounts as an important tool to safeguard oil savings from increasing spending demands.

These estimates do not include any possible capital injections to banks.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

However, any use of NFRK resources that is not aligned with the medium-term fiscal objectives
could complicate policy coordination and macroeconomic management. In line with the
recommendations of the technical assistance mission on Public Financial Management, staff advised
to fully integrate the NFRK into the budget, and anchor the budget process on clear and credible
medium-term targets for the non-oil deficit.
26.
With the large role of public enterprises in the economy, transparent reporting of their
activities is essential for fiscal planning. Since the crisis, the government has shown preference for
large quasi-fiscal operations channeled off budget through state enterprises, in particular, SK and its
subsidiaries. Information on the extent of these operations is not fully available. While the bulk of
them occurred in 2009, the authorities indicated that they have plans for outlays of 1¼ percent of
GDP in 2012–13. Staff noted the benefits of incorporating state enterprises into the fiscal accounts
for the authorities’ own analysis of the fiscal stance. Transparency of public sector statistics, in the
form of a consolidated balance sheet, would also eliminate the asymmetry of information among
government agencies. The authorities have formed an interagency committee to work on reporting
the fiscal positions of state owned enterprises and have started collecting debt data for enterprises
with more than 50 percent state ownership.

G. Diversifying the Economy and Improving Governance
27.
The commitment to economic diversification is an opportunity to enhance
competitiveness and the role of the private sector in the economy. Oil accounts for one quarter
of GDP, half of fiscal revenues, and two thirds of export proceeds. The authorities seek to reduce this
dependence by accelerating industrialization and infrastructure development in other sectors. Their
medium-term plans envisage an increased share of manufacturing in GDP, improved productivity in
agriculture, development of advanced technologies, health and education reforms, and selected
privatization. Based on the results of a growth accounting model, staff stressed that increases in
productivity to complement gains in capital accumulation and employment are needed (Box 3).
Discussions focused on four broad areas:


Using oil savings to finance productive non-oil investment. The authorities argued that the
current yields on financial investments of the NFRK are lower than the potential wider benefits
from infrastructure and development-oriented job-creating programs that could be financed
with oil savings. Staff supported partial use of the oil savings for non-oil investments, but noted
that such an approach can be successful only if projects are well chosen, fiscally sustainable, and
consistent with sound governance and implementation capacity.



Reducing the role of the public sector. The public sector is taking an increasingly large role in
the economy. The government has announced that public sector entities will undertake a
number of construction and development projects, and that the NFRK resources will be used to
finance the acquisition of a larger stake in the Kashagan oil field by the state oil and gas
company (KMG). Staff emphasized that a more important role for the private sector is key to the
dynamic development of the economy. Plans for privatization via the “People’s IPOs” program to
allow citizens to acquire stakes in large corporations (expected to start in the fall of 2012),

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

PPP-type schemes, and other modalities, would allow private investors’ participation on a
competitive basis.


Improving competitiveness and the business environment. Following recent gains in some of
the international rankings, the authorities aim to further enhance governance and transparency,
to promote investment (Appendix 3). They are also interested in continuing to attract
investments to tax free special economic zones for the production of domestically consumed
and exported goods. Staff cautioned against the maintenance of subsidies and tax exemptions
that would generate price distortions and affect tax collection, and emphasized that clear rules
and sound institutions are crucial for a more friendly business climate and increased interest
from investors.



Removing barriers to trade and further integrating into the global economy. The
authorities are pursuing closer integration with neighbors and improved trade relations with
countries in all regions. They noted that the Customs Union and the creation of a single
economic space with Russia and Belarus have the potential to boost trade, investment and
growth. Staff stressed that regional integration works best if conceived as a stepping stone
toward multilateral trade liberalization. It will also be important to avoid protectionist measures
against nonmembers of the Customs Union. In that regard, it is encouraging that Russia will
formally join the WTO in mid–2012, and Kazakhstan is expected to achieve WTO accession by
late 2012.

28.
Looking ahead, there is a clear need to ensure that growth benefits the population as a
whole. In addition to being broad based, growth in Kazakhstan needs to be inclusive. Recent
demonstrations of social discontent signal the need to continue to pursue policies targeted at the
reduction of poverty and inequality, especially in rural areas. In that regard, the authorities’ plans to
improve coverage and administration of the existing social safety net are a welcome step. Further
improvements in the provision of health and quality of education are important for increasing the
productivity of human capital.

Box 3. Sources of Growth
Favorable hydrocarbon prices led to strong growth and expansion of resource sectors, following
gradual market reforms in the 1990s and substantial foreign investments. The share of mining in GDP
grew from 8 percent in 1998 to 20 percent in 2010, while the contribution of manufacturing and agriculture
declined from 18 and 9 percent in 1998 to 12 and 6 percent in 2010, respectively.
A growth accounting model1/ suggests that:


Physical capital accumulation has increasingly become the most important source of growth,
particularly since 2005. The high volatility of the capital stock in the early 2000s reflects its
modernization in the first years of transition, when old machinery and equipment were being
replaced. This shift resulted in massive investments and bulky depreciations, and led to steady
capital accumulation in the late 2000s. In 2005–10 the capital stock in mining increased nearly two
and a half times in real terms. In manufacturing, after an initial decline, the capital stock expanded
at a significantly lower rate than in mining, and in agriculture it decreased nearly by half in the early
2000s, returning to its 1998 level only in 2007.



Overall employment and average schooling have also expanded. Kazakhstan has traditionally
enjoyed higher labor force participation than resource-rich peers, and official unemployment rates
have been low and steadily declining. However, labor mobility across sectors has been relatively
limited. Nearly a third of employment remains concentrated in agriculture despite the continuous
decline in the sector’s share in total value added. Unsurprisingly, mining is not a major employer,
accounting for only 2½ percent of employment in 2010, a share that has remained stable since the
mid 1990s. The share of manufacturing in employment has declined steadily in line with its share in
GDP, even though labor productivity in manufacturing has been higher than the average in the
economy.



Total factor productivity (TFP) has been declining since 2007. TFP has shifted from being a
major source of growth in 1999–2003 to become less important in 2003–06 and negative in the
most recent period. This pattern is shared by most sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, and
to a lesser extent mining. Most countries that underwent a transition from centrally planned to
market economies experienced fast gains in TFP in the period of rapid reforms followed by a slower
expansion as reforms were being completed. The decline of TFP may be temporary, reflecting lower
utilization of capital at the time of its rapid accumulation, including through FDI. Nonetheless, since
productivity is an important source of growth in the long run, a continued decline in TFP would be a
cause for concern.

Enhancing productivity growth is therefore crucial. If the current trend were to continue in the long term,
sustaining high growth rates would require increasingly higher rates of physical capital accumulation.
Enhancements in TFP growth could be achieved by: 1) ensuring that production factors are channeled to
their most efficient uses—increased labor mobility across sectors and firms can boost productivity by
channeling labor from less productive to more productive ones; and 2) bringing the non-oil tradable sectors
closer to the technological frontier—it is key that government’s industrial development and diversification
policies aim at encouraging technological innovation in addition to investment in physical capital.
Importantly, an increased role of the private sector in the economy would be crucial in enhancing efficient
resource allocation and innovation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Macroeconomic policies have responded to the oil price-driven recovery, but the
legacy of the boom and bust cycle on bank soundness remains unresolved. The authorities have
reacted to the upswing in the cycle by appropriately unwinding the stimulus provided at the time of
the crisis. Fiscal policy has been gradually tightened, although the non-oil deficit remains above the
long-term sustainable level. High excess bank liquidity has been sterilized by the NBK and the tenge
has shown some more flexibility than in the past, though the NBK has been active in offsetting
frequent fluctuations in portfolio flows reflecting changes in risk perceptions. Against this
background, addressing the continuous deterioration of the quality of banks’ loan portfolio has
proven challenging, and hopes that the rebound in economic activity and ad hoc stimulus support
would restore bank balance sheets have not materialized. As a result, banks, especially some large
ones, remain vulnerable and unsupportive of the government’s diversification strategy. The banking
sector’s capital needs present a contingent liability for the public sector.
30.
The growth outlook is positive but subject to external and domestic risks. A further
downturn in eurozone economies, in particular if it affects China and Russia, would hurt
Kazakhstan’s trade, investment, and financial flows. If these developments are combined with a
decline in commodity prices, the adverse impact on the economy and the banking sector would be
even higher. Conversely, if world oil prices remain high, the economy would continue to benefit
from positive spillovers. The authorities’ preparation of contingency plans to deal with external
shocks is welcome. The weak banking system and the changing socio-political environment are
crucial domestic sources of vulnerability.
31.
In the absence of a shock, however, it will be important to resist current plans to
spend a higher share of the oil surplus. The authorities attribute a high likelihood to an adverse
global scenario that would inhibit domestic growth. This perception, coupled with continued
demand for public sector support from different sectors and a spread of social discontent, has led
the government to temporarily increase the transfers from the oil fund to the budget and step up
spending plans. In the absence of additional shocks, the envisaged expansionary fiscal policy would
risk derailing the non-oil deficit from the downward trend observed in recent years and delaying its
convergence to the medium-term target. While social spending must be privileged, treating other
stimulus spending plans as contingent would be important, as premature and excessive reaction
could unnecessarily invigorate demand and result in overheating.
32.
Despite the recent sharp reduction in inflation, the NBK may need to tighten monetary
policy if price pressures arise. The current record-low inflation has been supported by decreasing
world food prices, an extraordinary harvest, and the use of administrative measures to limit price
increases in key food items. Dismantling these measures soon is a necessary step to avoid market
distortions, but together with the potential fiscal expansion, this could reignite inflationary
pressures. NBK policy rates lack traction in a shallow market with limited interbank transactions and
little exchange rate flexibility. Nonetheless, given the uncertainty, the NBK may need to avoid
signaling further monetary easing and stand ready to tighten policies by stepping up open market
operations or increasing reserve requirements if domestic demand picks up.

33.
Restoring the health of the financial system remains an urgent and immediate priority.
The NBK needs to be proactive in strengthening banking supervision. Envisaged and desirable
regulatory improvements, including a commitment to adopt Basel III type measures, need to be
complemented by strict enforcement of regulations, as prolonged forbearance does not provide
incentives to the large banks to clean up their balance sheets. A comprehensive resolution of the
bad debt problem is essential for the resumption of normal banking activities. The new mechanism
to manage troubled assets represents only a partial solution to the problem. A successful strategy
will require enforcing banks to accept realistic asset valuation and recognize losses. Forceful action
will be needed to ensure adequate provisioning, replenish bank capital where needed, and close
unviable banks. At the same time, subsidized lending to selected troubled borrowers that creates
distortions and may lead to new NPLs should be discontinued.
34.
To minimize costs and risks, a fast solution to the BTA external liability problems is
needed. Losses are mounting as the bank remains operational while protracted and complex
negotiations with creditors on the extent of the difficulties and the viability of a business plan take
place. While the restoration of BTA’s viability is not an automatic and easy task, a credible plan,
based on a comprehensive and forward looking balance sheet assessment, is yet to be developed.
Once legal constraints are addressed, all options, including the bank’s closure, should remain open
until there is agreement on a viable business plan.
35.
Looking ahead, macroeconomic policymaking would benefit from improved
medium-term frameworks and better policy coordination. In the fiscal area, this strategy would
require broadening the tax base to make achievement of the fiscal target credible, and fully
integrating the NFRK and state entities’ accounts into the medium-term fiscal framework. On the
monetary front, strengthening the transmission mechanism would require a well-functioning
benchmark yield curve with full market determination of prices and deeper financial markets in
domestic and foreign currency. Greater exchange rate flexibility should support monetary
management and the economy’s response to external shocks, while mitigating speculative demand
for financial assets. Ultimately, to fully garner the benefits of these reforms a well-capitalized and
well-regulated financial system will be required.
36.
Success in promoting sustainable development will entail reduced oil dependence and
increased reliance on private consumption and investment as sources of growth. The
government’s plans to use some of the oil savings to finance job-creating and productive
investments are consistent with economic diversification, but need to be complemented by
enhanced participation of the private sector in the economy. Private sector investment will respond
to further enhancements in competitiveness and the business environment by addressing
governance issues and building institutions. These reforms, along with further integration of
Kazakhstan into the global economy, should help ensure that the oil wealth benefits the population
as a whole.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12–month cycle.

Appendix 1. Kazakhstan: External Stability Assessment
Current Account and Exchange Rate
With oil prices gradually falling and an increase in non-oil imports to finance development projects,
the current account surplus is projected to decline gradually from the current record high to
3 percent of GDP by 2017.
The current account and the real effective exchange rate are broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. Staff assessed the exchange rate using the augmented methodology for oil exporters
developed by MCD, as well as employing the standard CGER methodologies. In all three
methodologies of the CGER, the tenge was found close to equilibrium or slightly undervalued. The
macroeconomic balance approach showed a slight undervaluation. Based on the external
sustainability approach, the extent of undervaluation is larger, but when the present value of the
NFRK is included in the net external asset position, the undervaluation is lower. The equilibrium real
exchange rate approach shows virtually no deviation from the estimated equilibrium.

WP/11/195.
2/ Based on 2017 projections. The current account excludes oil-related net income flows.
3/ Based on medium-term fundamentals (2017 projections).
4/ Norm and underlying current account positions exclude oil-related net income flows. The norm is the
adjusted current account balance needed to stabilize the 2017 net foreign asset position, given the trade
shares as of 2010.

Capital and Financial Accounts
Total external debt continued to decline from 80 percent of GDP in 2010 to 67 percent in 2011.
Excluding inter-company obligations, external debt is now 34½ percent of GDP. Banks’ net external
position has been negative since the restructuring, and the remaining external debt is less than
10 percent of GDP at end-2011.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

International Reserves
NBK’s international reserve adequacy is comparable to that of large and sustainable EMEs. If assets
of the NFRK are included, the level compares well to other oil and fuel exporters. The new reserve
adequacy metric (see SM/11/31) suggests that reserves in the range of 16.4–24.6 percent of GDP
in 2011 may be considered appropriate in the case of Kazakhstan. The actual data as of end-March
2012 shows 16.5 percent for NBK’s reserves and 41 percent if the NFRK is included.
In 2011, the change in reserves has been guided in part by the central bank’s efforts to limit
excessive volatility in the nominal exchange rate. As such, during periods of strong inflows (up to
July 2011), the NBK intervened to buy dollars, with reserves rising from $28 billion to $37 billion.
However, as flows (mainly portfolio) reversed, reserves declined to around $29 billion by year-end. In
the first two months of 2012, fresh inflows led the central bank to accumulate reserves, which now
stand at $34½ billion. In contrast, foreign assets in the national oil fund have steadily risen
throughout the year as oil-related revenues were saved.

Appendix 2. Kazakhstan: Risk Assessment Matrix
Nature/source of main threats

Likelihood of realization in the
next three years

Expected impact on the
economy if risk is realized

Global slowdown affecting
China and Russia

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff currently projects growth in
China and Russia to remain
sufficiently strong.

Kazakhstan would be affected
through trade, finance, and
investment channels. A
deterioration of market
conditions in Russia could have
an impact on FDI and portfolio
inflows.

Staff assessment: Low

Staff assessment: High

The economy remains highly
dependent on oil for export
proceeds and budget revenues.

A global recession with a
protracted slow growth could
depress demand for energy and
cause a sharp fall in oil prices.

While reserves are sufficient to
avoid an immediate fiscal shock,
the recovery in transport,
communications and other
non-oil sectors would be
endangered.

Failure to improve the health of
the banking system

Staff assessment: Medium to
high

Staff assessment: High

The banking system is fragile, and
BTA debt negotiations are likely
to be difficult, especially if the
market sentiment toward
emerging markets deteriorates.

Attempts to resolve banking
sector issues have not been
successful so far. New proposed
schemes present only a partial
solution, and have been delayed.

Political uncertainty

Staff assessment: Medium to
high

Staff assessment: Medium to
high

The risk has increased following
episodes of social unrest in parts
of the country.

Political factors may hinder
effective policymaking and affect
growth and stability.

EU, Russia, and China are the
main trading partners. Risk
indicators tend to move in line
with those of Russia. China is a
major source of investment.

Large and prolonged decline in
oil prices

Political incentives may be
misaligned with economic
priorities.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Less than two years after the
previous bank debt restructuring,
the impact on confidence will be
high, and could lead to deposit
runs and credit crunch. The
capital shortfall of the system is
large, and represents a
contingent liability for the
government.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The official
exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held daily. Auctions
are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are quoted for over 30 other
currencies on the basis of cross-rates. From late 1999 to October 2007, the exchange rate regime
was a managed float with no preannounced path. From October 2007 the tenge was maintained
within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. In February 2009 the tenge was devalued by
18 percent against the US dollar, and a trading band of T150/US$ +/- 3 percent was established. In
February 2010, the trading band was widened and set at an asymmetric T150/US$ +10/-15 percent.
In February 2011, the trading band was officially abolished, and the de jure exchange rate
arrangement was changed from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands to a managed
float. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as crawl-like, because the tenge has been
consistently tracking a trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2 percent margin. The exchange rates at
numerous exchange bureaus are very close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and
selling rates is very small. The exchange system is free from restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on
Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010). The last consultation was
concluded on June 16, 2011 (see IMF Country Reports No. 11/150 and 11/151).
FSAP Participation and ROSCS
Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000. The staff report
on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on November 27, 2000
(FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision, Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good
Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of
Securities Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP Update mission took place in
February 2004 and a second FSAP Update mission took place in March 2008. The fiscal transparency
module was completed in October 2002 and the final report published in April 2003. A data module
mission took place in April/May 2002, and its final report was published in March 2003. An update
of the data ROSC was undertaken in 2006 and the report was published in February 2008 (Annex V).
AML/CFT Assessment
Kazakhstan’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework was recently assessed against the AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) 40+9 Recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by the Eurasian Group on money
laundering and financing of terrorism (EAG), the FATF-style regional body of which Kazakhstan is a
member, and the final mutual evaluation report was adopted in June 2011. The report indicates that
the main sources of criminal proceeds in Kazakhstan are crimes related to fraud and abuse of public

office. The evaluators found that Kazakhstan had a relatively comprehensive AML/CFT framework in
place, but that significant deficiencies nevertheless remained, notably with respect to customer due
diligence measures and the reporting of suspicious transactions.
Technical Assistance
Kazakhstan has received technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area of
economic policy, including through about 90 technical assistance missions provided during
1993–2012 by FAD, LEG, MCM, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to short-term missions, the
Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, to the Ministry of Finance, and a peripatetic expert to the Financial
Supervision Agency. Other international agencies and governments, including the World Bank, EU
TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of technical assistance. The
following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan since 2003.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of May 1, 2012)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and the International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992 and a member of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. In 2010 Kazakhstan became an IDA donor under the
IDA 16 replenishment. Kazakhstan is the largest client of the IFC in Central Asia.
IBRD in Kazakhstan
The Bank’s lending operations in Kazakhstan are wide-ranging and all fall within the key pillars of
the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) adopted in 2004. The new CPS for 2012–17 was presented to
the Board of Directors on May 1, 2012. As of April 2012, the IBRD loan program comprises twelve
projects with a total commitment of $2.55 billion, of which $887 million has been disbursed. Among
the twelve projects, implementation of two projects (agricultural competitiveness and Moinak
electricity transmission) will be completed by the end of this calendar year. The other ten active
projects are: forest protection and reforestation, Ust-Kamenogorsk environmental remediation,
technology commercialization, customs development, tax administration reform, health sector
technology transfer and institutional reform, technical and vocational education modernization,
strengthening the national statistical system, South West roads, and Alma electricity transmission. A
new road project to complete construction of the last section of the Western Europe-Western China
corridor linking Almaty to the border with China was presented to the Board of Directors on
May 1, 2012.
The Joint Economic Research Program (JERP) provides extensive analytical support to the
Government’s development needs. Analytical and advisory services (AAA) under the JERP remain in
high demand and currently comprise 21 activities amounting to $4.4 million. As in previous years,
the current JERP is focused on the government’s strategic priorities in: (i) enhancing
competitiveness; (ii) mitigating macroeconomic risks; (iii) strengthening public finance management
and administration; and (iv) improving human development.
IFC in Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan is the IFC's largest client in Central Asia. As of the end of March 2012, IFC’s total
committed portfolio in Kazakhstan amounted to $345 million, of which $336 million has been
disbursed. IFC’s efforts in Kazakhstan are directed to foster private sector led growth, particularly in
the non-extractive sectors and frontier regions. The investment portfolio is mostly concentrated in
the financial sector and general manufacturing, although recently IFC has begun making
investments in the agribusiness sector. In the financial sector, IFC is focusing on: (i) further
stabilization, diversification, and extension of the maturity of the banks’ funding base; and (ii)
establishment of the best international corporate governance and regulatory environment. As a
result of the financial sector crisis, the IFC has aimed to identify partner financial institutions to
contribute to the stabilization of the financial sector and increase access to finance in priority

sectors. In this regard, over the past three and a half years, the IFC has provided close to
$600 million in equity, quasi-equity, senior debt, and trade finance to several banks.
IFC’s investment program has been expanding in recent years. Investments grew tenfold between
FY05 and FY08 (to $110 million) and nearly doubled again in FY09. In FY10, IFC invested a record
$336 million in five projects in the financial and agribusiness sectors, with vast majority provided to
commercial banks. Post-crisis investment levels have been more modest, with $103 million invested
in five projects in FY11 and $66 million invested in FY12 to date.
In addition, the IFC is providing advisory services in several key areas. These include Corporate
Governance and Private Public Partnerships (PPPs), where IFC’s Transaction Advisory team is in
discussions to help the government structure PPPs in the roads and health sectors. A new advisory
investment climate initiative has been launched to assist Central Asian countries, including
Kazakhstan, in strengthening transparency of tax systems.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK
FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(As of May 1, 2012)
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is the largest investor outside the
oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan. As of May 1, 2012, the EBRD’s total business volume in Kazakhstan,
including co-financing, stood at €11 billion, with investments totaling €4.4 billion (both these figures
include approximately €2.4 billion in cumulative Trade Facilitation Program turnover). As of May 1,
2012, the EBRD’s portfolio in Kazakhstan amounted to €1.8 billion. During 2011, the EBRD signed
14 projects, including regional ones, for a total amount of EBRD finance about €300 million. During
the first four months of 2012, the EBRD signed six operations with a total annual business volume
(ABV) of €93 million.
In its country strategy, approved in 2010, the EBRD aims to assist Kazakhstan in promoting
economic diversification and moving towards a more sustainable model of financial development.
The EBRD’s main operational objectives for 2012 are:


In the corporate sector, support investment in the manufacturing and the agribusiness sectors
to address immediate financing needs, while promoting the modernization and diversification of
the economy, best business and environmental practices, and energy efficiency.



In the financial sector, work with the Kazakhstani authorities and other IFIs to strengthen the
country’s financial sector; re-engage with partner banks; expand the partner banks group; and
assist the authorities with resolving the banks’ NPL problem and identifying and implementing
policy reforms to promote de-dollarization, develop local capital markets, and increase the
availability of sustainable local currency financing.



In the infrastructure sector, restructure the national railway company and support its
energy-efficiency improvement program; improve the infrastructure in Kazakh municipalities;
expand activities into the solid waste and district heating sectors and support municipal sector
reform, including innovative methods for developing and financing projects in the water
segment.



In the power and energy sector, support clean energy through the provision of financing to
modern generating facilities, stemming losses in the distribution segment through rehabilitation
of power lines and developing pilot renewable energy projects with private operators (subject to
bankability and integrity).

ANNEX IV. RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of April 19, 2012)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. In the early years of
transition from a centrally planned to a more market-driven economy, ADB focused on efforts to
sustain a higher growth rate, promote environmental friendly development, support the private
sector, and encourage regional integration.
As of April 19, 2012, cumulative public sector loan commitments to Kazakhstan amounted to
$2.34 billion, of which about $1.39 billion has been disbursed. Commitments cover 20 public sector
loans in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and communications, water
supply and sanitation, and irrigation. The loan operations were complemented with 65 technical
assistance (TA) projects totaling over $28 million. Kazakhstan is no longer eligible for concessional
resources from the ADB’s Asian Development Fund.
In recent years, ADB operations focused on water distribution and irrigation, road transportation,
budget support, private sector, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In supporting the State
Drinking Water Sector Program, 2002–15, ADB provided a $35 million loan in 2004 for basic water
supply services and a capacity-building program to improve living/health conditions in Akmola and
North and South Kazakhstan. After a slight pause from 2004, ADB's public sector operations in
Kazakhstan resumed in 2008 with the signing of the $225 million loan agreement for the Central
Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC) Transport Corridor 1 project under a
$700 million Multi-tranche Financing Facility (MFF). The Transport Corridor project aims to improve
a major transport corridor across Kazakhstan, linking it with its eastern and western neighbors, as
well as opening up north-south routes.
In 2009, ADB supported Kazakhstan in mitigating the impact of the global financial/economic crisis
with a $500 million loan. The loan supported the government’s crisis-mitigation action plan and the
employment-generation program and helped Kazakhstan finance its budget deficit. ADB also
approved another loan totaling $187 million under the MFF for reconstruction of CAREC Transport
Corridor 1 (Zhambyl Oblast sections) that year.
In 2010, ADB approved three loans totaling $608 million. An SME Investment Program
Tranche 1 project to enhance efficiency and competitiveness of the financial sector and SMEs was
approved as part of a $500 million MFF. The other two were the CAREC Transport Corridor
1 Tranche 3 and the CAREC Transport Corridor 2 Tranche 1. In 2011, ADB approved the CAREC
Transport Corridor 1 Tranche 4 and the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Taraz Bypass) loans totaling
$339 million.
Recent technical assistance projects include: preparation of the CAREC road projects in
2009 ($825,000); (ii) capacity development to support SME development approved in 2010 (for
$650,000) and (iii) preparation of the Astana Lightrail Transport project ($565,000) approved in 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

In 2011, an energy efficiency diagnostic study to identify investment priorities totaling $200,000 was
also approved. Kazakhstan also participates in a number of ongoing regional TA projects.
Private sector operations of ADB in Kazakhstan began in 2006, and have been focused on the
banking sector, with five private sector financings amounted to $375 million. Near-term ADB private
sector financing prospects are in the areas of private infrastructure and natural resource projects.
Kazakhstan was one of the 4 founding partners of the CAREC Program in 1997 (together with China,
Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan). Since then, six other countries have joined the partnership, and
CAREC-related investments in the partner countries have totaled $17 billion, over the period
2001–11. Four of the six CAREC road and rail corridors traverse Kazakhstan, developing these Central
Asian corridors is a priority for achieving the vision of land bridges connecting Europe and Asia.
A new country partnership strategy (CPS) to guide ADB operations during 2012–16 is being
prepared. The CPS proposes to support economic diversification and the increased competitiveness.
It envisages support for regional cooperation, private sector development, inclusive growth, and
knowledge exchange. Under the CPS, ADB’s support will focus on transport, finance, urban, and
energy sectors. Important corporate level cross-cutting themes include regional cooperation,
gender, environment and climate change, good governance, and private sector development and
operations.

ANNEX V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(as of May 1, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are monetary and balance of payments statistics, with remaining deficiencies in
national accounts.
National accounts: The quality of GDP statistics is affected by the limited coverage of small
businesses in selected activities such as retail and construction. While some progress has been made
in compiling and reporting GDP by final expenditure consistent with output-based measures,
dissemination of quarterly GDP series data is conducted on a discrete basis only.
Government finance statistics: Progress has been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts
consistent with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). However, as a
result of the reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of budgetary units,
difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears. In addition,
statistics on the enlarged government (including public enterprises) is not available.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs)
complied by the central bank have a few inconsistencies, and a technical assistance mission in January
2009 provided several recommendations.
Balance of payments: In general, the balance of payments is compiled in concordance with the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). However, foreign direct investment
statistics are not fully in line with the standards set forth in BPM5, as local branch offices of foreign
companies operating in the construction sector are considered nonresident entities. This leads to
discrepancies with national accounts statistics where this activity is treated as domestic production. In
addition, the errors and omissions have been large and increasing. The technical assistance mission in
April 2010 addressed these issues.
II. Data Standards and Quality

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW

June 18, 2012

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Kazakhstan
On June 18, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Background
Real GDP growth reached 7½ percent in 2011. While growth of oil production slowed, high
commodity prices helped spur domestic demand and activity in transport and
communications. Agriculture recovered from a severe drought, but activity in construction
and real estate remained flat. Official unemployment rate, at 5¼ percent, continued to be
unaffected by real growth, as was the case at the time of the slowdown.
Driven by rising global food prices and large increases in public sector wages, inflation
peaked at 9 percent in mid-2011, exceeding the official objective range of 6–8 percent.
More recently, however, slowing international commodity prices, an exceptionally high
harvest, and the use of administrative measures to limit food and fuel price increases
helped to bring inflation below 5 percent. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food,
remains subdued.
The current account surplus rose to 7½ percent of GDP, the highest level in recent years,
as robust exports outpaced the demand–driven rebound in imports. Assets in the National
Fund (NFRK) rose rapidly, and together with National Bank of Kazakhstan’s (NBK)

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

international reserves, reached a comfortable level equivalent to 17 months of imports and
110 percent of broad money.
Fiscal and monetary policies have adapted to the economic recovery. An expansion of
nonoil revenues from improved tax collection combined with a small decrease in the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio resulted in a decline in the nonoil fiscal deficit. Key monetary
indicators continued to grow at a slower rate than nominal GDP, and as inflation pressures
subsided, the NBK signaled a more accommodative monetary policy stance, cutting its
policy rate by 100 bps in early 2012. The tenge has started to show more flexibility, with the
NBK intervening on both sides of the market to avoid undue exchange rate volatility in
either direction.
The banking sector has still not fully recovered from the severe shock in 2007. Foreign
liabilities have fallen drastically, aggregate liquidity is ample, and provisioning of overdue
loans is still relatively high. Nevertheless, domestic banks’ burden of nonperforming loans
has further increased, and BTA bank has embarked on a second debt restructuring with
external creditors. So far, economic growth and government ad-hoc support to distressed
borrowers in the construction, real estate and SME sectors have not improved the quality of
the loan portfolio, as activity in construction and real estate, the sectors subject to highest
bank exposure, remains flat.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities’ policies which, together with high commodity prices,
yielded a strong economic recovery and helped rebuild external buffers. The authorities
have appropriately responded to the upswing in the cycle by gradually tightening fiscal
policy, sterilizing excess bank liquidity, and allowing greater exchange rate flexibility.
Directors noted that the growth outlook is positive, but subject to downside risks. They
called on the authorities to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector posed by the
deterioration of asset quality, and further strengthen the macroeconomic framework.
Directors appreciated the preparation of plans to deal with a possible protracted global
slowdown and a decline in oil prices. They stressed that achieving the non-oil medium-term
deficit target remains a priority and spending plans should not unduly stimulate demand in
the absence of a shock. They encouraged the central bank to closely monitor inflation, and
to stand ready to tighten monetary policy if domestic demand picks up.
Directors underscored the need to address the continued rise in bank troubled assets,
which presents a public sector contingent liability. They stressed that restoring banks’
health would support growth and economic diversification. Envisaged regulatory
improvements should be complemented with strict enforcement to provide an incentive for
banks to clean up their balance sheets. Directors noted that the new mechanism to
manage troubled assets represents only a partial solution. A successful strategy would
require action by the central bank to enforce realistic asset valuation and loss recognition,

3

ensure adequate provisioning, replenish bank capital where needed, and close unviable
banks. To mitigate further risks, a quick and definitive solution to the difficulties of BTA
bank is a crucial priority. Directors welcomed the plan to adopt Basel III standards by
year-end.
Directors considered that macroeconomic policymaking would benefit from improved
medium-term frameworks and policy coordination. In the fiscal area, this would require
broadening the tax base and fully integrating the oil fund and state entities’ accounts into
the fiscal framework. In the monetary sector, strengthening the transmission mechanism by
deepening financial markets would allow the gradual unwinding of administrative price
controls. Greater exchange rate flexibility would facilitate monetary management and the
economy’s response to external shocks. A well-capitalized and well-regulated financial
system would be important to support these reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ambitious plans to promote growth in the non-oil sector.
The envisaged job-creating government investments, partly financed by oil savings, will
however need to be complemented by enhanced private sector participation. Directors
therefore called for sustained efforts to improve the business environment through
strengthened governance and institutions and integrate Kazakhstan into the global
economy. Along with improvements in the coverage of the social safety net, these reforms
would promote greater social inclusiveness and help ensure that the oil wealth benefits the
population as a whole.

Statement by Mr. Rene Weber, Executive Director for the Republic of Kazakhstan and
Mr. Kuanyshbek Sazanov, Advisor to Executive Director
June 18, 2012

1.
On behalf of our Kazakh authorities, we thank the staff for this report, which provides
helpful policy recommendations. They welcome the regular dialogue with the Fund in the
context of the Article IV consultations and look forward to continued cooperation, including
in the area of technical assistance. The authorities stress that the economy’s strong and
sustained growth performance, substantial current account surplus, and ample financial
buffers should mitigate concerns about financial stability in the country. They nevertheless
appreciate the risk assessment by staff as well as the particular focus on spillovers that could
impact the Kazakh economy. The authorities would like to comment as follows on policy
developments and their policy stance.
Monetary Policy
2.
The authorities emphasize that the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) will continue
to conduct monetary policy aimed at price stability. The main goal of monetary policy is to
keep inflation both in 2012 and over the medium term within the 6 to 8 percent range (yearon-year). The authorities agree with the staff that the main drivers of inflation are high
international food and energy prices and that these factors were behind the peak in inflation
in mid-2011, which has now slowed to within the target range and, in May 2012, fell even
below that range to its lowest level since 1999.
3.
The flexibility of the exchange rate has increased but the NBK will continue to
intervene to prevent sharp fluctuations in the rate. The stability of the national currency, the
tenge, is considered important also from the perspective of the status of the currency in the
region and to allow domestic producers to compete on predictable terms. There is currently
also a premium on a stable exchange rate as developments in the global economy are highly
uncertain. The NBK intends to further increase the flexibility of the exchange rate, as
warranted, in support of an accelerated development of the Kazakh economy. Kazakhstan has
ample capacity to credibly maintain its managed floating exchange rate regime. At the end of
May 2012 the country’s international reserves exceeded US$85 billion, which includes more
than US$51 billion of National Fund assets.
4.
The authorities acknowledge the challenges in establishing a sound macroeconomic
framework and a resilient financial sector as the impact of the global crisis lingers. The
effectiveness of further measures will also depend on the strategy by the NBK regarding
monetary policy development and implementation. Currently, the NBK is considering the
possibility to improve the efficiency of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, mostly
through an active use of open market operations. This will improve liquidity management
and help build a yield curve in the money market.

2

Fiscal Policy
5.
The authorities confirm that their fiscal strategy over the medium term focuses on (i)
a reduction in the non-oil budget deficit, which by 2020 should not exceed 3 percent of GDP,
and (ii) a decrease in the use of National Fund resources to finance current expenditures,
which reflects a transition to funding solely through the regular budget. On the revenue side,
the main objective is to provide for a stable environment for economic activity, thereby
supporting industrial innovation, promoting non-oil sector development, and attracting
investments. Envisaged changes in the tax code aim at improving tax administration, which
will improve the transparency and predictability of fiscal policy.
6.
Fiscal policy is designed to be countercyclical. During periods of strong economic
activity, government spending will be restrained at a level lower than the nominal rate of
GDP growth, while during economic downturns such spending aims to support domestic
demand, including through public investment. This approach should allow for an appropriate
policy response both to a worsening of global economic conditions and to a potential
overheating of the economy.
7.
In order to ensure a sufficient fiscal policy buffer, the accumulation of financial
resources in the National Fund will continue by limiting the guaranteed transfer from the
National Fund to the budget to the amount of 1,380 billion tenge (about US$9.2 billion) per
year 2012-14. This buffer enhances the authorities’ room for maneuver to support the
economy should external conditions deteriorate. It will also increase the savings for future
generations and reduce the budget’s dependence on oil revenue. Any government borrowing
need will primarily be met on the domestic market. The authorities are ready to adjust their
fiscal stance, and if needed their budgetary framework, should domestic or international
developments call for it.
Financial Sector Policies
8.
The authorities are aware of the financial sector development and stability issues
highlighted by staff, namely related to the level of bank lending and the share of nonperforming loans in the system. The NBK acknowledges that the new mechanism for solving
problem loans—through the use of a new, centralized Problem Loans Fund (PLF) and
specialized SPVs created by banks—is not sufficient to resolve the non-performing loan
problem to its full extent. However, the authorities stress that the SPVs do not get
preferential terms when it comes to forming provisions, and shifting loans into an SPV
requires a bank to establish an action plan whose implementation is monitored by the NBK.
Legislative amendments made in 2011 provide for an exemption from taxation of SPV
income (until January 1, 2018), along with the establishment of operating procedures for
SPVs. The authorities consider that the mechanism foreseen to achieve improvements in the
quality of the loan books, both in the PLF and the SPVs, once operational, will be effective.
9.
The authorities share the staff’s concern regarding the risks which are related to a
deterioration of the quality of banks’ assets, to be acquired by the PLF, and which may result
in considerable losses for the PLF. In order to mitigate these risks, best international practices

3

will be applied in implementing adequate asset evaluation procedures and managerial
practices that should help minimize losses. It is the authorities’ intention that the PLF
establishes a benchmark for financial market participants on how problem assets should be
fairly valued and better managed. In addition, in line with the staff’s advice, banks
themselves must actively seek solutions to resolve problem loans by writing them off or
selling them at market prices. The sole transfer or sale of non-performing loans to the SPVs,
without taking comprehensive measures to improve the quality of the loans, will not
contribute to a resolution of the issue.
10.
The NBK currently considers adopting the Basel III standards, and the necessary
preparatory work is under way. This work involves consultations with the banks with a view
to determining the extent to which these standards (related to capital, liquidity, and
provisioning) will be implemented in accordance with the decisions of the Council on
Financial Stability and Financial Market Development of Kazakhstan. The authorities expect
that the necessary preparations could be in place by October 2012. The legal steps to
incorporate Basel III into national legislation could subsequently be concluded at the
beginning of November 2012.
11.
The authorities stress that the NBK in its activities, including in regulating and
supervising financial institutions, is guided by international practices and experience. Judged
by this yardstick, the current level of bank capitalization in Kazakhstan is higher and the
requirements for provisioning are stricter than in countries with comparable economic
structures and challenges. The NBK also is in regular dialogue with financial institutions
with the aim to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework. It has done so in order
to enhance assets classification and provisioning, to ensure the use of up-to-date risk
management systems in the banks, and to address the issues related to the introduction of
Basel III. Discussions on macro-prudential policy tools to support financial stability have
also been part of this dialogue.
