NEW ZEALAND
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with New Zealand
Approved by Steven Dunaway and Scott Brown
April 7, 2006
• The 2006 Article IV Consultation with New Zealand has a streamlined focus on current and
medium-term macroeconomic policies. Longer-term growth and structural policy issues were
discussed extensively in the 2005 Article IV Consultation, and New Zealand’s first official long-term
fiscal report will be released in mid-2006, making next year’s Article IV Consultation a suitable
opportunity for broader policy discussions.
• The discussions were held in Wellington between February 7-14, 2006. The mission met with
Minister of Finance Michael Cullen, Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard, Treasury
Secretary John Whitehead, other senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector
and trade unions. The staff team comprised Messrs. Gordon (Head), Beaumont, and Mercereau (all
APD). Mr. Dunaway (APD) and Mr. Blazey (OED) also participated in the discussions.
• Past recommendations and implementation: In previous consultations, the Fund has praised the
clear design and steadfast implementation of inflation targeting, a policy approach which New Zealand
has pioneered. The Fund has also commended the medium-term orientation of fiscal policy, which has
kept public debt on a low and declining path. With resources tightly stretched in recent years, the
authorities have undertaken to manage planned spending increases so as not to exacerbate short-term
pressures, an objective endorsed by the Fund. The Fund has also supported the authorities’ efforts to
provide adequate safeguards for financial stability in New Zealand in the event of a crisis; the recent
agreement with Australia on enhanced home-host supervision represents significant progress in this
regard. Other policy issues discussed in the 2005 Article IV Consultation are described in the latest
Public Information Notice; see http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn0560.htm.
• Exchange system: The New Zealand dollar floats independently, and New Zealand maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions (Annex I).
• Statistics: New Zealand publishes an array of high-quality statistics (Annex II). The authorities are
addressing issues that have precluded subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
• Official development assistance: New Zealand’s ODA is focused on the Pacific, and was 0.27 percent
of Gross National Income in 2005, an increase from 0.23 percent in 2004.

-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
New Zealand’s economy expanded at a more sustainable pace in 2005 after a period of
strong growth that led to rising inflation, but the external current account deficit widened
sharply. Net exports were undermined by the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, which
reached record levels by late 2005, supported by exceptional capital inflows driven by the global
“search for yield.” At the same time, domestic demand slowed less than expected owing to
surprising strength in the housing market.
The prospects are for a soft landing, although downside risks remain. Domestic demand has
begun to slow, hence growth is expected to be sluggish in 2006, and underlying inflation is likely
to begin to decline as pressures on resources ease. The exchange rate has depreciated
significantly recently, and may continue to weaken, so rising exports are expected to underpin a
pick up in growth. Domestic demand will likely recover more slowly, allowing the external
deficit to narrow over time. Initial signs of a cooling of the housing market have appeared, but
house price behavior remains a source of uncertainty.
Current macroeconomic policies are broadly suitable. With underlying inflation likely on a
downward path, monetary policy tightening has paused for the time being, and there is
substantial room for maneuver if the economy slows too abruptly. Fiscal policy will be
somewhat expansionary in coming years, reflecting government plans to raise support for
families and strengthen social services, and provides a further cushion against downside risks.

sector, and the external current account deficit rose
to 9 percent of GDP, double its 20-year average (Table 2).

With the New Zealand dollar historically
high, exports waned while imports surged. The
currency rose to a post–float high on a trade–
weighted basis by December 2005, boosted by
large capital flows associated with exceptional
demand for New Zealand dollar denominated
bonds from foreign retail investors in Japan and
Europe—net offshore issues reached 15 percent of
GDP in 2005 (Box 1). Total export volumes
declined despite strong global activity, as the high
exchange rate reduced manufactured exports and
tourism, and dairy production fell owing to poor
weather. Meanwhile, import growth remained rapid,
led by capital goods.1

facilitating the housing market revival was the
continuation until late in 2005 of low “fixed-rate”
mortgage interest rates despite rising official interest rates.2

Chapter I of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper finds that the high exchange rate has reinforced the
effect of strong domestic demand on imports.

Fixed-rate mortgages account for about four-fifths of total mortgages in New Zealand. They are similar
to adjustable rate mortgages in the United States, with rates usually reset at 1 to 3 year intervals.

Domestic demand has slowed more
recently. Consumer confidence fell to 5–year
lows in late 2005, reflecting rising mortgage rates
and high fuel prices. At the same time, the high
exchange rate and increasing labor and energy
costs reduced business confidence to 20–year
lows. More recent indicators, including retail
sales, employment growth, and imports, have
increasingly confirmed that a significant slowing
in domestic demand growth is underway.
5.
While underlying inflation is no longer
increasing, the labor market remains tight.
Headline CPI inflation rose to 3.3 percent y/y in
March 2006, from 2.8 percent a year earlier, slightly
exceeding the medium-term target range of 1 to
3 percent. However, almost half of this increase
reflected the direct impact of higher oil prices, and
most measures of underlying inflation leveled out
during the past year. Moreover, resource pressures,
as measured by capacity utilization and the difficulty
of finding labor, have begun to ease as growth has
slowed. Nonetheless, wages increased by
5½ percent y/y in 2005 compared to 4¾ percent in
2004 (measured by the unadjusted Labor Cost
Index), suggesting that the labor market remains
relatively tight. Inflation expectations have risen
according to survey data, although expectations for
two or more years remain within the target and
short-run expectations have eased more recently.

Monetary policy is on hold after a
further tightening in 2005. The RBNZ raised the
official cash rate (OCR) by 75 basis points in 2005
to 7¼ percent, with two hikes late in the year
prompted by the persistent strength in household
spending. Growth in household credit remained
around 15 percent y/y, and household debt rose to
150 percent of disposable income, despite RBNZ
statements aimed at raising awareness about the
potential risks of residential property investments
and high indebtedness.

Exchange rate adjustment is finally
underway. When the trade-weighted exchange
rate index (TWI) peaked in early
December 2005, the RBNZ stated that the
exchange rate was “exceptionally and
unjustifiably high” signaling that one of the
criteria for considering foreign exchange
intervention had been met, although, to date, no
intervention has occurred.3 By early-April, the
TWI had retraced 16 percent from its peak, with
most of this decline occurring since
mid-February.4 Nonetheless, the REER still
remains about 9 percent above its 20-year
average.
8.
Fiscal surpluses remain large. Strong
revenues lifted the operating surplus (OBERAC
excluding earnings of the New Zealand
Superannuation Fund) to 5½ percent of GDP
in 2004/05 (Table 3). The government’s
December 2005 Half Year Economic and Fiscal
Update (HYEFU) projects the 2005/06 operating
surplus to fall to 4 percent of GDP (excluding
write-downs of student loans), partly reflecting
the expansion in support for low income families
announced in 2004.5 In September 2005, the
Labour party won its third term in government,
with the support of minor parties. Though high
surpluses made fiscal policy a key election issue,
the spending allowance for 2006/07 was raised by
just ¼ percent of GDP relative to earlier plans,
with no increase for later years.6 The government

Under the policy adopted in March 2004, the other criteria required for the RBNZ to contemplate
intervention are that it would be consistent with the objectives of monetary policy, and that an opportunity
would exist for it to be effective.

4

The exchange rate began to decline once weak economic data was released that markets interpreted as
indicating an end to the monetary tightening cycle. At the same time, concerns about the end of the global
carry trade weakened sentiment toward a number of currencies, including the New Zealand dollar. In this
environment, the issuance of New Zealand dollar-denominated Uridashi issues dried up in March,
although this may also be associated with reduced demand by New Zealand banks for funds in line with
the cooling economy.

The overall fiscal surplus on an SNA basis (net lending in Table 4) is projected at 3 percent of GDP in
2005/06, which is exceeded only by Norway and Singapore among the advanced economies.

the elevated level of house prices relative to
household incomes and rents, the authorities
expect house prices to flatten out in 2006, thereby slowing demand, as experienced in Australia
and the United Kingdom in recent years. Lower housing market turnover in December to
February suggests that a turning point in house prices may be near, although such predictions
have in the past not always proved accurate.
10.
Growth is expected to strengthen once the economy rebalances. Although inflation
would remain near the top of the target range in 2006, the authorities expect it will decline as
resource pressures further unwind, allowing an eventual easing in monetary policy. The
authorities also expect the exchange rate to continue declining to more typical levels over the
next few years, which is consistent with IMF staff estimates that by December 2005, the
New Zealand dollar was 10–25 percent above medium-term equilibrium (based on a combination
of the macroeconomic balance approach and a modified PPP framework). Net exports would
accelerate as the tradable sector responds to the lower exchange rate, but domestic demand
growth may remain modest, partly because real house prices could decline moderately for a
number of years as in previous housing cycles. Staff project real GDP growth to rise to about
2 percent in 2007, and return to trend levels from 2008, while the external deficit would narrow
substantially over the medium term.
11.
While the central outlook is for a soft landing, the authorities have given thought to
less favorable scenarios.7 For example, the HYEFU considered a situation of generalized
weakness in demand and exports, that would reduce the growth projection by 1 percentage point
in the year ended March 2007. Similarly, the RBNZ’s December 2005 Monetary Policy
Statement allowed for a sharper correction of imbalances, with domestic demand growth and the
exchange rate falling more rapidly than in the baseline. Another possibility, although this seems
duration of the current parliament, an increase in pension benefits by 1 percentage point to 66 percent of
average wages.
7

Chapter II of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper discusses the macroeconomic risks posed by
external imbalances in advanced economies.

-8less likely now than at the time of the mission, is that the slowing in demand is deferred, in
which case a hard landing could occur later. In such a scenario, continued momentum in the
housing market would sustain strong demand in 2006, lifting inflation and resulting in additional
monetary tightening, followed by an eventual sharper correction in house prices and domestic
demand. The authorities also agreed that external shocks, such as further oil price increases or a
fall in U.S. economic growth, could trigger a harder landing.8
12.
Risks of a harder landing remain, but are mitigated by the strength of balance
sheets. Domestic demand could still weaken more sharply in the near term, but strong labor
income growth and fiscal stimulus cushion such downside risks. Moreover, the recent slowing in
demand and depreciation of the exchange rate appear to have diminished the risks of a later hard
landing. Although the housing market remains a source of some uncertainty, the authorities
consider that the banking sector is robust to a scenario with more significant house price
declines. In particular, the authorities have monitored developments in bank lending practices,
noting some expansion in loans with high loan-to-value ratios, or lower documentation of
debtor’s income, but consider that banks continue to allocate and price these risks appropriately
so that risks to bank capital have not increased substantively. Hence, the banking sector stress
tests conducted by the 2004 FSAP, which found a high degree of financial soundness, continue
to be germane. In addition, corporate and private sector balance sheets generally remain strong,
although households have likely become more sensitive to interest rate pressures. 9
B. Macroeconomic and Financial Sector Policies
13.
The government plans to raise spending
significantly over the medium term as gross debt
declines. Non-interest current spending is projected
to rise to 32½ percent of GDP in 2007/08, from
30 percent on average in the three years to 2004/05
(Table 4). This expansion is fully consistent with
meeting the government’s medium-term fiscal
objectives; the HYEFU projects the operating
balance to remain in surplus by 2 percent of GDP

The high degree of hedging of foreign exchange risks is a key factor reducing New Zealand’s economic
vulnerability, as seen in the robustness of the external debt position to shocks (see Figure 1). The
New Zealand authorities have also made contingency plans in the case of an avian flu pandemic, including
by actively working with financial institutions to promote adequate business continuity planning: see
http://www.moh.govt.nz/pandemicinfluenza and http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/crisismgmt/2176891.pdf.

6 percentage points of GDP over the same period.10
14.
The medium-term orientation of fiscal policy continues to serve New Zealand well.
The floating exchange rate regime provides New Zealand’s small open economy with a crucial
shock absorber against external events such as major swings in commodity prices, and has
permitted monetary policy to act as the primary lever to lean against cyclical developments. By
contrast, fiscal policy has provided support through the operation of automatic stabilizers, an
approach that has enhanced the predictability and prudence of fiscal policy, contributing to
macroeconomic stability. According to Treasury estimates, current fiscal plans imply an
estimated fiscal stimulus of about ½ percent of GDP in 2006/07 and 1¼ percent of GDP in
2007/08. Assuming the slowdown proceeds as projected, staff judged these plans to be consistent
with the authorities’ goal of managing the fiscal position to avoid exacerbating pressures in the
economy. Moreover, if the economy was to slow more rapidly, there is ample room for monetary
policy maneuver.
15.
Nonetheless, in certain circumstances, a degree of flexibility in fiscal policy might be
useful. Although the scenario now looks less likely, staff questioned whether there was scope for
running a somewhat tighter fiscal policy should domestic demand continue to be strong and
imbalances threaten to persist. In a situation with a continued high exchange rate, along with
high house prices and household indebtedness, relying solely on monetary policy to respond to
stronger demand could increase the risks of an eventual harder landing.11 Staff therefore
questioned whether there was any flexibility to defer part of the planned increase in spending
should this be necessary. Although the 2006/07 budget was largely finalized, the authorities
noted that they still had some scope to manage the NZ$1.9 billion in new spending planned for
2007/08. However, the Finance Minister saw little prospect that such flexibility would be needed
given the slowing economy.
16.
Ensuring “value for money” and sustained growth benefits from the additional
fiscal resources will be crucial. Staff welcomed the government’s plans to review expenditure
across departments and agencies at a time when relatively rapid growth in spending could
undermine expenditure efficiency in the public sector. Moreover, the government’s efforts to
maintain wage discipline in the public sector were particularly important given the relatively
tight labor market. Staff encouraged the government to focus the extra fiscal resources on
strengthening the drivers of sustained economic growth, in order to boost medium-term
economic prospects and enhance New Zealand’s capacity to manage long-run fiscal challenges.
In this respect, staff looked forward to the conclusions of the review of business taxation, which
has the overarching aim to encourage investment and promote productivity. Tax competitiveness

The key objective is to slowly reduce gross debt to below 20 percent of GDP before 2015, while
making contributions to the NZ Superannuation Fund, which are currently 1½ percent of GDP per annum.

Discretionary management of fiscal policy faces substantial practical difficulties, but may have a role in
the context of a high exchange rate or asset prices, see Ramakrishnan and Zhang, “Macroeconomic Policy

control. Staff agree that decisions to further
tighten policy would need to be carefully weighed, particularly given the monetary contraction
already in the pipeline. The RBNZ also did not expect to be in a position to ease policy in 2006,
because labor market and resource pressures would take some time to dissipate. Though an
earlier easing was possible, this would require a more rapid reduction in domestic inflation
pressures than currently projected.

18.
The authorities have welcomed the recent depreciation of the exchange rate. Staff
endorsed the RBNZ’s statements in late 2005 regarding the overly high level of the New Zealand
dollar, but agreed that the extent to which these statements had contributed to the subsequent
depreciation was unclear. Further currency declines may occur, and staff supported the RBNZ’s
position that it would look through the first-round inflation effects of a depreciation and not
tighten monetary policy as long as inflation expectations remain anchored. Experience during the
20 percent depreciation in mid-1998 to end-1999 suggests that expectations would be well
behaved in the context of a slowing economy.

Banking sector policies have progressed and a new supervisory framework for
non-bank financial institutions is being developed. An important step forward was the
agreement with Australia on the legislative foundations for enhanced home-host banking
supervision arrangements.13 Plans to conduct joint Australia-New Zealand crisis preparedness
exercises are one example of closer ongoing cooperation with the Australian Prudential
Regulatory Authority. The authorities have also continued to address issues highlighted by the
2004 FSAP.14 In this context, the capacity to conduct stress tests, particularly in relation to
households’ capacity to service debt, is being strengthened. The RBNZ’s November 2005

The key elements of the legislative changes proposed by the Trans-Tasman Council on Banking
Supervision are described at: http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/finstab/banking/supervision/2420258.html.
14

The RBNZ has finalized its policy on outsourcing and issues of local bank incorporation have been
resolved. Lender of last resort and failure management policies have been further operationalized, and
disclosure requirements have been expanded to cover the quality of large exposures.

- 11 Financial Stability Report points to the general soundness of the financial sector, but raises
concerns about the robustness of some finance companies, especially those exposed to property
development. Although the macro-economic risks are limited by the small scale of these
companies, staff supported the authorities’ decision to establish a new supervisory framework for
non-bank financial institutions.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
New Zealand’s economy has slowed after a period of strong growth, and while the
current account deficit widened in 2005, the economy has started to rebalance. Net exports
were undermined by the historically high exchange rate in 2005, which was supported by large
capital inflows associated with exceptional foreign demand for New Zealand dollar denominated
bonds in a world of low international interest rates. Hence growth slowed to 2¼ percent even as
domestic demand remained strong with a revival in the housing market, and the external current
account deficit rose to 9 percent of GDP. At the same time, with resources tightly stretched and
global oil prices increasing, inflation edged up to the top end of the 1–3 percent medium-term
target range. More recently, domestic demand appears to have slowed and the exchange rate has
depreciated significantly. While growth is expected to be sluggish in 2006, an export-led
recovery is expected in 2007, with the current account deficit narrowing over the medium term.
21.
Budgetary plans cushion downside risks to the outlook. The Half Year Economic and
Fiscal Update projects the operating surplus to decline to 2 percent of GDP by 2007/08, from
4 percent of GDP in 2005/06. This decline is fully consistent with meeting the government’s
prudent medium-term fiscal objectives, and the associated fiscal stimulus should not exacerbate
pressures in the economy given the expected pace of slowing in activity. In the case of a sharperthan-expected downturn, monetary policy provides the first line of defense within
New Zealand’s well-established macroeconomic framework, while fiscal policy should
contribute through the full play of the automatic stabilizers.
Monetary policy should continue to steer a steady course in the near term.
Underlying inflation is expected to decline as resource pressures ease, and given the lagged
effects of previous tightening still to come, the current pause in monetary policy tightening is
appropriate. However, with the labor market remaining tight, there is little room to cut rates in
the near term. By contrast, there is ample room for maneuver if the economy slows more
abruptly. The recent depreciation of the exchange rate is welcome, and with the slowing
economy anchoring inflation expectations, monetary policy is well placed to “look through” a
temporary rise in headline CPI inflation arising from a decline in the currency.
22.

Recent and prospective advances in the financial sector regulatory framework will
further enhance financial and hence macroeconomic stability. The financial sector is sound,
but close monitoring of households’ debt service capacity will need to continue given the rise in
household indebtedness. The agreement with Australia regarding arrangements for enhanced
home-host supervision is particularly welcome as close cooperation with bank supervisors across
the Tasman will be essential, especially in the case of banks experiencing distress. A new
regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions will take time to establish, but will
facilitate the further development of New Zealand’s financial system and promote growth.
23.

24.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with New Zealand take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

looking for high yields have been the
main buyers of these offshore NZD bonds, which are called “Eurokiwis” or “Uridashis” when issued in
Japan. These retail investors are buyers of NZD dollars when they purchase the bonds and sellers of NZD
when the bonds mature. Thus the Eurokiwi and Uridashi markets provide support to the NZD during periods
of positive net issuance.
Debt instruments were a major source of external financing in 2004-05, led by New Zealand banks’
funding of mortgage lending, typically by tapping international capital markets in U.S. dollars (USD). The
highly liquid swap market in New Zealand dollars (NZD) enables banks to manage their exchange rate and
interest rate risks. Most new mortgage loans have interest rates that are fixed, yet New Zealand banks tend
to borrow at floating rates. To match liabilities and assets, the banks use cross-currency swaps, selling the
USD funds they have raised for NZD, and at the same time, exchanging their USD floating rate debt for
NZD debt with a fixed interest rate. The swap rate that banks pay on the NZD debt represents the marginal
cost of New Zealand dollar funding for banks and is used to price fixed-rate mortgages.
The outstanding stock of NZD denominated Eurokiwi and Uridashi bonds is historically high and
significant maturities are coming due. Net issues of offshore NZD denominated bonds were
NZ$23 billion in 2005, and the outstanding stock rose to NZ$50.2 billion at end-February 2006, which is
about one third as large as the foreign debt owed by New Zealanders. Maturities on these bonds are
estimated at NZ$9 billion in 2006 and NZ$17 billion in 2007. In the past, a build up in maturities has
unwound in orderly fashion with net offshore issuance of NZD denominated bonds declining in tandem with
easing credit demand in New Zealand; however, maturity volumes are notably larger in this cycle.

ANNEX II

NEW ZEALAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The New Zealand authorities publish an array of high-quality statistics which are fully
adequate for surveillance purposes. The frequency, timeliness, and availability of common
indicators required for Fund surveillance are summarized in the attached table. Economic and
financial data are readily available electronically from the websites of Statistics New Zealand,
the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the New Zealand Treasury.
The authorities are continuing to enhance data quality and expand the range of data
products available. For example, Statistics New Zealand has undertaken a range of projects to
improve balance of payments statistics in the areas of travel debits, trade in other services
(services excluding transport, travel, and insurance), and debt securities transactions. To increase
the range of information available, investigations into inward foreign affiliate trade statistics and
ultimate investors using available data have been undertaken and results published. The New
Zealand Treasury is leading a project to publish fiscal data consistent with the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) and regularly submits annual general government
sector data for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook. Stocks of financial assets and liabilities are
reported for all levels of government, and related flows are reported for levels except local
government.
New Zealand has made further progress toward becoming a subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). All SDDS requirements are being met for monetary data, and
timeliness requirements for central government fiscal data were met in 2005. While external debt
data continue to be collected and published in official series on the basis of residual maturity,
estimates of external debt by original maturity—as required by SDDS—are prepared. The
remaining issues are the requirement for publication of an industrial production index, redissemination of 3- and 6-month forward exchange rates, and the timeliness of local government
data, where the authorities are exploring the feasibility of earlier publication.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
New Zealand
On April 28, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with New Zealand.1
Background
Following a vigorous expansion in recent years, a cyclical slowing in New Zealand’s economy
commenced in 2005, with growth declining to 2¼ percent. Economic growth had averaged
4¼ percent annually in 2002–04, with domestic demand boosted by large migration inflows,
wealth effects from rising house prices, and income effects from high commodity prices.
Unemployment fell to 3½ percent, but resources became increasingly stretched. In this
environment, CPI inflation rose slightly above the medium-term target range of 1 to 3 percent by
end-2005, although higher international oil prices also played a role.
The slowdown in 2005 fell most heavily on the tradable sector, and domestic demand growth
remained strong for much of the year, hence the external current account deficit rose to 9 percent
of GDP, double its 20–year average. The New Zealand dollar reached a post-float record high in
December 2005, supported by large capital inflows associated with exceptional demand for New
Zealand dollar denominated bonds from retail investors in Japan and Europe. The appreciated
exchange rate was a key contributor to the decline in export volumes in 2005 despite strong
global growth. At the same time, domestic demand was sustained by an unexpected revival of the
housing market in 2005, with annual house price inflation of about 15 percent facilitated by
mortgage rates remaining relatively low despite rising official interest rates.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

Monetary policy has been on hold so far in 2006, after being tightened in 2005, while the fiscal
position remains strong. The official cash rate (OCR) was raised by 75 basis points during 2005
to 7¼ percent. The central government’s operating surplus before revaluations and accounting
changes (OBERAC) climbed to 5½ percent of GDP in 2004/05 (fiscal year ending in June), and
gross government debt declined to 23 percent of GDP. The OBERAC surplus is expected to fall
to 4 percent of GDP in 2005/06 (excluding write-downs of student loans), partly reflecting an
expansion in support for low income families.
Domestic demand has slowed more recently and the exchange rate has declined substantially.
The downturn in domestic demand is expected to continue, reflecting the upward repricing of
mortgage rates in 2006, and also owing to an expected leveling out of house prices. Hence
growth is likely to be sluggish in 2006, at around 1 percent. Nonetheless, growth is projected to
recover to about 2 percent in 2007, led by exports, which will benefit from the adjustment
underway in the exchange rate, which has so far retraced 16 percent on a trade-weighted basis
from its December 2005 peak.
With slower growth easing resource pressures, inflation is expected to moderate, allowing an
eventual easing in monetary policy. A substantial narrowing of the external current account
deficit should occur over time as the economy rebalances. In the medium term, growth is
expected to return to 3 to 3½ percent, underpinned by the extensive structural reforms
undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, and the sustained implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the New Zealand authorities on their continued implementation
of sound macroeconomic policies during a challenging phase in the business cycle. Directors
noted that following a number of years of strong economic growth, New Zealand’s economy
slowed in 2005. The external current account deficit widened markedly as the exchange rate
appreciated, and with resources stretched, a strong housing market, and higher oil prices,
inflation edged to the top of the medium-term target range. Nonetheless, inflation expectations
going forward remain well contained, and underlying inflation is expected to decline as resource
pressures ease. Accordingly, Directors agreed that the current stance of macroeconomic
policies should be appropriately supportive of a soft landing for the economy, although
downside risks remain.
Looking ahead, Directors noted that the recent depreciation of the exchange rate will help
rebalance demand in the economy and contribute subsequently to a pick-up in growth.
They also considered that the government’s budgetary plans will help cushion downside risks to
the outlook. Directors fully endorsed the government’s farsighted conduct of fiscal policy, which
has allowed the operating surplus to rise substantially during the years of strong growth.
The expected decline in the operating balance in coming years is consistent with the
government’s prudent medium-term fiscal objectives, as the balance will remain in surplus, and
net assets will continue to increase relative to GDP. Directors judged that the associated fiscal

stimulus should not exacerbate inflationary pressures in view of the expected slowing in activity.
In the case of a sharper-than-expected downturn, Directors supported allowing full play of the
automatic fiscal stabilizers.
Directors considered that following the significant tightening over the past two years, monetary
policy should continue to steer a steady course in the near term. They regarded the current
pause in official interest rate adjustments to be appropriate. Directors also considered monetary
policy to be well placed to accommodate the one-off effects on headline inflation from the recent
exchange rate depreciation and the jump in international oil prices, particularly as the slowing
economy helps anchor inflation expectations. At the same time, with the labor market remaining
tight, they saw little room to cut interest rates in the near term, but noted that there is scope for
monetary policy easing if the economy slows more abruptly.
Directors welcomed the recent advances in the financial sector regulatory framework, which will
help to entrench financial and macroeconomic stability. They considered New Zealand’s
financial sector to be fundamentally sound, and supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen
the monitoring of households’ debt service capacity, in view of the notable rise in household
indebtedness in recent years. Directors welcomed the agreement with Australia to lay the
legislative foundations for enhanced cooperation in banking supervision between the two
countries. They also supported the government’s decision to develop a new regulatory
framework for non-bank financial institutions.

Statement by Oh Jong Nam, Executive Director for New Zealand
and Andrew Blazey, Advisor to Executive Director
April 28, 2006
Key Points
•

After a period of sustained buoyancy, the economy entered a period of slow growth in
the second half of 2005. Year-on-year GDP growth is expected to moderate further over
2006 before rebounding in 2007 and 2008.

•

The period of slower growth, driven by an easing in domestic demand growth, is
expected to see an easing in underlying inflation pressures. This combined with a
stronger contribution from net exports on the back an expected decline in the exchange
rate is expected to result in a decline in the current account deficit.

•

Following the re-election of a Labour-led government in August 2005, key fiscal policy
settings are unchanged with operating surpluses expected to decline from recent high
levels to levels more consistent with long-term fiscal objectives.

•

While capacity pressures are now easing, high and rising oil prices and the depreciation
of the exchange rate still represent risks to inflation expectations and pose ongoing
challenges for monetary policy. Official interest rate cuts are not expected for some
time.

•

Eurokiwi and Uridashi issuance is likely to diminish this year as interest rate differentials
narrow. Maturing issues are likely to be handled smoothly, but could result in a further
fall in the exchange rate.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
New Zealand has experienced a sustained period of economic buoyancy over the first half of
this decade, with real GDP growth averaging 3.5 percent (2.3 percent in per capita terms).
High commodity prices, a period of exchange rate undervaluation, low interest rates and an
unusually strong net inward migration were amongst the initial catalysts of robust growth.
More recently, rapid house price growth appears to have supported strong consumption
expenditure alongside strong labour income growth - best estimates suggests housing equity
withdrawal of the order of 3-4 percent of disposable income.
The period of strong growth has put considerable pressure on resources. Unemployment has
fallen markedly notwithstanding rising labour force participation. At 3.7 percent at the end
of 2005, unemployment was slightly off its multi-decade low. Other indicative measures of
capacity utilization reached multi-decade highs during the first half of last year.

-2There is now clear evidence, however, that the economy has entered a period of slower
growth. A cyclical slowing of the economy has been expected for some time, but slower
economic growth finally took hold only in the second half of 2005, and for domestic demand
only in the last quarter. Real GDP growth of 2.2 percent for 2005 as a whole masked a
marked divergence in performance between the first half of the year and the second.
Domestic demand is slowing and net migration (which is both large and quite variable by
OECD country standards) fell to 8,220 people for the year to February 2006 after reaching a
high of 42,540 people in the year to May 2003. Residential building activity has slowed,
although the housing market, while slowing, remains active. As the housing market moves
to lower activity levels this source of support for consumer demand will dissipate.
My authorities expect year-on-year growth to slow further over 2006 led by an easing in
domestic demand growth, before rebounding in 2007 and 2008 to trend or above trend
growth rates. The depreciation of the New Zealand dollar, coupled with strong global
demand, is expected to support an export-led recovery in GDP growth, although lags in the
agricultural sector are among the factors that mean the full benefit of the lower exchange rate
will not be seen until well into next year. By most estimates, the output gap is likely to have
closed by around the middle of this year.
The New Zealand authorities share the views of the staff that the current slowdown in growth
is cyclical in nature. They continue to view New Zealand’s trend growth performance as
robust, and the Government has an ongoing policy agenda to ensure that remains the case.
At close to 9 percent of GDP, the current account deficit is higher than at the time of the
2005 consultation. The increase in the deficit reflects a combination of factors. The cyclical
strength in the economy, in particular, the strength of domestic demand growth has been a
key driver, but the rise in global oil prices and a poor 2004/05 agricultural production season
has also played a part (of the order of 2 to 3 percent of GDP).
Some drivers of the increase are not necessarily a cause for concern. The strong business
investment cycle has resulted in high demand for imported capital goods. Similarly, in
response to the strong domestic currency in 2004-05, consumer purchases of imported
durable goods contributed to the high level of imports. Further, profits and dividends paid on
foreign investment in New Zealand have been growing. All of these have strong cyclical
characteristics.
Despite a couple of years of large current deficits there has not been any dramatic
deterioration in New Zealand’s net international investment position (IIP), with the IIP and
net debt position having not moved much over the last decade.
Most recently, there has been no evidence of any unease among investors regarding either the
level of the current account or the net international investment position (for example, bond
spreads to major markets have narrowed this year, consistent with the proposition that the
exchange rate fell as short-term monetary policy expectations changed).

-3However, the authorities acknowledge that the deficit, at its current level, is not sustainable
in the medium-term. The decline in the exchange rate is seen as part of the adjustment
process. The easing in domestic demand, when combined with stronger net exports, is
expected to reduce the current account deficit. It is worth noting that the current account and
exchange rate went through very large adjustments in the late 1990s with no adverse affects
on overall economic performance.
Macroeconomic Policy
My New Zealand authorities acknowledge that recent economic performance and the current
cyclical downturn makes for a challenging policy making environment.
For some time now, the authorities have been coping with a delicate balancing act. On the
one hand, the pressure of resources pointed to a tighter stance on macroeconomic policy. On
the other hand, forward indicators suggested that growth and the pressures themselves were
likely to ease. The next year will also require similarly complex judgments to be made.
Fiscal Policy
Following the re-election of a Labour-led government in August 2005, fiscal policy settings
are largely unchanged. Reflecting decisions taken in the 2004 and 2005 Budgets, latest
forecasts show the Government’s underlying measure of the operating surplus is expected to
fall from around 4 percent of GDP in the current year, to around 3½ percent in the 2006/07
financial year and 2½ percent a year later. Although not the prime motivation, the forecast
fiscal stimulus in 2006 and 2007 is expected to have a cushioning effect on the economy.
Preparing for the future impact of population ageing is the main objective of fiscal policy.
The Government has already implemented initiatives such as the New Zealand
Superannuation Fund (2001) and more recently the Public-sector superannuation scheme
(2004) to facilitate individual saving. With assets of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund
taken into account, the government is expected to move into a net financial asset position
around the end of the year.
A new initiative, KiwiSaver (a voluntary savings scheme for all employees using individual
accounts, administered by Inland Revenue) is due to come into operation early in 2007.
KiwiSaver is designed to facilitate a change in the savings behaviour of individuals and to
complement New Zealand Superannuation (the universal pay-as-you-go pensions system).
The initiative is to be complemented by changes to the tax system to improve the taxation of
investments in managed funds.

-4Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
New Zealand’s inflation target is to keep CPI inflation between 1 and 3 percent, on average,
over the medium term. In response to a sustained period of pressure on resources, linked to a
period of strong commodity prices and the largest boom in house prices since the early
1970s, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) gradually increased the Official Cash
Rate from 5 percent at the start of 2004 to the current rate of 7.25 percent - with the two
most recent 25 point increases occurring in late 2005.
A downward sloping yield curve has encouraged most mortgage borrowers to shift from
floating rate mortgages (closely linked to changes in the OCR itself) to mortgages with
interest rates fixed for 1-3 year terms. This has slowed the impact on households of the
rising official interest rates, although as mortgage terms are renewed, debt service costs are
increasing, contributing to an easing of consumption. The RBNZ has indicated that there is
little room for easing monetary policy at this time, as inflationary pressures, built up over
several years, remain. In particular, pressures in the labour market remain intense, and
inflation expectations remain uncomfortably high. At a time when inflation is above 3
percent, direct price effects of the lower exchange rate and higher oil prices pose some risks
for inflation expectations, the Reserve Bank hopes to be able to “look through” the direct
price effects.
The recent depreciation of the New Zealand dollar was not unexpected given the extent to
which the dollar had been overvalued in 2004-05 - on a trade-weighted basis many estimates
suggested that the exchange rate was 20-30 percent above medium-term fair value. The fall
in the exchange rate appears to have been triggered primarily by data that strengthened
market perceptions that the stance of monetary policy would be eased, and the OCR cut, this
year. The weaker exchange rate itself represents some easing in monetary conditions, and
acts as less of a drag on economic activity over the next few years. Despite the depreciation
over the past three months, the real effective exchange rate remains approximately 9 percent
above its 20-year average value.
As staff note, retail New Zealand dollar bond issuance abroad (the Eurokiwi and Uridashi
market) has been on a very large scale in 2005 in particular, and has been an important part
of the mechanism by which the continuing strong demand for housing credit has been met.
At a time, when most global interest rates were relatively low, New Zealand’s interest rates
appeared particularly attractive and this demand exacerbated the upward pressure on the
exchange rate last year. The stock of such issues is now large (around NZ$50 billion, or
around one third of GDP), and most issues are for terms of 2-3 years. As credit demand
eases and interest differentials are less attractive, my authorities expect that new issuance will
continue to slow and net maturities will occur. Past experience (in the late 1990s) suggests
that the adjustment is likely to be reasonably orderly, given that banks themselves are very
well-hedged, and that any adjustment will occur largely in the level of exchange rate itself.
My authorities are of the view that New Zealand’s macroeconomic framework has played a
key role in the improved economic performance seen over the last decade, but they are not
complacent. With this in mind, the Secretary to the Treasury and the Governor of the

-5Reserve Bank commissioned their officials to examine whether there were additional tools
that could be applied to lend support to monetary policy in stabilizing the macro economy
and reduce pressure on the exchange rate – the so-called Supplementary Stabilization
Instruments project. While a number of areas of further work were identified, no immediately
options for implementation were identified.
Banking and Financial Sectors
The New Zealand financial system is well placed to manage a slowdown in the economy.
Stress tests from the 2004 Financial Sector Assessment Program and independent exercises
have demonstrated that New Zealand’s financial system is resilient to a wide range of
economic and financial shocks.
In the past 12 months, the RBNZ completed two initiatives that strengthen the durability of
the supervisory framework: the completion of the local incorporation policy requirement for
major banks and deposit-taking smaller banks, and an outsourcing policy to ensure that core
liquidity, payment and transaction services can be maintained in times of stress. In addition,
the RBNZ has been working to implement Basel II. The regulatory capital requirements for
banks will be calculated under Basel II from January 2008 and the work is being coordinated with foreign supervisors (especially APRA the Australian home supervisor for the
four largest banks in New Zealand). A multi-agency process is currently underway
reviewing the regulation of the non-bank financial sector and a preliminary decision was
made by the government late last year that there is a case for extending prudential
supervision to some classifications of non-bank financial institutions. Further, the RBNZ,
Treasury and other government agencies have largely completed substantial work in planning
to manage the potentially serious economic risks associated with a possible bird flu
pandemic.
