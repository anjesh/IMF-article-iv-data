MALTA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Malta
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Ranil Salgado
August 5, 2009
Executive Summary
Background: While the financial sector has so far weathered the global turmoil relatively
unscathed, the real economy has been decelerating since the last quarter of 2008. However,
inflation failed to moderate, while the fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2008, owing to oneoffs and spending slippages. The current account deficit improved to 5½ percent of GDP.
Challenges: The immediate goal for fiscal policy should be to mitigate the negative spillovers on
activity from the global crisis without compromising the already fragile public finances. To
preserve competitiveness, Malta will have to complete its structural reform agenda as it emerges
from the downturn.
Staff views: The fiscal stance for 2009 is appropriate, and stimulus withdrawal should be limited
in 2010. However, fiscal consolidation should resume forcefully once the recovery is established,
and the fiscal framework should be strengthened. Supervision needs to keep up with the rapidly
expanding financial sector, and banks should set capital buffers and provisions more proactively,
while labor market reforms and reduced state involvement in the economy would support
competitiveness for the post-crisis.
Authorities’ views: The authorities’ short-term priority is to help the corporate sector withstand
the crisis, with a view to minimize job losses. They nonetheless aim to cut the fiscal deficit in line
with EU recommendations, predicated on a more favorable outlook than that of the staff. Though
committed to medium-term fiscal consolidation, they have not articulated underlying measures to
achieve it. They credited conservative lending practices and effective supervision for the benign
impact of the global crisis on Maltese banks.
Mission team: C. Allard (Head), L. Lusinyan and V. Herzberg (all EUR) visited Malta on June
11–22, 2009 and held discussions with the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank
of Malta, and other key central bank and government officials, as well as representatives of the
private sector and the opposition, social partners, and academics.

I. CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS1
1.
Malta’s economy is facing its first test following
successful EU entry in 2004 and euro adoption in 2008.
Largely as the outcome of liberalizing reforms, Malta
experienced a sustained expansion starting in the middle of
the decade, underpinned by diversification to higher valueadded exports. But the unfavorable external environment is
now challenging the economy’s resilience, threatening to
unravel past efforts at fiscal consolidation, and possibly
holding back the reform impetus, even as the convergence
process remains incomplete.

2.
The global economic crisis has started affecting Malta’s real sector. Following
annual average growth of 3½ percent in 2005–07, the expansion of the economy slowed to
2½ percent in 2008, hampered by declining trade flows and investment as Malta’s main
trade partners entered severe recession (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1). Semiconductor
production and tourism, accounting respectively for 15 and close to 25 percent of GDP,
were particularly affected. Private consumption, resilient so far, also weakened in the
beginning of 2009, as employment prospects deteriorated. However, activities in services—
into which Malta’s economy substantially diversified over the last few years—continued to
hold.
3.
The labor market was resilient before worsening at the end of 2008 (Figure 3).
Job creation remained strong, driven by the services industries. Average compensation per
employee rose 2¼ percent throughout the year, exceeding the across-the-board mandatory
indexation to the cost of living (COLA), even though labor productivity gains tapered off. In
particular, public wages, covered by a multi-annual collective agreement, increased by
4¼ percent. More recently, however, labor market conditions started deteriorating, with the
unemployment rate inching up since the fall of 2008, to reach 7.1 percent in May 2009.
4.
Inflation has remained stubbornly high, topping the euro area since October 2008
and reaching 2¾ percent in June 2009 (Figure 4, Box). While there does not appear to have
been any notable inflation boost due to euro adoption in January 2008, the positive output
gap likely played a role. Additionally, the authorities increased utility tariffs in October
2008, food price inflation failed to moderate, reflecting an imperfect pass-through of the
decline in international food prices, and prices in the hospitality sector remained buoyant
until the recent deterioration in tourism. In contrast, housing price inflation continued
moderating throughout 2008, with prices falling by about 10 percent in the first quarter of
2009, in part because of oversupply in certain segments of the market.

Box – Inflation
Inflation in Malta has been the highest in the euro area since October 2008. While inflation has trended
downward in the euro area since mid-2008, prices continued accelerating in Malta until recently. This
development followed a period from mid-2006 to end-2007, when conversely, inflation was more moderate in
Malta than in the euro area.

The inflation differential with the euro area has been particularly marked for food, fuel and hospitality
prices, related to idiosyncratic developments on the island:


Utility services are governed by administered prices. Throughout 2007 and until October 2008, the
authorities postponed the adjustment of these prices to oil prices hikes on the global markets, keeping
energy prices artificially low in Malta. However, in the fall of 2008, prices were adjusted up, contributing to
the build-up in the inflation differential as the euro area, conversely, was then starting to experience a
deceleration in energy prices. With the authorities adjusting utility prices down again in April 2009, the
discrepancy with the euro area in energy price inflation is expected to fade in the near future.



Hospitality price moderation throughout 2007 reversed in 2008, as new high scale hotels opened up and
tourism picked up, following the arrival of low-cost airlines. These price fluctuations were magnified by the
relatively large share of this segment in the price basket, at 17 percent against 9 percent in the euro area.
Looking forward, with tourism prospects rapidly deteriorating, price moderation is likely to resume.



Food prices remained surprisingly buoyant in 2008 despite the generalized downward correction in global
food commodity prices. Importers and domestic retailers failed to pass though this decline, possibly
highlighting a lack of competition in the market.

9
More generally, the euro changeover did not affect Malta’s inflation more than in the neighboring
countries; rather, inflation responded to the positive output gap in 2008. The authorities had put in place
effective price monitoring prior to the currency changeover in January 2008, and the inflation differential with
the euro area in Malta in 2008 remained in line with what Greece, Spain and Portugal experienced in 2002 and
Slovenia in 2007: more than a changeover effect per se, it reflects the positive output gap at that time in Malta.

amounted to 1 percent of
GDP because of larger energy subsidies in the context of rising oil prices in the first half of
the year and significant slippage on the wage bill and on spending on goods and services,
partly related to the health care sector and to the elections in March 2008. Reversing the
downward trend, public debt inched up to 63 percent of GDP and the sovereign spread
vis-à-vis the German 10-year bond rose in line with regional peers, to reach about 110 basis
points in May 2009. So far, the authorities have managed to finance the deficit without
difficulties. Owing to the fiscal slippages, the European Commission reinitiated the
excessive deficit procedure for Malta in May 2009 and recommended to bring the deficit
below the Maastricht reference value by 2010.

6.
The authorities passed a stimulus package in the 2009 budget. Measures include
support to the manufacturing and tourism sectors, as well as increased public investment
financed through higher EU fund absorption. The personal income tax regime was also
modified to increase incentives to work, in particular for women. The overall package
amounts to 1½ percent of GDP, two thirds of which would be financed by EU grants. Since
early 2009, the authorities have also provided additional support to a small number of ailing
manufacturing companies based on criteria related to investment and training plans.
7.
The impact of the financial market turmoil on Maltese banks has so far
remained contained (Figure 6, Appendix). The banking sector has expanded rapidly in
recent years to over seven times GDP; most of this growth, however, has been driven by
internationally oriented banks with traditionally little interaction with the domestic
economy.2 Still, domestically oriented banks have been protected in the crisis by their
limited exposure to structured financial products, a traditional retail funding model, and
conservative lending policies. Credit has proved resilient, with loans to the resident private
sector growing 10 percent in 2008, as banks continued to fund their operations mainly
through domestic deposits. No government intervention to shore up capital or liquidity has
been necessary to date. However, some institutions suffered large valuation losses on their
security portfolio, resulting in negative returns in 2008. At around 50 percent of GDP,
household indebtedness is below euro area average, but it has been trending up, and the
share of nonperforming loans (NPL) remains high in domestically oriented banks.
The current account deficit improved to 5½ percent of GDP in 2008 (Figure 7,
8.
Table 3). The goods balance worsened, as foreign demand faltered, most notably for
semiconductors, whose export growth turned negative in nominal terms in the fall of 2007.
Conversely, thanks to past efforts at export diversification, net services exports improved,
led by business services and the remote gaming industry. Imports volumes slumped, as
investment gradually dried up throughout 2008. Against this backdrop, competitiveness is
deemed to have remained broadly stable. Moreover, the current account deficit continued to
be more than financed by significant, yet declining, FDI net inflows. Portfolio and other
investment flows remain heavily influenced by operations of internationally oriented banks.
9.
The reform-oriented Nationalist Party was reelected in March 2008 with a
narrow parliamentary majority. Nonetheless, with the economy in recession and euro
membership secured, the government’s immediate priority has shifted from liberalizing
initiatives and fiscal consolidation to measures to support the economy.

2

Out of 23 banks, 13 are locally incorporated subsidiaries of foreign institutions and three are foreign branches.
Only seven banks, dubbed domestically oriented banks—accounting for 30 percent of total assets—play a role
in domestic intermediation. Most of the remaining 16 internationally oriented banks, settled in Malta for tax
optimization purposes, use funding from their overseas banking groups to finance assets outside Malta.

II. OUTLOOK
10.
With recession affecting all main trade partners, growth in Malta is projected
to turn negative in 2009. Staff projects activity to contract by about 2 percent in 2009, with
the output gap turning negative and remaining so until 2014. As foreshadowed by the most

conditions. The authorities concurred with

2008

2010
staff that, in the context of the global crisis,
potential growth would soften going forward.
11.
Inflation is projected to moderate while the current account deficit would
stabilize, with long-term sustainability risks mitigated by the positive net international
investment position. With the output gap turning negative and world commodity prices
lower, inflation would fall to 2¾ percent in 2009 from 4¾ percent in 2008, and the current
account deficit would stabilize at 5¾ percent of GDP. Staff’s external sustainability analysis
points to a strengthening in the net external creditor position as net FDI inflows would
continue to more than finance the external deficit (Tables 4 and 5). Nonetheless, gross
external liabilities stood at over 550 percent of GDP at end-2008, owing to strong growth in
recent years in nonresident deposits held by internationally oriented banks; while these are
backed by matching assets, the associated external vulnerability reinforces the need for
fiscal and financial buffers to anchor investors’ confidence in Malta’s small open economy.
12.
Staff sees clear risks to the recovery in 2010. First, it is conditional on a gradual
improvement in trade partners’ growth, which could fail to materialize. Risks also stem
from potentially tighter credit conditions, as the economic slowdown inevitably leads to a
deterioration in banks’ asset quality. Finally, in a context of more depressed global demand,
the revival in activity could be further jeopardized if the strategy of export diversification
were to falter for lack of foreign investor appetite. Risks to inflation are more balanced:
persistent food price increases could continue to spur inflation, at least temporarily;
conversely, a more severe slowdown in activity, especially for export-oriented sectors,
could put downward pressures on prices.

13.
The authorities’ outlook is more benign. In particular, they saw private
consumption remaining more resilient, supported by wage and credit growth, and forecast a
stronger pick up in corporate investment going forward. However, they agreed with staff
that risks were on the downside and acknowledged that some downward adjustment to their
projection could not be excluded as further macroeconomic updates came in.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
While responding to the crisis has become the authorities’ top priority, the
structural reform agenda will need to regain preeminence. Key elements include:
resuming fiscal consolidation once the recovery is established to build buffers against future
external shocks and as the population ages; further strengthening the financial supervisory
framework to keep up with the rapidly expanding sector; and completing the labor and
product market reforms so as to further the move towards higher value-added activities.
A. Preserving Fiscal Sustainability In A Recession
15.
The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow marginally to 4½ percent of GDP in
2009. However, excluding the substantial one-offs of 2008, the balance would deteriorate by
over ½ percentage point of GDP. Slippages, in particular on utility subsidies, contributed to
the fiscal relaxation in 2008; the authorities have curtailed them, and the structural
consolidation for 2009 is projected to reach ¾ percentage point of GDP. Still, the authorities
are letting automatic stabilizers play in full, providing support to domestic demand of about
1½ percentage points of GDP. In addition, staff estimates that EU funding of the stimulus
measures would represent ½ percent of GDP of additional support to demand. Based on
somewhat stronger real growth forecasts, the authorities’ fiscal projections are more
optimistic, with a decline in the deficit of 1 percentage point compared to 2008,
underpinned primarily by higher assumption of direct tax collection.

16
16.
Staff agreed with the thrust of the authorities’ fiscal policy for 2009. The
economic downturn called for a fiscal response to support activity, and the focus on public
investment in the 2009 stimulus package is apposite, given infrastructure needs and its
potentially high multiplier. While letting the automatic stabilizers play fully, the authorities
are making fiscal room by cutting inefficiently targeted subsidies on utilities. In addition,
boosting EU fund absorption prevents an excessive deterioration in the public finances and
current account. For 2010, staff recommended only moderate structural consolidation, to the
tune of ½ percentage point of GDP, so as not to jeopardize the modest recovery.
17.
Measures taken to support enterprises raise some concerns, however. The
measures implemented in the spring of 2009 to co-finance investment and training allowed
for rapid and targeted support. Staff noted, however, that they could become entrenched and
costly if the crisis continues, and that, in some cases, they might only postpone required
restructuring. More recently, the authorities announced that they would tolerate late tax
payments from companies with cash flow difficulties and also invited hotels and banks to
work on debt restructuring. Staff underscored that, even if not widespread, these steps
would risk undermining tax compliance and contract enforcement. The authorities agreed
with the assessment but stressed that, given the small size of the economy and risk of
spillovers, these measures had been necessary to shore up confidence.
18.
All concurred that fiscal consolidation needed to resume forcefully once the
recovery was established. The authorities are committed to consolidation and have taken
significant steps with respect to the shipyards and the utility subsidies. However, staff
stressed that these measures alone would fail to achieve the necessary consolidation: under
an unchanged-policy scenario, the headline deficit would fall to the 3 percent mark only in
2013, with public debt topping 70 percent of GDP (Table 6). To secure a quick reversal in
the debt trend and to build enough buffer against future shocks, a stronger consolidation
path—with a structural effort of at least 2/3 percentage point of GDP per year over 2011–
2014, more than double the current scenario—would be appropriate. Thus, staff urged the
government to promptly identify commensurate underlying measures. The authorities

agreed that the adjustment should be essentially expenditure based, as increasing the tax
burden, already around 40 percent, would run against their competitiveness strategy.
Additional tax cuts should be implemented only as cost savings materialize and compliance
improves.
19.
Determined action on the expenditure side is required. The rigid spending
structure—wages, transfers and interest payments account for more than two thirds of
spending—hinders adjustment to shocks and crowds out capital outlays. Health care and
education absorb about 30 percent of public spending and also stand out as areas needing
rationalization. The authorities have so far relied on attrition to reduce public employment;
staff called for a more proactive approach, based on a general review of public services
needs to identify areas for retrenchment. Similarly, consideration should be given to
market-based measures, both to provide incentives to rein in demand for public services and
to increase the efficiency of supply. Streamlining social transfers and subsidies through
broader means-testing of benefits will also be important. As an illustration, staff estimates
that the adjustment scenario could be achieved with an annual real growth in primary
current expenditure of ½ percent over 2011–14, as opposed to 1¾ percent in the current
scenario, with the wage bill growing at 1 percent versus 2 percent in the current scenario.
20.
Long-term projections reinforce the call for decisive consolidation and health
care reform. The EU-level Ageing Working Group’s most recent estimates take into
account the 2006 pension reform, which introduced an incremental increase in the
retirement age, but also a partial indexation of benefits to wages.3 These estimates suggest
that public spending on pensions would almost double in 2060 to reach 13½ percent of
GDP—one of the highest percentage changes in the EU-27—and that health care spending
would sizably increase, too (Figure 5).
21.
Strengthening the fiscal framework will also be essential, in view of the
necessary consolidation. Despite the relatively good track record until 2007, recent
spending slippages underscore the need to strengthen budget execution discipline,
expenditure reporting and recording, and accountability. The authorities concurred and
pointed to the initial steps undertaken to increase oversight of spending ministries. Staff also
recommended informing fiscal projections with independent forecasts—possibly by
expanding the mandate of the National Audit Office—and securing a stronger involvement
of parliament, through medium-term targets committed to in the annual budget act and
strengthened accountability of the government.

B. Maintaining Financial Stability
22.
Although Malta’s banks have withstood the global financial turmoil reasonably
well so far, profitability is coming under pressure (Figure 8, Tables 7 and 8). Capital
ratios, though declining, have remained well above regulatory minima. In addition, with a
loan-to-deposit ratio at 80 percent at end-2008, domestically oriented banks have been
protected from shocks in global wholesale markets by their reliance on deposits. However,
as the global interbank market dried up, exposure of foreign-owned subsidiaries to their
parent company increased sizably, and leverage rose. On the whole, vulnerabilities have
increased in the wake of the financial turmoil, and the authorities agreed that profitability
would remain under pressure from lower volumes, a narrowing in interest margins, and
rising nonperforming loans as the economy weakens.
Exposure to the real estate market appears to pose the main immediate risk.
23.
Domestically oriented banks’ activities are highly concentrated in the construction and real
estate sectors—with related credit accounting for more than half of their loan portfolios—as
well as in tourism and trade, increasing their vulnerability to the current contraction in
global activity. Large single name exposures compound these risks. In addition,
provisioning coverage is kept low by the extensive use of real estate collateral, further
exposing them to the ongoing correction in housing prices. The authorities estimate that
property prices might still be overvalued by up to 10 percent. Recent stress tests conducted
by the central bank also highlight these vulnerabilities: in the event of a 30 percent drop in
property prices, combined with a 15 percent increase in NPLs, a few banks would breach
regulatory capital thresholds.
24.
The authorities agreed that a more proactive approach toward building buffers
was warranted. As the transmission channels of the global crisis continue to broaden,
banks will need to build additional capital buffers well beyond statutory ratios, on top of
expected requirements from Pillar II implementation. Institutions are aware of this, having
successfully tapped the domestic market to raise capital recently; they should be encouraged
to continue to take advantage of the current liquidity in Malta’s financial market. Staff also
recommended that the supervisor discuss with banks dividend payout policies and means to
set provisions in a more proactive fashion, including through the introduction of tax
deductibility for specific provisions, in line with international practice.
25.
Risks need to be better incorporated in the macro-prudential and supervisory
framework. Univariate stress tests are regularly conducted by the central bank for

domestically oriented banks, but multivariate adverse scenarios need to be further tested.4
Similarly, while linkages between the internationally oriented banks and the domestic
economy remain limited, they have been on the rise, as some institutions started
participating in the domestic interbank market, issuing securities locally or collecting
resident deposits. The central bank has accordingly gradually incorporated these institutions
in its stability assessment and stress testing exercises, but systemic considerations still need
to be better taken into account when setting prudential standards. To this end, the authorities
intend to run a stress testing exercise involving the central bank, the supervisor and
individual banks. Monitoring of large intragroup exposure risks should follow a similar
template, in collaboration with home authorities. Alongside these efforts, regulatory scrutiny
should be intensified to match the growing size and sophistication of the financial sector.
26.
The authorities would also need to further enhance their communication
strategy and strengthen their crisis management framework. At the height of the global
crisis, the government provided assurance that it stood ready to support banks and raised the
level of deposit insurance substantially, in line with EU peers. Staff welcomed the recent
publication of the financial stability report and stressed that, going forward, further regular
communication to the public about the health of the financial sector would be critical.
Similarly, closer monitoring of financial sector issues in the ministry of finance—as
exemplified during the recently conducted crisis impact assessment—will be necessary.
Finally, the authorities are undertaking legislative work to increase funding for the deposit
guarantee scheme and to modernize their crisis management and bank resolution regime.

The most recently published stress tests focused on risks related to asset quality (increase in probability of
default from 10 to 20 percent), the economic downturn (increase in NPLs by 15 percent), the house price
correction (increase in NPLs by 20 percent and decline in house prices by 30 percent), and liquidity (deposit
withdrawals of 20 percent). While the tests showed that on average, the banking sector would still remain
adequately capitalized, in some instances, some banks would fall below the regulatory thresholds.

the current downturn is testing this strategy, price developments in 2008 also affected cost
competitiveness: with wage costs accelerating, labor productivity gains vanishing, and the
euro strengthening, Malta’s ULC-based real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by
close to 3 percent against its main trade partners, after an increase of 2¼ percent in 2007.
On the other hand, the current account position improved, with the impact of the oil price
hike and further cutbacks in the manufacturing sector more than offset by expanding niche
exports. Overall, using CGER methodologies,5 staff estimates that the competitiveness gap
remained broadly similar to last year’s, with a modest overvaluation in the range of 2 to
16 percent. These developments support the authorities’ view that changes in export
structure have underpinned an equilibrium appreciation.
28.
Still, in the current taxing environment, the authorities’ strategy to continue
upgrading the exports structure will not succeed without a multipronged approach to
promote structural reforms (Figure 10). The authorities underscored that euro area

29.
The authorities are committed to reducing the state’s involvement in the
economy. They are finalizing the privatization of the shipyards’ activities, and unbundling of
Enemalta’s gas and petroleum divisions is underway. The authorities have introduced a
rule-based mechanism to determine electricity and water tariffs with a view to gradually
achieve full cost recovery for the state-owned utility enterprises while providing consumers
with transparency and predictability in tariff adjustments. Staff welcomed this important step
but warned that the financial situation of Enemalta remained fragile, raising risks the
government might still need to support the company financially in the future. The
privatization process should continue, including with the search for strategic investors for
Bank of Valletta, market conditions permitting.
There was broad agreement that the causes of persistent inflation had to be
30.
rapidly tackled. While the lagged pass-through of oil prices to domestic energy prices
accounts for part of the differential in inflation with the euro area, food price inflation has
remained high. Staff recommended that the competition authority adopt a more proactive
stance, expeditiously addressing any monopolistic behavior in the wholesale and retail
markets, while regulated segments of the markets be liberalized. Adequate capacities and
institutional independence should be granted to the competition authority.
31.
Wage developments and labor and education policies will also need to play their
role in strengthening Malta’s competitive position. Staff stressed that, as inflation remains
high, the COLA risked hampering necessary cost adjustments, especially in manufacturing
industries hit by the global downturn and in low-skilled employment intensive sectors; staff
advised its elimination and instead encouraged a move towards productivity-linked wage
increases at the enterprise level. The authorities underscored that the indexation setting had
served the country well; they expressed cautious support to staff’s suggestion of a social pact
to forge consensus on required policies. Upcoming negotiations on the public sector
collective agreement should also set a conservative benchmark for the private sector. Malta
does not compare well with peers on female employment participation and on education
attainment, and incentives to pursue tertiary education and to enter the labor force need to be
reinforced. Beyond the recent income tax reform, staff stressed that further efforts were
required to address skill mismatches and to clamp down on informal activity.
An infrastructure upgrade would further increase Malta’s attraction as an FDI
32.
destination. The public investment package included in the 2009 budget constitutes an
important step to improve Malta’s attractiveness. The launch of the first tranche of the Smart
City Project, a privately-financed information technology business park, could bear strong
potential in attracting further investment in ICT.
33.
Both production and provision of economic statistics have improved. The
National Statistics Office has now filled senior management vacancies and taken decisive
steps to improve the production and timely dissemination of economic indicators. Significant

25
progress has been made towards SDDS subscription, which, in consultation with STA, is
targeted for end-November 2009.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Following strong structural reforms on the run-up to euro adoption, the Maltese
economy is better equipped to handle the global crisis. Activity has been diversified
towards high-value added services sectors, which so far have remained relatively less
affected by the slowdown. Fiscal consolidation and privatization helped put public finances
on a stronger footing for euro adoption in early 2008. Accordingly, the economy remained
resilient until the fall of 2008.
35.
Staff nevertheless projects the economy to shrink by 2 percent in 2009. Growth
remains influenced by the outlook in the manufacturing and tourism sectors, highly affected
by the global crisis. Private consumption and employment prospects have also weakened
recently. The downturn will put pressure on government revenue and bank asset quality, and
vulnerabilities related to Malta’s significant exposure to external developments—both
through trade ties and through the large internationally oriented banking sector—call for
strong fiscal and financial policies. Staff views the balance of risks still on the downside.
Fiscal policy is appropriately accommodating in 2009, and the authorities should
36.
be mindful not to withdraw fiscal support too rapidly in 2010. The stimulus package
combined with the full play of automatic stabilizers will provide an appropriate
counter-cyclical response to the slowdown, while the reform of utility subsidies will help
generate fiscal room and address inefficiencies. However, the composition of the stimulus
measures should be improved, with a gradual winding down of measures to support
enterprises as the implementation of infrastructure projects gather pace. If risks were to
materialize and the recovery be further delayed, the full play of automatic stabilizers—and
possibly further capital spending—should be allowed to provide additional support in 2010.
Without policy adjustment, the fiscal deficit will nonetheless fail to moderate
37.
substantially in the medium term. It would remain in excess of the Maastricht ceiling until
2013, with much of the debt adjustment achieved during 2004–07 erased. The looming
challenge of ageing only compounds these fiscal risks.
38.
Anchoring the short-term fiscal response to the downturn within a
well-articulated consolidation strategy will therefore be key. The authorities started
tackling the shipyards and the utility subsidies, two areas of traditionally large public
outlays. But, more needs to be done to secure sustainability, in particular with respect to the
wage bill, subsidies and health care spending. A fiscal strategy aimed at delivering
2/3 percentage point of GDP of structural adjustment annually over 2011–14 would provide
a quicker reversal in public debt trend, necessary to re-build fiscal buffers.

26
39.
A stronger fiscal institutional framework would also help foster consolidation.
More independent fiscal projections, stronger budget execution discipline, greater
accountability of the government to parliament, and better integration of the medium-term
strategy in budgetary discussions would all contribute to anchoring the authorities’
consolidation plans.
Maltese banks have withstood the global crisis relatively well but vulnerabilities
40.
have increased. Credit concentration remains a concern, especially as the downward
correction in property markets and the economic slowdown will typically trigger a
deterioration in asset quality.
41.
More capital buffers are needed. Banks already started tapping the market, and
should continue doing so, private appetite permitting, preferably with a focus on core
capital. The government has appropriately communicated it stood ready to support banks;
legislative work on bank resolution regime and deposit insurance coverage should speedily
be finalized. Provisioning should also be more proactive.
42.
More broadly, the authorities should assess whether the cost-benefit analysis of
Malta’s banking business model has been altered by the risks brought to light by the
global financial crisis. This applies in particular to the internationally oriented financial
sector, whose assets account for more than five times GDP and whose linkages with the
domestic economy, though limited, are rising. Containing these risks will require further
enhancing supervisory capacities and better incorporating systemic considerations into
prudential standards. Closer monitoring of financial sector issues in the ministry of finance
will be paramount, given the potentially sizeable impact on public finances in case of crisis.
Completing the structural reform agenda will be critical to buttress
43.
competitiveness. Euro area membership offers clear opportunities in terms of trade and
financial integration, FDI inflows, and exchange rate stability. However, further internal
flexibility will be essential for strong performance within the currency union, and a
concerted effort from all stakeholders will be required to preserve cost competitiveness and
generate productivity gains necessary to raise living standards. A social pact negotiated
between the government and the social partners could offer a useful vehicle to forge
consensus on policies, including on measures to tackle persistent inflation and to link wage
increases to productivity developments at the firm level. The critical reform of the utility
tariffs should be completed, and the price-setting formula applied in full and transparently.
Finally, the government should continue to place special focus on raising labor market
participation and increasing education attainment to fill skill mismatches.
44.

It is recommended that Malta remain on a 12-month consultation cycle.

B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2010

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

MALTA’S BANKING SECTOR
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND RISKS TO BANKING SECTOR STABILITY
Risks to the stability of Malta’s banking sector have increased over the past few
45.
years. The sector has grown in size and in financial linkages with the rest of the world. The
developments come with new risks, and, significant progress notwithstanding, supervisory
capacities and macro-prudential surveillance will need to keep pace with the rising
sophistication of the sector.
A. Broad characteristics of the Maltese banking sector
46.
The banking sector has grown rapidly in recent years (Figure 1). Between 2004
and 2008, the number of institutions increased from 16 to 23 and total assets doubled, to
reach €42 billion, over seven times Malta’s GDP. Most of the expansion was led by external
assets, which account for over three quarters of total assets at end-2008. Domestic assets also
grew briskly, especially in loans for mortgage and broader real estate purposes, and to the
transport sector. Property-related loans currently constitute more than half of the domestic
loan portfolio. On the funding side, foreign deposits tripled and domestic deposits grew by
one third over 2004–08.

The banking sector is heterogeneous, with only a small fraction of institutions
playing a role in domestic financial intermediation. Of the 23 banks, 13 are locally
incorporated subsidiaries of foreign institutions and three are foreign branches.6 However,
according to the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) only seven of these banks, dubbed
domestically oriented institutions (DBI) play a role in domestic intermediation.7 Four of
6

EU subsidiaries and branches are from Austria, the UK, Portugal and the Netherlands; two of the non-EU
subsidiaries are from Saudi Arabia, while all non-EU branches are Turkish.

The CBM in its 2008 Financial Stability Report classifies banks as DBIs if they reach a threshold resident

them are foreign-owned. DBIs represent 30 percent of total assets and account for the
quasi-totality of resident market transactions, both on the funding and lending side (Figures 2
and 3). In fact, domestic intermediation is concentrated in two banks—one of which is
foreign-owned—accounting for about 80 percent of both domestic loans and resident
deposits. Domestic lending is largely deposit financed, with a loan-to-deposit ratio at almost
80 percent at end-2008. Most of the remaining 16 internationally-oriented banking
institutions (IBIs) use funding from their overseas banking group to finance assets outside
Malta, while some others specialize in trade finance outside Malta. Partly because of these
differences in business models, performance indicators vary significantly across banks
(Figure 4).8

Malta’s favorable tax regime and extensive double-taxation treaties explain in part the presence of IBIs. Under

The z-score measures the number of standard deviations a return realization has to fall in order to deplete
equity, under the assumption of normality of banks’ returns. A higher z score implies a lower probability of
insolvency. The calculation for Malta is based on the two largest banks that represent 80 percent of the market.

However, in the wake of euro area entry, new risks have emerged as
internationally oriented banks start integrating in the domestic financial sector. First,

residents, while others are collecting
domestic deposits, covered by the local Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS). At end 2008,
eligible deposits of IBIs under the DGS amounted to about €0.2 billion.12 While this amount
only represents 2½ percent of all eligible deposits, it has been on the rise. Incidentally, it may
not be straightforward to monitor risks stemming from IBIs; because these entities often act
as simple agents of overseas banking group, their balance sheet information may not provide
adequate guidance on underlying risks.
54.
Moreover, DBIs and IBIs are exposed to countries with elevated economic risks,
such as Turkey, the UK or Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Subsidiaries of Austrian
banks (DBIs and IBIs) are mostly exposed to Bulgaria and the Czech Republic; their
exposure to CEE stood at €2 billion, about 170 percent of their own funds at end-January
2009. Total banking sector exposure to the UK amounts to €3.5 billion, while that to Turkey
exceeds €12 billion. While the latter amounts to one quarter of total assets, it is concentrated
in two Turkish branches (IBIs) that have little direct links with the domestic economy. Still,
even if the direct impact of stresses at IBIs on DBIs is currently likely to be small, contagion
effects due to imperfect information cannot be ruled out.13

10

Previously, IBIs did not take part in the Maltese Lira market. IBIs also have interbank exposures with
non-resident banks, which could be an additional indirect source of risk to DBIs.
11
TARGET2 is the real time gross settlement system for the euro, offered by the Eurosystem. It is used for the
settlement of central bank operations, large-value euro interbank transfers as well as other euro payments. It
provides real-time processing, settlement in central bank money and immediate finality.
12
Some of the branches also collect deposits, but these do not fall under the Maltese DGS. Amounts have so far
remained small.
13
Under most license agreements of IBIs, non-performing loans are transferred to the parent. While this
provision offers partial protection to the domestic financial sector, it may not protect the system in the event of
shocks to liquidity, neither to solvency if this information is not widely available to market participants.

40

55.
While positive for competition, the entry of new banks in the domestic market
will certainly lead to a further gradual compression of interest margins. Over the past
two years, new entrants have emerged targeting the domestic retail sector. The decline in
margins, and hence in profitability, is

vulnerabilities to shocks. The share of
property-related loans in banks’ portfolio rose 10 percentage points in 2003–08 to reach 55
percent. Furthermore, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios have been relaxed in past years: according
to a CBM survey, LTV ratios above 80 percent were granted to 38 percent of residential
property-based loans in 2008, up from 25 percent a year earlier. Both corporate and
household indebtedness levels have risen, although they remain below euro area average at
about 55 and 65 percent of GDP, respectively.14 Furthermore, even though household assets
well exceed measured debt, distributional unevenness could contribute to vulnerability. In
particular, as property prices are currently undergoing a downward correction, real estate
collaterals will offer less protection against loan losses.15 The recent top-down stress tests
conducted by the CBM on DBIs confirms these vulnerabilities: in the event of a 30 percent
drop in house prices, combined with a 15 percent increase in NPLs, three banks would
breach regulatory capital thresholds. Risks are compounded by non-negligible single name
concentration risks, with the ten largest single name exposures increasing by 10 percent in
2008.
57.
The considerable expansion in intragroup exposures during the global financial
crisis highlight spillovers risks from overseas parent institutions (Figure 8). For IBIs,
lending flows to parent banks more than doubled in the second half of 2008; for DBIs, they
increased by 50 percent during July–October 2008 to reach 114 percent of equity. The main
purpose of these transfers was to meet liquidity needs of the banking group, at a time when
global wholesale markets were dysfunctional. While these flows have substantially receded
since then, the event disproportionately exposed local banks to the risk of failure of their
parent. Maltese banks are currently exempt from limits on intragroup exposures.
14

This is based on DBIs’ outstanding loan book at end 2008. Actual debt, which would include liabilities to the
non-bank sector and non-residents, is likely to be higher.
15
The process of realizing collateral is also considered very slow.

41

APPENDIX

58.
Banks’ risk management responses may need reinforcing in the face of these
new challenges. While lending conditions have been tightened, especially to the construction
sector, domestic loan growth has remained brisk, at close to 10 percent year-on-year in
April 2009. Though banks have successfully raised fresh capital in 2009, it was concentrated
in Tier 2 rather than in core capital. Moreover, banks continued to pay out dividends.
Provisioning, already low by international comparison, has also softened, with coverage
ratios of NPL shrinking to 21.6 percent in March 2009 from 24 percent three months earlier.
At end 2008, NPL net of provisions represented as much as 27 percent of DBIs’ capital.
Finally, so far banks do not hold capital specifically against concentration and other Pillar II
risks, and stress tests and contingency funding plans have yet to be fully developed.

VI. MALTA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in close cooperation with the European Central
Bank (ECB) and Eurostat while upgrading statistical systems to meet the euro area
standards.16 However, national accounts and balance of payments data have remained subject
to substantial revisions, often affecting several years. Most macroeconomic statistics can
now be accessed through Eurostat. The country has been a participant in the GDDS since
September 11, 2000, with the metadata posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board. In 2009, the IMF continued to provide technical assistance to the authorities
in order to finalize preparations for SDDS subscription. The review of Malta’s data
production and dissemination practices found that SDDS requirements are met or exceeded
for 17 of the 21 required data components. Planned short-term improvements in the
remaining four components—relating to external debt template, the industrial production and
producer price indices, and the dissemination of the international investment position (IIP)
data—will bring data production and dissemination practices in line with SDDS
requirements. In consultation with STA, the target date for SDDS subscription is set for
end-November 2009.
Real sector statistics: Data on retail and consumer prices, labor market indicators, and
tourism arrivals are released monthly, usually with a short lag. These data are available
through Eurostat and via the Internet at the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the National
Statistical Office (NSO) websites. Presently the NSO releases national accounts data in euros
with one quarter lag. Statistical discrepancies (captured under stock building) are often large,
particularly on the first release, and typically lead to sizable revisions. Supply-side GDP
estimates by type of economic activity are not available, but the recently published producer
price index will facilitate their compilation. A planned monthly manufacturing output index
with timeliness of one month is expected to be available for public dissemination before
end-2009. National accounts imports and exports data are not disaggregated into goods and
services. The harmonized index of consumer prices was first published in May 2004.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics meet basic requirements, with quarterly
accrual-based data on general government operations compiled in accordance with the
ESA95 methodology and disseminated with a one-quarter lag. The general government
comprises data from the consolidated fund of government adjusted to include other accounts
of government, the accruals elements, and the financial performance of the Extra Budgetary
Units and of the Local Councils. The NSO also publishes monthly statistics on the cash
operations of the central government, for which the authorities plan to utilize the targeted
16

The 2007/08 Eurostat peer review on the implementation of the European Statistics Code of Practice found
that the NSO had reached a remarkable compliance with large parts of the Code despite its small size, but
underscored the need to improve adequacy of resources and data quality management.

5
timeliness flexibility option in light of additional time required for the final month of the
fiscal year.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality. Since
the entry into the euro area in January 2008, monetary data for IMF statistical publications
are now obtained through a gateway arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the reporting
burden of the country. The country participated in the pilot project—Coordinated
Compilation Exercise—for Financial Soundness Indicators and submitted indicators as of
end-2005 along with metadata, which are now available to the public through the IMF’s
website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/part.asp?iso=MLT).
External sector statistics: Summary data (merchandise trade, current account balance, and
selected financial account data) are released on a quarterly basis with a lag of about three
months. More detailed BOP and IIP data are released annually, the latter with a lag
sometimes exceeding one year. Summary trade statistics are released monthly with a lag of
about 40 days. The CBM plans to disseminate the external debt template in line with
requirements of the SDDS and recommendations of the External Debt Guide as well as make
some minor changes (in coverage and classification) to the Reserves Template currently
being disseminated. It is also expected that Malta would be in a position to disseminate the
2009 IIP data with an SSDS required timeliness of three quarters.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Malta
On September 4, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Malta.1
Background
After a period of sustained expansion following successful EU entry, Malta started feeling the
effects of the global downturn in the fall of 2008, with declining trade flows and investment.
More recently, private consumption also weakened, as the labor market prospects
deteriorated, and growth slowed substantially in the early-2009. Although inflation has begun
moderating recently, it has remained the highest in the euro area since October 2008, and
reached 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 2009, mostly as a result of a lagged impact of
energy price increases and imperfect pass-through in food prices.
Fiscal consolidation came to a halt in 2008, with the deficit widening to over 4½ percent of
GDP, both as the result of restructuring measures in the state-owned shipyards and of
spending slippages, most notably in energy subsidies and the health care sector. With the
economy deteriorating, the authorities are letting the automatic stabilizers play and are
implementing a stimulus package, focused on infrastructure projects and support to the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

manufacturing and tourism sector. The authorities have managed to finance the fiscal deficit
without difficulties, although at a higher cost, but the debt ratio has started to inch up again.
Banks have so far withstood the global financial turmoil relatively well, as they were protected
by their limited exposure to structured products, a traditional retail funding model, and
conservative lending policies. Credit has proved resilient, and no government intervention to
shore up capital or liquidity has been necessary. Nonetheless, some institutions suffered large
valuation losses on their security portfolio, and credit concentration in the construction and real
estate sectors remains a concern, especially as property prices have fallen noticeably recently.
The external current account deficit narrowed to 5½ percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting
continuous efforts at export diversification and value-added upgrading. Competitiveness has
therefore remained broadly stable, notwithstanding moderate appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate driven by accelerating wage costs, weakening labor productivity gains, and the
strengthening of the euro. Nonetheless, labor market participation remains low, particularly for
women, and education attainment trails peers. Furthermore, wage flexibility is limited by an
automatic indexation to inflation.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that past efforts at fiscal consolidation and export diversification
toward high-value-added services activities in the run-up to euro adoption had increased the
resilience of the Maltese economy. Nevertheless, the global crisis had started to affect the
manufacturing and tourism sectors, weakening growth prospects and jeopardizing the hardwon gains. The main challenges facing policymakers in the current environment are to remain
supportive in the short run without compromising the fragile fiscal position, and to preserve
competitiveness as a foundation for medium-term growth.
Directors considered that the fiscal stance for 2009 is appropriately accommodative. The full
play of automatic stabilizers, combined with a limited stimulus package focusing on
infrastructure investment, should provide an adequate counter-cyclical response to the
slowdown. Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the composition of the fiscal
stimulus by winding down measures to support enterprises as the implementation of planned
investment projects gathers pace. While recognizing the need to avoid premature withdrawal
of fiscal support, Directors considered it important that consolidation efforts start as soon as
feasible, with a number suggesting frontloaded measures in order to reach the Maastricht
deficit target by 2010. Directors called for a well-articulated medium-term consolidated
strategy, supported by a strengthened institutional framework and budget execution discipline.
This would require targeted action on the expenditure side, particularly with regard to the wage
bill, social transfers, and pension and health care spending. Directors welcomed recent steps
to privatize the shipyards industry and eliminate utility subsidies.

3
Directors observed that the banking sector has weathered the global crisis relatively well and
capital ratios remain adequate. However, rising nonperforming loans and credit concentration
in the context of the downward correction in property prices and the economic slowdown have
increased vulnerabilities. Directors recommended that banks build additional capital buffers
and set provisioning more proactively. Directors looked forward to the early finalization of
legislation on a bank resolution regime and deposit insurance coverage.
Directors saw merit in reassessing the costs and benefits of Malta’s banking business model,
in view of the risks brought to light by the global financial crisis. Noting the rapid expansion of
internationally oriented banks and their increasing linkages with the domestic economy,
Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to conduct stress tests and risk assessments, and to
gradually incorporate these institutions into the exercise. Containing these risks would require
supervisors to further enhance capacities and to better incorporate systemic considerations
into prudential standards.
Directors noted that euro area membership provides a clear opportunity for Malta in terms of
trade and financial integration. At the same time, it highlights the urgency of improving internal
flexibility to remain competitive, especially given persistent inflation in Malta. A concerted effort
would be necessary to complete the difficult reform agenda focusing on cost adjustments and
productivity improvements, in particular a move toward productivity-linked wage increases and
a restructuring of public enterprises. Directors welcomed progress in utility tariff reform, and
recommended that the new price-setting formula be applied fully and transparently.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Malta and Francesco Spadafora,
Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 4, 2009
On behalf of the Maltese authorities, we thank staff for the well-written and informative report,
which once again witnesses the fruitful and close cooperation with the authorities.
Overview
The global crisis resulted in an external shock that is testing the resilience of the Maltese
economy. Annual growth averaged 3.5 percent over the last four years, but it will turn into
negative territory (at around 2 percent) in 2009, driven by declines in all private components of
demand. In particular, exports in the manufacturing and tourism sectors have fallen as a result of
the recession affecting Malta’s trade partners. On the positive side, the services balance
continues to improve due to the significant diversification of activities into higher value-added
productions that took place over the last few years. The services balance is projected to increase
to over 20 percent of GDP in 2009, up from about 17 percent one year ago.
For 2010 staff expect a modest recovery, with growth at about 0.5 percent, driven by
improvements in external conditions. While agreeing that risks prevail on the downside, the
authorities are somewhat more optimistic on account of expectations for resiliency in
consumption and a more robust pick-up in corporate investment.
In the labor market, the robust activity in the services sector contributed to the satisfactory rate
of job creation until the end of 2008, but conditions deteriorated afterwards. After having
declined for three years in a row, the unemployment rate is projected to increase to 7.3 percent in
2009, still below the euro area average by about 2 percentage points.
Inflation remains at a relatively high level, a reflection of buoyant food, energy, and hotel prices.
The inflation differential with the euro area in energy prices is expected to decline in the near
future, helped by the downward adjustment in utility prices adopted by the authorities in April
2009. More generally, inflation will be brought down by the negative output gap projected
through 2014.
FDI inflows, attracted by Malta’s stable institutional and business environment, have continued
to overfinance a stabilizing current account deficit, thus strengthening the country’s net external
position.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities responded to the global crisis by allowing a full play of automatic stabilizers, and
by adopting a stimulus package of 1.5 percent of GDP, partly financed by EU grants. The
package focuses on measures to increase public investment in order to upgrade the country’s
infrastructure and further increase Malta’s attraction as an FDI destination.

2
At the same time, the authorities foresee a fiscal consolidation of 0.75 percent of GDP in 2009,
fully accounted for by cuts in subsidies on utilities. Moreover, to rein in public expenditures, the
authorities have taken corrective measures with regard to the shipyards sector.
The authorities are committed to resume fiscal consolidation, when cyclical conditions improve,
in order to reduce the budget deficit to below the 3 percent threshold and terminate the
Maastricht Treaty’s excessive deficit procedure.
The authorities agree with staff that fiscal consolidation should be essentially expenditure-based.
Currently, preparations for the 2010 budget are underway and, in this context, the authorities are
considering measures to reduce government expenditure in a number of areas. This process will
also involve consultation with the social partners. The authorities also see with favor a
strengthening of the fiscal framework and budget execution discipline. To this end, initial steps
have been taken to increase oversight of spending ministries.
The authorities are mindful of the potential side effects mentioned by staff with regard to their
measures to support a small number of manufacturing enterprises, but they see them as
instrumental in shoring up investors’ confidence in the Maltese economy.
Financial Sector
Over the last few years, the financial sector has grown in size and sophistication, reaching over
seven times GDP, driven by internationally oriented banks that account for 70 percent of total
assets. The global crisis has had a contained impact on Maltese banks so far. Domestically
oriented banks have been virtually unscathed by the turmoil, as they lack exposure to structured
financial products and rely on a traditional funding model based on retail deposits. This safe
structure also underpins the resilience of credit to the private sector.
While banks’ profitability has been hurt, capital ratios, although declining, have remained well
above regulatory minima and the liquidity position is stronger than in most peer countries. The
local interbank market, whose development was fostered by the 2008 euro adoption, continues to
function smoothly.
At the height of the crisis, the government committed to support banks, but so far there has been
no need to actually provide additional capital or liquidity. A number of banks have been able to
raise capital by tapping capital markets at relatively favorable price conditions.
Against this background, the authorities are aware that the financial turmoil has inevitably raised
some vulnerabilities.
Rising nonperforming loans and the concentration of domestically oriented banks’ exposures in
the construction and real estate sector are a source of concern. The authorities’ have conducted
stress tests to better identify the risks; they agree with staff that a more proactive stance towards
strengthening capital buffers is appropriate.

3
In view of the increased participation of internationally oriented banks in the domestic interbank
market, the central bank has gradually incorporated these intermediaries in its stability
assessment and stress testing exercises.
In December 2008, a “crisis impact assessment” was conducted jointly by the Ministry of
Finance, the Central Bank of Malta, and the Malta Financial Services Authority to assess the
channels of transmission in case of financial distress, and to evaluate communication between
the different authorities. Going forward, in order to better gauge systemic risk, the authorities
intend to run a stress testing exercise that will involve the central bank, the supervisor, and
individual banks.
The authorities are also taking the legislative steps needed to increase funding for the depositguarantee scheme, and to modernize the regimes for crises management and bank resolution.
Communication to the public has been enhanced through the publication of the financial stability
report.
Structural Reforms
So far, the authorities have concentrated on supporting the economy in order to mitigate the
fallout from the crisis, but they are committed to resume efforts to increase the economy’s
competitiveness and attractiveness to FDI. As noted by staff, the country’s competitive position
has evolved in line with structural changes in the export structure towards higher value-added
sectors, and has remained broadly stable in the face of the downturn, with the euro shielding it
from unnecessary currency volatility.
To further reduce the state’s involvement in the economy, the authorities are finalizing the
privatization of the shipyards’ activities, and the unbundling of Enemalta’s gas and petroleum
divisions. To reduce the potential fiscal consequences posed by the state-owned energy and
water utility companies, the authorities have introduced a rule-based mechanism to determine
electricity and water tariffs with a view to gradually achieving full cost recovery.
The authorities are aware of the need to tackle the causes of persistent inflation in a timely
manner. Staff recommend that adequate capacities and institutional independence should be
granted to the competition authority so that it may adopt a more proactive stance toward
addressing any monopolistic behavior in the wholesale and retail markets. The authorities’ view
is that the recommendation to grant institutional independence to the competition authority is
premature, but they agree that a proactive stance is crucial in fostering price flexibility and
efficient markets.
The authorities noted staff’s remarks on the existing across-the-board mandatory inflation
adjustment of wages (COLA), but point out that the indexation mechanism had served the
country well; they expressed cautious support for staff’s suggestion of a social pact to forge
consensus on required policies.
