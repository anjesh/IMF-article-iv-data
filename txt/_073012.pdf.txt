Note. Taxonomy of the reasons for delays of Article IV consultations or mandatory financial

stability assessments
Article IV consultations and mandatory financial stability assessments are delayed for a variety
of reasons. For the purpose of monitoring delays, Fund staff groups the reasons into the following
categories, though it should be recognized that a delay may have more than one reason.
• Program-related issues: Delayed (i) in order to combine the consultation with a request for use of
Fund resources (UFR) or Policy Support Instrument (PSI), or program review; or (ii) due to ongoing
discussions on UFR or PSI, or continued work on program review.
• Further discussions: Delayed due to further discussions with the authorities on economic
developments and policies.

2
• Political/security situation: Delayed due to the unsettled political and/or security situation.
• Government change: Delayed due to forthcoming or recent elections, change of government, or
changes within government.
• Staffing constraints.
• Authorities’ request.
• No agreement on mission dates/modalities: There was no agreement on the modalities for the
mission/the authorities have not communicated dates for the Article IV consultation mission.
• Miscellaneous: Includes reasons not accommodated above.
