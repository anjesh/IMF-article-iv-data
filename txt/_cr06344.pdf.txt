EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic performance has started to improve. For more than a decade, economic growth
was sluggish, in part the result of external shocks. Last year, growth likely exceeded
4 percent, driven by strong exports. Inflation this year has picked up to 4 percent, but the
pegged exchange rate should hold this in check. The external position is better, with gross
reserves now at around €1,200 million (more than 4 months of imports, or 25 percent of
GDP). This increase in reserves has allowed the NBRM to cut rates significantly, from
10 percent to less than 6 percent since October, and which commercial banks have partly
matched. Credit is expanding, to households especially, though from a low base and slowly
compared to the region. Fiscal policy is also modestly expansionary, last year’s ¼ percent of
GDP surplus giving way to a projected 0.6 percent of GDP deficit. As a result, growth should
remain at around 4 percent this year, with the current account deficit increasing only slightly.
However, the economy faces severe structural obstacles to the more rapid growth
needed to raise living standards closer to European levels. Unemployment is
exceptionally high, the financial system is still underdeveloped, and there are serious
weaknesses in basic economic institutions.
Discussions focused on the main challenges facing the new government: sustaining and
building on this recent improvement in macroeconomic performance, and reducing
unemployment:
•

The authorities agreed that continued stable macroeconomic policy was a
precondition for sustained growth. This meant keeping to the 0.6 percent of GDP
fiscal deficit target, while the fixed exchange rate would guide monetary policy.
Pressures to spend privatization proceeds were increasing, and the authorities largely
accepted the need to resist these; however, medium-term challenges to the fiscal
target (loss of telecom dividend, pension reform, EU accession) will be considerable.

•

This needs to be accompanied by structural reforms to create a functioning
market economy. The mission highlighted the following priorities: (i) institutional
reform (judicial reform, transparency in government decisions, telecoms
liberalization) to promote factor productivity and growth; (ii) labor market reform
(lower tax wedge, ending tax discrimination against part-time work) to reduce
unemployment; and (iii) financial sector development (consolidating the banking
system, revising the banking law, enhancing supervision). These themes are
developed more fully in the accompanying Selected Issues papers, which the mission
discussed in a seminar with the authorities.

With the current account improving, the level of the exchange rate for now is broadly
appropriate.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
With economic performance improving following a decade of low growth, and
elections in July, the Article IV consultation took place at an opportune but sensitive
time. Despite recent improvements that owe much to generally sound policies (Box 1),
FYR Macedonia still faces the considerable challenge of achieving sustained rapid growth,
lowering unemployment, and reducing current account vulnerability. With financing
constraints easing, pressure to relax macroeconomic policy is also increasing. Tax cuts and
spending initiatives proposed during the election could jeopardize the hard-won record of
stability. The discussions gave a chance to reassess the macroeconomic policy stance and to
devise policies that will accelerate growth in a lasting way. By seeking the views of the
current government, the opposition, unions and business leaders, this consultation should
help shape the new government’s economic program.
2.
While conditions are improving, understanding economic performance and
assessing monetary and fiscal policy is complicated by data deficiencies. National
accounts data are available with considerable delay, and prone to revision, creating
uncertainty over the forces determining growth. Trade performance and competitiveness are
hard to gauge, with volume figures for 2005 indicating an exceptionally large contribution of
net exports, difficult to reconcile with production-side GDP estimates. Increased conversions
of foreign currency into denars at exchange bureaus are also hard to interpret. Are these
current account transactions, such as increased remittances from abroad, tourism and
informal exports? Or do they reflect capital inflows or the conversion of so-called mattress
money? Aside from making this report’s macroeconomic analysis more tentative, these
statistical uncertainties caution against fine-tuning monetary and fiscal policy, increasing the
premium on keeping macroeconomic policy stable and relatively simple.
II. BACKGROUND
A. The Medium-Term Problem: Stability But Low Growth
3.
Since independence in 1991, FYR Macedonia has faced severe challenges on top
of the normal problems of transition. Hyperinflation in the early 1990s, trade embargoes,
regional conflict, and the 2001 internal security crisis have compounded the problems of
restructuring and creating a market economy. The starting point also was weak: within
Yugoslavia, Macedonia’s economy was the poorest, specialized in very few, mainly
traditional, sectors, with an unemployment rate of around 20 percent.

6
4.
Despite these challenges, conservative fiscal policy and the fixed exchange rate
have controlled inflation. After a 16 percent devaluation in 1997, the de facto peg to the
DM and later the euro has remained intact. Since 2002, inflation averaged less than
1 percent. Save during crises, the fiscal deficit has been low, keeping gross public debt to
40 percent of GDP.
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Advice
The Macedonian authorities have generally been responsive to the Fund’s advice since the last Article
IV consultation http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2003/pn0363.htm and the ex-post assessment
of the long-term use of Fund resources http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2004/pn0497.htm.
Fiscal policy: Consistent with staff advice, the authorities pursued fiscal consolidation and reversed
spending increases associated with the 2001 security crisis, to achieve sustainable medium-term fiscal
and external positions. Revenue administration and public financial management have been
strengthened, including by widening the coverage of the treasury single account, giving the Ministry
of Finance power to control line ministries’ spending, and improving procurement. While budget
arrears are under control, progress containing health sector arrears has been mixed. Fiscal
decentralization is on track, but local government financial management needs to improve.
Exchange rate: Although agreeing in principle on the need for an exit strategy, either towards greater
flexiblity or a harder peg, the authorities have continued with the “soft peg”, which has worked well
so far.
Structural reforms: Labor market flexibility and the business climate have improved. Privatization
has continued and should improve corporate governance. Trade has been further liberalized. EU
candidate status should catalyze the authorities’ structural reform efforts, many long advocated by the
Fund.

5.
However, macroeconomic stability has been slow to translate into rapid output
or employment growth:
•

Since 1995, growth has averaged only 2 percent, well below other transition
economies, so that GDP has only recently reached pre-transition levels. By the late
1990s, growth had picked up to around 4 percent, but this improvement was
interrupted by the 2001 conflict. International reserve shortages have also increased
growth rate volatility.

•

Recorded unemployment in 2005 reached 35 percent. Employment has barely
increased since 1995. Nevertheless, wages appear quite high for the region,
suggesting that insiders are protected from competition. With two-thirds of the
unemployed more than four years out of work, high youth unemployment, and low

7
labor force participation, much of the unemployment is structural; reducing it will
thus be difficult.

Besides various shocks, high real interest rates and low foreign direct investment
have slowed growth, suggesting underlying structural problems:

•

Interest rates have been relatively high, despite low inflation. High real interest
rates have limited private credit growth, despite low financial intermediation. The
fixed exchange rate has induced considerable volatility in NBRM rates; bank lending
and deposit rates have largely ignored these, weakening monetary transmission.

7.
In the past, persistent current account deficits created reserve shortages and
rising external debt. From 1995 to 2004, the current account deficit averaged more than
6 percent of GDP, any improvements typically proving short-lived. Reserve cover fell to less
than 3 months of imports by 2004, and external debt rose above 40 percent of GDP. Higher
private transfers from migrants (mostly foreign currency cash conversions) both boosted
imports and financed the resulting trade deficit.

Box 2. Macedonian Migration and Remittances
Though reported remittances are half the size of exports, information on their size and
determinants is incomplete. Official figures for the number of Macedonians living abroad are
outdated, dropped from the 2002 census as politically sensitive after the 2001 security crisis. ILO
data only report those who obtained working visas from foreign embassies in Macedonia (112 in
2003). Data from recipient countries give an estimate of roughly ½ million, though the further back
the generations the weaker the ties. If true, this would represent 20-25 percent of the population,
even higher than in other migrant European countries like Moldova.
Lack of official data makes it difficult to assess whether emigration has accelerated. Unlike in
other countries, increased migration has not increased wage pressure since unemployment remains
high. Private transfers (which in Macedonia include remittances and cash exchanged in bureaus
assumed sent by migrant workers) have doubled in the last five years, to almost 18 percent of GDP
in 2005. Remittances seem stable and countercyclical, consistent with an altruism motivation. In
contrast, cash exchanged is procyclical, and may reflect portfolio diversification.
Apart from Serbia, migrants are mostly located in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Australia,
USA, and Canada. Emigration to Australia and Canada predated independence, and low
remittances in Australian and Canadian dollars suggest weakening ties. With the 10 most active
foreign exchange bureaus located in municipalities with highest Human Development Indices,
foreign migration is not exclusively a phenomenon of poor and rural areas, though roughly half cash
exchanged is in ethnic Albanian areas.

B. Recent Developments
8.
Despite these severe medium-term challenges, economic performance has
improved recently (Figure 1, Table 1). The authorities’ preliminary estimates (based on
industrial production) suggest growth reached 4 percent in 2005, driven by strong exports,
with tight fiscal policy and high interest rates at end-2004 restraining domestic demand.
However, corporate income tax receipts are much stronger than expected, likely reflecting
higher profitability and value added, and the increase in consumption and investment (borne
out by retail turnover, car sales, and investment data) due to higher private transfers and bank
lending is unlikely to have been measured fully. The true growth rate could therefore be even
higher, though unemployment has fallen only marginally. Despite higher oil prices, the stable
exchange rate, lower tariffs, and food prices kept average inflation below 1 percent.
9.
The external position has strengthened, with gross reserves rising from
€700 million at end-2004 to around €1,200 million (more than 4 months of imports,
25 percent of GDP) by May 2006 (Figure 2, Table 2):
•

The reported current account deficit fell sharply to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005.
The main factor was increased private transfers, which probably include capital

conservative staff estimates would put the true deficit closer to 4.5 percent of GDP.
Although higher oil prices raised imports by 3.3 percent of GDP, the overall trade
deficit fell by 2 percent of GDP, but is still close to 20 percent of GDP. Export
growth accelerated in all sectors except for textiles, and especially in steel (which
grew 30 percent) with the reopening of the largest steel factory. Higher energy
imports were offset by lower imports of goods for processing, while consumption
goods imports were flat.

Capital account developments are difficult to gauge. Abstracting from one-off
items such as last year’s €150 million Eurobond and this year’s electricity
privatization (€225 million, almost 5 percent of GDP), improvements are hard to
discern. Long-term private borrowing and portfolio flows have increased, banks have
drawn down deposits abroad to lend domestically, and EU candidacy has improved
financial market confidence (Figure 3). In June, Fitch upgraded its rating to BB+ (one
notch below investment grade). However greenfield FDI remains low, and mainly in
nontradable sectors such as banking, telecoms, retail trade, and energy.

10.
The increase in reserves allowed the NBRM to cut interest rates from 10 percent
in October to below 6 percent in May. Though prompted partly by increased sterilization
costs (which reached €10 million (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2005 and were set to rise
significantly in 2006 with continued foreign currency purchases), the differential with euroarea rates had been high, perhaps because of residual uncertainties over the exchange rate.
Banks have only partly matched the NBRM’s rate cuts, in part because they did not entirely
match earlier rate increases. Credit has expanded, especially to households and in foreign
currency, though from a low base and less rapidly than the region (Figure 4, Tables 3-4).

11.
Fiscal policy has been kept tight, though with some easing this year (Table 5).
Last year’s 0.3 percent of GDP central government budget surplus exceeded the program by
more than 1 percent of GDP. Special Revenue Account underperformance continued, and the
authorities also curbed public employment and delayed procurement. The unusually high
telecom monopoly dividend (1 percent of GDP), and advancing VAT payments by importers
also contributed. The 0.6 percent of GDP deficit in the 2006 budget represents a modest
fiscal easing.
12.
Though present, traditional vulnerabilities are relatively low (Table 6). External
debt exceeds 40 percent of GDP, though almost all is long term and around half owed to
multilaterals. Private short-term external debt is very low (only 8 percent of GDP) and
consists almost entirely of trade credits. Government debt is around 35 percent of GDP,
almost entirely foreign currency denominated, but with maturity averaging more than
10 years (Table 7). Parts of the banking system appear weak and a large share of
intermediation is in foreign currency (with a 50 percent share of deposits). However, the
level of monetization is also low, with broad money only 40 percent of GDP, well covered
by gross international reserves of 25 percent of GDP. In addition, though net foreign assets
are declining as banks borrow from their overseas parents, their net foreign exchange
position remains positive. Debt sustainability analyses likewise suggest only limited
vulnerabilities, save for the scenario based on historical averages (which includes the
security crisis years) (Tables 8-9). This underlines a main theme of this Article IV: the need
to break with historical growth and current account trends.
13.
However, political risks (both domestic and regional) are quite significant, as are
the risks of election-related policy slippage. EU accession prospects may wane, with the
government still to complete the five key priorities identified last year by the Commission,
and the EU divided on enlargement. While all major parties are committed to reform,
implementation will likely depend on how strong a coalition emerges after the election.
III. PROSPECTS FOR 2006
14.
Immediate prospects remain favorable, with somewhat easier monetary and
fiscal policy sustaining growth, and inflation under control:
•

Growth should meet the authorities’ 4 percent projection. Though exports and
recorded industrial production show signs of slowing, the authorities noted that
demand side indicators were favorable: net wages are rising 4 percent year on year in
real terms, new car registrations are up more than 30 percent year on year, and retail
sales are strong.

•

Average inflation should rise to around 3 percent, due to one-off factors.
Consumer price inflation rose to 4.1 percent year on year in May, driven by supply
factors: increased tobacco taxes and oil prices, and higher than expected food prices.

16
With the exchange rate fixed, the mission agreed with the authorities that this price
increase should be a blip (core inflation is only 1 percent), any domestic demand
resurgence first showing up in the current account.
15.
The balance of payments should continue to strengthen in 2006, provided the
sale of the remaining telecom shares is completed:
•

The current account deficit should widen modestly to 3 percent of GDP. Higher
oil prices should increase the trade deficit by 2 percent of GDP; growing steel exports
should be broadly offset by higher consumption and investment goods imports,
stimulated by the recent interest rate decline. Though growing less rapidly (perhaps
because lower interest rates are discouraging inflows), recorded private transfers
should increase by 2 percent of GDP. Discussions suggested that the risks were finely
balanced: oil prices could rise further, the reopened steel factory might take time to
reach capacity, and Chinese competition could threaten textile exports. Against this,
the private transfers projection was conservative, and the elimination of Serbia’s
quota on refined oil imports could boost exports.

•

Successful privatization of the government’s remaining telecom shares could
boost capital inflows by €300 million, raising gross reserves to €1.6 billion
(5½ months of imports of goods and services). However, the mission cautioned that
excluding one-off effects from Eurobond issuance and privatization receipts, net
capital inflows only increase modestly by about 5 percent. Greenfield foreign direct
investment especially was projected to remain weak.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Outlook

16.
Discussions focused on how best to sustain and build upon the recent
improvement in economic performance, essential for reducing unemployment and
raising living standards toward European levels. This needed a two-handed approach. As
a pre-condition, FYR Macedonia should maintain its hard-won macroeconomic stability. But
for growth and jobs to be created, more ambitious structural reforms were required:
enhancing financial intermediation with sound banking supervision, improving the business
climate, and labor market reform to reduce unemployment. The Selected Issues papers
describe these potential reforms in more detail. Underlying all these reforms was the need to
improve the quality of institutions.
17.
The authorities agreed with this message, particularly the importance of
structural reform. Prime Minister Bučkovski noted that the achievement of macroeconomic
stability, EU candidate status, and the implementation of labor, judicial, and bankruptcy

17
reforms, had improved confidence. Targeting 5-6 percent growth was therefore reasonable.
Discussions with the main political parties, and the academic and business communities
showed a broad commitment to reforms, and the formation of the new government offers an
excellent chance to accelerate these. However, these discussions also revealed considerable
pressures to spend recent privatization proceeds.
18.
The mission presented two medium-term macroeconomic scenarios to frame the
policy discussions, compared to the program baseline (updated for this report to include
recent events, and which underlies Table 2 and the debt sustainability analysis):
•

In the optimistic scenario, macroeconomic stability is maintained but structural
reforms are accelerated compared to the program, amid intensified EU
accession efforts (Figure 5, Table 10). Capital inflows and FDI boost investment,
and structural reforms raise total factor productivity so that growth rises to 6 percent;
Balassa-Samuelson effects raise inflation slightly. With imports 1½ times exports, the
resulting modest increase in import growth rates widens the current account, though
this is largely FDI-financed. The fiscal deficit target prevents overheating and
contains the current account deficit; by anchoring policies, it also maintains
confidence in the exchange rate peg.

•

Conversely, delayed structural reforms slow growth to 3 percent, closer to
historical averages (Table 11). Spending and tax cut pressures increase the fiscal
deficit. Government debt ratios rise, while lower domestic saving raises the current
account deficit. Financial market confidence and capital inflows worsen, reserves fall,
and external vulnerability could again become an issue. A more restrictive fiscal
stance would be needed to contain the current account deterioration, though at the
cost of slower growth in domestic demand.

19.
The authorities agreed with the main message of these scenarios, and on the
benefits of a medium-term fiscal anchor. They looked forward to refining and using them
in their Pre-Accession Economic Program.
B. Fiscal Policy
20.
The authorities are confident of meeting the 0.6 percent of GDP deficit target
this year. Though last year’s advance payments from importers have weakened VAT
collections, stronger direct taxes have compensated, especially corporate income tax due to
unexpectedly high profits in 2005. The mission expressed concern at pre-election spending
initiatives (tobacco farmer subsidy, health sector wages) which worsened budget
composition, and tobacco tax increases which encouraged smuggling and lost revenue.

However, the authorities noted that agricultural subsidies were low; doctors’ salaries had not
been increased in four years, and cost savings and increased contribution collections would
finance this. Though the telecom dividend would likely be 0.6 percent of GDP higher than
budgeted, the mission cautioned against using this to accommodate new spending pressures,
since telephone charges are exceptionally high and this revenue will disappear once
privatization is complete. The mission also stressed that pre-election tax and spending
promises (from both the government and the opposition) needed to respect the deficit target.
Box 3. Medium-Term Fiscal Challenges
Macedonia faces considerable medium-term fiscal challenges:
•

EU Accession. This year’s national strategy for adoption of the acquis envisages the
introduction of 300 new laws by 2010, and the need for 2,600 new staff (a quarter of the civil
service). From 2007 funds will be drawn from the newly-established Instrument for Preaccession Assistance, of around 1 percent of GDP. Disbursements will require around
25 percent co-financing. Transportation and environmental investment may need to rise by 12 percent of GDP. For comparison, fiscal costs of accession for other transition economies are
estimated to have been around 1-2 percent of GDP.

•

The new second pillar pension system reduces social security revenues by 0.5 percent of
GDP this year, 0.9 percent of GDP by 2009.

•

Trade liberalization will reduce tariff revenues by 0.5 percent of GDP by 2010.

•

Loss of the telecom dividend after privatization reduces revenues by ½-1 percent of GDP.

21.
The mission stressed the importance of meeting medium-term fiscal challenges
within the 0.6 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target (Box 3). The authorities acknowledged
these pressures, but lacked detailed plans to address them. Staff suggested focusing on the
following areas:
•

Broadening the corporate income tax base (and possibly increasing VAT,
depending on the findings of September’s FAD tax policy mission).

•

Completion of the tax administration reform project supported by the Fund and the
Netherlands.

•

Reducing the share of non-discretionary government spending (almost
80 percent) to create flexibility for EU-spending and public investment (currently
only 3 percent of GDP).

20
•

Rationalizing public employment (which had increased considerably before 2004).
The World Bank’s forthcoming public expenditure review might help here.

•

Containing health expenditures, again with the World Bank.

22.
These challenges and the low revenue
ratio compared to the region limit the scope
for tax cuts. Opposition proposals to introduce
a flat tax would require offsetting measures,
including withdrawing exemptions. The
mission argued for reducing the labor tax
wedge while raising other taxes: this could
reduce unemployment and increase taxes on the
grey economy. Taxing business property should
also be considered, though the authorities noted
this would primarily help municipalities.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
23.
The mission supported the NBRM’s gradual interest rate reductions under the
fixed exchange rate, made possible by the accumulation of foreign reserves. However,
the NBRM noted that the scope for further rate cuts seemed limited given uncertainty over
the current account deficit, lags in transmission to bank lending and deposit rates and to
credit growth, and because euro-area rates were rising and the differential was quite small
compared to historical averages.
24.
Despite Macedonia’s history of current account deficits, analysis in the Selected
Issues suggests that while there are structural competitiveness problems, the level of the
exchange rate is broadly appropriate. The price level is low compared to countries with
similar incomes, and the real exchange rate has depreciated steadily despite the peg
(Figure 6). Though sensitive to output gap and equilibrium current account estimates, the
macroeconomic balance approach suggests the exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, as
do econometric estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate. Against this, wage level
comparisons may suggest a competitiveness problems, but data quality is weaker. The
NBRM agreed with this assessment, being in line with its own research. It noted that wage
growth had moderated recently, which should improve competitiveness. However,
specialization in export sectors with low value added and declining world trade shares point
to a structural competitiveness problem. Overcoming this will depend less on the exchange
rate than reallocation to dynamic sectors, which depends on structural reform and FDI.

Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States), new data that allowed staff to base the

Box 4. Is the Fixed Exchange Rate Appropriate?
Using the framework developed by Husain
(IMF WP/06/54), characteristics identified as
key determinants of the choice of the
exchange rate regime were quantified for
FYR Macedonia. These include trade
orientation, financial integration, economic
diversification, macroeconomic stabilization,
credibility and “fear of floating” effects. These
characteristics were then compared to other
countries, to assess the most suitable regime for
Macedonia.
The results do not point to any compelling
reason for changing the fixed rate regime.
Macedonia is a small open economy, trade is
heavily concentrated towards countries using
the Euro, and the cycle is not out of line with
the Euro area. Weak financial integration, the
predominance of monetary over real shocks,
and euroization also support fixed rates.
Against this, capital flows’ large relative size
and export concentration (iron and steel,
textiles) would point to greater flexibility. The
track record of low inflation suggests less need
for an exchange rate anchor for inflationary
expectations.

foreign currency denominated debt from 95
percent to 60 percent by 2011, easing fear-of-floating concerns. Increasing financial integration and
large capital inflows, if EU accession prospects firm, would call for greater flexibility.

25.
With reasons for change not compelling and the authorities committed to the
peg, the fixed exchange rate regime seems appropriate for now (Box 4). The system has
worked well in disinflation and, with capital inflows so far modest and price competitiveness
a less pressing concern, there is no urgent case to switch. However, the mission cautioned
that if reserve accumulation were to persist—for example if EU accession prospects firm—
then the costs of sterilization, loss of interest rate control, and increased susceptibility to
speculative attack would call for a reconsideration, as would a large terms of trade shock.

23
The NBRM is working on building capacity in order to be able to respond if the prevailing
conditions change. Besides technical preparations, these should include ensuring the
financial system’s resilience to exchange rate volatility, development of money and foreign
exchange markets, and data improvements.
D. Structural Reforms for Medium-Term Growth
Improving Growth Performance and the Business Environment
26.
Though macroeconomic stability is essential for sustained growth of 5-6 percent,
structural reform and improving institutional quality are needed too. Cross-country
regressions in the Selected Issues suggest that increasing investment from 22 to 25 percent of
GDP, closer to the regional average, will only

27.
Though the mission and the authorities agreed on the importance of improving
productivity and attracting investment, how best to achieve this was debated. The
authorities and the opposition stressed the importance of attracting sizeable “brand-name”
foreign direct investment, which would encourage other foreign firms to follow. Concessions

24
(free economic zones, selling land below market prices, or direct subsidies) were needed to
meet neighboring country competition. Despite this stated commitment to foreign direct
investment, the mission noted the lack of major foreign presence in such sectors as banking,
hotels or airlines belied this and suggested forces of resistance, perhaps from domestic
competitors. The mission also cautioned against granting concessions to individual firms.
Aside from governance concerns, these result in opportunistic investments that typically
create little value added, erode the tax base, and encourage others to seek similar treatment.
They discriminate against firms which had earlier invested based on fundamentals.
28.
The mission instead stressed the benefits of creating an environment that
attracts investment projects on merit. Measures of the business environment, like the
World Bank’s governance indicators—covering areas such as the costs of opening and
closing a business, hiring and laying off workers, and contract enforcement—rank
FYR Macedonia poorly against its neighbors. These indicators have changed little in ten
years, suggesting reform is difficult, but also that there is considerable scope for
improvement.
29.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve the business environment, and
discussions focused on the most important actions needed to enhance governance and
lower business costs:
•

Continuing judicial reform. The government has amended the constitution and
passed new laws to introduce comprehensive judicial reform, one of the five key
priorities identified last year by the European Commission. A strategy to implement
these changes is now needed, to reduce the backlog of court cases (a major utility
claimed to be involved in 190,000 court cases in Skopje alone, one third of its
customer base) and to improve governance in the judiciary. A key test will be
whether agencies such as the Public Revenue Office or NBRM are finally able to
impose fines for non-payment of taxes or non-compliance with regulations.

•

Enhance transparency of government action. Electricity discounts should be
offered to firms not through individual negotiation but by clear rules, based on
rational and objective criteria, open to all. While there are rules on procurement,
abolishing discretionary power to sell state-owned land through direct negotiations
(and outlawing intimidation at auctions) would also strengthen governance. The
authorities agreed that rapid completion of the cadastre was also essential for
clarifying property rights. The new Law on Free Access to Information should
promote greater transparency and better governance.

•

Liberalize the telecoms sector. Aside from being an EU requirement, liberalization
should reduce business costs. Publication of information on the internet and greater
use of e-government can improve governance and efficiency, but only if there is
widespread internet access. The mission urged the authorities to ensure consistency

25
between the telephone monopoly’s concession agreement and the new telecoms law,
to promote competition. The authorities noted that facilitating interconnection for
new operators might require tariff rebalancing: raising local call charges, and
lowering those for international and long-distance.
Labor Market Reform
30.
The authorities agreed that high unemployment was the most pressing economic
problem for the new government. Last year’s labor law had improved flexibility, but
unemployment was still very high. The following reforms were discussed (described in more
detail in the Selected Issues):

Slovenia

Bosnia

Albania

Bulgaria

Serbia

Though more rapid growth is the most effective way to reduce unemployment,
the mission argued that the following reforms could also help: (i) reducing the
labor tax wedge by funding healthcare
Tax wedge on wages

through general taxes instead of social
70
contributions on payroll; (ii) promoting
60

possible by judicial reform to shrink the informal sector should produce more
accurate unemployment data. Even so, the underlying unemployment rate still likely
exceeds 25 percent. Much of the unemployment fund was spent on passive measures,
and the authorities intended to make greater use of UN-sponsored active labor market
policies. These could rebuild the unemployed’s skills, and screen out those who
register as unemployed but work in the informal sector.

Trade Policy

The mission commended the authorities’ trade liberalization efforts. Since 2000,
the authorities had concluded 10 free trade agreements and joined the WTO. EU access

remains problematic in some sectors due to quality certification requirements. Textile
producers expect to weather the elimination of Chinese export quotas, since they are
specialized in small orders with quick turnaround.
Enhancing Financial Intermediation
32.
Improved financial market development should support growth. Total financial
sector assets are only half of GDP, almost all in the banking sector. Stock market
capitalization has increased, but is still less than 20 percent of GDP. Though the banking
sector, for the most part, is adequately capitalized and liquid, high levels of non-earning
assets and operating costs lower bank profitability and raise spreads (Table 12). The number
of banks and savings houses is high, suggesting considerable room for consolidation
(Figure 7). Foreign bank penetration is moderate, mostly from neighboring countries,
providing services for their nationals’ businesses: no major foreign bank has entered the
market.
33.
The mission urged the authorities to take steps to encourage financial
intermediation. Considerable progress has been made (Box 5). However, as discussed in the
Selected Issues, weaknesses implementing the legal framework for insolvency, poor credit
culture, and high operating costs had stifled intermediation.
34.
While accepting these concerns, the NBRM noted the transmission mechanism
was improving. Rather than lending, banks still had excess reserves, but these were falling
and concentrated in smaller banks. There were signs that credit had recovered strongly in
March and April. The mission noted that banks’ uncertainty over the NBRM’s willingness to
supply liquidity in times of shortage, for example payment of the telecom dividend, might
also be a problem. Greater clarity here (such as the NBRM’s willingness to lend via repos)
and money market development, might reduce banks’ excess reserves and strengthen the
transmission mechanism.
35.
Anticipating faster credit growth, banking supervision was being enhanced. The
NBRM argued that its corrective actions toward four small banks demonstrated its
commitment to improving bank governance. Interest among strategic foreign investors was
increasing, which could help foster competition, efficiency, and some market consolidation.
The recently approved Supervisory Development Plan, agreed with the World Bank,
provides a comprehensive strategy to migrate toward a more risk-based supervision and
regulation, assisted by an MFD-sponsored resident advisor. The revision of the Banking
Law, with MFD and LEG assistance, aims to bring the legal and regulatory framework more
in line with international best practice and EU standards, facilitating the financial system’s
sound expansion.

27
Box 5. Financial Sector Reform: Where Do We Stand?
While acknowledging improvements in the soundness of the banking system despite weak
institutions and governance, the 2003 FSAP identified several financial sector weaknesses. In
particular, the FSAP recommended to: (a) strengthen the legal and judicial framework (which would
also help combat money laundering); (b) improve the quality of bank ownership; (c) enhance banking
regulation and supervision by adopting a more risk-based approach; (d) develop the government
securities market; (e) give the NBRM a clear oversight and policy role over the payments system; (f)
establish a framework for NBRM emergency lending; and (g) develop supervisory capacity for the
insurance and planned pension fund markets.
Implementation has been uneven, although improving. The legal framework has been improved
but the implementation gap is still considerable. The new Law on Misdemeanors gives regulators
legal authority to impose sanctions, but implementing regulations and the appeals process still need to
be defined. Opaque bank ownership structures and governance weaknesses need to be addressed,
although the NBRM has recently taken corrective measures. While prudential regulations on
exchange rate risk have been strengthened, supervisory norms concerning all market risks in banks’
trading portfolios and foreign exchange lending are expected in 2006. The NBRM has established an
emergency lending facility and revised supervisory circulars and manuals to give supervisors a more
active role in AML/CFT implementation and enforcement. Insurance supervision remains weak but a
World Bank project to develop supervisory capacity has started this year.
Market infrastructure developments have been more positive. The domestic securities market has
grown and the government has lengthened the maturity of new bond issues (to 2 years). New private
pension funds, following the introduction of the two-pillar pension system in January 2006, should
stimulate capital market development. Although the NBRM established an electronic over-thecounter market, the secondary market remains thin. Payments system operation, which is on a realtime gross settlement basis, has been enhanced and remote back-up facilities improved. However,
weaknesses in the legal framework persist, including the need to better define the NBRM’s role in
developing a payment infrastructure and grandfathering of the NBRM’s obligation to execute
guarantees between third parties. Recent changes in some laws, such as giving municipalities the
power to freeze (or directly withdraw funds from) the bank accounts of noncompliant customers
without a court order, may affect the orderly functioning of the payment system.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Macedonian economic performance is improving. For more than a decade,
economic growth has been sluggish, in part because of external shocks. However, in the last
couple of years, growth has reached 4 percent, inflation has remained under control, the
current account deficit has narrowed, international reserves have increased, and structural
reforms have been initiated. Though adequate for surveillance, data uncertainties complicate
economic policymaking.
37.
To raise living standards more decisively toward European levels, the
authorities now need to sustain and accelerate these achievements. As a pre-condition,
this will require maintaining the country’s hard-won macroeconomic stability. But for
growth to accelerate and jobs to be created, more ambitious structural reforms are also
needed: enhancing financial intermediation with sound banking supervision, improving the
business climate and, underlying all these, improving institutional quality and reducing
corruption.
38.
Though tempting, shifting to more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies
will not deliver sustained growth. In small open economies like FYR Macedonia, the result
would only be higher imports and loss of international reserves, depreciation, and inflation.
Likewise, pressure to spend the recent increase in international reserves should be resisted.
Since this in large part reflects one-off privatizations, the proceeds are best saved (for
example by repaying external debt) rather than spent. Keeping the reserves is already
producing substantial economic benefits, by improving confidence in the fixed exchange rate
and causing interest rates to fall.
39.
The 0.6 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target serves as an anchor for
macroeconomic stability. First, uncertainty over the current account deficit’s true size, as
well as its history of volatility, caution against fiscal expansion. Second, though there are
spending needs, institutional capacity in line ministries to spend additional funds efficiently
is lacking. Third, rationalization of the public sector is far from complete, and should be
completed before spending increases are entertained. This should be championed at the
highest levels of government. Finally, a clear fiscal anchor can create substantial credibility
and expectational benefits, essential support to the fixed exchange rate regime.
40.
Although the level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate, the NBRM
should continue to build capacity in order to be able to respond if the prevailing
conditions change. Though structural deficiencies are considerable, price competitiveness
and the level of the exchange rate seem broadly appropriate. The fixed rate regime also
matches Macedonia’s characteristics of a small open economy, with limited international
financial market integration. However, the authorities should be ready for flexibility in case
conditions alter (such as a pickup in capital inflows if EU accession prospects strengthen, or

30
a terms of trade shock). Recent interest rate cuts are welcome, but with euro-area rates higher
and the need to see the effects on credit and the real economy, a pause is now needed.
41.
As well as ensuring macroeconomic stability is maintained, the authorities need
to accelerate structural reform. The agenda is vast, ranging from judicial reform to
improving public governance to liberalizing markets, including telecommunications.
Underlying all this is the need to improve the quality of institutions and to develop a
functioning market economy. Labor market reform to reduce the very high unemployment
rate is also needed: active labor market policies, reducing the tax wedge, and ending
minimum social contributions should all be considered. The authorities should also continue
to foster financial market development, by lowering intermediation costs, improving credit
culture, and enhancing banking supervision. A more pro-active approach to banking
consolidation may also be warranted.
42.
The tasks ahead are immense, but so are the potential rewards. By committing to
macroeconomic stability, but then addressing each of these structural impediments, the
potential for higher growth and living standards should be considerable.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with FYR Macedonia
take place within 24 months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation
cycles in program countries.

1/ Consolidated central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
10/ 6-year average for the average real interest rate.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update was completed on February 28, 2006 with respect to the current StandBy Arrangement. The previous assessment was completed in April 2003. The
update found that the NBRM had taken steps to strengthen its safeguards
framework and recommendations from the earlier assessment had been
implemented. Notwithstanding this progress, the report made recommendations in
the reporting and audit areas, including: (i) review by the NBRM internal audit
function of processes for compiling monetary data reported to the Fund under the
program; and (ii) completion of annual external audits on a timely basis as

1

This schedule presents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations and
repayment obligations. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations (within predetermined
limits) upon request by the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong enough to meet the
expectations without undue hardship or risk.
2
This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents
all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations-except for SRF
repayment expectations-would be extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board
upon request of the debtor country. SRF repayments are shown on their current expectation dates, unless already
converted to an obligation date by the IMF Executive Board.

46

prescribed by the central bank law. The NBRM has started to conduct internal
audit reviews on the processes for compiling monetary data reported to the Fund.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:
The currency of the FYR Macedonia is the denar. The FYR Macedonia maintains a
managed floating exchange rate system with a de facto peg to the Euro.
Households can transact only through commercial banks or through foreign
exchange bureaus that act as agents of banks; enterprises can transact through the
banking system. The reserve requirement on all foreign currency deposits is set at
10 percent.
At end-May 2006, the official exchange rate was 47.65 denars per U.S. dollar and
61.18 denars per euro. The FYR Macedonia has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from June 19, 1998.
The FYR Macedonia maintains an exchange restriction subject to the Fund’s
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) arising from restrictions imposed on the
transferability of proceeds from current international transactions contained in
former frozen foreign currency saving deposits. The retention of this restriction was
approved by the Board on April 26, 2006 until December 31, 2006. During the
Article IV consolations, the authorities confirmed their commitment to eliminate all
restrictions by then.

IX.

Article IV Consultations:
The first consultation with the FYR Macedonia was concluded in August 1993.
The last consultation was concluded on April 30, 2003. The FYR Macedonia is on
the standard consultation cycle.

Appendix II—FYR Macedonia: Statistical Issues
1.
The authorities, with technical assistance from the Fund and other bilateral and
multilateral agencies, have made significant progress in upgrading the country’s statistical
system in recent years. Continued efforts are being made to further improve data quality and
availability. While data provision for surveillance purposes is now adequate, staff’s analysis
continues to be hampered by shortcomings in all major datasets.
2.
The authorities mostly report data to the Fund on a timely basis and an IFS page is
available. The authorities began participating in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) in February 2004. A data ROSC was prepared and published in 2004.
3.
Quarterly GDP volume estimates are produced on a regular basis and their quality
benefited from improvements in the compilation of industrial production indicators which are
used as a basis for the quarterly GDP estimates. The State Statistics Office (SSO), with
support from STA, is currently improving the quarterly GDP compilation (using the
expenditure and the production approach). However, implementation of STA’s
recommendations has been slow mainly due to a heavy work load, lack of appropriate data
and the need for further guidelines. Employment data from a company survey continue to be
unreliable, but the timeliness of unemployment and labor force data has been improved as the
labor force survey is now conducted on a quarterly basis (compared to annual surveys in the
past). Wage data suffer from the volatility of wage arrears payments.
4.
The compilation and coverage of balance of payments data have improved in recent
years. The October 2002 STA technical assistance mission recommended further
improvements to the estimation of short-term trade credits and investigated the large errors
and omissions. Recommendations were made relating to the valuation of imports of goods
and to the estimation of transportation services. Most recommendations were implemented
by the authorities, but gaps remain because data from surveys and reports on transportation
services, direct investment, and transactions settled through resident accounts with nonresident banks were not incorporated into the statistics. The 2004 data ROSC mission
confirmed these shortcomings. The February 2005 STA technical assistance mission focused
on the validation and inclusion of surveys and reports in the compilation of balance of
payments and international investment position. A severe weakness in the BOP statistics
evolved in 2005 when high inflows of foreign exchange cash inflated private transfers. A
STA TA mission, which will deal with private transfers, other cash transactions, and other
issues, will be conducted during 2006.
5.
Progress has been made in government finance statistics since 2004. Data for the
consolidated central government are now available following the expansion of coverage to
extra-budgetary funds and special revenue accounts (SRAs), including their foreign-financed

49

projects. However, reliability of extra-budgetary funds and SRAs data could still be
improved. The financing data for the central government is increasingly presented in line
with GFSM 1986 and are now reconciled with BOP and monetary data following staff’s
recommendations. Data on central government domestic arrears has improved following
introduction of commitment accounting in autumn 2003. However, data on fund arrears,
especially of the Health Insurance Fund, remain unreliable. As part of the ongoing process of
fiscal decentralization, the authorities plan to start collecting data on municipalities that will
allow monitoring of general government finances in 2006. The authorities also plan to begin
implementation of the GFSM 2001 in line with the recommendations of the 2004 data ROSC
as a first step to bringing the fiscal reporting in line with the European Union’s ESA95
methodology. In 2005, the authorities started systematic compilation of public debt data and
are planning to start publishing statistics on public debt on a regular basis in 2006.
Government Finance Statistics are not reported to the Fund for inclusion in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook or the IFS.
6.
Money and banking data are reported to the Fund on a regular basis, although in the
past they have been subject to concerns regarding inconsistencies, accuracy and reliability.
To address these issues, STA provided technical assistance in April 2005 based on the
findings of the data ROSC in 2004. The mission and the authorities agreed on an action plan
aimed at improving current data collection and compilation practices. Specific recommended
actions include: (i) improved institutional coverage of monetary statistics through the
inclusion of savings houses in the reporting of other depository corporations; (ii) the
collection of more disaggregated data in both the National Bank of Republic of Macedonia
(NBRM) and commercial banks’ balance sheets for the improved classification of accounts
by economic sector; (iii) improved data consistency through reconciliation of loan data
among various sectors; (iv) the publication of improved interest rate data in IFS; and (v) the
establishment of a well-defined policy on data revisions in line with best international
practice. The NBRM has since begun to implement these improvements. Notably, the regular
publication of lending and deposit interest rates of various maturities and currency-type has
been an important step forward. Notwithstanding these advances, further TA might be
necessary in the future as the financial sector develops.

51

Appendix III—FYR Macedonia: World Bank Relations
A. Partnership in FYR Macedonia’s Development Strategy
1.
FYR Macedonia has made considerable progress since independence in 1991, with
support from the international community. While risks still remain, the relatively calm
external and internal environment presents FYR Macedonia with perhaps the first significant
window of opportunity since independence to focus on strengthening growth and
employment opportunities. This follows the resolution of regional conflicts that took place
through much of the 1990s, especially the cessation of hostilities in neighboring Kosovo,
which particularly affected FYR Macedonia. Similarly, the Ohrid Framework Agreement of
late 2001 has brought a reasonable measure of stability to the country, despite continuing
isolated incidents. FYR Macedonia’s progress is reflected perhaps most prominently in the
agreement with the European Union (EU) on a Stabilization and Association Agreement, as
well as FYR Macedonia’s recent application to begin negotiations on EU membership.
2.
Macro-economic stability has been largely maintained since the mid-1990s, and been
further strengthened since 2002. Fiscal discipline and the peg to the Euro have helped to
bring inflation close to zero, and resulted in Government spending falling as a proportion of
GDP to a level significantly lower than most of the other former Yugoslav republics.
3.
Nevertheless, despite the recovery of annual growth rates of 4 percent unemployment
remains high and of serious concern. Growth remains constrained by structural impediments.
Further reform to improve competitiveness will be crucial to attract the investment needed to
encourage stronger growth and to provide employment opportunities.
B. World Bank Supported Reform
4.
Since FYR Macedonia joined the World Bank in 1993, 33 loans have been approved
with a total value of approximately US$754 million. About half of all lending has been on
concessional IDA terms. FYR Macedonia graduated fully from IDA in 2003 reflecting
improved economic performance and credit-worthiness. All new lending since 2003 has been
on IBRD terms.
5.
The World Bank’s current program of assistance to FYR Macedonia is outlined in a
Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board in September 2003. Reflecting
Government priorities, the CAS outlines three broad areas of support: (i) promoting the
efficient management of public resources and tackling corruption; (ii) promoting the creation
of jobs through sustainable private sector led growth; and (iii) promoting social cohesion,
building human capital, and protecting the most vulnerable. The CAS envisages a series of
multi-sector development policy loans, supported by specific investment operations to build

52

capacity to support priority reform areas. The CAS also provides for total financing in a high
case lending scenario of up to US$165 million over three years. FYR Macedonia has
qualified for such a high case lending scenario since the CAS was discussed by the Board.
6.
World Bank operations in the past few years have focused primarily on supporting
Macedonian Government efforts to strengthen public sector management and governance. A
US$15 million Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (PSMAC) approved in 2002,
and a recently completed US$30 million Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan II
(PSMAL II) have emphasized:
(i)

improving governance of the health sector, particularly through reform of the Health
Insurance Fund and international tendering for very significant pharmaceuticals
contracts (which has resulted in savings to the Government of over US$10 million per
annum);

(ii)

strengthening overall budgetary management, especially though the consolidation of
extra-budgetary funds within the Treasury Single Account; and

(iii)

civil service reform, including the greater application of the merit principle in hiring
and promotion decisions, and associated wage decompression to encourage retention
of senior and experienced staff.

7.
While maintaining involvement in key elements of the governance agenda,
particularly health sector financing reform, the Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government
is increasingly shifting to structural economic reform to improve the business environment
and promote growth and employment. Bank support for Macedonian Government reform
efforts will be centered on a series of Programmatic Development Policy Loans (PDPLs), the
first of which was approved by the Board in October 2005, shortly after IMF Board approval
of the proposed Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). In terms of strengthening the overall business
and investment climate, the PDPLs support Government efforts to undertake judicial reform,
labor market reform, and strengthened financial sector regulation and supervision. Efforts to
further strengthen public sector governance include an emphasis on further reform to
improve the transparency of the critical health sector, building the capacity of the civil
service to permit more effective strategic prioritization, and support for the decentralization
program being conducted under the umbrella of the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
8.
Development policy lending has been, and will continue to be, supported by a series
of specific investments to build capacity to implement priority reforms. On the governance
and public administration side, a Health Sector Management Improvement project will
continue to provide technical assistance and investment support to the broader health sector
reform program; a Social Protection project will continue to support reform in this area,

53

including the proposed introduction of a second pillar pension system; and an Education
project will continue to assist Government efforts to improve access and introduce stronger
performance and equity measures in primary and secondary education financing. On the
investment climate side, a Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening
(BERIS) project approved in June 2005 will concentrate on building capacity to improve
business entry, operations, and exit; as well as enhancing the competitiveness of the
enterprise sector; and a Real Estate Cadastre and Registration project approved in early
2005 is intended to strengthen land markets and the use of real property as collateral for
business investment by providing more secure title. A Legal and Judicial Reform project
currently under preparation is planned to be presented to the Board in early 2006 to support
critical reforms in this area. Adjustment and investment lending has also been backed up by a
comprehensive program of analytical work.
C. IMF – World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
9.
World Bank and IMF engagement in FYR Macedonia in recent years has been
marked by a spirit of collaboration and cooperation between the two institutions, and with
the Government. Synergies between the proposed Bank and IMF programs over the next
three years reflect a strong degree of consensus between both institutions and the
Government in regard to reform priorities. Especially given the broad range of structural
reform areas in which the Bank and the Fund will both be engaged, however, it will be
critical that close coordination is maintained in order to ensure that the SBA and the Bank
program are mutually reinforcing.
Improving the Investment Climate
10.
There is broad consensus that judicial reform is central to improving the business
environment in FYR Macedonia. As recognized in the Government’s December 2004
Strategy on the Reform of the Judicial Sector, comprehensive judicial reform is especially
urgent to firmly establish the efficient, effective and fair enforcement of creditor, contract
and property rights. The Bank’s Doing Business report has also highlighted the time and cost
of enforcing contracts and conducting bankruptcy procedures as particular constraints in
FYR Macedonia. IMF SBA benchmarks to analyze and budget for the fiscal effects of
judicial reform, enact amendments to the Bankruptcy Law, and amend the Law on
Misdemeanors to allow administrative bodies to impose sanctions without prior court
involvement should complement Bank supported reform efforts. Under the PDPL and the
proposed Legal and Judicial Reform project, the Bank will focus on: reducing backlog and
delays in court proceedings by 25 percent; improve the enforcement of court judgments;
improve the regulatory and implementation framework for bankruptcy cases including the
development of a profession of bankruptcy trustees; and increase the speed, transparency and

54

fairness of administrative decisions. Ultimately, institution building to support the legislative
reform agenda will be crucial, and is likely to take several years.
11.
Support for labor market reform will also require close coordination. A very rigid
legislative framework governing labor relations has contributed to a stagnant formal labor
market, unemployment rates among the highest among transition economies, limited
opportunities for new entrants to the labor market, and a large informal sector. The recently
adopted Law on Labor Relations – a prior action for the Fund SBA—will eliminate the most
burdensome features of the old law and, over time encourage growth, investment, and a
gradual shift in employment from the informal sector to the formal sector, with a
concomitant strengthening of workers’ rights. Further efforts to strengthen labor market
flexibility, including the implementation of the new legislative framework, the establishment
of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and a renegotiation of collective agreements
are expected to be supported the three PDPL operations.
12.
Judicial and labor market reforms are being complemented by a range of other
measures to strengthen the framework for business activity. The enactment and
implementation of a new Business Registration Law and associated regulations will critical
to reducing the relatively high costs and time of business entry – with the time required for
registration currently exceeding the regional average. The Government is also establishing a
permanent body to oversee regulatory reform, including the streamlining of business
licensing, permits and inspections. These continuing reforms will be supported over the next
few years by the Bank’s PDPL operations as well as the BERIS project. Further actions to
implement corporate governance and accounting and auditing reports on standards and codes
(ROSCs) will also be required, including amendments to the Company Law and Securities
Law, and the passage of a new Audit Law. Efforts by the Bank to support the capacity of the
National Bank (NBRM) to supervise and regulate the banking sector, and to strengthen
compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements, will
also need close coordination with the IMF, and the SBA also includes benchmarks on the
strengthening of risk-based supervision by the NBRM.
Public Sector Transparency and Governance
13.
Reform of health sector financing will be a key element of both the Bank and IMF
programs. Health sector financing makes up 15 percent of Government expenditure and has
historically been an area with significant public financial management risks associated with
both pharmaceutical procurement and the less than fully transparent operation of the Health
Insurance Fund (HIF). As noted in the SBA documentation, implementation of health sector
reform will be a litmus test for the authorities’ commitment to fight corruption. Prior actions
and performance criteria in the SBA requiring submission to Parliament of relevant
legislation to tighten the selection of the HIF Board, implement more transparent budget

55

procedures, and introduce binding budget ceilings for the largest public health institutions
will be reinforced through existing and proposed Bank programs, which will also support
efforts to further prioritize spending, improve the cost-effectiveness of health interventions,
and further strengthen mechanisms for pharmaceutical procurement.
14.
Continued collaboration between the Bank and the IMF will be necessary in regard to
the consolidation and rationalization of social insurance contributions with the collection
of personal income tax. The Bank supports Government efforts, with IMF assistance, to
merge collection over time. At the implementation level, however, rationalization and
consolidation of social insurance contributions will need to continue to be coordinated with
Bank efforts to support Government reform of the social protection system, including the
introduction of a second pillar pension scheme.
15.
Bank support for civil service reform, including strengthening institutional
arrangements for strategic prioritization, should complement IMF efforts to improve fiscal
and budget management. Extending civil service reform to the majority of Government
employees who are not civil servants will further strengthen meritocratic principles and the
professionalism of the public sector. Nevertheless, any potential wage decompression among
this group – although not scheduled to begin immediately - will require close coordination
with the Fund to ensure that fiscal targets, including ceilings on the wage bill, are adhered to.
This will also need to occur within the framework of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, and
the associated provisions for the representation of minorities. Similarly, IMF benchmarks
regarding the completion and implementation of a functional analysis of line Ministries have
been set in close coordination with the Bank, as well as other bilateral and multilateral
donors active in public sector reform.
16.
The Government has made substantial progress in enacting the legislative framework
for decentralization, including passage of the controversial Law on Territorial
Reorganization, and adopting a formula for the distribution of VAT revenues between the
national Government and the various municipalities. Nevertheless, before municipalities
assume responsibility for child care and elderly functions under the first phase of
decentralization, a plan for resolving municipal arrears still remains to be agreed.
Considerable capacity strengthening at the municipal level will also be required if the second
phase of decentralization, including the provision of block grants to municipalities to fund
schools, is to be implemented successfully and for service standards to be maintained. This
will clearly require close coordination between the Government, the IMF, the bank and other
relevant donors.

56

D. Summary
17.
FYR Macedonia has made considerable progress in macro-economic management
and improving the transparency and operations of the public sector. Although continuing
governance and macro-economic challenges remain, there is broad consensus that a stronger
focus on structural reform will be required to overcome key impediments to growth and
employment. This is reflected in both the IMF and Bank programs. The strong similarities
between aspects of the IMF SBA and the Bank’s proposed adjustment and investment
lending program have considerable potential to generate synergies and complementarities.
This will, however, require continuing strong collaboration between the Macedonian
Government, the Bank and the IMF.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 11, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
On July 28, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.1
Background
Economic performance has started to improve. After a decade of sluggish growth, in part
the result of external shocks, growth has reached 4 percent for two years in a row. In
2005, growth was driven by strong exports. A broadly balanced fiscal position and the
fixed exchange rate have kept inflation under control. The external position has
strengthened, with gross reserves rising from €700 million at end-2004 to around €1,200
(more than 4 months of imports or 25 percent of GDP) by May 2006. The recorded current
account deficit fell sharply to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005 driven by increased private
transfers, though these may also capture capital account transactions.
The increase in reserves has allowed the central bank to cut interest rates. Bank credit
has expanded, especially to households and in foreign currency, though from a low base
and less rapidly than in the region’s other countries.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

58

The overall fiscal position showed a small surplus in 2005. Last year’s 0.3 percent of GDP
central government budget surplus was better than projected by 1 percent of GDP,
reflecting continuing underperformance of ministries’ Special Revenue Accounts, restraint
in public employment, and procurement delays. One-off revenue developments, including
the unusually high telecom monopoly dividend and advancing VAT payments by
importers, also contributed.
In 2006, growth is projected to remain at 4 percent, with higher domestic demand
offsetting some decline in net exports. Inflation is expected to increase to 3 percent,
driven by supply factors, including higher tobacco taxes and oil prices. The official current
account deficit is projected to widen to 3 percent of GDP due to higher oil prices, lower
interest rates stimulating imports, and some slowing in last year’s increase in private
transfers.
Despite recent progress, structural weaknesses constrain the economy’s ability to
increase employment and achieve more rapid output growth. Recorded unemployment in
2005 reached 35 percent, one of the highest in the region, as employment has barely
increased since 1995. Levels of financial intermediation and the stock of foreign direct
investment remain low. Macedonia ranked poorly in international comparisons of the
business environment due to high costs of opening and closing a business, hiring and
laying off workers, and enforcing contracts. Property rights are poorly defined with the
land cadastre incomplete, the tax wedge on labor remains high, and telecommunications
services are expensive. The government has amended the constitution and passed new
laws to introduce comprehensive judicial reform, yet implementation has just started.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Macedonian authorities for their sound
macroeconomic policies which, after a decade of sluggish growth, have now started to
deliver economic recovery. Inflation has remained under control, the current account
deficit has narrowed, international reserves have increased, and the fiscal position is
sound.
Directors noted that, despite these successes, considerable challenges lie ahead. These
include raising living standards closer to European levels, reducing unemployment, and
keeping the current account deficit under control. Directors stressed that the best way to
meet these challenges would be by maintaining the country’s hard-won macroeconomic
stability, and accelerating structural reforms.
Directors viewed the 0.6 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target as one of the anchors of
macroeconomic stability. They cautioned that loosening the fiscal stance would be
premature in view of uncertainties about the current account’s true size, medium-term
fiscal challenges, and the limited institutional capacity in line ministries to spend additional
funds efficiently. Rationalization of the public sector should be undertaken before
spending increases are envisaged. Going forward, Directors also encouraged efforts to
strengthen the fiscal revenue base and reduce nondiscretionary spending.

59

Directors considered that the exchange rate peg is appropriate given the Macedonian
economy’s size and openness, and its limited international financial market integration.
The peg has kept inflation low, and, although there are structural weaknesses in the
economy, price competitiveness and the level of the exchange rate seem broadly
satisfactory. Directors considered it important to continue to strengthen the central bank’s
policy instruments. They welcomed the central bank’s recent interest rate cuts, but with
euro-area rates higher and the need to see the effects of the cuts on credit and the real
economy, a pause now seems appropriate.
Directors stressed the importance of structural reforms for accelerating growth.
Institutional reforms, ranging from judicial reform and improving public governance to
market liberalization and privatization, will be essential to developing a functioning market
economy. Reducing the very high unemployment rate should be a priority, and can be
achieved through active labor market policies, reducing the tax wedge, and eliminating
barriers to part-time employment. Financial market development is also needed, notably
to lower intermediation costs, improve the credit culture, and enhance banking
supervision. Such reforms would boost investment and employment, strengthen total
factor productivity, and increase Macedonia’s attractiveness for foreign direct investment.
Directors noted that although these tasks are immense, so too are the potential rewards,
and they encouraged the authorities to implement these reforms expeditiously.
Macedonia’s provision of data to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.
Directors nevertheless underscored the need for continued efforts to improve the quality
and coverage of statistics, including in the area of fiscal transparency.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Jeoren J. M. Kremers, Executive Director for
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
July 28, 2006
On behalf of the Macedonian authorities I thank staff for the constructive policy
dialogue during the mission and the comprehensive set of papers, including the very useful
selected issues analysis, which will help the new government in their policy formation
process.
The main political event since our previous Board discussion on Macedonia about
two months ago was the July 5th Parliamentary election, which has been regarded both by the
international and local observers as transparent and fair. As a result, the main opposition
party VMRO-DPMNE (headed by the former Minister of Finance Nikola Gruevski) secured
45 out of 120 seats in the parliament and is currently conducting negotiations with potential
partners for a coalition government. This marks Macedonia’s shift to sustained political and
macroeconomic stability following the 2001 security crisis and confirms the progress in
implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement reflecting the county’s broad consensus on
the need to strengthen democratic process towards full convergence to EU principles. In the
same vein, Macedonia’s economic performance has remained strong, with exports being the
main engine of economic growth for the second consecutive year, low inflation and a
consistent increase in employment. Reflecting the policy stance and a considerable increase
in transfers, Macedonia’s external position has improved substantially and is projected to
remain sustainable over the medium term.
These achievements were accomplished thanks to continued support from the Fund
and other development partners, prudent and well-coordinated monetary and fiscal policies,
and labor market liberalization. The authorities share staff’s view that a continued stable
macroeconomic policy is key to sustained growth, and remain committed to build on recent
progress by addressing underlying long-term structural weaknesses, improving institutional
capacity and enhancing financial market development. Their commitment enjoys broad
support across society and is underpinned by the European Council’s decision to grant
Macedonia EU candidate status.
Continued economic stability has also resulted in an increase in financial market
confidence and improvement in the capital account, as evidenced by growing capital inflows
including the large oversubscription on Macedonia’s first Eurobond issue at the end of last
year. These developments were marked by a rating upgrade from Standard and Poor’s in
2005 followed by one from Fitch in June, 2006.
The authorities’ medium-term goals are consistent with the SBA, currently under
implementation, and the main challenge is to accelerate real GDP growth to above
4.5 percent, while sustaining and building on recent macroeconomic performance.

Fiscal policy
Notably, the tight fiscal stance from 2003 onwards, supported by price stability, has
contributed to the improved economic situation. A budget surplus was achieved for two
consecutive years, the 2005 program target being exceeded by more than 1 percent of GDP.
This is a significant improvement compared to a 5 percent of GDP deficit only three years
earlier. The impressive fiscal consolidation reflects politically difficult measures undertaken
by the authorities, who, among other measures, increased taxes, raised utility prices and cut
expenditures. Given the improvement in the current account and lower public debt ratios, the
modestly expansionary fiscal policy in 2006 is appropriate. This is also supported by
Macedonia’s low capital expenditure as a share of GDP and the absence of major
mediumterm fiscal sustainability risks. In this context, the deficit target of 0.6 percent of
GDP for 2006 appears to be reachable.
The fiscal framework was recently assessed by the IMF through the fiscal
transparency ROSC, which concluded that Macedonia meets the requirements of the fiscal
transparency code in several key areas. In particular, the ROSC emphasized the appropriate
allocation of responsibilities among different levels of government, the central bank’s
operational independence, the availability of reliable information on public and
publiclyguaranteed debt, the adequate legal framework for the management of public funds,
and the transparency of the annual budget process. It also points out that the legislative basis
for taxation is clear and comprehensive. At the same time, the assessment cites a number of
areas were improvements are warranted including the provision in budget documents of
public debt sustainability analysis and information on fiscal risks, strengthened reporting on
state-owned enterprises, and the development of a system for tracking fiscal incentives and
their expenditure implications, and further support to the recently-established internal audit
units. Addressing these issues is a comprehensive part of the authorities’ broader fiscal
reform agenda which is being implemented with support from the Fund and the Bank.
Implementation of the broad-based reform of the tax administration with technical
support from the Fund and the Netherlands remains an important element of the fiscal
agenda. Considerable ground has already been covered in establishing a base for improved
fiscal administration, including Parliamentary approval of the new Law on Tax
Administration Procedures, expanding taxpayer protection and broadening the Public
Revenue Office’s (PRO) authority. Also, the authorities made progress toward improving
arrears collection, tax payer registration, public procurement and performance measurement.
Harmonization of personal income tax and social contribution is underway, and its first phase
is expected to be completed by year-end.
Looking forward, the authorities are aware of the medium-term fiscal challenges
including those related to the fiscal costs of EU accession, further trade liberalization, SOEs
privatization and the development of the second pillar pension system. To this end, they
continue efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of fiscal spending and control
mechanisms. Particular attention is paid to containing arrears in the health sector within SBA
parameters. Furthermore, the preliminary findings of the Public Expenditure review

63

conducted with Bank support will help guide the 2007 budget process. The authorities look
forward to starting the regular monitoring and reporting exercises and pre-accession fiscal
surveillance required for EU membership.
The staff report indicates that debt dynamics are generally subdued, with the
government debt at around 35 percent of GDP and an average maturity of more than
10 years. The private short-term external debt is also low and constitutes only 8 percent of
GDP. Although debt sustainability analysis suggests limited vulnerabilities, the authorities
have used the favorable environment to substantially upgrade debt management at the
Ministry of Finance.
Monetary policy and exchange rate regime
The National Bank’s (NBRM) monetary policy, in combination with a tight fiscal
stance, is consistent with maintaining the de facto currency peg backed by an adequate level
of international reserves. The authorities believe that the exchange rate regime has served
Macedonia well as a clearly defined monetary anchor and will continue to do so.
Additionally, staff estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate using the macroeconomic
balance approach suggest that the exchange rate is broadly appropriate. At the same time, as
the sterilization costs are increasing, the authorities are open to consider ways to improve its
sterilization cost projections to asses the regime’s durability and to proceed with preparations
for possible inflation targeting.
The improved external position and substantial privatization proceeds led to a greater
than initially projected international reserves accumulation. Gross reserves are currently at
around 1.2 billion EURO and represent about 4.5 months of import cover. This has allowed
the NBRM to cut interest rates from 10 to 6 percent. The authorities are in agreement with
staff that the scope for further rate cuts is limited given the uncertainty over the current
account deficit, the lags in transmission to bank lending and the narrowing differential with
the euro area rates.
With the increased confidence in the denar and growing capital inflows, the NBRM
expects a fall in the level of euroization as the demand for local assets is increasing. To avoid
inflationary pressures and ensure continued success of the exchange rate regime, the NBRM
stands ready to sterilize capital inflows by issuing central bank and treasury bills.
Financial market development is key to sustained economic growth and the
authorities remain committed to build on the progress made in encouraging financial
intermediation. In this context, they will seek further support in improving the legal
framework for insolvency and poor credit practices. In order to improve the soundness of the
banking system, the authorities are preparing a comprehensive revision of the legal
framework. They have produced a new draft of the Banking Law aimed at a number of
important areas, including governance issues, clarification of the roles of the Audit
Committee and Risk Management Committee, and increased capital and enhanced licensing
requirements.

64

In anticipation of faster credit growth the NBRM has undertaken a number of steps to
strengthen banking supervision. With World Bank assistance, a Supervisory Development
Plan (SDP) has been developed to enable a more risk-based, anticipatory approach to
banking supervision. To that effect, an MFD resident advisor has been in place since May.
To give supervisors a more active role in AML/CFT implementation and enforcement, the
central bank has established an emergency lending facility and revised supervisory circulars.
Structural reforms
The useful selected issues paper gives an excellent overview of the role of structural
reform in improving productivity and attracting foreign investment that should ultimately
result in achieving a GDP growth of 5-6 percent. The authorities are in broad agreement with
staff that further structural reforms and improved institutional capacity are critical for a
healthy business environment conducive to sustained economic growth.
Important components of an attractive business environment are enhanced
governance and lower business costs. To this effect, the authorities have amended the
constitution and passed new laws to introduce an ambitious and comprehensive judicial
reform in line with the European Commission’s recommendations. In order to enhance
business activity, government introduction of a one-stop shop for business registration, a new
Bankruptcy Law and the Law on Audit were approved, among other measures. Also, the
authorities see scope for faster completion of the cadastre project in order to improve
property rights. With regard to further liberalization in telecommunication, the authorities
will pursue with vigor the implementation of the February 2005 Law on Electronic
Communications.
Reducing unemployment is one the most pressing and difficult policy challenges
facing the authorities. With a recorded unemployment rate of 35 percent, much of which is
structural, and low labor participation, as the staff report correctly emphasizes, bringing the
unemployment rate to the regional level will require further labor market liberalization,
improved unemployment measurement, reducing the labor tax wedge, and promoting
parttime employment. Next to that, a broader context of economic stability and growth will
be key to achieving this objective.
