EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

After a long post-crisis boom, the Korean economy has begun to sputter. Domestic
demand has stagnated for the past two years, forcing the economy to rely on exports.
These boomed in 2003, but have now slowed, reducing growth to low levels.

•

What has gone wrong? The answers are several. Households and SMEs have been
unable to spend, as they are repairing their balance sheets following a long credit boom.
Meanwhile, corporations have become reluctant to invest domestically, mainly because
they are discouraged by the highly regulated labor market.

•

Reviving the economy will consequently require restarting the domestic engines of
growth: spending by households, SMEs, and larger corporations. To do this, the
government needs to provide a macroeconomic spark, while putting in place marketfriendly frameworks needed to solve the underlying problems. Specifically, it should:
¾

Implement stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, while continuing to pursue a
flexible exchange rate policy;

¾

Accelerate the resolution of household debt delinquencies, by strengthening the
personal bankruptcy system;

¾

Revitalize the SME sector, by expanding the sources of private financing while
gradually unwinding public credit guarantees; and

¾

Promote investment, by modernizing the labor market, easing strict job protection
for regular workers while expanding social protection.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
From 1999 to 2002, Korea’s economy grew rapidly, by an average of 7¼ percent
per annum. But starting in 2003, the economy began to sputter. Growth suddenly stopped in
the first half of the year, leapt ahead in the second half as exports boomed, but then slowed
again to an anemic 2¾ percent annualized rate during January-September 2004 as exports
decelerated. What explains this pattern of stop-and-go growth? And what can be done to put the
economy back on the path of sustained, rapid, expansion? These are the key policy questions
facing the Korean economy.
2.
In some sense, the answer to the first question is straightforward. Growth has
slowed because the economy has been dealing with the after-effects of a 2001–02 credit boom,
which damaged the balance sheets of households and firms, causing them to slow their
spending. But in another sense the issue is deeper. The origins of the credit boom, and the
impediments to renewed growth, lie partly in government intervention into the economy, the
legacy of decades of a state-directed development strategy. The Article IV consultation
discussions consequently focused on ways to overcome this legacy and complete the shift to a
market-based framework needed for sustained growth.
II. THE UBIQUITOUS HAND
3.
Since the Asian crisis, Korea has accelerated its shift towards a market-oriented
development strategy. Directed credit has been abolished, protectionist barriers largely
eliminated, the exchange rate floated. The bulk of the banking system has been placed in
private hands, while the chaebol have been restructured and their leverage reduced to
U.S. levels. As a result, Korea now has one of the more open and liberal economies in the
emerging market universe. Foreign investors, for example, now hold 43 percent of equity
market capitalization, the 4th highest share in the world.
4.
Nonetheless, since the crisis Korean governments have continued to intervene in
the economy, and the after-effects of these interventions are now holding back a
recovery.1 The key areas where past

main factor, following a more than five-fold expansion in credit card debts
during 2000–02. The primary impetus for this expansion came from the credit card
companies themselves, which marketed their product aggressively. But according to an
official investigation by the Bureau of Audit and Inspection, the government also
contributed to the boom by introducing tax deductions and lotteries for credit card users,
as part of a strategy to develop domestic demand and expand the formal economy.2
Moreover, lax supervision allowed card companies to issue cards without requiring
basic information needed to assess credit risk, such as income. There were 31 million
cards issued in 2001 alone—in a country with a total population of 48 million.
•

The financial difficulties of SMEs. To contain the decline in bank loans to SMEs
immediately after the Asian crisis, the government sharply expanded its credit
guarantees. These emergency guarantees, however, have not been unwound over time.
Instead, they have been repeatedly rolled over, contributing to a boom in bank lending
to SMEs in 2001–03. As a result, this vital sector—which accounts for 85 percent of
employment—is now plagued by over-capacity and poor profitability (Box 1).

•

The reluctance of larger corporations to invest. In contrast with smaller firms, the
position of the larger corporations is generally strong. But they have preferred to use
their profits to repay debts, repurchase stock, or invest in China, rather than to expand
their domestic investments. One reason is that they are discouraged by the highly
regulated domestic labor market: workers with regular contracts in Korea continue to
benefit from some of the strictest job protection in the OECD, the legacy of government
attempts from the 1960s through the 1980s to provide the security of lifetime
employment.
III. AN ECONOMY FLYING ON JUST ONE ENGINE

5.
With the household and SME sectors
facing financial difficulties, and many
corporations reluctant to invest, most of
Korea’s engines of growth have shut down.
Domestic demand has stagnated since
early 2003, with private consumption in
particular contracting in 5 out of the past 7
quarters as households have focused on paring
down their debt burdens, while incomes have
been eroded by the sharp rise in world oil
prices.3

-7Box 1: Are SMEs the Next Credit Card-Style Problem?
As large enterprises in Korea engaged in financial
deleveraging after the crisis, banks turned to
SMEs as a new lending opportunity. Starting
in 2001, SME loans and housing mortgages surged,
with the former substantially collateralized by real
estate as well. Lending to SMEs seemed justified at
the time by their relative profitability and financial
stability, and was certainly aided by a 23 percent
increase in government SME credit guarantee
provisions.1 Not all SMEs benefited equally from
this credit boom however, with the largest increases
concentrated in services sectors.

But weak domestic demand is hurting the SMEs’ bottom line. The proportion of loss-making
SMEs increased from 17.7 percent in 2002 to 21.3 percent in 2003.2 Tougher business conditions are
also unmasking lingering structural deficiencies in the sector, with many nonviable SMEs reliant on
the credit guarantees and other forms of government support. These guarantees account for more than
6 percent of GDP, a much larger share than in comparable economies like Taiwan Province of China.
With SME finances weakened after a period of strong credit growth, some analysts have
questioned whether SMEs will be Korea’s next mass defaulters. SME loans now constitute more
than 40 percent of banks’ credit portfolio, and amount to over 30 percent of GDP. A wave of SME
defaults would put further pressure on the financial system which is recovering from a credit card
boom-bust cycle.
The underlying degree of financial distress remains unclear. SME delinquency ratios have risen
little from 2.1 percent in December 2003 to 3 percent in August 2004, but this may partly reflect
“evergreening” by banks.3 Certainly, these ratios appear too low if, as shown by some studies,
6 percent of SMEs have failed to generate enough operating income to cover interest charges for the
last three consecutive years.
Relative to credit card loans, potential losses on SME loans are limited by two key factors. First,
the combination of real estate collateral and government guarantees secure some 70 percent of SME
credit. Even in a pessimistic scenario where all SMEs with an interest coverage ratio below one
in 2003 default on their debts, private sector analysts have estimated the unsecured portion of the
defaulted debt at slightly more than one year of banks’ pre-provisioning profits and less than a fifth of
the banks’ book value. Second, most SMEs deal with one or two creditor banks, making any
restructuring easier than in the case of households with multiple credit cards.
However, there is no room for complacency. Restructuring of the sector needs to begin soon if
SMEs are to resume investment and growth.

6.
Accordingly, the economy has been forced to rely on merchandise exports. These
boomed in the second half of 2003 as the global electronics industry recovered, propelling GDP
growth to an annualized rate of 9 percent. But in early 2004 this growth engine began to falter.
Exports slowed as the electronics expansion matured, reducing GDP growth in the first three
quarters to just 2¾ percent (q/q annualized, Table 1).
7.
The authorities have tried to counter this slowdown by easing macroeconomic
policies. In particular:
•

The fiscal stance was shifted from neutral to mildly expansionary. As concerns
about growth mounted, the government initially frontloaded expenditures into the first
half of the year, then adopted a supplementary budget of ½ percent of GDP (Table 2).

•

The monetary policy mix was shifted to favor domestic demand. The Bank of Korea
cut its policy rate by 25 basis points in both August and November, to an historic low of
3¼ percent, easing the burden on domestic debtors (Table 3). Meanwhile, the won was
allowed to appreciate, cushioning the

$37 billion in reserves, bringing the
total to $196 billion (Table 4).

8.
On the structural side, the progress of Fund-supported measures was slow for
much of the year, partly because the National Assembly was preoccupied by legislative
elections.4 Now that the President’s party has secured a slim majority, however, some of these
measures have been advancing. A major corporate governance bill, aimed at discouraging
cross-shareholdings and strengthening the firewalls between industrial and financial firms, was
approved in December 2004. In addition, the government has sold one of the three large
investment trust companies that it controlled at end-2003, and is in the process of selling the
other two.

4

Another factor is that the governing party has been focusing on four major social issues:
repealing the anti-communist National Security Law, regulating media monopolies, reforming
private schools, and investigating collaboration during Japan's 1910–45 colonial rule of Korea.

following section), growth could
gradually accelerate to 4 percent
in 2005 and 5½ percent by 2007, before settling down over the medium term to its potential
rate of around 5 percent (Table 5).6

See Senhadji, “Balance Sheet Effects on Household Consumption,” Selected Issues,
forthcoming.

On an annual basis, however, growth would slow, because output in 2004 was boosted by the
export-driven growth spurt at the end of 2003.

- 10 Box 2. When Will Private Consumption Recover?
A revival in private consumption is the key to a broader economic recovery. But when will this occur? The question
is impossible to answer with certainty, but analysis suggests that a revival may begin in 2005.
Growth in private consumption averaged 6½ percent during 2000–02 before becoming negative in 5 out of the
7 past quarters. The persistent weakness in private consumption has resulted, to a large extent, from the bursting of
the consumer credit bubble in 2003, especially the

households are quite sensitive to the health of their
balance sheet. Faced with a negative shock to their net
wealth, they will reduce their consumption. An increase in household gearing ratio—the ratio of household liabilities
to household assets—by one percentage point will reduce consumption by 2¾ percent (see chapter II of the Selected
Issues).
.52

Therefore, achieving sustainable growth in private
consumption will depend crucially on the amount of
adjustment needed by households to repair their
balance sheets. This will depend on the degree to which
the substantial increase in households’ gearing ratio has
been excessive and needs to be unwound, and the extent
to which it has reflected fundamental factors, such as
financial innovation and low interest rate environment.
Prior to the Asian crisis the gearing ratio had been
relatively stable around 46 percent. If the gearing ratio
were to revert to its mean, significant adjustment remains
ahead.

growth has been registered at the lowest and highest
income levels. While the latter seem to have borrowed heavily
to invest in real estate, low income households did so for consumption, which has increased their gearing ratio
significantly, reducing substantially their capacity to service their debt as demonstrated by the significant increase in
delinquency rates in 2003.

There are both upside and downside risks to this baseline projection:

•

The recovery in domestic demand
could be much more vigorous than
projected, especially as Korean

sharp.

prove higher than the WEO assumption of $43 per barrel, since the central bank
estimates that GDP falls by 0.2 percentage points for every 10 percent increase in oil
prices.

Under any scenario, however, Korea’s vulnerability to crisis is very low. The
fundamental pillars of the economy are solid: the balance sheets of the chaebol are healthy on
average, while banks remain well capitalized despite their recent losses (Table 6). Moreover,
the cushions are considerable, with external reserves now exceeding external debt and
government debt amounting to only 30 percent of GDP (Table 7). As a result, vulnerability
analysis shows that the economy is robust even to severe shocks (Annex I).
12.
There are, nonetheless, problems in particular sectors. As already noted, households
and SMEs are over-indebted. Moreover, while credit card companies have rebuilt their capital
adequacy ratios, a substantial fraction of rescheduled delinquent loans has fallen into arrears
again, suggesting that further losses are yet to be recognized. Also, failures among the
226 mutual savings banks are eroding the reserves of the KDIC, a symptom of the fact that

- 12 -

one-fifth of their loans are overdue.7 Finally, without corrective action, the National Pension
Fund is likely to slip into a substantial deficit over the longer-term.
V. HOW CAN KOREA START THE STALLED ENGINES OF GROWTH?
Reviving the economy will require restarting the stalled domestic engines of growth—spending
by households, SMEs, and larger corporations. But how can this be done? The first step would
be to provide a macroeconomic spark, by implementing stimulatory fiscal and monetary
policies. But the heart of the strategy would need to involve addressing the structural
problems: the household debt overhang, the SMEs’ financial difficulties, and the reluctance of
corporations to invest. In all of these areas, the challenge will be to find ways of developing
market-friendly frameworks that reduce the need for heavy-handed government interventions.
It is this policy challenge that formed the crux of the mission’s discussions with the authorities.
A. Providing a Macroeconomic Spark
13.
The mission and authorities agreed that some macroeconomic stimulus was
necessary to spark the awaited recovery. The 2005 budget submitted to the National
Assembly contains some expansionary measures, including reductions in income tax rates,
increases in tax deductions for SMEs, and the abolition of excise taxes on a range of luxury
items. There are also plans to again frontload spending, as was done in 2003

with rising demographic pressures and the
potential costs of reunification.
14.
Accordingly, the authorities intend to supplement the budgeted spending with a
“General Investment Plan for Economic Revitalization.” At the time of the mission, the
package was still being finalized, but the initial plan involved new spending of around
1 percent of GDP, targeted on infrastructure projects and involving private sector participation
in combination with funding from the National Pension Fund and other nonbudget sources.
15.
While welcoming the plan for additional fiscal stimulus, the mission noted that it
faced a number of challenges. To begin with, maintaining fiscal transparency might be

difficult, as the public sector outlays involved would need to be identified and added to the
consolidated central government accounts. It will also be a challenge to make these projects as
commercial as possible, ensuring that the entities providing financing receive an adequate cash
rate of return while simultaneously containing the extent of contingent fiscal liabilities. For this
reason, the projects may take time to materialize.
16.
There is consequently a risk that fiscal policy could fall short in providing the
needed stimulus. Accordingly, the team strongly supported the plans to front-load fiscal
spending, and recommended the adoption of a supplementary budget, with additional social
spending. The authorities responded that they would evaluate the need for a supplementary
budget in mid-2005.
17.
In the meantime, the mission noted, the task of macroeconomic management
would fall mainly on monetary policy. In mid-2004, the sharp increase in international
commodity prices caused headline inflation to increase. But core inflation has remained within
the 2½ to 3½ percent target range, while longer-term interest rates have fallen to unusually low
levels, suggesting that inflationary

The authorities stated that they
remained committed to allowing the
won’s external value to reflect market
fundamentals. At the same time, they
would continue to intervene to smooth the
currency’s path when it came under
speculative pressure, as had occurred on a
number of occasions during 2003-04. During
the most recent episode, starting in
mid-October, the pressure had been so
intense that, merely by trying to smooth the
sharp appreciation, they had accumulated
considerable additional reserves.

B. Reviving Household Spending
20.
While macroeconomic stimulus can provide a spark for the economy, achieving
sustained strong growth will require addressing the underlying structural difficulties.
This will require, first and foremost, addressing the household delinquency problem.
21.
The staff team strongly endorsed the government’s basic policy approach toward
debt delinquencies. It commended the decision to stand firm against calls for an interventionist
approach, noting that a mandated debt amnesty scheme would only generate moral hazard,
make financial institutions more reluctant to lend to households in the future, and trigger calls
for government bail-outs in other sectors. Instead, government efforts have appropriately
focused on establishing a market-friendly framework within which debtors and creditors can
work to resolve their problems (Box 3). Already, a number of programs have been created for
different groups of debtors, allowing one-sixth of the delinquencies to be resolved in the short
period since many of the schemes were established.
22.
Even so, the bulk of delinquencies remains to be resolved, including many of the
most difficult cases. In other countries, those debtors who have little chance of repaying their
debts in full would seek refuge in the bankruptcy courts. But such a course is less likely in
Korea because a strong social stigma is attached to being bankrupt, exemplified by provisions
in over 100 laws mandating discrimination against such persons. In addition, the terms of
bankruptcy are relatively onerous, with debtors having to live on minimum incomes for 8 years,
compared to 3-5 years in the United States and Japan. As a consequence, very few debtors
apply for bankruptcy, while creditors are extremely reluctant to exercise their legal rights: there
are only 18 recorded cases of creditor-initiated bankruptcy proceedings. In such circumstances,
the team noted, the personal bankruptcy system is not only failing to serve those unable to pay,
it is failing to serve as a standard that would motivate others to enter the various out-of-court
schemes.
23.
For these reasons, the team strongly supported the personal bankruptcy reforms
submitted to the National Assembly in November 2004. These reforms would expand asset
exemptions, increase minimum living incomes, and raise the debt ceiling for use of a simplified

- 15 Box 3: How Much Progress is Being Made in Resolving Credit Card Debts?
Korea is dealing with an unprecedented rise in household loan delinquency following an unchecked expansion
of credit card lending in 2000–2002. Some 3.7 million persons, or 10 percent of the adult population, are classified
as being delinquent, up from about 2 million prior to the credit card boom. Most delinquents are younger people,
typically with lower incomes—half are under 40 and almost 20 percent are under 30.
Financial institutions and the government have established a number of channels for resolving household
debts. These channels offer varying terms depending on the size of debts and whether the debts are to single or
multiple creditors.

of individual financial institutions, and
a credit recovery program jointly

Insolvent individuals with virtually no
income and few assets.

So far, about 15 percent of the total number of delinquent borrowers
have resolved their debts. For the many deeply insolvent debtors with
multiple debts rescheduling is not sufficient to achieve resolution, while
the sanctions under personal bankruptcy are considered overly harsh.
Thus, rather than participating in these resolution channels, many
delinquents appear to be waiting for some kind of debt amnesty.
Creditors lack the information and sanctions that would be needed to
prevent such delays by debtors. For example, credit card companies
indicate that up to 40 percent of their delinquent borrowers have not
provided current addresses or phone numbers. Moreover, creditors are
reluctant to use bankruptcy, as is done in other countries, due to the
strong social stigma that is attached to it in Korea.

bankruptcy process 2½ times to W500 million (around $500,000). Over time, the mission
considered, these measures should be extended, notably by shortening the repayment period
and reducing official discrimination against bankrupt persons.
24.
In addition, the team supported efforts to streamline the new Personal Debt
Rehabilitation Program (PDRP), which allows court-supervised debt restructuring
outside of bankruptcy. The Supreme Court has already begun to simplify the PDRP, reducing
the documentation requirements and shortening the standard repayment period to 3-5 years. But
further efforts may be needed: a possible model is the Individual Voluntary Arrangements
system, an informal but court-supervised mechanism, which has proved a helpful way to deal
with consumer debt problems in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong SAR.9
25.
At the same time as efforts are made

to accelerate debt resolution, it would also

lenders to obtain a complete picture of their
loan applicants’ credit standing. If this
situation were changed, the team stressed, credit bureaus would be able to provide
comprehensive reports whenever financial institutions need them. These institutions could then
begin to tailor their lending to their applicants’ credit standing, enabling those with less-thanperfect records to still get access to funds, provided they are willing to pay higher interest
rates—just as occurs in other advanced countries.

26.
Building such an efficient system of positive credit bureaus will take time, and will
require a supportive regulatory framework. Based on Mexico’s experience, the team
considered that two basic regulations were needed.10 First, financial institutions submitting
information to credit bureaus should be required to submit the same information, at the same

Under the Individual Voluntary Arrangements, debtors and creditors submit their debt
restructuring proposals to arbitrators, usually accountants experienced in insolvency issues,
who decide what plans would be appropriate. Then, to give the plans legal status and afford
creditors some protection against any relapses into delinquency, they are ratified by the courts.
Thus, those debtors who subsequently default could be sent into bankruptcy for a final
resolution.

Issues.

fee, to all other licensed credit bureaus. Second, financial institutions should be encouraged to
obtain credit reports, for example, by requiring them to provision more heavily on loans for
which reports were not obtained.
27.
Beyond restoring access to credit, it will also be important to address problems on
the asset side of households’ balance sheets. This will involve housing policy. The
government’s anti-speculative measures of October 2003 have succeeded in engineering a “soft
landing”, with national housing prices declining by a modest 2½ percent in the subsequent
year.11 However, the impact on transactions has been profound, with nationwide housing
turnover falling by 31 percent y/y in the first 9 months of 2004, especially in the areas
designated as “speculative zones” that cover over half of Seoul. As a result, the main asset of
households—accounting for more than 80 percent of their wealth—has been rendered less
liquid, giving them further reasons to build up their precautionary savings, rather than consume.
One way to address this problem, the team suggested, would be to rebalance the tax burden on
property by reducing transactions and capital gains taxes when the new wealth tax on property
is introduced in 2005.
28.
The authorities welcomed the team’s recommendations. They appreciated the
suggestions for streamlining the debt resolution programs and agreed that the credit information
system needed to be improved, expressing hope that a new entrant, sponsored by the largest
banks and credit card companies, could provide a catalyst for change. As for the housing
market, they noted that the proposed law introducing a comprehensive real estate holding tax
would reduce the total tax rate on property transactions. In addition, they announced that seven
more areas in Seoul would be removed from the list of “speculative zones” in November,
following the removal of eight areas in August.
C. Revitalizing the Small and Medium Enterprises
29.
In addition to addressing the
difficulties of households, Korea also needs
to resolve a growing problem in the SME
sector, which accounts for half of
manufacturing output. Around one-fifth of
manufacturing SMEs are now incurring losses,
with more than one-third failing to generate
enough operating income to cover their interest
expenses. Indeed, these figures likely
understate the extent of the sector’s problems

The measures included increasing tax rates on property holding and capital gains, especially
for owners of multiple properties. In “speculative zones”, the cost of transactions and capital
gains taxes have risen substantially, the result of shifting the tax base to actual market values.

because the bulk of SMEs are in services, where firms’ financial difficulties are apparently
worse. In response, banks have been slowing their credit to SMEs, even as delinquency rates on
these loans remain modest.
30.
To a certain extent, the sector’s problems are cyclical. Many firms have been hit
hard by the slowdown in domestic demand,
and as demand recovers, so too will their

31.
A telling contrast can be found in
Taiwan Province of China. There, as in
Korea, the SME sector plays a very
important role, and is also highly exposed to
growing foreign competition. Yet
profitability has remained strong. The main
reason is that this sector is considerably
more dynamic, with entry and exit rates
much higher than in Korea.12

32.
What explains this difference? A key factor is government loan guarantees. In Taiwan
Province of China, guarantees amount to only 1½ percent of GDP, compared with 6¼ percent
in Korea. As a result, Taiwanese banks cannot rely on them to guide their lending: they instead
need to evaluate credit themselves, and take risks accordingly. In contrast, in Korea resources
tend to flow to the SMEs that can secure guarantees, which are overwhelmingly wellestablished firms. Moreover, the average length of KCGF guarantees is now around five years,
implying that most of the firms benefiting from this program are the ones originally selected
in 1998 when guarantees were expanded in the wake of the crisis. In this way, the program has
been preserving existing firms and raising barriers to entry, thereby limiting the dynamism of
the sector.

12

See Kang and Miniane, “Too Small To Fail? Revitalizing the SME Sector in Korea”,
Selected Issues, forthcoming.

- 19 -

33.
The government has recognized this problem, and in July 2004 formulated a plan
to deal with it. Under this plan, guarantees would be directed away from well-established firms
toward start-ups and new technology companies. In addition, a government-run credit bureau
for SMEs will be established, to provide banks with the information they need to undertake
risk-based—rather than guarantee-based—lending.
34.
The team welcomed these steps, but recommended that the government go further
in this direction. To encourage banks to do more credit analysis, the loan coverage of
guarantees could gradually be reduced from the current typical level of 85 percent to around
50 percent, which is more consistent with international practice. And to limit the risk of firms
“monopolizing” guarantees, the fee structure could be altered to impose higher rates on firms
rolling over loans; currently, these rates only rise by 5 basis points for each rollover.
35.
Fundamentally, though, what is needed is a new framework for the sector, in
which the private sector plays a dominant role in allocating capital. This will require
winding back the levels of the guarantees. The reduction could be gradual, perhaps by 1 percent
of GDP per year for the next five years. It could also be preannounced, to give time for banks
and enterprises to adjust. But it should also start now, the team stressed, because postponing the
necessary task of restructuring will only increase the eventual costs.
36.
At the same time, measures could be taken to provide direct help to SMEs,
especially start-ups. The team recommended relaxing Korea’s strict rules on venture capital
firms; amending the Civil Code to allow for the registration of property rights and security
interests on a wide range of assets, to make it easier for SMEs to borrow on the basis of their
receivables and other intangible collateral; reducing the minimum capital requirement for
incorporation; and providing a more efficient way for SMEs to reorganize or exit by approving
the long-awaited unified insolvency bill.
37.
The authorities agreed with the team’s proposals, but were concerned that
changing the SME framework at the current juncture could trigger a credit crunch that
would worsen the macroeconomic situation. The team, however, considered such risks to be
small, primarily because any unwinding of guarantees would be gradual. More to the point, the
team considered that the risks of inaction were greater. Currently, SMEs are not investing
because they are not in a financial position to do so. Thus, SME investment will not revive until
creditors force them to accelerate—or begin—the process of restructuring.
D. Unleashing Corporate Investment
38.
In addition to reviving the household and SME sectors, Korea also needs to
unleash corporate investment. The decline in investment is not just cyclical: facility
investment has been declining for more than a decade, from a peak of 14 percent in 1995 to a
projected 9½ percent of GDP in 2004. In part, this decline has been a natural consequence of
moving from a government-directed system that encouraged over-investment toward one that
places more emphasis on economic returns. But another reason why so few investments are
now profitable is that structural problems are raising the cost of capital, and the projects
themselves. These problems—including a relatively rigid regular labor market, lingering

- 20 -

problems with corporate governance, and an underdeveloped bond market—have become
particularly pressing in recent years, as Korea’s economy has begun to integrate with that of
China, forcing firms to consider carefully what production should take place domestically, and
what should be outsourced.
39.
As with the other structural challenges, making Korea an attractive place to invest
will require a further reduction in government regulation and intervention. Most
important would be a modernization of the
labor market.
18
2000
40.
The team welcomed the progress
in improving industrial relations. In 2004,
the government’s stance of refraining from
intervention in disputes, apart from
enforcing labor laws, has had notable
success. Strikes, though still numerous, are
being settled relatively quickly, with less
disruption to the overall economy.

But the fundamental labor market problem, the team noted, remains: the strict
employment protection for regular workers. 13 With the legal criteria for dismissal being
difficult to satisfy, firms must often offer high voluntary severance payments to those workers
they wish to dismiss. Larger companies, for

example, typically offer 2¼ months of

employers to hire a growing number of

half of the nonself-employed labor force—

security.
42.
Seeking to narrow these gaps, the government has proposed two bills to protect
nonregular workers by prohibiting “unreasonable discrimination.” The team recognized
this objective, but warned that the law would need to be designed carefully, to ensure that it
does not further reduce labor market flexibility.
43.
The case of Spain, first raised during the previous Article IV consultation, was a
pertinent example, the team noted. During the 1990s, Spain initially tried to increase
13

See Chapter III of IMF Country Report 04/45 for a more detailed discussion.

- 21 -

protection to nonregular workers, but employers responded by reducing their hiring of all
workers, and unemployment increased. Subsequently, the country tried the opposite approach:
it introduced a new type of employment contract with less job protection, reducing opposition
by “grandfathering” existing contracts for regular workers. This new contract has proved highly
successful in generating jobs and helping unify the labor market.
44.
For this reason, the team welcomed the Tripartite Commission’s consideration of
the example of Spain’s labor market reform strategy, among others, to see if it can be
applied to Korea. The team also proposed exploring whether more flexible contracts for
regular workers can be adopted in certain firms or industries, and then expanded if successful.
Furthermore, the mission endorsed the government’s plans to lay the groundwork for increased
labor market flexibility by expanding the social safety net, especially eligibility for
unemployment insurance and basic livelihood protection.
45.
Even as labor market flexibility is increased, it would also be important, the team
emphasized, to improve corporate governance. This remains a priority because, for all the
progress that has occurred in recent years, there remains a “Korea discount” on share prices,
increasing the cost of equity capital.14 For this reason, the team supported the Fair Trade
Commission’s bill (approved after the mission) to strengthen corporate governance. This bill
provides incentives for chaebol to bring their governance up to adequate levels, by granting
exemptions to the cross-shareholding limits to those which improve their internal checks and
balances or adopt more transparent vertical holding company structures. At the same time, the
bill strengthens the firewalls between industrial and financial firms.15
46.
To supplement these measures, the team suggested developing more market-based
mechanisms for enforcing corporate discipline. The government has already taken a
welcome step in this direction, by allowing class action lawsuits for securities violations,
starting in 2005. In addition, the team again recommended that the government encourage the

in Corporate Governance, which would set out a short list of good governance practices and ask
listed companies to comply with the individual measures or explain why they haven’t done so.

Enhancing the functioning of Korea’s corporate bond market can also facilitate
investment.16 While Korea has the second largest corporate bond market in Asia after Japan,
the market lacks liquidity and credit spreads are compressed. To overcome these problems and

develop the market as a ready source of capital for a larger group of domestic firms, the team
recommended that the government break with the tradition of rescuing of bond investors when
companies incur financial difficulties.17 Instead, the team suggested, the government should
facilitate market-led debt work outs by passing corporate insolvency reforms, thereby giving
market participants incentives to do proper risk management.
48.
The government agreed that the team’s proposals would help improve the
investment climate, and noted that steps would be taken in all of these areas. Labor market
reform would take place gradually, once agreement had been reached with all parties involved,
including unions. Meanwhile, the bill to improve conditions for nonregular workers, the
authorities clarified, was not intended to require equal pay or working conditions for nonregular
workers. (The team encouraged them to make this intention clear to the courts.) In relation to
the revised insolvency law, they hope to have this approved shortly, while they were still
considering the “comply or explain” proposal.
E. Other Issues
49.

The team also discussed a number of other important issues:

•

Korean Investment Corporation (KIC). The bill to establish the KIC, which will be
charged with investing a portion (initially $20 billion) of the country’s reserves, has
now been introduced to the National Assembly. The team commented that the bill
should provide the agency with more specific objectives, stronger independence, and
greater transparency, to ensure that public funds are managed efficiently and are not
used to bolster specific firms or markets. The authorities responded that some of these
issues would be addressed in the Presidential Decree, while the risks of market
distortion would be limited since the KIC would invest its foreign assets offshore. They
also noted that the assets entrusted by the Bank of Korea would be invested in liquid
assets and remain readily available to the central bank, so they could continue to be
considered as reserves.

•

Financial supervision. In the 2002 FSAP, the Fund recommended a unified and
independent supervisor. And an official investigation has recently concluded that the
overlapping responsibilities of the three agencies involved in financial supervision (the
FSC, the FSS, and MOFE) had indeed contributed to the credit card crisis. However, the
authorities see a major impediment to unification, since they believe that a private body
such as the FSS could not have the legal authority to impose sanctions. Accordingly,
they are instead planning to clarify each agency’s responsibilities.

17

For example, when LG Card was rescued in 2003, bond holders were made whole, while
other creditors were required to convert debt into equity. As a result, LG Card is still rated as
investment grade despite having negative capital.

- 23 •

Population aging. Korea’s population is aging rapidly, a process which could propel
the National Pension System into sizeable deficit by 2030.18 The team therefore
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with long-standing plans to increase
contribution rates and reduce income replacement rates over time.

•

Trade. Korea’s trade barriers remain high by OECD standards, especially in the
agricultural sector. Out-of-quota tariffs for agricultural products averaged 50 percent in
2003; agricultural support is almost double the OECD average; and domestic rice prices
are more than three times the world level. Accordingly, the team argued that the
government can demonstrate leadership—internationally, as well as domestically—by
further opening up its agricultural sector. The authorities responded that they are
planning to do this, but gradually. In particular, they are considering doubling the rice
import quota from its current level of 4 percent of consumption and allowing foreign
rice to be sold for the first time directly from retail outlets, provided partners agree to
extend the 10-year WTO exemption from tariffication of rice that expires at end-2004.
Also, in November, Korea signed its second FTA, with Singapore—a relatively
comprehensive agreement that includes financial services, investment, and government
procurement.

•

Data. Korea's provision of data is broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes. A vast
array of high-quality statistics is published, with short time lags, providing a strong base
for policy assessment. The team welcomed the authorities' plans to build on this base by
developing more comprehensive data on the financial and fiscal sectors.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

50.
After a long post-crisis boom, Korea’s economy has begun to sputter. One by one
over the past two years, the domestic engines of growth have shut down. Spending by
households and SMEs have slowed sharply because they accumulated too much debt during the
boom years, while corporations have become reluctant to invest. As this has occurred, the
economy has been forced to rely on merchandise exports, which boomed in late 2003, but have
now slowed, reducing Korea’s growth to low levels.
51.
Reviving the economy will consequently require restarting the domestic engines of
growth. To a certain extent, they are ready to restart on their own. Experience from other
countries that have experienced credit boom-and-busts suggests that consumption should begin
to revive in 2005. Moreover, the high rate of capacity utilization suggests that ultimately
investment will recover, as well.
52.
The key policy challenge facing the authorities, then, is ensuring that this recovery
will be strong and sustainable. How can this be done? The first step would be to provide a
macroeconomic spark, by implementing stimulative fiscal and monetary policies. In the staff’s
assessment, the 2005 budget submitted to the National Assembly as a whole is economically
neutral. Moreover, while there are plans for additional investment spending, these involve
18

Chapter I of IMF Country Report No. 03/80 provides projected pension balances.

- 24 private-public partnerships which may take some time to materialize. (But when they do, the
public sector outlays should be recorded transparently in the fiscal accounts.) Consequently,
staff supports the authorities’ plans to front-load budgetary spending, and urges the adoption of
a supplementary budget, with additional social safety net spending.
53.
In the meantime, the task of macroeconomic management will fall mainly on
monetary policy. With core inflation remaining within the target range and inflation
expectations under control, the staff believes there is scope for the central bank to provide
support to the real economy. It consequently supports the recent reduction in interest rates, as
well as Bank of Korea’s plan to stand ready in case further reductions are required. Staff also
commends the authorities’ decision to allow the won to respond to market forces, noting that
Korea’s flexible exchange rate policy has served the country well, encouraging financial
market development while maintaining external competitiveness.
54.
While macroeconomic stimulus can provide a spark for the economy, achieving
sustained strong growth will require addressing the underlying structural difficulties.
This will require, first and foremost, addressing the household delinquency problem. The staff
strongly supports the government’s decision to stand firm against calls for a mandated debt
reduction scheme, and instead establish a market-friendly framework within which debtors and
creditors can work together to resolve their problems.
55.
The linchpin of such a framework, however, needs to be a working bankruptcy
system, to provide a final resolution for those who cannot repay their debts and a
standard for others, so as to encourage them to settle out of court. For this reason, the staff
endorses the plans to make bankruptcy a viable option, and suggests that the government go
further in this direction by shortening the repayment period and reducing official discrimination
against bankrupt persons. Staff also endorses the efforts to streamline the Personal Debt
Rehabilitation Program. Most importantly, these reforms should be enacted speedily, for
accelerating the pace of debt restructuring is critical for hastening the advent of the recovery.
Meanwhile, to restore households’ access to lending, staff recommends that the authorities
promote the information sharing needed for an efficient system of competing credit bureaus.
56.
The second engine that needs to be restarted belongs to the SMEs. For too long,
resources flowing to these firms have tended to be allocated on the basis of government
guarantees, mainly to businesses first identified in 1998. This has stifled the dynamism of the
sector, taking a severe toll on its overall financial health.
57.
In the staff’s view, reviving the SMEs requires a fundamental reform: the current
government-led framework needs to be replaced by one where the private sector allocates
resources, funding the firms with the most promising futures. To do this, the amount of
guarantees should be unwound in the medium-term, while the share of each loan covered by
guarantees should be reduced, and the cost of rollovers increased. At the same time, to help
SMEs grow, staff recommends measures to broaden the range of security for loans, expand the
availability of venture capital, reduce start-up costs, and improve the efficiency of exits—the
last, by passing the long-awaited unified insolvency law.
58.
Restarting the third engine of growth—spending by larger corporations—requires
improving the investment environment. And the key to doing this is modernizing the labor

- 25 market. Staff welcomes the recent improvement in industrial relations, but this still leaves a
fundamental problem: strict employment protection for regular workers, which deters risky
investments and has prompted a growing use of nonregular workers. These problems can only
be resolved in one way, by reducing employment protection for regular workers. Accordingly,
staff welcomes the plans to consider Spain’s reform of introducing a new regular labor
contract, with less protection. It also encourages trials of more flexible contracts in particular
firms or industries. Meanwhile, the staff welcomes the plans to lay the groundwork for
increased flexibility by expanding the coverage of the social safety net.
59.
Promoting investment also requires improving corporate governance and
developing the bond market, so as to encourage markets to provide more financing, to
more firms, at lower costs. Accordingly, the staff welcomes the amendments to the Fair Trade
Act, aimed at encouraging the chaebol to improve their governance. It also welcomes the
introduction of class action lawsuits for securities law violations and encourages additional
steps to reinforce market discipline on corporate governance, such as adopting a “comply or
explain” system for the Code of Best Practices in Corporate Governance. In the bond market,
what is needed most is for the government to refrain from bailing out investors, which has
distorted the balance between reward and risk, stifling market development.
60.
Two final points. First, the staff urges the government to play a leadership role in
advancing global trade liberalization, including by further opening up Korea’s heavily
protected agricultural sector. Second, to build the credibility of the proposed Korea Investment
Corporation, its objectives should be clarified, to ensure they are based on sound economic
principles. These objectives should be supported by well-defined governance, transparency and
accountability arrangements, to allow the public to confirm that the organization’s activities are
indeed consistent with its mandate.
61.
While this structural reform agenda is ambitious, staff remains fundamentally
optimistic about Korea’s economic prospects. Time and again, the Korean authorities have
demonstrated the willingness and ability to take decisive measures to address the economy’s
problems. In particular, ever since the Asian crisis, they have been dismantling the statedirected economic framework at an accelerated pace. By enacting this reform agenda, the
authorities will go a long way toward completing this task, the task of building the
comprehensive market-based framework that is the sine qua non for a return to sustained and
rapid growth.
62.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX I

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Korea has relatively low public and external debt, and its debt dynamics are robust to most
shocks, although population aging casts a cloud over the longer-run fiscal outlook. Korea’s
external debt/GDP ratio is estimated at 25¾ percent in 2004 and the central government
debt/GDP ratio at 23 percent. This annex outlines the main assumptions and results of an
analysis of Korea’s public and external debt sustainability.
Korea’s remaining structural problems in the household and SME sectors expose it to a
domestic demand shock. SME failures could trigger a decline in property prices, reducing
consumption and investment, which would further reduce SME profitability.
The country-specific scenario used in the sustainability analysis includes such a domestic
demand shock. Korean growth has a high standard deviation in the last 10 years at 4.8 percent,
so a shock of one standard deviation would imply a 0.8 percent decline in real GDP in 2005. The
scenario also assumes that the exchange rate depreciates by 5 percent. The primary fiscal balance
would fall as revenues decline while primary spending is unchanged in real terms, but the current
account surplus would rise as imports decline.
Public debt remains below 50 percent of GDP even in the face of extreme shocks (Annex I,
Table A1). In the baseline, public debt remains broadly stable as a ratio to GDP, as the central
government budget returns to balance (excluding the accumulation of social security funds) in
2008 in line with the government’s medium-term fiscal plan, and as GDP growth offsets the
increase in debt due to the planned rollover of guaranteed bonds into treasury bonds amounting
to 8 percent of GDP (Box 3, IMF Country Report 03/79). The shock to real GDP (B2) has the
greatest impact, lifting public debt to 46 percent of GDP by 2009, but the shock is extreme, with
a permanent GDP fall of 18 percent below its historical average, and the primary deficit rising by
4 percentage points of GDP. Public debt rises to 34¾ percent of GDP with variables at their
historical average (A1), but this is because the social security surplus was small in the past and
because of the impact of the 1997–98 crisis on the fiscal balance. Under the above countryspecific scenario, public debt rises modestly, to 25¾ percent of GDP.
External debt is most sensitive to exchange rate shocks, but shocks of the assumed
magnitude appear very unlikely (Annex I, Table A2). Korean external debt is projected to
remain about 25 percent of GDP in the baseline, as the current account surplus declines toward
balance and as net nondebt creating inflows decline from the high levels after the crisis. Most
shocks have a relatively modest impact on the external debt path, but the two exchange rate
shocks have a substantial impact:
•

a 30 percent exchange rate depreciation (B6) lifts the external debt ratio to 42¾ percent;

•

a two standard deviation shock (B3) lifts the external debt ratio to 62½ percent—the
exchange rate falls by 55 percent given the 13.5 percent standard deviation of the
exchange rate due to the volatility in 1997–98.

Such large permanent shocks to the real exchange rate seem highly unlikely for a manufactured
goods exporting country like Korea.

- 39 -

ANNEX I

In the longer-run, Korea faces a rapid aging of its population, presenting a major risk to
fiscal sustainability. The National Pension System is projected to swing into deficits of as much
as 8 percent of GDP after 2030.1 In 2003 the authorities proposed to phase in reforms over time,
including lowering the income replacement rate to 50 percent by 2008 from the current
60 percent, and raising the contribution rate to 16 percent by 2030 from the current 9 percent.
The authorities estimate that the proposed reforms will avoid exhaustion of the NPF, which
would otherwise occur by 2047. However, the National Assembly has not approved these
reforms, largely due to union resistance to these additional measures on top of the reforms that
were adopted in 1998. The opposition party has drafted an alternative plan and a Presidential
committee is working on another alternative plan, so the nature and timing of pension reforms is
currently unclear.

I. Baseline Projections

2005

1/ Central government debt. Includes projected conversion of publicly guaranteed debt of KDIC and KAMCO into treasury bonds, see Box 3 of IMF Country Report 03/79.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes. The large residual is due to asset accumulation of the National Pension Fund.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

STATISTICAL ISSUES

Korea’s macroeconomic statistics and statistical base are adequate to conduct effective
surveillance and the country subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Nevertheless, the April 2001 data ROSC mission identified shortcomings in some statistical
practices that have the potential for detracting from the accurate and timely analysis of
economic and financial developments and the formulation of appropriate policies.
Real Sector
•

The overall structure of the national accounts mainly follows the 1968 System of
National Accounts (1968 SNA). The delineation of the economy, the valuation rules, and
the production and asset boundaries are in line with the 1968 SNA. However, the
classifications used are broadly in accordance with those recommended in the
1993 SNA. The existing data collection program is not being fully used to compile the
national accounts and new measures have yet to be implemented to improve those
surveys perceived as being unfit. One omission from the accounts is the informal
activity in the unrecorded economy, the size of which is not known. Informal activities,
including some illicit activities, are expected to be reflected in the next revision of the
national accounts. Although GDP data are produced in accordance with international
practice, the national accounts could be improved by shifting to the 1993 SNA. The
BOK plans to implement the shift gradually over time. Also, the commodity flow
technique could be improved by moving to the Supply and Use Table framework, but
there are currently difficulties with obtaining the basic data required.

•

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is based on internationally endorsed standards and
uses classifications compatible with internationally recommended systems. Concepts
and definitions used for the compilation of the CPI are in line with the recommendations
of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The scope of the CPI covers urban areas,
but excludes single person, farm and fishing households. The CPI is compiled using
sound procedures and methods which, however, could be improved by also including
single-person households, and by having the prices of missing seasonal items imputed
by similar items within their group. The coverage gaps can be a potential problem with
the level of the indices, while the absence of good imputation procedures can potentially
introduce a bias in short-term price trends and affect inflation monitoring. New weights
and a new market basket using the 2000 Household Income and Expenditure Survey
were introduced in the CPI for January 2002.

•

The Producer Price Index (PPI) is also based on internationally endorsed standards
and recommendations. Concepts and definitions used for the compilation of the PPI are
in line with the 1993 SNA. The scope of the PPI covers all domestic industrial activities
and a large segment of service activity, as well as free trade zones and bonded

- 43 -

ANNEX II

warehouses. The PPI is compiled using sound procedures and methods but could be
improved by imputing missing prices from other similar commodities, rather than being
simply carried forward using the last reported price.
Fiscal Sector
•

Consolidated statistics on the general government aligned with internationally
recognized standards are not compiled. Statistics following these standards only cover
the central government, which accounts for about 75 percent of total general
government. National concepts and definitions differ from those internationally
recognized. Therefore, two sets of government finance statistics are compiled for the
central government, using national definitions and using internationally recognized
standards. Concepts and definitions used in the latter set of central government finance
statistics generally follow the recommendations of the 1986 Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM 1986). The data cover the budgetary units of the central
government (including social security funds owned and/or managed by the government)
and the extra-budgetary funds owned or managed by these units.

•

Central government statistics aligned with internationally recognized standards are
produced from the National Financial Information System (NAFIS), which integrates
the preparation of budget data, accounting reports, and the generation of fiscal statistics
on a monthly basis. The NAFIS provides for automatic crosschecks at different levels of
the compilation process.

Monetary Sector
●

The overall quality of Korea’s monetary statistics is generally sufficient for informing
the policy process. The data ROSC mission to Korea identified several areas that are not
in line with international guidelines. The revised monetary aggregates, which have been
compiled since early 2002, address many of the identified data issues and now almost
fully comply with the Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual (MFSM 2000).

●

The analytical usefulness of data relating to foreign assets and foreign liabilities is
affected by the BOK valuing its financial assets and financial liabilities at book value
(rather than at market value) and revaluing its foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities twice yearly (rather than on a monthly basis). Also, some banks are using
nationality rather than residency to distinguish between resident and nonresident
individual and household accounts, affecting the accurate measurement of net foreign
assets of the banking sector.

Balance of Payments
•

The overall quality of balance of payments data is good. The Bank of Korea
implemented the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) in

- 44 -

ANNEX II

early 1998, but some deviations remain in the classification and sectorization of balance
of payments transactions.
•

Following liberalization, the coverage of the balance of payments statistics has become
less comprehensive, as residents were permitted to conduct transactions via accounts
with banks abroad. There is also incomplete coverage of transactions via intercompany
accounts, via nonresident won-denominated accounts with domestic banks, and noncash
transactions. The BOK is preparing to implement new collections to improve coverage.
The BOK has developed an array of statistical techniques and collections to improve the
coverage, classification, and timeliness of source data, including timing and valuation
adjustments to trade statistics compiled from customs documents, grossing of certain
services transactions, and recording long-term construction contracts under direct
investment.

•

The quality of external debt statistics has greatly improved since the financial crisis.
However, until September 2003, the statistics were not compiled on a residency basis,
and certain external liabilities are excluded from the disseminated data. Hence, the
external debt statistics were not comparable with the balance of payments statistics, nor
with external debt data disseminated by other countries. In September 2003, the BOK
started to release external debt statistics on a residency basis according to the SDDS
specifications; a debt service schedule, an encouraged item in the SDDS, is not
disseminated. The BOK has also released data on Korea’s International Investment
Position (IIP) for 2001, 2002 and 2003.

•

Data dissemination on international reserves, foreign currency liquidity, and external
debt generally meets the SDDS specifications for periodicity, timeliness, and advance
release calendar.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Korea’s exchange rate system is classified as “independently floating.” Previously,
the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was allowed to float only within specified margins
around the previous day’s weighted average exchange rate in the interbank market. The
margins were widened five times between March 1990 and November 1997 (most recently to
+/-10 percent), and on December 16, 1997 were eliminated altogether. On
December 29, 2004, the exchange rate was W1,041=US$1.
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation:

Korea is on a 12-month consultation cycle. Staff discussions for the 2003 Article IV
consultation were conducted on a mission to Seoul during November 5–18, 2003. The

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MFD: The final FSAP mission was conducted during October 2002. The mission

This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. The information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent data confirms the weakness of domestic demand. Service industry output
fell by 1.6 percent (y/y) in November, the fifth consecutive monthly decrease. Meanwhile,
consumer confidence slipped to a four-year low in December, as the National Statistical
Office’s index fell to 85.1 from 86.6 in November.
3.
At the same time, however, there has been some significant progress in
restructuring household debt. As of end-2004, the total number of restructurings was
estimated to have reached 750,000, compared with 556,000 as of end-September, as reported
in the staff report. Consequently, restructurings now account for more than 20 percent of total
credit delinquents.
4.
The Bank of Korea kept its key interest rate unchanged at 3¼ percent in its
mid-January meeting. The Bank said it was waiting to better judge the effects of its latest
cuts in August and November 2004, noting also that it continued to expect consumer demand
to revive in the second half of 2005.
5.
The exchange rate has appreciated by 0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar so far
in 2005, bringing the cumulative appreciation since end-2003 to 15½ percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Korea
On January, 21, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Korea.1
Background
From 1999 to 2002, Korea’s economy grew rapidly, by an average of 7¼ percent per annum.
But starting in 2003, the economy has begun to sputter. Growth suddenly stopped in the first
half of the year, leapt ahead in the second half as exports boomed, but then slowed again to an
anemic 2¾ percent annualized rate during January-September 2004 as exports decelerated.
In effect, for the past two years, the economy has been dependent on export growth, because
the domestic engines of growth have shut down. Households and SMEs have been unable to
spend, as they are repairing their balance sheets following a long credit boom. Meanwhile,
corporations have become reluctant to invest, in large part because they are discouraged by the
highly regulated domestic labor market.
The authorities have been countering this slowdown by easing macroeconomic policies. The
fiscal policy stance has been shifted from neutral to mildly expansionary. At the same time, the
monetary policy mix has been shifted to favor domestic demand. The policy interest rate has
been reduced to an historic low of 3¼ percent, easing the burden on debtors, while the won has

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2been allowed to appreciate, cutting the cost of imports and thereby boosting real household
incomes. Over the course of 2004, the won climbed by 14½ percent against the U.S. dollar,
a 12½ percent gain in nominal effective terms. While smoothing this rise, the authorities
accumulated $44 billion in reserves, bringing the total to $199 billion.
Staff expects that domestic demand will finally begin to revive in early 2005, supporting yearly
growth of 4 percent. Experience from other countries that have gone through similar booms and
busts suggests that consumption could revive as the process of balance sheet adjustment
advances into its third year. Moreover, high capacity utilization ratios and strong manufacturing
profitability should ultimately prompt a recovery in facility investment, offsetting a slowdown in
construction.
There are both upside and downside risks to this baseline projection. On the upside, the
recovery in domestic demand could be much more vigorous than projected, especially as
Korean recoveries have often been swift and sharp. On the downside, the projected recovery
could be undermined if OECD growth falters or there is a significant downturn in the volatile
electronics sector. Moreover, with the country highly dependent on imported oil, growth could be
cut significantly if oil prices rise significantly from current levels. Most importantly, the strength
and sustainability of the recovery will depend heavily on government policies, especially in
tackling the ongoing structural difficulties.
Despite these challenges, Korea’s vulnerability to crisis remains very low. The fundamental
pillars of the economy are strong: the balance sheets of the chaebol are healthy on average,
and banks have preserved their capital strength despite recent loan losses. Moreover, the
cushions against shocks are ample: the external position is more than comfortable, with
reserves now exceeding the level of gross external debt, while government debt is only
30 percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the Korean
authorities’ basic policy approach, especially the accelerated dismantling of the state-directed
economic framework, in recent years. These efforts, Directors considered, have paid handsome
dividends, creating a relatively open and liberal economy and touching off a long economic
boom.
More recently, however, Directors noted, the Korean economy has begun to slow down. While
noting that this has occurred because the economy has been dealing with the after-effects of a
200l–02 credit boom, Directors emphasized that the more fundamental problem is the remaining
legacy of a state-directed development strategy. Accordingly, they stressed that completing the
shift to a market-based framework would be the key to restoring sustained and rapid growth.
Directors agreed that stimulative fiscal and monetary policies would be appropriate to provide a
macroeconomic spark. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to adopt a pro-active approach
by front-loading budgetary spending, and urged the adoption of a supplementary budget with

-3additional social safety net spending. They also welcomed the Comprehensive Investment Plan,
which aims to stimulate additional investment spending through public-private partnerships,
but noted that these projects may take some time to materialize, and will need to be recorded
transparently in the fiscal accounts when they do.
Directors believed that, with core inflation remaining within the target range and inflation
expectations under control, there is scope for the central bank to provide support to the real
economy. They consequently supported the reduction in interest rates in November, as well as
Bank of Korea’s plan to stand ready in case further reductions are required.
Directors commended the authorities’ decision to allow the won to respond to market forces,
noting that Korea’s flexible exchange rate policy has served the country well,
encouraging financial market development while maintaining external competitiveness.
Directors emphasized that achieving sustained strong growth will require addressing the
underlying structural difficulties. This will require, first and foremost, addressing the household
delinquency problem. Directors strongly supported the government’s decision to stand firm
against calls for a mandated debt reduction scheme and instead establish a market-friendly
framework within which debtors and creditors can work to resolve their problems.
Directors stressed that the linchpin of such a framework, however, needs to be a working
bankruptcy system, to provide a final resolution for those who cannot repay their debts and a
standard for others, so as to encourage them to settle out of court. For this reason,
they endorsed the plans to make bankruptcy a viable option, and suggested that the
government go further in this direction by shortening the repayment period and reducing official
discrimination against bankrupt persons. Most importantly, these reforms should be enacted
speedily, as accelerating the pace of debt restructuring is critical to hastening the advent of the
recovery. Meanwhile, to restore households’ access to lending, Directors recommended that the
authorities promote the information-sharing needed for an efficient system of competing credit
bureaus.
Reviving the SMEs is another important priority. Directors noted that resources flowing to these
firms have tended to be allocated on the basis of government guarantees, mainly to businesses
first identified during the Asian crisis. This has distorted competition and stifled the dynamism of
the sector, taking a severe toll on its overall financial health. Fundamental reforms are
consequently needed: the current government-led framework needs to be replaced by one
where the private sector allocates resources, funding the firms with the most promising futures.
Directors recommended that the amount of guarantees be scaled back over the medium term,
while the share of each loan covered by guarantees should be reduced, and the cost of
rollovers increased. At the same time, to help SMEs grow, Directors recommended measures to
broaden the range of security for loans, expand the availability of venture capital, reduce startup costs, and improve the efficiency of exits.
Directors considered that improving the investment environment would require modernizing the
labor market. They welcomed the recent improvement in industrial relations, but noted that a
fundamental problem still remains: the strict employment protection for regular workers,
which deters risky investments and has prompted a growing use of nonregular workers.

-4The only way to resolve these problems, Directors considered, would be by reducing
employment protection for regular workers. Accordingly, they welcomed the authorities’ plans to
consider introducing regular labor contracts with less protection, while simultaneously
expanding the social safety net.
Promoting investment also requires improving corporate governance and developing the bond
market, so as to encourage markets to provide more financing, to more firms, at lower cost.
For this reason, Directors welcomed the amendments to the Fair Trade Act, aimed at
encouraging the chaebol to improve their governance. They also welcomed the introduction of
class action lawsuits for securities law violations, and encouraged additional steps to reinforce
market discipline on corporate governance, such as adopting a “comply or explain” system for
the Code of Best Practices in Corporate Governance. In the bond market, Directors
recommended that the government refrain from bailing out investors, which has distorted the
balance between reward and risk, stifling market development.
Directors urged the government to play a leadership role in advancing global trade liberalization,
including by further opening up Korea’s heavily protected agricultural sector. On the proposed
Korea Investment Corporation, Directors urged that its objectives be supported by well-defined
governance, transparency, and accountability arrangements.
While recognizing that the structural reform agenda is ambitious, Directors remained
fundamentally optimistic about rekindling the dynamism of the Korean economy. The Korean
authorities have time and again demonstrated the willingness and ability to take decisive
measures to address the economy’s problems. Moreover, by enacting the reform agenda,
Korea will advance considerably toward achieving a comprehensive market-based framework
that is needed for a return to sustained rapid growth.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Korea will take place on the standard
12-month cycle.
