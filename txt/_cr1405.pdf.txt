ZAMBIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 26, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Zambian economy has performed well in recent years, with strong
growth and modest inflation, and has high growth potential. The government has
resolved to step up development by scaling up investment in infrastructure. However,
this year has seen a significant loosening of fiscal policy, leading to a large fiscal deficit.
Outlook and risks. Assuming front-loaded fiscal adjustment toward a sustainable
deficit, growth is projected to remain strong at 7–8 percent and inflation to decline
gradually to 5 percent over the medium term. Key risks to the outlook are the
uncertainties about fiscal policy and the broader business environment, and a possible
slowdown in emerging markets and its impact on copper prices.
Fiscal stance. The current fiscal stance is unsustainable. To improve Zambia’s fiscal
position, fundamental reforms are required to contain the wage bill and recurrent
expenditures, boost domestic revenue, and create fiscal space for infrastructure
investment. Staff recommended reducing deficits to 5 percent of GDP in 2014 and
gradually to 3 percent over the medium term, and bringing down net domestic
financing to 1½-2 percent of GDP to avoid crowding out the private sector.
Public financial management (PFM). To support fiscal consolidation, PFM reform
needs to be stepped up. Investment planning and implementation also need to be
strengthened to support planned scaling up of capital expenditures, and debt
management strengthened in light of the increasing reliance on non-concessional
financing.
Monetary policy. Given the low level of international reserves, the Bank of Zambia
(BOZ) should allow more exchange rate flexibility and continue to build up reserves in
line with their medium-term target. BOZ also needs to continue to tighten monetary
policy to contain inflation.
Competitiveness. Over the last decade, Zambia’s competitiveness has been boosted
by strengthened macroeconomic fundamentals and a favorable business environment.
However, a series of recent regulations have raised questions about the policy
direction, and high minimum wages could hamper the country’s competitiveness, job
creation, and economic diversification.

DECADE OF PROGRESS BUT THE ECONOMY AT A
CROSSROADS
1.
Decade of progress. Zambia has achieved high, sustained growth—thanks to strong growth
in copper production and prudent macroeconomic policies—and macroeconomic stability over the
past decade, supported by two Extended

update, 2011).
2.
Growth and inflation. Output grew 7.2 percent in 2012, supported by strong performance
in agriculture, construction, and communication services. Growth is expected to decline to 6 percent
in 2013, mainly owing to lower agricultural production. Inflation was slightly above the BOZ target of
7 percent at end-2012, and was 6.9 percent in October 2013, mainly driven by non-food inflation.
3.
Fiscal developments. The government conducted fiscal policy prudently in recent years,
and the 2013 budget targeted a deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP (broadly consistent with the 2012
Article IV recommendations), with significant increases in capital spending. However, the actual fiscal
deficit for 2013 is projected to be roughly double the budgeted level, mainly as a result of significant
overspending on recurrent items, primarily

External position. The current
account was roughly balanced in 2012, but is
expected to move into a deficit of
1.3 percent of GDP in 2013, despite rapidly
growing non-traditional exports, reflecting
lower copper prices and rising imports. FDI
has been increasing in recent years, largely
in mining. International reserves are
increasing slowly, but remain low after sharp
declines earlier in 2013. In January-

ZAMBIA

April 2013, BOZ sold foreign exchange to offset depreciation pressures. The possible tapering of
unconventional monetary policy in the U.S. has had little impact on Zambia’s Eurobond yields, but
reflecting concerns about the Zambian economy, Zambia’s Eurobond spreads have during 2013
increased more than those of other African countries.
5.
Financial sector. The banking sector has grown steadily and remains profitable and wellcapitalized. Private sector credit growth has started slowing down in 2013 from a rapid increase in
the second half of 2012. Nonperforming loans declined to 8.2 percent of total loans in mid-2013
from 15 percent in 2010.
6.
Past advice and recent reform measures. In line with earlier advice, the government
recently made progress in structural reforms by curtailing fuel and agricultural subsidies (Box 1) and
announcing a pension reform plan that will include an increase the pension age to 65 from 55 years.
The authorities have also made progress in improving access to financial services, and the
government increased BOZ’s capital substantially. BOZ has proceeded flexibly and gradually with the
implementation of the increased capital requirement for banks. However, traction on PFM reforms,
including on fiscal reporting and quality control, has been weak and the fiscal situation has
deteriorated sharply in 2013.
Box 1. Subsidy Reform
Subsidies for fuel, maize, and agricultural inputs have in recent years been a source of significant budget
overruns in Zambia. During 2010-13, these subsidies averaged close to 3 percent of GDP in total, of which
only about one quarter was provided for in the original budgets. Aside from being difficult to manage, the
programs have been widely criticized as being excessively costly and not obtaining good value for money.
To rein in expenditures and better target those in need, the Zambian government has embarked on a major
subsidy reform. Retail fuel prices were raised in May 2013 by an average of almost 22 percent, eliminating a
mounting subsidy and generating savings for the government of about 1.2 percent of GDP. Around the
same time, Government announced that it would reduce the scale of the Food Reserve Agency’s operations
and eliminate the difference between its buying and selling price for maize. Moreover, the price of fertilizer
under the Farmer Input Support Program was doubled. While the reforms are still underway and the full
savings are yet to be realized, the combined cost of the latter two programs is expected to be reduced to
1.0 percent of GDP in 2014 from 2.2 percent of GDP on average during 2010-13. In addition, starting from
the 2014 budget, the authorities have decided to accurately reflect all maize-related activity on budget.
Along with the reduction of subsidies, government is scaling up social cash transfers to better assist the
poor. The budgeted allocation to such transfers is being increased almost tenfold to K150 million in 2014
(about 0.1 percent of GDP) to provide some 143,000 of the poorest households with about $12 a month.
This program will cover approximately 13 percent of those in extreme poverty, and for the average recipient
household the transfer should boost consumption by 20 percent and eliminate almost half of the gap to the
food poverty line. Government plans to extend the program nationwide over the coming years as delivery
capacity is built up.

7.
Political and business environment. Zambia’s score in the World Bank’s Doing Business
Indicators has improved over the past decade, largely due to improvements in the ease of getting
credit and enforcing contracts (Appendix I). Policymakers, however, have at times taken measures
adding to costs of doing business and raising uncertainty about the policy direction. The
government banned, in mid-2012, the use of foreign exchange in domestic contracts (creating
problems for some externally-funded businesses, although these were reduced by a later exclusion
of electricity projects from the ban); BOZ introduced caps on lending rates early this year; and the
authorities recently adopted a new regulation to strengthen monitoring of foreign exchange
transactions (adding to business costs, albeit limited by subsequent revisions of the regulation).
8.
Medium-term outlook. The Zambian economy has high growth potential, with its
substantial mineral wealth and largely untapped resources in agriculture, hydropower, and tourism.
In light of the significant policy uncertainties, however, the medium-term outlook for growth and
inflation is uncertain. Assuming front-loaded fiscal reforms leading to a medium-term deficit of
3 percent of GDP, and a business friendly policy environment, staff projects growth to remain at 7–
8 percent and inflation to decline gradually to 5 percent. The proposed fiscal adjustment together
with increased copper production and non-copper exports would improve the current account to
roughly balance by 2018.
9.
Risks. The balance of risks to growth is on the downside due to the uncertainties regarding
the pace of fiscal adjustment and the investment climate. If the needed fiscal adjustment is delayed,
the economy would be highly vulnerable to negative shocks, with low international reserves and
rapidly rising public debt. In addition, the authorities might have difficulty mobilizing the needed
deficit financing (Risk Assessment Matrix). Other risk factors include weather conditions, financial
fallout from a reemergence of financial stress in the euro area, and trade and commodity price
implications of a slowdown in emerging markets such as China. Greater exchange rate flexibility
could help cushion against negative shocks, including disruptions to external financing and
worsening of the terms of trade.
10.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the economy and
outlook. They noted that steps had already been taken to contain the fiscal deficit, including by
removing the fuel subsidy, and that further strong action would be taken in 2014 and over the
medium term. They also emphasized their commitment to maintaining a business friendly
environment, noting that the recent steps to tighten regulation were needed to strengthen
monitoring of the economy and had already revealed some suspicious business activities.

POLICIES GOING FORWARD
11.
Government objectives. The government’s Sixth National Development Plan aims to make
Zambia a prosperous middle income country with an economic program leading to inclusive
growth. Large public investment, particularly on roads and electricity, will lessen key constraints to
economic development. Moreover, a rural focus will support pro-poor growth and an ambitious
target for job creation has been established.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

12.
Policy priorities. Preserving the economy’s hard won macroeconomic stability calls for a
reduction of the fiscal deficit and increased international reserves. This will require mobilizing
additional domestic revenue, realigning spending priorities, and creating fiscal space for
infrastructure investment, while also maintaining a business environment that encourages job
creation. At the same time, the targeted transformation of the Zambian economy requires
fundamental administrative and institutional reforms to promote credible policy implementation,
higher efficiency of public infrastructure investment, and deeper financial intermediation.

A. Fiscal Policy: Close the Financing Gaps and Realign Priorities
13.
Developments in 2013. The fiscal deficit for 2013 is projected to reach 8.6 percent of GDP,
assuming that the government implements planned fourth quarter spending cuts through reducing
spending on goods and services (0.3 percent of GDP savings relative to the budget for the fourth
quarter) and maintaining capital spending at least 0.5 percent of GDP below the annual budget.
Virtually all categories of spending have deviated substantially from approved levels. The sharp
increase in wages (45 percent, compared to the budgeted 9.1 percent),1 and the large overruns on
subsidies—4.0 percent of GDP, compared to a budget of less than 0.7 percent—forced the
government to make sharp cuts in goods and services, intergovernmental transfers, and capital
spending. To finance the above-budget deficit, the authorities have increased issuance of Treasury
bills, used part of the 2012 Eurobond proceeds that had earlier been transferred to SOEs for
investments but had not yet been spent, and intend to borrow abroad via a syndicated loan.
14.
There are risks that the fiscal deficit for 2013 will be higher than currently planned, if
the authorities fail to implement the spending cuts discussed with the mission. This could lead to a
substantial accumulation of arrears and/or reliance on central bank financing. In this regard, staff
expressed concern about the recourse to central bank bridge loans, which are intended to assist
with cash management but could—if not quickly repaid—constitute central bank financing of the
budget.
15.
The current fiscal stance is clearly
unsustainable. Rating agencies have recently
downgraded Zambia’s credit rating, citing
sharply deteriorated government finances.
Without a change in policies, government
debt would rise in net present value from
about 30 percent of GDP in 2013 to over
50 percent by 2018, with the debt financing
predominantly recurrent expenditures.

16.
Proposed fiscal adjustment over the medim term. Discussions on the 2014 budget took
place before the authorities had finalized their plans. Staff advised addressing the fiscal gaps and
creating space for spending on infrastructure, health, and education by taking measures to boost
domestic revenue and contain the wage bill and other recurrent expenditures. Given the small size
of the domestic financial market, in line with earlier staff advice, net domestic financing should not
exceed 1½–2 percent of GDP in the medium term, so as not to crowd out private sector credit. In
addition, given limited debt management and project assessment and implementation capacities, as
well as the limited availability of concessional financing, staff believes reliance on external financing
should also be contained and gradually reduced. Thus, staff recommended reducing the fiscal deficit
to 5 percent of GDP in 2014, in line with the MTEF approved by Cabinet in September, and gradually
to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. Given the recent fiscal slippages and to anchor the
needed fiscal adjustment, staff stressed the importance of adopting, and then following, prudent
budgets.


Long-term fiscal anchor. Staff proposed—and the authorities agreed—that fiscal policy
should target a roughly unchanged debt to GDP ratio over the medium term. The proposed
debt level is moderate but, considering the limited absorptive and debt management
capacities, debt-financed additional spending is not recommended to maintain
macroeconomic stability. To finance the needed investment in infrastructure, revenue
measures are needed in addition to external borrowing. Moreover, maintaining fiscal space
will be important given the economy’s dependence on copper and its volatile prices. In light
of the expected increases in mining revenue over the medium term, the authorities will need
to consider the implications of possible revenue volatility in conducting macroeconomic
policy as well as the benefits of introducing a fiscal rule over the medium term.



Staff Medium-Term Recommendations: Revenue
Revenue measures. Staff
Measures

cautioned against any

Staff proposed revenue
measures of about
2.3 percent of GDP over
the medium term through
broadening the tax base (text box), based on the recommendations of the recent FAD tax
policy mission. The authorities need to continue strengthening mining tax administration.
Staff advised against raising the PIT tax free threshold, which the authorities were
considering, noting that the threshold is already high at 3 times GNI per capita. The
proposed tax measures together with rising mining revenue and improved non-tax revenue
collection are expected to raise revenues by 5 percent of GDP over the medium term.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA



Rationalize the wage bill, which is projected to be 54 percent of domestic revenue in 2014.
To mitigate this year’s large wage increase, staff supported the government’s plan to freeze
wages in 2014 and 2015 and net recruitment in 2014, and further proposed reducing the
wage bill to not more than 35 percent of domestic revenue over the medium term and
eventually to not more than 8 percent of GDP. To achieve the medium term target will
require very tight wage policy through at least 2016. To enhance budget predictability and
contain the wage bill, multi-year wage agreements (for the period after 2015)2 and civil
service reforms will be needed, including a review of staffing levels (Appendix III). In this
context, the government has embarked on a multi-year civil service reform program that
aims to strengthen the efficiency of the public sector by, among other things, introducing a
performance management system, rationalizing the pay scale, and streamlining allowances.



Fuel subsidies. Staff welcomed the removal of fuel subsidies and stressed the importance of
adopting an automatic pricing mechanism to avoid the recurrence of subsidies and to
attract much needed investments in the area.



Maize marketing and fertilizer subsidies. Staff supported the authorities’ decision to
reduce fertilizer subsidies and fully reflect the Food Reserve Agency’s (FRA) operations in the
budget, and urged them to stick to the announced policy of limiting FRA activities to
maintaining a modest strategic reserve. Additional reforms to support a larger role for the
private sector, including the elimination of export bans, could help boost agricultural output
and rural development more generally.



Pension system. The Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF) has accumulated pension arrears of
an estimated 1.1 percent of GDP, and its annual funding is insufficient to prevent the
accumulation of new arrears. Staff supported the government’s intention to reform the
system (Box 2), including through increasing the retirement age to 65 from 55 years.

In addition, staff strongly supports the proposal to move wage negotiations with civil servants to before, rather than
after, budget approval.

Box 2. Pension Reform
The public pension system in Zambia is complicated by the presence of three different schemes: i) the
National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA), to which all new entrants to the formal sector since 2000 are
mandated to contribute, ii) The PSPF for central government workers, and iii) The Local Authorities
Superannuation Fund (LASF) for subnational government and public utility workers. The PSPF and LASF have
been closed to new entrants since 2000. Moreover, pensions for all three funds are based on ultimately
unsustainable benefit rules. And the PSPF and LASF have been running large deficits. The central
government has been partially financing the deficit of the PSPF to slow down the pace of arrears
accumulation, but the stock of PSPF arrears to pensioners are nevertheless expected to reach 1.1 percent of
GDP by end-2013.
Supported by the finding of an FAD TA mission, staff recommended near- and medium-term measures to
strengthen the sustainability of the pension systems including: i) transferring members of PSPF and LASF to
NAPSA, which is currently in surplus, under a dual-benefit system, ii) raising the statutory retirement age
from 55 to 65 gradually, (iii) reducing the current bias towards lump sum payments by lowering the
commutation rate, introducing penalties for early retirement, and indexing benefits to inflation, (iv) raising
the contribution rates of PSPF and LASF workers to the NAPSA rate of 10 percent, (v) strengthening
collection capacity within NAPSA.
The authorities have announced their intention to put the public pension system on a sustainable footing,
including by raising the retirement age to 65. However, the full details and timing of the reform are not yet
available.



Capital spending and financing. Staff recommended a more gradual path of increase in
capital spending, in light of capacity constraints, and limiting external borrowing for capital
projects to what is needed each year rather than issuing a Eurobond adequate to cover the
full cost of multi-year investment projects. In the case of the latter, the government must
bear additional interest costs, and there will be a risk that the funds will be diverted to lower
priority spending.

17.
Proposed 2014 budget. Staff stressed that the proposed 2014 budget does not take
sufficient steps to start addressing the large fiscal deficit. The budget submitted to Parliament in
October calls for a deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP in 2014, above staff’s recommendation of 5 percent.
The budget aims to increase domestic revenue by about 1.3 percent of GDP, mainly through nontax
measures (including bringing revenue from FRA and other government agencies on budget, raising
road tolls, and introducing a surcharge on money transfers). Contrary to staff’s advice, the budget
proposes raising the PIT tax-free threshold to K3,000 from the current 2,200, which will generate a
revenue loss of about 1 percent of GDP.3 The budget also proposes a wage freeze for 2014

income taxes.

and 2015, as well as a net recruitment freeze for 2014 and limits FRA activities to maintaining a
strategic reserve.
18.
In addition to the higher than desirable planned deficit, there are substantial downside
risks to the proposed 2014 budget. Based on available information, staff estimates that revenue
and spending policies in the budget would produce a deficit of 7.4 percent of GDP, about 1 percent
of GDP higher than budgeted.4 Moreover, the proposed wage and hiring freezes will be difficult to
achieve given opposition from unions. Even modest increases in wages and new recruitments could

Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to ensure that the fiscal
deficit for 2013 does not go beyond 8.5 percent of GDP. They will cut low-priority spending as
needed to meet the deficit projection. Regarding the risks to the 2014 budget, the authorities
reaffirmed that the government will stick to the proposed wage and net recruitment freeze and that
additional measures will be taken as needed to meet the 2014 deficit target. Starting next year,
revenues and expenditures of FRA and other government agencies will be monitored by the
Treasury. Across the public sector, steps are being taken to strengthen governance and
accountability, including new measures to improve procurement of petroleum and fertilizer.
20.
While the authorities have not finalized their medium-term fiscal plans, they broadly
agreed with staff’s recommendations to gradually reduce the deficit to 3 percent of GDP, net
domestic financing to 1½–2 percent of GDP, and the wage bill to not more than 35 percent of
revenues.6 They did not fully agree with the long-term target of a wage bill less than 8 percent of
GDP, noting that the need to hire teachers, health care workers, and agricultural extension workers
may make this impossible. In addition, while the authorities agree it will be important to eventually
develop a fiscal strategy to insulate the budget from volatile copper revenues, they do not see this
4

The deficit could be significantly higher if the increase in nontax revenue falls short of the authorities’ ambitious
projections.

5

The baseline in Tables 2 and 3 assumes a fiscal outcome in 2014 based on the authorities’ planned financing. Over
the medium term the baseline assumes that the authorities arrive at their medium-term target of raising tax revenue
by around 3 percent of GDP over 2014-18 through the measures recommended by staff, and that recurrent
expenditures are contained to levels agreed upon during discussions with a gradual increase in capital spending. For
this baseline to hold, the authorities would need to identify additional measures to arrive at their targeted deficit.

The attached fiscal tables reflect these medium-term fiscal goals. As the authorities have not yet spelled out all
policies required to meet these goals, the tables include a line for fiscal measures yet to be taken.

as an urgent need, in light of the fact that significant copper tax revenue remains some years in the
future.

B. PFM: Step up Reforms to Support Fiscal Consolidation
21.
Developments. The recent PEFA assessment found a deterioration in PFM, including
reporting and quality control. Procurement practices have also deteriorated, with single-source
contracts for some large projects. While the rollout of the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) has continued, its implementation, as well as that of the Treasury Single
Account (TSA), has been weak, and only release-based fiscal data are available. In addition,
consolidation of financing data with the BOZ needs to be improved.
22.
Staff stressed the importance of stepping up PFM reform to support fiscal
consolidation and improve budget planning and implementation. Staff underlined the
importance of (i) enhancing budget credibility and consistency between the National Development
Plan, Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, and annual budget; (ii) improving fiscal data as well as
forecasts by enhancing the macro fiscal framework; (iii) expanding the coverage of the TSA by
closing line ministries’ accounts at commercial banks; (iv) improving collaboration between units at
the Ministry of Finance, and with the BOZ, to produce fiscal data based on expenditures rather than
releases; (v) strengthening IFMIS implementation and controls; and (vi) providing additional
resources to the Accountant General’s Department to support these reforms.
23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the need to improve cash management and
improve collaboration across ministry units and with the BOZ. They noted that, with TA from donors,
they will be refocusing efforts in this area and have recently adopted a new PFM reform strategy.
Progress has been slow in implementing the multi-donor funded Public Expenditure Management
and Accountability (PEMFA) program prepared in 2010. They indicated that the recommendations of
the November 2013 FAD mission will be used to further develop the reform program, including
prioritization and sequencing, and will inform further strategic discussions with donors on support
for PFM reform.

finance needed infrastructure.7 Selected municipalities and SOEs have proposed issuing sub-national
Eurobonds totaling $4.5 billion (over 20 percent of 2012 GDP). Such issuances would likely require
government guarantees.
25.
Staff supported the Minister’s opposition to the proposed sub-national Eurobonds,
and advised that, to the extent these projects are of national importance, it would be preferable to
issue sovereign bonds, which should be budgeted and on lent to sub-national entities with proper
monitoring. Any such borrowing should also be in line with (i) macroeconomic stability and
fiscal/debt sustainability; (ii) project appraisal, management and monitoring capacity; and (iii) debt
management capacity and strategy. In this regard, staff encouraged the authorities to request a
voluntary update of the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DEMPA) conducted in 2011,
as well as to request TA from the World Bank to assist in finalizing their medium-term debt strategy.
26.
Debt sustainability analysis (DSA). Zambia’s external and public debt remains relatively
low, and an updated DSA based on the authorities’ planned fiscal adjustment scenario continues to
indicate a low risk of debt stress, despite higher borrowing envisaged than in the previous DSA
(Attachment). Absent adjustment, however, the debt ratio would rise sharply, with the fixed primary
fiscal balance scenario demonstrating clearly the need for fiscal adjustment.
27.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations on the
proposed sub-national Eurobonds as well as with the DSA results. They indicated that, to strengthen
debt management, the International Debt Management Department will be restructured in tandem
with a restructuring of the Ministry of Finance and stressed that Zambia will not fall into another
debt trap, after receiving large debt relief in the 2000s.

D. Monetary Policy: Ensure Flexibility to Maintain Macroeconomic Stability
28.
Developments. Inflation has in recent months remained at around 7 percent, above the
BOZ’s end-2013 target of 6 percent, reflecting the removal of fuel subsidies, and inflationary
pressure is expected to rise due to the large civil servant wage increases and reduction of maize
subsidies.8 Following the elimination of fuel and maize subsidies, the BOZ increased the policy rate
twice (25 bps each time) to 9.75 percent to contain inflationary pressure.9 Bank liquidity has been
highly volatile. The BOZ has been under political pressure to lower lending rates and strengthen the
kwacha.

7

Zambia’s maiden sovereign bond issue in September 2012 was a 10-year dollar-denominated bond, in the amount
of $750m (initially $500 million). Orders for the offer amounted to some $12 billion, allowing the country to price the
bond at a yield of just 5.625 percent.
8

Food comprises 53 percent of Zambia’s consumer price index basket so the BOZ uses headline inflation as its
inflation target while monitoring food and non-food inflation developments.
9

The policy rate was introduced in April 2012 to replace reserve money targeting as BOZ’s main monetary policy
tool.

Monetary policy framework. Staff welcomed the progress that the BOZ has made in
transitioning from conducting monetary policy through targeting reserve money to conducting
policy through the policy rate. However, more needs to be done, including strengthening
understanding of the interest rate transmission mechanism, improving liquidity forecasting and
management, and developing high frequency indicators of economic activity. Pending further
progress in these areas, staff supported

exchange rates. The BOZ has started
building up reserves slowly as the kwacha

losing reserves rapidly early this year
during a brief (now ended) period of
providing foreign exchange to finance oil
imports. Given the economy’s vulnerability
to negative shocks and the current low

Monetary policy stance. The
significant fiscal policy changes this year
greatly complicate the BOZ’s task of
controlling inflation. Staff supported the
authorities’ intention to implicitly increase
their inflation target for end-2013 to
7.5 percent to accommodate the first
round effects of the removal of fuel and
maize subsidies (estimated at 1–
1½ percentage points). Staff emphasized
the importance of continuing to tighten
monetary policy, in order to resist the
second round effects of the removal of
subsidies and the inflationary pressure
from the large civil servant wage increases.

months of imports for 2013), staff advised the BOZ to allow more exchange rate flexibility and to
continue to build up reserves in line with their medium-term target of 4 months of imports, using
reserves to offset temporary exchange rate movements, but not to resist sustained depreciation
pressures when they exist. Staff analysis suggested that the kwacha remains broadly in line with
fundamentals (Appendix IV).
32.
Exchange restrictions. The authorities amended the BOZ Act and introduced new foreign
exchange market regulations to strengthen monitoring of external transactions. LEG had judged that
the initial version of the regulation on foreign exchange transactions violated Article VIII of the IMF’s
Articles of Agreement:


On June 25, 2013, the Zambian authorities issued Statutory Instrument 55 of 2013, which
regulates the monitoring of foreign exchange transactions and includes two measures that
give rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a).
The first exchange restriction arises from the requirement that a person making payments of
dividends in foreign exchange provide a tax clearance certificate and evidence of payment of
corporate or income tax. The second exchange restriction arises from the requirement that
payments for royalties, management fees, technical fees, commissions or consultancy fees in
foreign exchange be accompanied by evidence of corporate tax payments. Both measures
give rise to exchange restrictions subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a)
because they impose limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of
payments of current international transactions based on noncompliance with obligations
that are unrelated to the proposed transaction.

33.
The authorities have been working closely with the Fund staff to eliminate the
exchange restrictions in the regulation, while maintaining their goal of strengthened monitoring.
It is expected that the authorities will amend the regulation to be compliant with Article VIII before
the Board meeting.
34.
Authorities’ views. The BOZ acknowledged that moving to a policy rate-based regime is a
transitional process. They noted that, utilizing the ongoing Norway/MCM TA, the BOZ will continue
to develop all the structures necessary for the effective functioning of the policy rate as the main
monetary policy tool. To improve liquidity forecasting, the BOZ plans to work together with the
government to enhance the flow of information on government transactions. The BOZ stressed that
to avoid a wage-price spiral, they are prepared to act to offset inflationary pressures from the large
civil service wage increase, and noted the recent increase in BOZ’s budget for open market
operations. The authorities agreed with the exchange rate assessment and acknowledged the need
to further build up international reserves, but noted that they are reluctant to do so when the
kwacha is depreciating.

E. Financial Sector: Address Structural Constraints
35.
Background. The authorities are concerned about high lending rates and limited access to
credit by SMEs, which prompted the introduction of caps on lending rates (Appendix V).10 The
banking system is highly concentrated, with the top four banks’ assets amounting to about
60 percent of total banking sector assets. The banking system’s loan-to-deposit ratio is low at
around 65 percent, indicating that the lack of bankable projects and borrowers is the main reason
for limited credit delivery. The overall framework and practices for banking supervision are broadly
compliant with the Basel Core Principles (Financial Sector Assessment Program Update, 2009).
36.
Lending rate ceilings. Staff noted

increasingly binding. Staff advised that to
reduce interest rates, efforts should focus on reforms to enhance competition in the banking sector,
and help SMEs develop credible business plans. If the authorities are determined to maintain the
lending rate ceilings, at the very least it will be important to adjust them in line with market rate
increases. One way to achieve this would be to tie the ceiling to the average Treasury bill rate, rather
than to the policy rate.
37.
Financial inclusion. Staff welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to enhance financial
services delivery by strengthening the Credit

The interest rate caps were initially set at 18.25 percent for banks, 30 percent for non-banks, and 42 percent for
microfinance institutions, with the levels tied to the BoZ policy rate.

contribute to a reduced cost of loans for SMEs than the lending rate cap.
38.
Banks’ new capital requirement. To strengthen the balance sheets of banks, the authorities
increased the minimum capital requirement.11 All but a few small banks are expected to meet the
new requirements by the end of 2013. Given the rapid increase in private sector credit in the second
half of 2012 and the new higher bank capital, staff supported the BOZ’s intensive banking
supervision to assess a potential build-up in vulnerability and risks to financial stability.
39.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that private sector credit has continued to
increase since the introduction of the lending rate ceilings and that the nonbank sector is being
restructured, including by marginal and inefficient nonbanks’ exit from the market. They indicated
that BOZ is carefully monitoring developments in bank and nonbank lending, and has also asked a
foreign consultant to conduct an in-depth study of the impact of the lending rate ceilings. The
authorities noted financial inclusion as a policy priority. Given limited financial system infrastructure
in Zambia, agent banking is being pursued as a low cost solution, particularly in rural areas.

F. Boosting Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth

41.
Minimum wages. A sharp
increase in 2012 brought the minimum
wage in Zambia to about 1½ times per
capita GDP. The private sector and NGOs
noted that the high minimum wage is
hampering the country’s competitiveness
and formal employment.12 Moreover,

Minimum Wage over GDP per Capita

40.
Background. Over the last decade, Zambia’s competitiveness has been boosted by
strengthened macroeconomic fundamentals and a supportive business environment. Zambia’s
business environment remains favorable compared to other countries in the region,
but weaknesses in infrastructure and human capital as well as the recently more interventionist
regulatory approach and related uncertainty about the policy direction are impediments to
continued progress. Moreover, while non-copper exports have increased rapidly in recent years, the
country remains reliant on copper exports. To secure continued growth and diversification, Zambia

The capital requirement was increased in 2012 from $2.4 million to $20 million for locally owned banks and to
$100 million for foreign-owned banks, but banks have been given to end-2013 to meet the new requirement.
12

The minimum wage law applies to the formal private sector, and sets different minimums for different job
categories, including domestics, shopkeepers, and general workers. In the public sector, the lowest wage paid is
much higher than specified in the minimum wage law.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ZAMBIA

some in government are considering pressuring private companies to match the new government
minimum wage, which is roughly 4½ times per capita GDP and 2½ times the current minimum
wage in the private sector. Minimum wages of this magnitude would inhibit job creation by driving
many employers out of business and resulting in a sharp decline in both domestic and foreign
investments. It could also lead to further reliance on informal sector jobs, where workers have less
protection.
42.
Authorities’ views. The authorities stressed that the government is ramping up capital
spending on infrastructure to address key impediments to inclusive growth and competitiveness.
They noted that the 2012 increase in the statutory minimum wage had been overdue as it had not
been adjusted between 2006 and 2011, but also that views by some officials on extending the new
government minimum to the private sector or introducing sector-based differentiation were their
personal views, not the government’s.

G. Strengthening Statistics
43.
While data provision needs improvement, especially on balance of payments and fiscal
reporting, data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Efforts are ongoing to improve national
accounts data with plans to rebase to 2010 by next year. However, gaps in balance of payments data
remain in several areas including reinvested exporter earnings, trade in services, and the financial
account (Informational Annex). Fiscal data is not robust due to weak data consolidation and limited
classification harmonization across government institutions and the BOZ. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ continued efforts to improve data quality and availability and recommended a data
ROSC to fully assess Zambia’s data situation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
The Zambian economy has performed well in recent years, with strong growth and
modest inflation, and has high growth potential. The government has resolved to step up
development by scaling up investment in infrastructure. However, this year has seen a substantial
loosening of fiscal policy, leading to a large fiscal deficit.
45.
The current fiscal stance is unsustainable. To address risks of large arrears accumulations
and additional central bank financing in 2013, it will be important for the authorities to adhere to
their plans to reduce low-priority investment spending, and contain goods and services spending.
Staff recommends firmly addressing the fiscal slippages in 2014 and continuing to reduce fiscal
deficits over the medium term. Medium-term reforms are required to contain the wage bill and
recurrent expenditure, boost domestic revenue, and create fiscal space for infrastructure investment.
Staff recommends reducing the fiscal deficit to 5 percent of GDP in 2014 and gradually to 3 percent
of GDP over the medium term, and bringing down net domestic financing to 1½–2 percent of GDP
a year to avoid crowding out the private sector.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

46.
The proposed 2014 budget does not take sufficient steps to begin addressing the large
fiscal deficit. Staff estimates that the spending and revenue policies in the budget will produce a
deficit of at least 7.4 percent of GDP, much higher than the recommended 5 percent. Staff cautions
against the proposed increase in the tax-free threshold on personal income tax, which would further
reduce the already narrow tax base. The government should take stronger revenue measures than
budgeted and stick to the proposed wage and recruitment freezes, to contain the already excessive
wage bill. Staff welcomes the government’s decision to remove fuel and maize subsidies, to limit
FRA activities to maintaining a strategic reserve, and to fully reflect FRA revenue and expenditure in
the budget.
47.
Public financial management reform needs to be stepped up to support fiscal
consolidation. Staff welcomes the authorities’ stated commitment to working with its partners to
strengthen PFM, and urges the authorities to attach high priority to these efforts, especially on fiscal
reporting and budgetary controls.
48.
The progress made in transitioning to conducting monetary policy through the policy
rate is welcome. However, more needs to be done, including strengthening understanding of the
interest rate transmission mechanism, improving liquidity forecasting and management, and
developing high frequency indicators of economic activity. Pending further progress in these areas,
staff supports the BOZ’s intention to increasingly conduct monetary policy through the policy rate,
while nonetheless seeking to keep reserve money and bank liquidity in check.
49.
The BOZ needs to continue tightening monetary policy. The significant fiscal policy
changes this year complicate the BOZ’s task of controlling inflation. Staff supports the authorities’
intention to increase their inflation target to accommodate the first round effects of the removal of
fuel and maize subsidies. However, tighter monetary policy is needed to resist second round effects
of the removal of subsidies and inflationary pressure from the large civil servant wage increases.
Given the current low level of reserves, staff advises the BOZ to allow more exchange rate flexibility
and continue to build up reserves in line with their medium-term target in order to limit the
economy’s vulnerability to negative shocks.
50.
Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the financial sector and improve
access to financial services. Staff recommends the elimination of the lending rate ceilings
introduced early this year, which restrict access to credit, particularly for SMEs, and are becoming
increasingly binding, or, at a minimum, tying the lending rate ceiling to the Treasury bill rate. To
reduce lending rates, efforts should instead focus on reforms to enhance competition in the banking
sector and address high business costs. The planned introduction of a unified collateral registry
system, agency banking guidelines, and steps to improve land titling will facilitate credit provision
and improve access to financial services particularly in rural areas.
51.
Maintaining a good business environment is important for strong growth and
economic diversification. Over the last decade, Zambia’s competitiveness has been boosted by
strengthened macroeconomic fundamentals and a favorable business environment. However,
regulatory changes in a number of areas have raised costs of doing business and created

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

uncertainty about the policy direction. Moreover, wage increases that outstrip productivity would
hamper the country’s competitiveness and job creation. Staff strongly advises against pressuring
private sector employers to match the government’s new minimum wage, as this would significantly
undermine competitiveness.
52.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Based on a recent Bank of Zambia survey on foreign private investment, the authorities are in the process of revising data for 2012 and the first half of
2013 on FDI inflows and their financing composition (reinvested earnings, borrowing from investors, equity capital). As the authorities were still analyzing
this new data at the time the staff report was completed, this data has not been reflected in the tables in this report.

Appendix I. Competitiveness1
Over the last decade, Zambia’s competitiveness has been boosted by strengthened macroeconomic
fundamentals and a favorable business environment. However, exports remain dominated by copper,
and weaknesses in infrastructure, scarcity of skilled labor and rising labor costs, and recent uncertainty
about the policy direction pose challenges to sustaining rapid economic development. To secure
continued growth and diversification, Zambia will need to boost investment in infrastructure and
enhance provision of education, while maintaining a business friendly environment.
Background
Zambia’s economy has over the past decade expanded rapidly. Overall output growth has been
strong at an average of 6.2 percent a year since 2003, about half a percentage point more than for
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a whole. This positive outcome has been supported by prudent
macroeconomic policies that kept fiscal balances and inflation in check as well as by rising copper
prices that improved the country’s terms of trade.
While exports remain dominated by copper, noncopper exports are now growing rapidly. Increased
copper production notwithstanding, the largest

contributors to real GDP growth over the past

Sustaining Zambia’s strong overall growth performance in the face of uncertain prospects for
copper prices will require that the ongoing diversification of the economy is maintained. That, in
turn, will require a supportive business environment and availability of credit and needed human
and infrastructure resources. This appendix examines the progress and challenges towards
improving the business environment, access to finance, and labor quality and cost. Additionally, the

annex considers key issues relating to the agricultural sector, where the majority of the workforce
remains employed.
The Business Environment
According to the World Bank’s Doing Business indicators, Zambia’s business environment—although
middling from a global perspective—is among the best in Africa.2 At 83rd in the world, Zambia’s
doing business ranking is the 7th highest in SSA and in Southern Africa is only surpassed by South
Africa and Botswana.3 Moreover, Zambia is 47th worldwide in terms of overall progress since 2005.
Zambia performs especially well in areas such as the ease of starting a business, getting credit, and
dealing with construction permits. The country also benefits greatly from political stability and a
conflict-free setting.

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see
www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness), care should be exercised when interpreting these indicators given subjective
interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small number of informants which tend to overstate
the indicators' coverage and explanatory power.

In Doing Business 2014, Zambia’s ranking of 83, compares to 41 for South Africa, 56 for Botswana, 98 for Namibia,
123 for Swaziland, 136 for Lesotho, 170 for Zimbabwe, and an average of 141 for SSA.

Constraints on competitiveness include lacking

transport infrastructure. Moreover, a shortage of
electricity despite sizable hydropower potential
is a major impediment to growth. In addition, a
series of recent regulatory changes, including

international transactions, have added to firms’
costs. Imposed with little prior consultation among stakeholders and in some cases revised multiple
times, these new regulations have also raised uncertainty about the policy direction.
Efforts towards modernizing transport and energy infrastructure would help ease the structural
bottlenecks. Zambia has a fast-growing market for exports to neighboring countries, including for
agricultural products, cement, and electricity. If well implemented, the country’s plans to upgrade
road, rail, and power infrastructure could provide important support to continued economic
development by facilitating trade internationally as well as within Zambia. Calderon (2009) measures
the potential growth dividend from infrastructure improvement in Zambia and estimates that
bringing the country’s infrastructure to a level comparable to the regional leader (Mauritius) would
boost real GDP per capita growth by

The study does not specify how long such a growth dividend would last, but by using a linear estimate based on
data spanning 1960-2005, the methodology suggests that the effect would persist over possibly several decades.

that facilitate access to credit, reflecting the depth of its credit information infrastructure and good
enforcement of contracts. Progress in this area has helped boost overall credit growth to an average
of over 30 percent during 2011-12. Notably, the share of credit to sectors such as agriculture and
manufacturing—where access to finance is traditionally limited in SSA—is significantly higher than in
peer countries. Overall, however, Zambia’s financial depth remains shallow compared to its peers,
with credit to the private sector at 15 percent of GDP in 2012, well below the median for lowermiddle income countries in the region of 28 percent of GDP.
Foreign financing is another important source of investment funding in Zambia, but inflows have
largely been limited to the mining sector. As of 2011, almost 70 percent of Zambia’s $11 billion
stock of inward foreign direct
investment (FDI) was in the mining
sector. These investments have
enabled a surge in copper production
from an estimated 260 thousand tons
in 2000 to current levels of about
800 thousand tons a year. More FDI
inflows into other sectors besides
mining would support overall growth,
as foreign investment not only boosts
available resources but also tends to
bring know-how and technological
improvement.

Human Capital and Cost of Labor
Aside from high transport costs and other infrastructure weaknesses, the availability and cost of
human capital is an important constraint on Zambia’s competitiveness, even as health and education
indictors show considerable progress in recent years. Life expectancy at birth has increased by over
15 percent since 2002; HIV prevalence among adults is on a declining trend; and school enrollment
rates have increased markedly. At 6.7 years, average schooling compares favorably within the region:
on par with Ghana and exceeding all low-income neighbors in the region and even Namibia, and
slightly above the average for countries assessed to have medium human development by the
UNDP.

However, there remains significant scope for improvement. Life expectancy is among the lowest in
Sub-Saharan Africa, even when compared to lower-income Malawi where HIV prevalence is similar.
Access to education and health services remains very limited in rural areas. Water and sanitation
conditions remain poor, with only 50 percent of rural population having access to improved water
sources. Moreover, even those with access to schooling often receive a substandard education, with
Zambian students underperforming in both reading and mathematics compared with their peers in
other countries (Hungi and others 2010). This is in part due to an elevated pupil-to-teacher ratio in
primary education, which at 61 in 2011 was the highest in the region after the Central African
Republic and Chad, as sampled by the World Bank. Teachers are especially scarce in rural areas due
to the difficulty of attracting qualified candidates.
High labor costs are another challenge. Labor costs in Zambia have contributed to high levels of
informality or self-employment, with wage employment estimated at only 16.8 percent of total
employment in 2010 (World Bank, 2013). Based on firm-level data, labor costs in manufacturing at
about $2,100 in 2007 were among the highest in SSA, although on par with other regions when
viewed in relation to productivity. Since 2007, however, minimum wages in the private sector have
increased by about 80 percent in real terms and currently stand at close to $2,600 a year (about
160 percent of GDP per capita) when allowances are included. Moreover, following the recent wage
increase for civil servants, the lowest wage in the public sector is now about $6,500 a year—about
4½ times GDP per capita and 2½ times the minimum wage for the private sector—and is bound to
put further upward pressure on wages in the private sector.

Agriculture
A key sector for continued economic development in Zambia is agriculture. While agriculture
accounts for 55 to 65 percent of total
employment, the sector’s contribution to
GDP stands at less than 10 percent. The
country is very well endowed for farming,
but less than 20 percent of arable land is
cultivated and most farmers operate on a
subsistence basis with low productivity.

obtaining land titles and finance, and policies that have been overly focused on maize to the
detriment of crops with higher income potential. With effective efforts to address these constraints,
the sector could be a significant source of export earnings and a major driver of poverty reduction.
Conclusion
Zambia’s favorable business environment and strong macroeconomic fundamentals have supported
high economic growth over the past decade. More recently, there has been rapid progress towards
diversifying exports and lessening the country’s dependence on copper. This all speaks to the
healthy competitiveness of the Zambian economy. Nevertheless, the country faces significant
constraints that will hold back continued growth and diversification unless addressed. These include
an inadequate infrastructure, especially in transportation and electricity; poor health and education
standards; high labor costs in the formal sector; and low yields in agriculture. These are all areas that
are being targeted in the National Development Plan. The challenge will be to ensure that fiscal
space is made available for the resulting spending needs and also to ensure that what is spent is
effectively used. Careful planning and prioritization is needed, supported by evaluation of
implementation capacity, estimates of return on investment, and clear communication.

Likelihood
(high, medium or low)

Expected Impact on Economy
(high, medium or low)

Medium
The needed fiscal adjustment to
address the emerging financing
gaps would be delayed until
after the next elections in 2016.

High
Given the government’s high funding needs, the failure
to contain the wage bill and other recurrent
expenditure could reduce needed capital and social
spending (which will hurt growth potential and poverty
reduction), or crowd out private sector credit, raise
interest rates, and prompt currency depreciation (which
will hurt growth and generate inflationary pressure).
Public debt would rise rapidly, reducing fiscal buffers.

Low to Medium
The measures taken recently to
tighten regulation of interest
rates, together with the
increases in minimum and
government wages and concern
about fiscal sustainability could
undermine investor confidence.

Medium to High
Loss of investor confidence could result in a sharp drop
in FDI, which will hurt exports, job creation, and growth
potential.

Re-emergence
of financial
stress in the
Euro area

Medium
Re-emergence of financial
stress in the Euro area as a
result of stalled or incomplete
delivery of national or Euro area
policy commitments could lead
to strains in cost of market
access for peripheral
sovereigns.

Medium
Given the emerging fiscal financing gaps, Zambia needs
a substantial amount of external financing. A sustained
shutdown of global funding markets would put
pressure on the domestic government securities
market, leading to a rise in interest rates and crowding
out private sector credit.

Lower than

Medium
Lower demand from emerging
markets, especially China, could
result in a substantial drop in
commodity prices.

Medium
A substantial fall in commodity prices, particularly
copper prices, could result in a sharp drop in exports
and FDI in the mining sector. Part of the impact would
be offset by lower profit and dividend payments to
foreign owners.

Loss of investor
confidence in
the Zambian

environment

Zambia’s funding costs in the global capital markets
could rise substantially, resulting in additional debt
service costs for the government given its need for
substantial external financing.

A deterioration in the current account could weaken

Appendix III. A Regional Comparison of
Government Wage Spending1,2
This appendix illustrates how Zambia compares to peer countries in the region on government wage
spending.3 The rapid increase in average wages that took place in September 2013 is raising pressures
on government finances, potentially crowding out public investment and priority spending in health
and education. This appendix also illustrates a few recent examples from countries where public wage
spending increased rapidly describing macroeconomic outcomes following such spending and policies
that may have helped mitigate the impact of ratcheted wage increases. Finally, the appendix draws
implications for Zambia.

investment expenditure.
Government wage spending can be a significant contributor to fiscal, and in some cases
external, imbalances due to the ratcheting impact of such spending on expenditure. Rising
wage spending not only affects fiscal balances, but through rising demand for imports may have
repercussion on the external position. Wage commitments are politically difficult to reverse through
cutting wages or firing public workers. The following section examines cases from three countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa: Angola, Botswana, and Ghana.

in Angola; 22 percent in 2010 in Botswana; 45 percent in 2011 followed by 66 percent in 2012 in
Ghana). 4 These countries raised their wage bill in excess of 1.5 percent of GDP in one year through
increased salaries in Botswana and Ghana, and increased recruitment in the case of Angola. Only
Angola has managed to reduce the wage burden from peak through containing wages and
adjusting the exchange rate, which was further helped by rising oil revenue. All three countries
experienced rising fiscal deficits and loss in international reserve coverage following the wage
increase with two of the countries, Angola and Ghana, experiencing significant exchange rate
depreciation.5

with a decline in real wage spending
helped reduce this ratio to around 20 percent of revenues in 2010. The exchange rate depreciated in
both countries significantly with devaluation in the case of Angola by 22 percent over 2008-10, and
by 26 percent in Ghana over 2010-12. While exchange rate depreciation contributed to rising
inflation in Angola, it had limited impact on inflation in Ghana where monetary policy tightened
significantly. Tightened monetary policy in Ghana raised rates on government bonds, which
attracted portfolio inflows and stemmed the decline in gross international reserve coverage from 3.2
to 2.8 months of imports over 2010-12. In Angola, recovering oil prices helped rebuild gross
international reserves in 2010 following a sharp decline in 2009 that led to a Stand-By Arrangement
with the Fund.

4

For Ghana, the wage bill includes deferred payments associated with transition to the single spine salary structure.

5

In the case of Angola, the decline in international reserves was due to a combination of oil revenue collapse and
expansionary policies. Gross international reserves recovered in 2010, but even then net international reserves
remained lower than they were in 2008.

settled worker demands by raising
wages by 3 percent. However, wage spending as a share of GDP remained persistently high and
increased by 2012 due to temporary allowances aimed at the lower end of the wage ladder. The
wage bill as a share of revenue declined by a small margin from a peak of 39 percent in 2010 to
35 percent in 2012. Throughout the wage freeze period, international reserve coverage declined
significantly from 16 months of imports in 2009 to 11 months of imports by 2012.
Lessons Learned
Zambia’s adjustment to the wage increase will require significant fiscal and monetary policy
tightening. On the fiscal side, revenue mobilization is critical to help alleviate the risks from the
elevated wage bill and a multi-year wage freeze is necessary to contain spending. On the monetary
side, maintaining tight policies will be necessary to support low inflation and reduce pressures on
the currency. Given the currently low international reserve coverage, the authorities would need to
abstain from central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market, except to smooth volatility
while gradually building up reserves.
A multi-year wage freeze will require clear communication and support from stakeholders
and strengthened expenditure controls. Much of the public discontent surrounding the recently
announced wage freeze policy is related to disparities in the salary structure and not to public
salaries themselves, which are significantly higher than private sector wages. The government needs
to highlight the risks stemming from the current wage levels and the need for a wage freeze while
reaching an agreement with stakeholders on how to manage current disparities in the civil service
salary structure. Following the currently planned wage freeze for 2014-15, multi-year wage
negotiations, rather than agreements on a year-by-year basis, would facilitate the efforts at
44

containing the wage bill and would help mitigate political pressures to raise wages in election years.
Additionally, wage freeze decisions need to imply controlling not only of base structural salaries, but
also of merit increases, allowances, and recruitment. In order to do so, strengthening expenditure
controls on salaries and enhancing communication with government agencies on wage and staffing
policies will be critical.

Appendix IV. External Stability Assessment1
Zambia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated since the early 2000s, mostly
because of the improvement in
terms of trade (Figure 1). High
copper prices were a major driver of
the terms of trade, and copper

in 2008–09 was mainly driven by a
plunge in copper prices associated
with the global financial crisis.
In 2012, the REER appreciated by

differential.
The standard tools developed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) have
been used to assess the Zambian exchange rate. For that purpose, the current account balance
presented in the Balance of Payments (Table 5) has been adjusted. The balance of payments for
Zambia shows the (mostly foreign-owned) mining companies as keeping a large share of the mining
export proceeds abroad. This large financial account outflow is simply the estimated difference
between the declared mining related inflows and outflows, conventionally recorded in the financial
account instead of in the current account. To better reflect the true impact of the mining related
flows on the foreign currency market, and the exchange rate and international reserves, for the
purpose of this exercise, these outflows have been reclassified to the current account as additional
dividend outflows.2

Prepared by Marco Arena.

Based on discussions with the authorities, the estimation is done assuming that 80 percent of the financial outflows
are reclassified to the current account. An additional scenario is presented with an adjustment of 60 percent. In this
context, the underlying current account would be equal to the baseline current account plus 80 (60) percent of the
financial outflows.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

Under current policies (without fiscal adjustment), there is conflicting evidence of whether
the real effective exchange rate is over- or undervalued (Text Table 1). The estimates based on
the external sustainability approach suggest an overvaluation of almost 6 percent, consistent with a
medium-term projection of 75 percent in the net foreign liabilities ratio. In addition, the
macroeconomic balance approach suggests an overvaluation of 8 percent. On the other hand, the
real equilibrium exchange rate approach
suggests an undervaluation, but that is not
statistically significant because the actual
REER is within the confidence intervals
around the equilibrium real exchange rate
(Figure 2). Under an alternative scenario

declined since the ceiling’s introduction.

Since the introduction of the lending rate caps, most nonbanks have continued to

expand their loan portfolios. Total nonbank loans have thus risen, albeit from a small base, by
almost 30 percent from December 2012 to August 2013. The nonbank sector, excluding enterpriselending MFIs, also continued to remain profitable.
5.

Some restructuring of the nonbanking sector is underway since the introduction of the

ceilings. In response to the declining interest margins, nonbanks, particularly the MFIs, have
implemented cost reduction programs, including closing marginal branches, and adjusted their
business models to remain viable. Four
consumer-lending MFIs decided to exit the
financial sector, which could indicate that
some inefficient nonbanks are weeded out

Safeguard Assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) were completed in June 2004, January 2009,
and October 2010. The 2009 assessment concluded that the bank had adequate safeguards in
several areas, but confirmed the existence of certain vulnerabilities in the BoZ’s legal framework and
financial reporting. The 2010 update report concluded that the BoZ had made progress in
implementing safeguards recommendations. Staff noted improvements in the internal audit and
internal control mechanisms. Weak statutory independence remains a substantive safeguards
concern.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The exchange rate arrangement is a “float,” with the kwacha
exchange rate determined in the interbank market. The buying rate of the BoZ is a simple average of
the primary dealers’ low bid rates, and the BoZ’s selling rate is the simple average of the primary
dealers’ high offer rates. On April 19, 2002, Zambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.
On June 25, 2013, the Zambian authorities issued Statutory Instrument 55 of 2013, which regulates
the monitoring of foreign exchange transactions. Among the measures included are two that give
rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The first
exchange restriction arises from the requirement that a person making payments of dividends in
foreign exchange to a foreign bank account or nonresident person provide a tax clearance
certificate and evidence of payment of corporate or income tax. The measure gives rise to an
exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) because it imposes
limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of payments of current
international transactions based on noncompliance with obligations that are unrelated to the
proposed transaction. The second exchange restriction arises from the requirement that a person
making payments for royalties, management fees, technical fees, commissions or consultancy fees in
foreign exchange to a foreign bank account or nonresident person be accompanied by evidence of
corporate tax payments. This measure similarly gives rise to an exchange restriction subject to IMF
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) because it imposes limitations on the availability of foreign
exchange for the making of payments of current international transactions based on noncompliance
with obligations that are unrelated to the proposed transaction. The authorities have assured staff
that SI55 will be amended to remove these restrictions before the Board Meeting for the 2013
Article IV consultation.
Further, Zambia continues to maintain an exchange restriction, which is subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII, arising from limitations imposed by the government on access to foreign
exchange for the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, which is
evidenced by the existence of external payments arrears accumulated prior to October 4, 1985. Staff
noted progress towards resolving these arrears.

Article IV Consultations
Zambia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to Decision No. 14747–
(10/96), as amended. The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on June 13,
2012.
FSAP Participation and ROSC
Zambia has participated in the financial sector assessment program (FSAP); an FSAP mission from
the Fund and the World Bank conducted a comprehensive external assessment of the financial
system April 30–May 15, 2002, and July 15–26, 2002. A mission from the Fund and the World Bank
conducted a follow up FSAP in November 2008.
The fiscal transparency module of a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
assessing compliance with the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency—Declaration of
Principles was issued to the Executive Board on October 31, 2001. A ROSC data module was issued

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November 20, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Issues with
source data and compilation affect most datasets, but are particularly problematic in the national accounts,
balance of payments, and fiscal reporting.
National accounts: There is a high degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of the level and growth
rate of real GDP, because 1994 is the latest benchmark year for value-added ratios to estimate GDP under
the production approach. For many important industry areas, such as wholesale and retail trade,
construction, business services, and many other service industries, (consisting mainly of small-scale private
service providers) no appropriate indicators exist. Data on total production and intermediate consumption
of establishments are not available. On the expenditure side, no reliable indicators of household
consumption exist and private final consumption expenditure is derived as a residual. Source data for
estimating gross fixed capital formation and changes in stocks are incomplete. There is also lack of high
frequency real sector data to support a more flexible monetary management. The situation largely reflects
resource constraints and organizational weakness within the Central Statistical Office that have affected its
ability to produce economic statistics on a timely basis.
Price statistics: The CPI broadly adheres to international methodological standards. The classification
system used for compilation closely follows the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose. With
STA technical assistance, a new CPI series with updated weights based on the latest household budget
survey was released in February 2012.
Government finance statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. The
transactional coverage of these data is however limited to government operations and transactions in
nonfinancial assets. Data on transactions in financial assets and liabilities are still unavailable. The
authorities report monthly budget releases data to AFR for operational use in a timely manner, but the
data are often subject to substantial revisions, and data on extra-budgetary institutions and local
governments are not available. The consolidation of fiscal outturn between fiscal reports and government
accounts in monetary data requires significant improvement.
Monetary statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. Since the 2005
monetary and financial statistics mission, there has been a noticeable improvement in the quality of
monetary accounts compiled and reported in accordance with the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the
BoZ and other depository corporations (ODCs).

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

Balance of payments statistics: Data sources and compilation methods still need to be improved (some
items are estimated without reference to current source data). Resources available for balance of payments
compilation have been increased, but are still inadequate, while coordination between the BoZ and CSO
had improved. As a result, gaps in data remain in many areas including reinvested earnings, trade in
services, and the financial account (including export proceeds held abroad by mining and nontraditional
exporters). While the source data are generally adequate in terms of timeliness, they fall short in terms of
coverage. As a result, indirect estimation methods are used, some of which have remained unchanged for
many years and are out of date. Source data on private sector foreign assets and liabilities are insufficient
to compile an International Investment Position statement.
External and domestic debt statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.
Recent efforts, facilitated by technical assistance, have led to an improvement in the consolidation of the
debt databases, both in terms of external and domestic debt. Further work is underway in these areas.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Zambia has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 2002.

A Data ROSC Assessment was published in
February 2005.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By

David Owen and Chris
Lane (IMF) and Jeffrey
D. Lewis and Marcelo
Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by:
International Monetary Fund and
International Development Association

Based on the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries
(LIC DSA), Zambia’s risk of external debt distress remains low as all debt indicators stay
below the indicative policy thresholds throughout the projection period (2013–2033).
Under the baseline and alternative scenarios, all external debt sustainability indicators
remain below their applicable thresholds. The public DSA suggests that, under the
baseline, Zambia’s overall public sector debt dynamics would be sustainable. However,
besides sound macroeconomic policies, strong debt management, a higher diversification
of the export base, and project appraisal capacity are needed to maintain debt
sustainability in the face of a projected rise in non-concessional borrowing and potential
external shocks.

ZAMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.

Zambia’s stock of external and public debt remains relatively low. External public and

publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt was about 18 percent of GPD in 2012 (US$3.7 billion).1, 2 The debt’s
share related to multilaterals declined from 62 percent to 38 percent given the issuance of a
Eurobond (US$750 million) in 2012. In this context, as of December 2012, the debt’s share owed to
private banks/investors was 27 percent. Zambia’s total PPG debt also remains relatively low at
32.5 percent of GDP at end-2012.3

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.

In 2013, Zambia’s economic growth will be slightly lower than in 2012. GDP is projected

to expand by 6.0 percent compared to 7.2 percent in 2012. This lower growth rate is related to a
decline in the agriculture sector due to adverse weather conditions. GDP growth is being supported
by a scale up of government investments. Inflation is projected at 7.5 percent. The external current
account is projected to register a deficit of around 1.3 percent of GDP compared to a small surplus
observed in 2012, mainly reflecting higher imports related to foreign direct investment activities and
public sector investments. The higher imports more than offset a higher value of both copper and
non-traditional exports compared to 2012. Reserve coverage, in terms of next year’s imports, are
projected to decline from 2.7 to 2.3 months. Over the medium term, the baseline scenario assumes
prudent economic policies to provide fiscal space for growth-enhancing investment while
safeguarding macroeconomic stability. Inflation is expected to remain in single-digits; real economic
growth will continue to be strong, supported by commodity exports, infrastructure investment, and
expanded electricity generation capacity (Box 1).

1

Zambia’s stock of external debt declined substantially from about 86 percent of GDP in 2005 to around 9 percent in
2006 as a result of debt cancellation under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI.
2

Authorities have revised the 2012 central government’s debt stock from US$2.605 billion to US$2.954 billion. This
change is mainly due to a reconciliation exercise with some creditors (mainly the EXIM bank of China by an amount
of US$331 million). According to the authorities, disbursements of some loans went directly to the implementing
agencies without informing the Ministry of Finance’s debt unit.
3

PPG debt stock includes Central Government debt stock, IMF debt stock and 60 percent of ZESCO’s debt stock.
According to ZESCO’s authorities, 60 percent of the debt is guaranteed by the government.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZAMBIA

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Economic growth: Real GDP growth is assumed to pick up to about 7.7 percent in the medium term,
supported by mining activity (copper exports are projected to increase by 70 percent between 2012
and 2018, from 0.9 million tons to 1.5 million tons, giving current production and investment plans),
large infrastructure investment (capital expenditures are projected to increase from an estimate of
6.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2018), and increased electricity generation
capacity. In the long run, the mining sector will remain important, but economic diversification in areas
such as electricity generation, agriculture, and tourism is expected to support economic growth, which
would be at around 5.0 percent annually.
Inflation: The current objective of monetary policy is to reduce inflation to 6 percent or less. Prudent
monetary and fiscal policies are expected to reduce annual inflation to around 5 percent in the
medium term.
External sector: Mining output is expected to show an average increase of 10 percent in the medium
term (between 2013 and 2018), and the copper price is assumed to stabilize at around US$3.3 per
pound in the long run. Copper, whose exports have been particularly strong in 2010 and 2011, will
remain Zambia’s most important export (between 65 and 70 percent of total exports in the medium
term). However, growth of nontraditional exports are projected to be 17–23 percent over the medium
term, and then stabilize at around 10-11 percent in the long run, consistent with higher non-mining
output growth and infrastructure expenditure. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected to rise in the
medium term to around 7.7 percent of GDP, concentrated in the mining, manufacturing, and transport
sectors, but then stabilize in the long run at around 4.5 percent of GDP. The current account balance is
projected to be roughly balanced by 2018 and to register a deficit of around 1 percent of GDP in the
long term.
Government revenue and expenditure: In line with staff recommendations, fiscal policy is assumed
to be geared toward creating space for spending needs to enhance the economic diversification of
Zambia. To this end, higher revenue will be mobilized through improvements in tax administration,
especially with respect to the VAT and mining taxes, and new tax policy measures that would broaden
the tax base (reduction of tax incentives and exemptions and some change in tax rates). As a result,
revenues would rise gradually from 20.9 percent of GDP in 2013 to 24.8 percent by 2018. Primary
expenditures would increase in the near term (reaching 27 percent of GDP), mainly due to the growthcritical infrastructure investment and spending on education and health, but are then expected to
stabilize at about 26 percent of GDP, with current spending contained.
Government financing: Net external financing is expected to decline from 5.0 percent of GDP in 2014
to 2.0 percent of GDP by 2018. External finance will be used to finance social and capital spending. This
amount includes the issuance of sovereign debt (Eurobonds). However, net external financing is
expected to decline to around 1.0 percent of GDP over the long-term. It is also assumed that the
repayment of Eurobonds would be done through roll-overs.

3.

The baseline scenario assumes new public external borrowing on the order of US$6.2 billion

between 2013 and 2018. Of this amount, around US$3.9 billion is expected to come through Eurobond
issuances. These Eurobonds are expected to incur interest at a constant spread from WEO global
assumptions on the 10 year US Treasury bond of about 5 percentage points. The significant reliance on
Eurobond financing in this scenario raises rollover risks and exposure to potential tightening of liquidity

conditions in international markets. Moreover, another US$650 million would be on commercial terms.4 It is
assumed that the proportion of borrowing under commercial terms, excluding the proceeds of the
Eurobonds, would gradually increase from 21 percent in the medium term to above 65 percent by 2033.
4.

The behavior of the grant element of new borrowing is erratic mainly due to assumptions

on rollover of Eurobonds. Issuances are projected to happen between 2014 and 2018. Also, it is assumed
that roll-overs would be in place to repay the 2012 issuance and the ones between 2014 and 2018. Under
the new discount factor of 5 percent, the grant element of new borrowing (GENB) would be around
56 percent in 2013, excluding the syndicated loan, and gradually declines over time until 2022 when the
first rollover of the 2012 Eurobond is assumed to take place.

Out of the US$650 million, US$250 million would correspond to a syndicated loan. Also, it is assumed that US$1.7
billion would come mainly from sources such as the World Bank, African Development Bank and China Exim Bank. It
is also assumed that Zambia will be able to access the non-concessional window of the World Bank and AfDB by
2020. In addition, it is assumed that the degree of concessionality from the China Exim bank’s loans would be lower
than 35 percent in the medium-term projection.

sustainability depends critically on its impact on growth. A number of empirical studies generally find a
positive impact of public investment on growth both through a direct impact on economic activity and
through spillover effects on private investment.5 Among these studies, Burnside and Dollar (1997) found
that a sustained increase in grant-financed investment by one percent of GDP raised real GDP growth in
low-income countries with good policy implementation on a sustained basis by about 0.4 percentage
points. 6 Gupta et al. (2011) find that the unadjusted output elasticity of public capital would be 0.25
(however, the marginal product of (unadjusted) capital would be around 0.5).7 Also, the growth impact of
public investment on growth is affected by how it is financed. Aschauer (2000) found that external debt
financing of public investment could reduce the impact on growth, depending on the quality and effective
use of the investment, as well as the financing costs.8
6.

The baseline scenario projects an increase in capital expenditure in the medium term. The

capital expenditure to GDP ratio would increase from 6.6 percent in 2013 to 8.6 percent in 2018. Between
14 and 18 percent of such increase is assumed to be financed with external borrowing, with a mix of
concessional and non-concessional resources. Based on the empirical studies mentioned above, the
projected increase in capital expenditure would raise real GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points over the
medium term.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
7.

External debt burden indicators rise in the medium term, but are expected to remain below

the indicative policy thresholds (Figure 1 and Table 1).9 The stock of external public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt is expected to rise to almost 23 percent of GDP by 2017 but gradually decline
thereafter. The present value (PV) of PPG debt to GDP increases to about 20 percent by 2017 before
declining to 10 percent by 2033, well below the 40 percent threshold.10 The PV of debt to exports increases
to almost 37 percent by 2017, and falls gradually thereafter, remaining well below the threshold of
150 percent. The PV of PPG debt to revenue increases from 63 percent in 2012 to about 89 percent in 2016
and then starts to fall, remaining below the threshold of 250 percent.11
Stress test
8.

External debt sustainability is maintained under all stress tests. However, the PV of PPG debt

to GDP ratio almost reaches the threshold in 2015 and 2016 under the export shock (Table 3 and
Figure 3).12 The PV of the PPG debt to GDP ratio reaches a higher level by 2023 compared to the results of
the other stress tests. This scenario illustrates Zambia’s vulnerability to copper price and copper output
volatility and the need to diversify its export base.
9.

External debt indicators would deteriorate, but remain below their respective thresholds,

under an alternative high investment-low growth scenario. This scenario assumes that there are
constraints in the appraisal, selection and project implementation capacity of public investment projects in
the medium term, which are not mitigated through the implementation of PFM reforms. In this context and
9

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) ranks Zambia as a medium performer (the
average 2010–12 CPIA score is 3.45). Thus, the external debt burden thresholds for Zambia are (i) a PV of debt-toGDP at 40 percent; (ii) a PV of debt-to-exports at 150 percent; (iii) a PV of debt-to-revenue at 250 percent; (iv) a debt
service-to-exports at 20 percent; and (v) a debt service-to-revenue at 20 percent.
10

Present Values (PV) are calculated based on a 5 percent annual discount.

11

The large residuals in Table 1 are caused by the fact that the official balance of payments statistics for Zambia
show the (mostly foreign owned) mining companies as keeping a large share of their mining export proceeds as
rapidly increasing deposits abroad.
12

Care is needed with the interpretation of the export shock in the case of Zambia. Given that not all the copper
export proceeds return to the country because most mine companies are foreign-owned, the assumption under the
export shock that losses in export proceeds are compensated with external debt is overestimating the impact of the
shock. Staff estimates that at least 40 percent of copper exports do not return to the country. The shock is defined as
the export value growth at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2014–2015.

based on the discussion provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, real GDP growth would remain about
0.5 percentage points below the baseline in the medium and long term. In addition, we assume that the
decline in GDP growth will have a negative impact on export growth, in particular for non-traditional
exports, due to lower infrastructure capacity (for the purpose of this exercise it is assumed that the
calculated decline in GDP growth would reduce the exports-to-GDP ratio by two percentage points in the
medium term and one percentage point in the long term). The lower growth would result in lower
domestic revenues and a higher financing requirement that are assumed to be met by additional external
borrowing on commercial terms. The additional financing would rise to about 1 percent of GDP in the
medium term. Under this scenario, the ratio of the PV of PPG debt-to-GDP increases by 11 percentage
points by 2018 compared to the baseline but remains below the threshold.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
10.

Zambia’s public debt rises slightly in the medium term, but declines gradually over time,

assuming that the government will implement front-loaded fiscal adjustment. Under the baseline
assumptions, the PV of public debt to GDP ratio would reach levels of about 37 percent in the mediumterm and then comes down to about 32 percent by 2033.
Stress test
11.

Risks to public debt dynamics come mainly from the possibility of a failure to implement

front-loaded fiscal adjustment and negative shocks to GDP growth. The results under the fixed
primary balance scenario (holding the primary balance unchanged at the 2013 value) underscores the
negative effects on public debt sustainability of not maintaining fiscal discipline over the medium term
(Figure 2 and Table 2). This scenario reinforces staff recommendations for undertaking a front-loaded fiscal
consolidation path. Under this scenario, PV of debt-to- GDP ratio and PV of debt-to-revenue ratio keep
rising over time. Regarding the bound tests, risk would mainly come from lower GDP growth. This risk
underscores both the need for Zambia to diversify its production structure to mitigate vulnerabilities
related to potential declines in mining production in the long term and to improve public investment
management in order to ensure productivity-enhancing investments.

CONCLUSIONS
12.

Zambia is considered at low risk of debt distress. The external debt indicators remain below

their thresholds in the baseline scenario and bound tests. The public debt DSA also suggests that Zambia’s
overall public sector debt dynamics would be sustainable under the baseline scenario. On the other hand,
the fixed primary balance scenario demonstrates the need for an improved fiscal position. Finally, in
addition to sound macroeconomic policies and debt management strengthening, developing project
appraisal capacity and diversification of the export base are needed in order to maintain productivityenhancing investments and debt sustainability in the face of access to international markets and a gradual
increase in non-concessional borrowing.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Zambia
On December 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zambia. 1
Zambia has achieved strong and sustained economic growth over the past decade due to
improved macroeconomic management and increased copper production; however, risks
have over the past year increased with rising fiscal imbalances and lower reserve coverage.
Robust output growth continued in 2012 at slightly above 7 percent, driven by agriculture
and services, but is slowing in 2013 due to a weaker harvest. Expansionary fiscal policies,
mainly from spending on subsidies and wages, have raised the projected 2013 deficit to about
8½ percent of GDP. Rising imports together with weakened copper prices are expected to
move the current account into deficit, and international reserve coverage has fallen to 2.3
months of next year’s imports.
Inflation has remained contained as monetary policy has been gradually tightened. With the
Central Bank having raised its policy rate in two steps of 25 basis points each, consumer
price inflation is projected to stay broadly unchanged at 7½ percent in 2013 despite the
withdrawal of fuel and agricultural subsidies earlier this year, as well as the more recent
increase in civil service wages. The nominal exchange rate has depreciated recently, but has
remained broadly in line with inflation differentials to trading partners.
The banking sector has grown steadily and remains profitable and well-capitalized. Private
sector credit growth has started slowing down in 2013 from a rapid increase in the second
half of 2012. Nonperforming loans declined to 8.2 percent of total loans in mid-2013 from
15 percent in 2010.
Over the medium term, economic growth is expected to stay strong, averaging about
7½ percent a year. However, this is premised on significant policy adjustment to restore

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,

fiscal sustainability and preservation of the investment climate. The authorities are targeting
a 3 percent of GDP deficit over the medium term with no more than 1½ percent of GDP net
domestic financing. In order to help achieve this, the government is planning a wage and net
recruitment freeze for 2014 and is aiming to limit the cost of agricultural subsidies. The
central bank aims to build up reserves gradually with the aim to reach 4 months of imports
over the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Zambia’s strong economic performance over the past decade,
which was underpinned by prudent macroeconomic management over much of this period.
Nevertheless, they noted that the outlook is subject to significant risks from the recent
widening of fiscal imbalances, reduced external buffers, and volatile copper prices. Directors
therefore recommended containing the fiscal deficit, accelerating public financial
management reforms, strengthening external buffers, and improving the business
environment to help diversify the economy away from mining and accelerate poverty
reduction.
Directors called for comprehensive policy actions to address the unsustainable fiscal position
following the spike in wage and subsidy spending last year. Noting the rapidly rising public
debt and substantial downside risks to the budget, they recommended fiscal consolidation
through increased revenue mobilization and a reorientation away from recurrent spending, to
create fiscal space for infrastructure investment and control of the public debt. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ plans to freeze wage spending in 2014 and limit the cost of
agricultural subsidies. They advised that raising the tax-free threshold on personal income
taxes runs counter to fiscal consolidation efforts and recommended accelerating revenue
mobilization through changes in tax policy, enhanced mining tax administration, and
broadening the tax base.
Directors called for strengthening public financial management through improvements in
budget planning, fiscal reporting, expenditure controls and debt management combined with
stricter oversight and accountability. Strengthening debt management and project assessment
capacity is critical, given the planned rise in infrastructure spending and recourse to nonconcessional borrowing. Noting the inherent risks, Directors advised against issuance of the
proposed sub-national Eurobonds in favor of sovereign bonds, and stressed that all external
borrowing should be subject to project appraisal and screened for consistency with
macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability and the overall debt management strategy.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors agreed that rising inflationary pressures warrant a tighter monetary stance. They
welcomed progress in transitioning the monetary framework toward utilizing the policy rate
and recommended improving liquidity forecasting and management. Directors advised
rebuilding external buffers through enhanced exchange rate flexibility and further reserve
accumulation.
Directors welcomed recent improvements in Zambia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing
Business Index, but called for improved policy consistency. They cautioned that the
imposition of lending rate ceilings, restrictions on the use of foreign exchange, and rapid
increases in minimum wages could undermine external competitiveness and erode investor
confidence. Directors advised that financial intermediation could be better strengthened
through enhanced competition and improved efficiency. Directors also recommended that the
remaining exchange restrictions on current account transactions be removed expeditiously.

Statement by Mr. Saho, Executive Director for Zambia
December 11, 2013
1.
The Zambian authorities welcome the completion of the 2013 Article IV
consultations and the Board’s consideration. The authorities have had thorough and wideranging discussions with staff, particularly around the priorities of the new Government
as it tackles the challenges of an unacceptably high level of poverty and inequality, whilst
maintaining robust economic growth and macroeconomic stability. This concern has
necessitated the adoption of a higher fiscal deficit profile over the medium term than was
originally envisaged.
2.
Whilst there are many areas in which the authorities agree with Fund staff, they
do have areas of significant differences in terms of policy priorities and the emerging
risks to strong growth and poverty reduction over the medium to long term. In particular,
the authorities’ views differ from the assessment of Fund staff in several key areas: (1)
outlook, risks and the fiscal stance; (2) public financial management (PFM); (3) monetary
policy; and (4) competitiveness.
A. Authorities’ views on selected key areas
Outlook, risks, and the fiscal stance
3.
The authorities’ projections for growth of an average of 7.5 percent over the
medium term are consistent with those of the Fund staff. They are also looking to achieve
fiscal consolidation over the medium term towards a deficit of no more than 3 percent of
GDP. They do not, however, agree that such fiscal consolidation should be front-loaded.
On the contrary, they believe that such front-loaded fiscal consolidation would
substantially impair critical investment in the energy and transport sectors – investment
that is critical for strong growth and improved competitiveness. In addition, the
Government is committed to substantially improving education and health outcomes in
terms of both the availability and quality of health and education services. Both of these
actions are critical to reduce poverty and inequality and to preserve peace and stability
that Zambia has enjoyed since independence.
4.
The authorities acknowledge and agree with Fund staff that improving Zambia’s
fiscal position will require fundamental reforms that enable them to contain the wage bill
and recurrent expenditures, and boost their revenue base. They would, however, welcome
greater engagement and more innovative thinking around how the Government can better
balance the need to manage its wage bill against its commitment to improve health and
education outcomes through improved services and infrastructure. They note that the
health and education sectors account for approximately 70 percent of the civil service
workforce. Be that as it may, achieving the MDG targets, such as improving maternal

health and the education outcomes and opportunities for their children, will require more
and better qualified teachers that will help to reduce pupil teacher ratios, as well as more
health personnel to reduce the number of mothers giving birth without qualified
attendants. The current health and education sectors are estimated to require additional
20,000 personnel each, if they are to achieve their MDG targets. While one way to
address these challenges is improvements in labor productivity, such improvements will
require greater use of technology (e-governance), which is expensive to implement and
will need a medium- to long-term horizon to fully implement – with implications for the
budget deficit.
5.
In the authorities’ view, failure to undertake these tasks poses a bigger threat to
Zambia’s long term growth prospects and the probability of reducing poverty and
inequality than failure to implement front-loaded fiscal consolidation. Therefore, the
fiscal stance that has been adopted by the authorities reflects the new Government’s
strategy to address the constraints placed on economic growth by the low investments in
infrastructure over the past years. However, the authorities remain committed to a tighter
fiscal stance in the medium term, as the bottlenecks to growth are loosened.
Public financial management (PFM)
6.
The authorities broadly concur with the views of Fund staff on the need to
revitalize reforms that will help to improve the quality and effectiveness of their
expenditures. This will require them to significantly improve their institutional
framework and arrangements in the areas of cash and financial management, planning
and budgeting, as well as investment planning and debt management. The authorities are
committed to these tasks and have already engaged their international cooperating
partners for support. In 2014, for example, the Ministry of Finance will develop a
planning and budgeting policy, and present a planning and budgeting bill to Parliament.
Monetary policy
7.
Zambia’s monetary policy has successfully reduced inflation, whilst maintaining a
flexible exchange rate regime, as evidenced by the achievement and maintenance of
single-digit inflation. In addition, recent work by Fund staff, suggests that the exchange
rate is not misaligned. Therefore, the authorities are concerned that Fund staff continues
to advocate for greater flexibility in the exchange rate, when the Bank of Zambia (BOZ)
has allowed the exchange rate to fluctuate – sometimes significantly, such as during the
global financial crisis. The BOZ currently intervenes to contain excessive volatility,
which undermines the primary monetary policy goal of achieving low inflation and more
broadly economic growth. It should also be noted that regulations such as the Statutory
Instrument (SI) 33 of 2012, which prohibits the pricing and quoting of domestic
transactions in foreign currency, were intended to address the issue of dollarization and
thereby strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

Competitiveness
8.
The authorities acknowledge the concerns raised by staff on the potential adverse
impact of recent regulations on the competitiveness of the Zambian economy. However,
they believe that many of these concerns are misplaced. One of the key impediments to
improving competitiveness in Zambia has been poor infrastructure and shortage of skilled
labor. Staff in fact acknowledges empirical work that suggests that Zambia’s
infrastructure deficit relative to its regional neighbors, such as Mauritius, potentially cost
the country 2 – 3 percent of GDP per annum. The Government’s public investment
strategy is squarely aimed at addressing these impediments. The authorities do not
believe that the recent policy actions such as the increase in the minimum wage and
strengthened monitoring of the external sector make the business environment worse. On
the contrary, they believe that these actions will allow for productivity gains and
improved macroeconomic management for the greater benefit of businesses and
households.
B. Recent economic developments, outlook and risks
9.
Despite several challenges, Zambia’s economy continues to grow strongly,
anchored on sound macroeconomic policies and a favorable business climate. Output
grew by 7.2 percent in 2012, and averaged 6.3 percent between 2004 and 2012, according
to the October 2013 Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa. Growth in
2012 was driven mainly by agricultural, construction, and communication sectors. At the
same time, inflation has remained broadly consistent with expectations and was 7 percent
in November 2013. In response, the Bank of Zambia’s Monetary Policy Committee
decided in November 2013 to maintain its policy rate at 9.75 percent.
10.
As a result of prudent fiscal policy management, budget performance has
improved consistently over time, with the deficit excluding grants declining from 8.4
percent of GDP in 2004 to about 4 percent in 2012. Despite pressures from the recent
wage increase, the authorities remain committed to a sustainable fiscal policy stance.
11.
Meanwhile, the external sector position was characteristic of solid economic
performance, with staff analysis not showing a real exchange rate misalignment. The
current account was broadly balanced in 2012; and foreign direct investment strong.
According to the REO (October 2013), FDI flows increased sharply and reached 5
percent of GDP in 2012, in response to rising copper prices and Zambia’s relatively
favorable business environment.
12.
The financial sector is characterized by profitable and well-capitalized banks.
Private sector credit remains strong and non-performing loans are declining.
C. Request for waiver of non-observance of performance criterion
13.
The Zambian authorities deeply regret the unintentional misreporting, and request
a waiver for non-observance of a performance criterion (PC) under the ECF arrangement

that expired in June 2011. As explained in EBS/13/147, the misreporting relates to two
loans that were contracted during Zambia’s ECF arrangement, each with a grant element
less than 35 percent.
14.
In line with the Managing Director’s report, the authorities have explained the
circumstances under which the Lusaka Stadium Project and the Mobile Hospital Project
were not reported to the Fund at the time of the fifth and sixth reviews in December 2010
and June 2011, respectively. At the time, the two loans did not appear on the Ministry of
Finance’s database, due to coordination gaps between different units of the debt
management department. In addition, officers responsible for debt management had
determined, prior to the contracting of these loans, that they would meet the 35 percent
grant element threshold. However, based on revised calculations, they fell slightly short
of the threshold.
15.
The authorities are taking necessary action to strengthen debt management. To
deal with the gaps in coordination, the Ministry of Finance have developed a Public Debt
Procedures Manual, aimed at providing guidance and direction to all stakeholders
involved in debt management. Also, the authorities have instructed government creditors
to inform the relevant unit whenever a disbursement takes place. At the same time,
relevant units now undertake regular bi-monthly internal reconciliation. Furthermore, the
authorities are working on a broader Debt Management Reform Plan that was finalized
earlier this year, in collaboration with the World Bank. The plan addresses key debt
management issues, including strengthening of the legal framework, developing a debt
management strategy, and improving operational risk management. The authorities have
also committed to sharing with the Fund team the terms of all future external loan
agreements prior to their signing, for a proper assessment of their concessionality.
D. Conclusion
16.
My Zambian authorities have resolved to step up infrastructure development, to
build on the economy’s strong track record of macroeconomic performance. Despite
resource and capacity constraints, they will continue to work closely with the Fund and
other international development partners in an effort to improve the welfare of the
Zambians.
