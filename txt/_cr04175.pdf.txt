UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with
The United Arab Emirates
Approved by Saleh M. Nsouli and Juha Kähkönen
May 6, 2004
The consultation discussions were held in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah from February 17 to
March 4, 2004. The staff team comprised Messrs. Elhage (head), Thai, Davoodi, Wilson, Floerkemeier (all
MCD), and Mr. Frydl (MFD).
The mission met with the Minister of State for Finance and Industry, the Governor and Deputy Governor
of the Central Bank, Under Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance and Industry, Economy and
Commerce, Labor and Social Affairs, and Planning, as well as senior officials of the federal government
and the three largest Emirates—Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. Meetings were also held with
representatives of the private sector, commercial banks, stock exchanges, and chief executives of several
public enterprises.
In concluding the last consultation on February 12, 2003, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities'
ongoing efforts to foster further development of the nonhydrocarbon sector and to promote the role of the
private sector and foreign direct investment. They commended the authorities for the priority they have
accorded to maintaining a sound and well-supervised banking system. Directors considered the main
challenges facing the authorities would be to maintain strong economic growth and enhance job creation
for nationals in a stable macroeconomic environment. Directors considered that the adoption of a common
strategy for foreign ownership across the emirates would be helpful in promoting investment in the U.A.E.
Directors urged the authorities to make stronger efforts to improve the quality, coverage, and timeliness of
official data to support policymaking in an increasingly complex economy.
The United Arab Emirates has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It has also
accepted the Fourth Amendment of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Appendices I and II provide information on relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group,
respectively. Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III, and Appendix IV discusses the long-term

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
In 2003, reflecting favorable developments in the oil market, higher oil production and prices, the U.A.E.’s
macroeconomic performance is estimated to have been strong. Nonhydrocarbon real GDP growth is
estimated to have remained robust at about 5 percent, making it one of the highest in the GCC (Gulf
Cooperation Council) area. A number of projects were launched in 2003 in the areas of construction,
upstream gas, and downstream oil services. Inflation remained stable at 2.8 percent. Both the external
current account and consolidated fiscal balances are estimated to have recorded large surpluses,
8.5 percent and 13.7 percent of GDP, respectively. The stock market index increased by about 32 percent.
The authorities were very cooperative and provided the staff with estimates of detailed information on
official foreign assets of the government for the period 1999–2003. Accordingly, the fiscal accounts have
been revised and prepared from the financing side, showing a significant improvement in the overall fiscal
balance.
The U.A.E. banks remain well capitalized and profitable. The ratio of gross nonperforming loans to gross
loans continues to decline. Following on the recommendations of the 2001 FSAP mission, the U.A.E.
authorities have undertaken a number of initiatives to improve financial sector supervision and efficiency.
Several important steps have been taken in the past few years to address money laundering and financing
of terrorist activities. Tighter regulations now apply across the entire financial sector.

Medium-term Context
On the basis of current expectations for oil prices and the current policy stance, on average, over the
medium term, both the fiscal and external current account balances are projected to remain in surplus.
However, the stock of total net wealth (government foreign assets and the present value of oil and gas
resources) and wealth per capita in real terms are projected to decline. To maintain wealth constant over
the medium term, fiscal adjustment is needed to reduce the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit.

Staff Appraisal
The role of the private sector has been enhanced, and the economy is among the most diversified in the
GCC region. Openness and a sound record in macroeconomic management have contributed to the
accumulation of a large stock of official foreign assets and to lay the foundation for further economic and
social progress into the future.
To maintain wealth constant over the medium term, the structure of the budget needs to be strengthened.
On the expenditure side, government employment should be contained and subsidies phased out. The
revenue base should be broadened, mainly through the introduction of a national value-added tax system.
Fiscal transparency needs to be improved and better coordination in setting policy objectives among
emirates would enhance efficiency of fiscal policy and prepare the U.A.E. for the GCC monetary union. It
is important that any future changes to labor policy do not impact adversely the competitiveness of the
economy.
The U.A.E.’s economic statistics need to be improved significantly with respect to data quality, coverage,
periodicity, timeliness, and consistency. Increased coordination between federal and emirate authorities,
adequate resources allocated to data collection and management, and training of staff are necessary
conditions for further progress on data issues.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The U.A.E. is a confederation of seven emirates,1 all of which retain considerable
political, judicial, financial, and economic autonomy. The country has the third largest
reserves of oil in the world and the fourth largest of natural gas, both estimated to last more
than 100 years at current production rates. Abu Dhabi accounts for more than half of the
country’s total GDP, close to 40 percent of the population, and 90 percent of oil and natural
gas resources. Dubai contributes one-quarter of the country’s total GDP and has been at the
forefront of developing nonhydrocarbon activities in anticipation of the depletion of its crude
oil reserves over the next decade. The other emirates rely on a mix of trade and light
manufacturing, and they depend on financial support from the federal government and the
two larger emirates, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
2.
The U.A.E.—a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)2—has managed
to avoid the pitfalls that at times result from having vast natural resources. Economic
development over the past three decades has been based on a highly liberal, business friendly
and market-oriented growth strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and strengthening
the export base. This development strategy has made the economy more resilient to oil price
fluctuations and contributed to a large accumulation of government financial wealth, which
has provided ample latitude to respond to external shocks.
3.
Fund missions in recent years have encouraged the authorities to strengthen
fiscal policy and address economic data deficiencies across sectors. Modernization of the
financial sector’s legal framework and improvement in securities and insurance supervision
and regulation have also been recommended. The decentralized policymaking process and
the complexity of the U.A.E.’s political structure have made it difficult for the authorities to
implement Fund’s policy recommendations in the fiscal area. Moreover, poor coordination
and cooperation between federal and local agencies, and other public sector entities have
precluded progress in addressing deficiencies in official statistics and providing information
to the Fund between consultations on macroeconomic developments, except for monetary
statistics. In contrast, important progress has been made in financial sector reforms, as the
Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) has unified authority over most institutions in the sector.
4.
The U.A.E.’s economic success has not been matched by the development of its
economic and social statistics which suffer from major shortcomings (discussed in
Appendix III). Significant weaknesses in the U.A.E.’s statistical base remain in terms of
coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness, all of which have hampered the staff’s
ability to conduct economic analysis and effective surveillance. The federal authorities agree
on the need to improve the availability and quality of data on consolidated fiscal operations,

the national accounts, balance of payments, and prices in order to enhance policymaking
decisions. In this connection, they indicated interest in participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS).
5.
The authorities were very cooperative and provided the staff with estimates of
detailed information on official foreign assets of the government. The provision of such
information allowed the staff to prepare the overall fiscal accounts from the financing side, in
contrast to previous consultations where absence of such information provided a measure of
overall fiscal balance from above the line.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Introduction
6.
Reflecting favorable developments in the oil market, the U.A.E.’s
macroeconomic performance in 2003 was strong (Table 1, Figure 1).3 Nonhydrocarbon
real GDP growth is estimated to have remained robust with stable inflation. The stock market
index, which has been rising since 2001, increased sharply in 2003 by about 32 percent on
account of strong economic conditions and optimism regarding the economic outlook. Both
the external current account and the consolidated fiscal balances are estimated to have
registered large surpluses. At end-2003, foreign assets of the central bank were about
US$15 billion, equivalent to about 4 months of imports.
7.
Progress in introducing structural reforms has varied among the emirates. Dubai
has extended foreign ownership of land and properties to some real estate developments and
has also announced the launch of several new free zones (Box 1). Abu Dhabi is moving
ahead with utility privatization, with the objective to privatize its entire water and electricity
sector by 2006. Restrictions on foreign ownership of companies and real estate, however,
remain in place in Abu Dhabi.

The discussion of economic developments for 2003 is based on preliminary estimates.

Box 1. Major Tourism Developments
The tourism sector is expected to be one of the main sources of future growth in the U.A.E.,
especially in Dubai. Although considered a high risk industry, depending much on the political
stability of the region, neither the Iraq war nor the SARS epidemic had significant adverse
effects on the sector’s performance in 2003. Occupancy rates have risen and reached more than
90 percent during events such as the shopping festival. Currently, around 5 million tourists visit
Dubai each year. The average stay of tourists is 2.8 days, consisting mainly of shopping and
business tourism. Dubai is increasingly targeting tourists who will stay for a longer period of
time. The emirate’s target is to attract 15 million tourists annually by 2010. Several large
projects have recently been launched to spur the industry’s growth: Dubailand, Dubai
Healthcare City, and Palm Island, among others.
With a total investment of almost $6 billion and an assigned space of 4 billion square feet,
Dubailand is one of the largest self-contained tourism projects internationally, offering leisure,
sport, retail, and entertainment attractions. The launch phase, covering initial infrastructure like
road works and utility provision, will extend from 2004 to 2006. The main construction phase
will be completed by 2010. Financing is mostly from the private sector—domestic and foreign.
Dubai will benefit from municipality taxes and infrastructure fees.
Dubai Healthcare City is a newly created free trade zone dedicated to the provision of
specialized medical and healthcare services. The project targets customers from the GCC, the
Indian subcontinent, East Africa, and Central Asia. The planners estimate to capture up to
50 percent of a potential market of $2 billion in 2005 in this region, with the help of high
reputation partnerships and investors from regional and international clinics, diagnostic, and
healthcare services. First operations will start end-2004.
The $3 billion Palm Island project, the construction of two artificial, palm-shaped islands off
Dubai’s coast, is a byproduct of the Jebel Ali harbor expansion. Each island will have around
60km of coastline. The islands will house residential homes, hotels, as well as entertainment
and retail outlets. Infrastructure work on the first island is due to be completed in 2004. In
addition, it is planned to build a similar group of 200 artificial islands in the shape of the world
map.
Other projects are the construction of the world’s first luxury underwater hotel as well as the
only indoor skiing center in the GCC region, Dubai Snow World.

B. Economic Developments in 2003
Real Sector
8.
Preliminary data show that real GDP growth was strong. Nonhydrocarbon GDP
growth is estimated at 5.2 percent, driven largely by rapid growth in the: (a) manufacturing;
(b) transport and communication; (c) finance; and (d) tourism sectors. Overall, real GDP
growth was about 7 percent. Inflation is estimated at about 2.8 percent in 2003 compared to
3.1 percent in 2002.
External sector
9.
The external current account surplus is estimated to have risen to about
8.5 percent of GDP from about 4.9 percent in 2002 (Table 2). Total exports increased to
an estimated $61 billion from $51 billion in 2002. The U.A.E.’s nonhydrocarbon exports are
heavily influenced by developments in the free zones, mostly located in Dubai. These exports
which have been increasing steadily since the early 1990s reached an estimated $9 billion
in 2003. Nonhydrocarbon exports by the emirates apart from the free zones are continuing
their upward trend and estimated to have reached almost $2.5 billion.
10.
The financial account balance indicates net capital outflows. The overall balance
of payments is estimated to have registered a deficit of $0.2 billion, resulting in equivalent
reduction in net foreign assets held by the CBU. Errors and omissions are estimated at about
$3.3 billion reflecting mainly unrecorded capital flows.
Fiscal policy
11.
The existing fiscal arrangements (Box 2) make timely and accurate assessment of
overall fiscal developments in the U.A.E. difficult. There is no uniformity among the seven
emirates and the federal government in classification of expenditures and revenues. At the
same time there is considerable netting out of fiscal operations at the emirates level and,
more importantly, the fiscal operations of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and
some of Abu Dhabi’s domestic government operations are not consolidated with the fiscal
accounts.
12.
Assessment of the overall fiscal balance has been revised in light of new
information received during the mission.4 The information, after taking into account
investment income estimated by staff covering the 1999–2003 period, now show overall

4

For 1999, the annual overall fiscal balance was revised from a deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP to
deficit of 10.2 percent of GDP. Whereas, for 2000–01, on average, the annual fiscal balance was
revised upward by about 6 percent of GDP. The 2002 fiscal outcome at the time of the last
consultation, which took place in October 2002, was an estimate.

surpluses in the U.A.E.’s consolidated fiscal accounts, except in 1999 and 2001 (Figure 2).5
It is estimated that in 2003 the U.A.E. recorded a fiscal surplus of about 13.7 percent of GDP,
as oil prices surged above US$28 per barrel (Table 3). Over the 1999–2003 period, fiscal
surpluses have been used to accumulate financial assets abroad.
Box 2: Fiscal Policy Setting in the U.A.E.
The emirate of Abu Dhabi provides the anchor for fiscal policy in the U.A.E. and as such its
decisions influence the path of the U.A.E.’s public finances. Being the emirate with the highest
hydrocarbon reserves, Abu Dhabi’s management of oil receipts, which includes transfers to other
emirates and the federal government, has allowed other emirates and the federal government to
pursue a balanced-budget approach to fiscal policy. At the same time, dependence on rich and finite
hydrocarbon reserves implies that the emirate of Abu Dhabi has to make long-run savings and
investment decisions regarding the use of receipts from its hydrocarbon wealth and conduct
expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy as needed. The resulting deficits or surpluses have been
used to draw down the emirate’s assets or augment them. Given the lack of a broad tax system in the
U.A.E. and of effective automatic stabilizers, Abu Dhabi’s fiscal policy decisions will continue to
impact fiscal outcomes in the U.A.E. for many years to come. Abu Dhabi’s budget is not cast in a
medium-term framework, but is based on a conservative oil price assumption (US$20–21 per barrel in
the 2004 budget).
The U.A.E.’s open and liberal economic development strategy has allowed each emirate to
conduct autonomous fiscal policy within the bounds of the federation. With dwindling revenues
from the oil and gas sector and a growing population, the emirate of Dubai, for example, is increasing
its reliance on nonhydrocarbon revenues to fund its budget and is working closely with the private
sector to shoulder the cost of providing infrastructure and other services that are traditionally
provided and financed by the public sector. The continued drive toward further diversification within
an open and business friendly environment, however, also implies increasing competition among the
emirates for investments and limited funds. For example, the emirate of Sharjah, which borders
Dubai, is competing to be a center for tourism, manufacturing, and banking. All the emirates have
access to bank overdraft facilities and revenues from other government entities for their cash
management, but all (except Abu Dhabi) in practice tend to run a balanced budget.
The U.A.E.’s federal government, although smaller in size relative to Abu Dhabi, plays an
important role in the federation and often leads other emirates in public administration
reforms. The federal government provides basic social services across the country, sets regulations
and minimum standards, represents U.A.E.’s interests in international affairs, addresses inter-emirate
disparities in resource endowments, and acts as a model for adopting public sector administration
reforms such as performance-based budgeting and setting up a modern treasury system.

5

The investment income earned by the U.A.E. from its financial assets, which is not included in the
official fiscal accounts, has also been revised to reflect the information received by the staff.

13.
In 2003, the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit excluding investment income
remained constant at about 37 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP.6 A policy shift in the
emirate of Abu Dhabi reduced agriculture subsidies significantly. As a result, spending on
subsidies, as reflected in the consolidated government operations, declined in 2002 and 2003.
By contrast, since 2000, nonhydrocarbon revenues (excluding investment income) remained
constant as a percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP. The low growth in nonhydrocarbon revenue
reflects the fact that no significant revenue-enhancing measures have been introduced at the
emirates or federal levels.
Monetary developments
14.
Monetary and credit developments in 2003 took place against a backdrop of
continued high levels of liquidity, increased economic activity, and low interest rates.
The broad money stock increased by 16 percent (Table 4), close to the rates of the previous
two years, compared to an annual average growth of nonhydrocarbon GDP of about
7 percent. In percent of initial money stock, credit to the private sector and public-sector
enterprises (PEs) accounted for about 12 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. Much of the
private sector credit was granted to wholesale trade, construction, and personnel loans for
business purposes. The increase in credit to PEs reflected the implementation of a number of
projects in construction, electricity, water, and gas. The staff welcomed the decision by the
CBU to publish, by June 2004, the broad money stock statistics according to internationally
accepted standards, by excluding from it the deposits of U.A.E. residents in overseas
branches/subsidiaries.7
15.
Following trends in global financial markets, the three-month interbank rate for
the U.A.E. dirham (AED) declined to 1.28 percent in 2003. Real interest rates on 3-month
deposits became negative by about 2 percentage points in 2002 and 2003. However, a small
interest rate differential, 10 basis points on average in 2003, was maintained in favor of the
AED. A large differential between the business lending rates and the 6-month U.S. dollar
LIBOR rates (400 basis points in 2003) also persists.

6

Analysis of fiscal policy in countries in which government’s revenue from the hydrocarbon sector is
sizable has to take into account, among other things, the exhaustible nature of hydrocarbon reserves,
volatility in price of oil as well as aggregate demand effects of any chosen fiscal aggregate. These
features are captured in the above fiscal indicator known as nonhydrocarbon net primary fiscal
balance which is increasingly being used to assess fiscal sustainability in oil producing countries. It is
defined as nonhydrocarbon revenues (excluding investment income) less primary spending.
7
Staff’s discussion of monetary developments is based on the envisaged corrected presentation of the
monetary survey.

Financial developments
16.
The financial sector in the U.A.E. remained strong as of end-2003.8 All 46 banks
operating in the country met the minimum 10 percent capital-assets ratio (CAR); and the
system-wide CAR exceeded 18 percent (Table 5). While the gross nonperforming loan
(NPL) ratio remains relatively high at 14 percent, provisions are considerable, bringing the
net NPL ratio below 2 percent. Bank lending has grown substantially, increasing at an annual
rate of about 17 percent between end-2001 and September 2003, but was well diversified
across industries. Market risk to banks was limited and profitability of banks remained strong
in 2003.
17.
Securities markets in the U.A.E. continued to develop in 2003, as transactions
volume expanded and new listings grew. While the general market index9 grew by
32 percent in 2003, the increase was among the lowest in the GCC area, and the average P/E
ratio at end-2003 was 19.
18.
Following on recommendations of the 2001 FSAP mission, the U.A.E. authorities
have undertaken a number of initiatives to improve financial sector supervision and
efficiency. Major actions included the implementation of annual comprehensive risk-focused
examinations of banks, establishment of operational capability for the Securities Authority,
implementation of an automated real time gross settlements interbank payment system, and
improvements in the transparency of regulatory actions. Progress in legal reforms, however,
has been slower. Revision of the Banking Law, for example, has been protracted, with
additional amendments to deal with a number of relatively technical issues.
19.
Several important steps have been taken in the past few years to address money
laundering and financing of terrorist activities. Tighter regulations now apply across the
financial sector. Many Hawala dealers have registered and been certified by the CBU, and
are required to report on a quarterly basis their records on transactions exceeding AED 2000.
As of end-February 2004, the CBU has received 112 applications for registration and
89 certificates have been issued.

Financial sector developments which include the status of 2001 FSAP recommendations are

Considerable progress was made in 2003 in implementing plans to set up the
Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), a financial free zone. This is an initiative
of the Government of Dubai, and will encompass a comprehensive set of international
financial functions. A unique aspect of the DIFC is the nature of its regulatory structure. The
strategic conception is to provide a comprehensive, best practices regulatory capability
supported by an extensive set of separate enabling laws and a separate judiciary at the
emirate level. Since both the operating and regulatory arms of the DIFC are subordinate to
the Government of Dubai, the governance structure holds the potential for conflicts of
interest for regulation. The current track anticipates operations beginning in early 2005 with
about 20–25 firms operating initially.
III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
21.
Based on the latest (March 2004) WEO oil price of US$30 per barrel and despite
the cut in OPEC-mandated oil production effective April 2004, macroeconomic
conditions are projected to remain strong in 2004. Growth in nonhydrocarbon GDP is
projected at 4.7 percent, resulting from strong domestic activities in the areas of tourism,
communication, and transport. Reflecting the nonhydrocarbon growth, imports are projected
to increase by 5 percent to about $44 billion. Oil and product export receipts are projected to
increase by about 2 percent to $26.2 billion, and nonhydrocarbon exports by 16 percent to
$13 billion. The external current account surplus is projected at about 7.5 percent of GDP.
Inflation is expected to ease to 2.6 percent and the consolidated fiscal balance is projected by
the staff to be in surplus at about 8 percent of GDP.
22.
In discussions, the authorities in Abu Dhabi informed the staff that because of
the specifics of the emirates’ institutional arrangements and the volatility of oil prices,
they manage expenditure and budget resources on continuous and cautious basis.
Accordingly, they review oil price developments during the year with ADNOC and
expenditures are adjusted as needed. If oil prices rise above the budgeted assumption, for
example, spending is left intact, but adjusted downward when oil prices fall below the budget
oil price. In 2004, Abu Dhabi’s budget is based on a conservative oil price assumption,
US$20–21 per barrel of oil. Abu Dhabi’s deficit is financed mainly from its resources.
23.
Over the medium term (2004–09), based on current expectations of declining oil
prices and the maintenance of a cautious policy stance, the overall fiscal balance
(excluding investment income) would turn into a deficit starting in 2008 (Table 6). The
budget financing requirement for 2008–09 could be met from investment income on
government external assets while the value of these assets would continue to rise in real
terms over the period.10 However, under the current policy stance, both the stock of total net
10

The medium-term projections are sensitive to assumptions about oil prices and rates of return on
the U.A.E.’s foreign assets. With a $1 drop in the price of oil per barrel, the fiscal balance will
weaken by 1 percent of GDP on average during 2004–09.

- 22 -

wealth and net wealth per capita in real terms are projected to be lower, as discussed in
Appendix IV.11 Under this baseline scenario, and the objective of maintaining net wealth
constant over the medium term, fiscal adjustment is needed to reduce the nonhydrocarbon
fiscal deficit annually by about AED 3.4 billion (1.1 percent of GDP).
24.
Given the present outlook, the growth rate of real nonhydrocarbon GDP is
projected to stabilize at around 4.3 percent, reflecting a number of long-term
infrastructure and industrial projects, particularly in Dubai. Inflation is projected to trend
downward to about 2 percent, mirroring projected developments in commodity prices.
25.
Policy discussions focused on how to broaden the economic and social progress
achieved over the past decades, narrow regional income disparities, address the needs
of a rapidly growing national labor force, lower the economy’s dependence on oil, and
increase transparency of government operations at all levels. Current government
policies are already in place to address some of these issues. However, to reinforce these
policies and improve the efficiency of public expenditures, staff stressed that better
coordination among the emirates—which continue to pursue different economic policies—is
needed. Staff also emphasized the need to improve transparency, particularly in the fiscal
area, in order to improve the policymaking environment and promote private investment to
its full potential. Staff reviewed risks and developments in the financial sector and assessed
performance in following up on the recommendations of the 2001 FSAP mission.
A. Structural Policies
Restructuring and privatization
26.
The authorities’ reform agenda is appropriately centered on increasing the role
of the private sector, with Dubai at the forefront of most new initiatives. In Abu Dhabi,
despite the privatization program in the electricity sector, current and capital spending on
electricity has continued to rise. Electricity tariffs and charges for nationals are different than
those for non-nationals. Water continues to be free for nationals, and only a small flat fee is
paid by non-nationals. The staff stressed that market pricing of publicly supplied goods and
services should go hand-in-hand with the efforts to increase private sector growth to ensure
an efficient allocation of resources and to reduce the burden on the budget. The staff also
stressed that there is a need to restructure companies in the transmission and distribution
sector. To this end, establishing a national electricity grid with a common tariff policy should
facilitate investment decisions nationwide. The staff stressed that targeted payments to some
nationals below a certain income level could be considered to protect them from the increase
in tariff rates. The authorities agreed with the staff recommendations; however, currently
there are no plans to adjust tariff rates.
11

An alternative scenario based on a conservative oil price, US$20 per barrel, and a long-term fiscal
sustainability analysis are discussed in Appendix IV.

27.
The staff stressed the need to have a coordinated strategy for economic
development among the emirates. Except for a number of areas such as labor, customs,
education, and foreign investment outside the free zones, on which a uniform federal policy
is in place, each emirate draws up and implements its own economic development strategy.
As such, there is scope for efficiency gains from the perspective of the country as a whole.
28.
In line with efforts to continue the process of economic diversification, the
U.A.E. is amending its Commercial Company Law, which may see the federal ceiling on
foreign ownership raised from the current 49 percent. This law is expected to establish a
"Foreign Direct Investment Commission," which will oversee foreign investment activity and
propose priority sectors. Certain foreign ventures with a high percentage of foreign
participation would require the approval of the Minister of Economy and Commerce. To
improve the business environment, Dubai has implemented a new Arbitration Law to fill the
legislative gap regarding resolution of commercial disputes. Also, measures are underway to
reform the commercial court system in Dubai and to establish a credit bureau system.

Labor policies
29.
Demographic dynamics point toward strains in the labor market emerging in the
period ahead. So far, most of the jobs in the private sector have been filled by expatriate
workers, with the majority of nationals continuing to seek employment in the public sector.
As a result, the authorities have implemented a number of new measures in recent years to
increase the cost associated with hiring expatriate workers. These measures include
quantitative quotas for nationals employed in the banking and insurance sectors and limited
transfers of sponsorship for broad classes of professions.12 The staff stressed that the liberal
labor policies adopted thus far in the U.A.E. have allowed the private sector to recruit
expatriate workers at internationally competitive wages. This policy has contributed to
economic growth and improved competitiveness of the nonhydrocarbon economy in the
U.A.E. As such, it is important that any future changes to labor policy do not adversely
impact the competitiveness of the economy.
30.
To create employment opportunities for U.A.E. nationals in the private sector
the authorities have developed programs at the emirates’ level to encourage domestic
entrepreneurship and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Key benefits of
these programs are simple and streamlined application process, competitive interest rates,
and favorable repayment terms. Also, a National Human Resource Development and
Employment Authority was created to train nationals to ensure that they have adequate skills
to be hired by the private sector. The staff recommended that these measures be
complemented by long-term structural policies in the areas of education, training, wage
policy, and reform of the current social benefits system. The staff stressed that, as long as
part of the salary of nationals in the public sector consists of social allowances (such as for
housing, marriage, and transportation), this creates an incentive to work in this sector, while
inflating nationals’ reservation wage. The staff recommended that these benefits be separated
from wage policies and be reduced gradually over time. Also, consideration should be given
to gradually increase working hours in the public sector to match those in the private sector.
B. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal policies
31.
In discussing fiscal transparency, the staff stressed that the flow of data among
the emirates and the federal government needed urgent improvement in order to
enhance policy coordination and to be able to assess efficiency of fiscal policy. Also,
progress needs to be made in increasing transparency about the disposition of Abu Dhabi’s
12

The authorities have also increased various fees paid by foreign workers, including health care and
visa charges, taken steps to crack down on an estimated large pool of illegal foreign workers, and
reduced the mandatory retirement age for expatriate workers from 60 to 55 years. Also, employers are
now required to deposit in a local bank, as guarantee, AED 3,000 for each foreign worker they hire.
These deposits will not earn interest.

- 26 -

oil and gas proceeds. On the disposition of oil and gas revenues, a key feature is that some
revenue is retained by the national oil company for financing of investments, or is transferred
directly to Abu Dhabi’s government’s foreign assets, rather than accruing to the budget.
32.
The staff recommended that steps be initiated to ensure that the fiscal surpluses
are large enough to be consistent with the intergenerational equity objectives over the
longer term. The stock of total net wealth and net wealth per capita are projected to decline,
given the current policy stance and oil price projection. Moreover, pressures may build up for
an increase in expenditures to address the emerging unemployment pressures and unfunded
pension liabilities that are deemed to be large, but as yet have not been finalized.
Accordingly, the staff stressed that the structure of the budget needs to be strengthened
through expenditure and revenue measures.
33.
On the expenditure side, the staff welcomed the reduction in agricultural
subsidies in the emirate of Abu Dhabi and stressed the need to reduce subsidies on
water and electricity nationwide. Government employment should also be contained with
remuneration based on productivity and performance. The staff also stressed the need to
budget for the growing size of unfunded pension liabilities.
34.
On the revenue side, a broadening of the revenue base is needed, in particular,
the extension of the corporate income tax to the nonhydrocarbon sector and local
banks.13 In addition, since service activities account for about 43 percent of GDP, a low-rate
broad-based consumption tax on services, utilities, retail trade, and telecommunications was
recommended. The authorities agreed on the need to broaden the tax base and informed the
staff that a discussion, at the cabinet level, on the introduction of a value-added tax
(VAT) system is ongoing. A VAT will also allow the federal government to reduce its
dependence on charges and fees. Also, the emirates should consider introducing a property
tax.
35.
The federal government has been instrumental in narrowing income disparities
among the emirates by providing services and goods to the poor emirates with transfers
received from Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and own resources. However, the federal government’s
own finances are constrained by increasingly inelastic revenue sources and block transfers
from the emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai that have been fixed over time.
36.
The staff welcomed the progress made by the federal government in improving
the quality of public services and ensuring greater efficiency in public spending.
The 2004 budget incorporates a more thorough treatment of performance-based budgeting.
The federal government has begun casting its budget in a three-year medium-term budget
framework. In addition, the International Organization for Standardization quality
13

Apart from profit tax on oil and gas companies, corporate income tax of 20 percent on foreign
banks and low import tariffs, the U.A.E. has no other sources of tax revenue.

- 27 -

management principles are being applied across the federal government, with each agency
clearly defining its mission and objectives that are consistent with performance-based
budgeting. The federal government at the same time is also proceeding with corporatization
of various supporting services to ministries that can be contracted out or completely financed
and operated outside the federal government.
Monetary policy and the financial sector
37.
Given the significant increase in money supply since 2001, the staff
recommended that the authorities monitor bank credit closely in 2004, and tighten
conditions if needed. The authorities were of the view that the increase in credit to the
private sector was consistent with economic developments in the nonhydrocarbon sector,
well diversified across sectors, and does not pose a concern at this point. However, they
indicated that monetary conditions will be tightened, if needed.
38.
The money supply will continue to be regulated mainly by adjustments in
domestic interest rates in order to maintain a small differential with rates prevailing in
the global markets, and the use of certificates of deposits (CDs) and foreign exchange
swaps. The staff supported the authorities’ strategy, but recommended that the CBU consider
moving from tap sales of CDs to an auction supplemented by a penalty rate discount window
in order to allow an interbank repo market to develop. The authorities agreed with this
recommendation and as a first step in that direction, the CDs’ maturity will be extended from
the current 18 months to 36 months.
39.
The U.A.E. has a number of important unresolved issues in financial sector
regulation and development.14 Perhaps most pressing is the need for the CBU to transfer
regulatory role related to initial public offerings (IPOs) and mutual funds to the Emirates
Securities and Commodities Authority. Also, with the growth of Islamic banking, the CBU
should begin to develop a mechanism for institutional liquidity support that is compatible
with Islamic banking practices. The authorities agreed with the staff that it would be useful to
have the regulatory arrangements of the DIFC fully assessed by the Fund in the near future.
40.
The authorities have continued their efforts to combat money laundering and the
financing of terrorism, an area that also covers informal funds transfers. A new law
dealing with financing of terrorism (FT) has been drafted and is expected to be enacted in the
near future. With the enactment of the FT law, the U.A.E. would be compliant with most of
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. The U.A.E. legal and
institutional regime for AML/CFT is comprehensive, modern and reasonably implemented.
A law criminalizing money laundering that was adopted in 2002 has been widely cited by the
United Nations as a model of good practice.

(Figure 3). The cumulative appreciation does
not seem to have hindered the country’s
competitiveness, the role of the private sector has been enhanced, and the economy is among
the most diversified in the GCC region (Figure 4). Also, nonhydrocarbon exports and reexports experienced rapid growth. Since 1995, non-oil exports have grown at over 17 percent
per year, and re-exports at about 8 percent per year. A large part of the U.A.E.’s
nonhydrocarbon exports go to the other GCC countries and Iran, which also have
experienced similar appreciation.

42.
The business-friendly environment; good infrastructure; access to expatriate
workers at internationally competitive wages; have been key to maintaining
competitiveness and growth in the non-oil sectors. These factors have made the U.A.E. an

- 30 -

attractive place to invest, particularly in the free zones, for companies seeking to serve the
growing markets of the Middle East, North Africa, India, and Pakistan.
43.
Progress continued toward regional integration within the GCC. Tariff rates have
been raised slightly to 5 percent effective 2003 in line with the Common External Tariff.16
The U.A.E. has participated in various technical committees in preparation for the adoption
of convergence criteria, scheduled for January 2005. In addition, the European Central Bank
is currently providing assistance in identifying the main indicators that will need to be
developed in preparation for the GCC-wide monetary union.
IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
44.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ cooperative approach in the provision of
detailed estimates on official foreign assets of the government. Such information was
necessary in clarifying the inter-sectoral linkages between oil, external, and fiscal
developments. Staff also welcomed the renewed efforts to form the Interministerial Statistical
Committee (ISC), in charge of collecting and compiling U.A.E. statistics, with members
from across the emirates and federal ministries.17 However, staff stressed that, in the near
term, to improve the U.A.E.’s economic statistics (see Appendix III) there is a need to
strengthen the current institutional base that exists at the CBU and the MOP for the collection
and compilation of financial, national accounts, and price statistics. The staff recommended
that an assessment of whether the MOP has sufficient resources to carry out its new mandate
be carried out.
45.
As for the fiscal accounts, there is a need to adopt a consistent and
comprehensive set of public sector accounts using a common methodology across the
eight budget systems. In this regard, staff recommended that a small unit, a Committee of
Fiscal Policy Coordination, be formed within the MOFI to provide coordination between the
federal government and the seven emirates with respect to classification and methodology.
46.
The authorities’ indicated interest in participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS). This is an important step toward building a national
statistics system that is consistent with internationally accepted best practice. In this
connection, the staff recommended that the authorities finalize the draft GDDS metadata
prepared jointly with the multi-sector mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department that
16

A minimum tariff rate of 5 percent applies to non-GCC imports while no tariffs apply to imports
from other GCC countries with at least 40 percent local value added. Tariffs in the U.A.E. are
consistent throughout the federation and all dutiable goods are subject to a 5 percent tariff with few
exemptions. Most foods, raw materials, precious metals and stones are exempted from import duties
in the U.A.E.
17

The ISC has been recently moved to the Ministry of Planning (MOP) from the Ministry of Finance
and Industry (MOFI).

- 31 -

visited the U.A.E. in December 2003 and to nominate a GDDS coordinator. The authorities
will be writing to the Fund’s Statistics Department on these issues after the formation of the
ISC is complete.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The U.A.E. has made impressive economic progress over the years, by
consistently pursuing an outward-oriented development strategy, prudent financial
policies, the utilization of oil revenues to diversify the economy, and the strengthening
of the financial sector. As a result, the role of the private sector has been enhanced, and the
economy is among the most diversified in the GCC region. Openness and a sound record in
macroeconomic management have contributed to the accumulation of a large stock of official
foreign assets.
48.
With high oil prices in 2002–03, the country’s financial situation strengthened
significantly, as reflected in the large fiscal and external current account surpluses.
Given the favorable prospects in the global oil market in 2004, economic developments are
projected to remain strong. However, to maintain wealth constant in real terms over the
medium term, the structure of the budget needs to be strengthened with the objective of
reducing the nonhydrocarbon budget deficit annually by about 1 percent of GDP. On the
expenditure side, government employment should be contained with remuneration based on
productivity and performance. Subsidies on water and electricity should be phased out and
replaced by targeted payments to nationals below a certain income. The revenue base could
be broadened by introducing a VAT system and the emirates could consider introducing
property taxes.
49.
While some emirates and the federal government are making efforts to improve
the efficiency of public administration, fiscal transparency remains a key challenge for
the authorities. Given the autonomy of emirate governments in public finance matters, the
staff is of the view that better coordination in setting policy objectives and instruments
among emirates would enhance efficiency and reduce the tendency for individual emirates to
outbid each other in investment incentives.
50.
The staff agrees with the thrust of the authorities’ monetary policy. On monetary
instruments, the staff recommends that the CBU considers moving from tap sales of CDs to
an auction, supplemented by a penalty rate discount window, in order to allow a repo market
based on CDs to develop. The U.A.E. authorities have undertaken a number of initiatives to
improve financial sector supervision and efficiency. Banks in the U.A.E. exceeded Basel
capital adequacy standards, and were well provisioned against classified loans. Also,
important measures have been implemented to combat money laundering and the financing
of terrorism, and a mechanism has been created to monitor informal funds transfers. The
U.A.E. legal and institutional regime for AML/CFT is comprehensive, modern and
reasonably implemented.

- 32 -

51.
The U.A.E. has a number of unresolved issues in financial sector regulation and
development. Perhaps the most immediate is the need to complete the rationalization of
responsibilities for securities regulation. With the growth of Islamic banking the CBU should
begin to develop a mechanism for institutional liquidity support that is compatible with
Islamic banking practices. Although complex financial groups are not now a factor in the
U.A.E., the lack of a consolidated supervisor is an important gap looking forward. The staff
strongly recommends that the regulatory arrangements of the DIFC be fully assessed
by the Fund in the near future.
52.
The staff continues to endorse the pegged exchange rate arrangement, which is
supported by the U.A.E.’s strong fundamentals, prudent macroeconomic management,
and sound financial system. This policy has served the country well by providing an anchor
for price stability, contributing to low inflation and market confidence. The nonhydrocarbon
GDP and exports have continued to experience buoyant growth over the past years
suggesting that the exchange rate remains viable from the view point of external
competitiveness.
53.
Overall, the staff agrees with the authorities’ labor market strategy to increase
employment opportunities for U.A.E. nationals. This strategy should continue to rely on
raising the skills of nationals through better education and training programs geared toward
private sector labor demand, while avoiding mandatory measures, such as quotas. The staff
also recommends the implementation of labor legislation reform to provide flexibility in
hiring and firing. Also, reform of the current social benefits system to move toward
equalization of wages in the private and public sectors is needed.
54.
Staff welcomes the provision of detailed data on the government foreign assets.
This provision improved staff’s assessment of the overall macroeconomic conditions and
resulted in revisions in the fiscal accounts for the period 1999–2002. The staff also welcomes
the renewed efforts of the Interministerial Statistical Committee and the authorities’
indication to participate in the GDDS. However, for the U.A.E.’s economic statistics to
improve with respect to data quality, coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and consistency
increased coordination between federal and emirates’ authorities and training of staff are
necessary conditions. Also, the authorities need to ensure that the MOP has sufficient
resources to carry out its new mandate of addressing the shortcomings of the U.A.E.’s
statistical data base.
55.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

United Arab Emirates: Relations with the World Bank Group
As of March 30, 2004
At the request of the government, the World Bank has been providing the U.A.E. with
technical assistance in the following areas:
•

A Framework Agreement for annual technical cooperation programs was signed in
1994 that replaced the previous requests which were on an ad hoc basis. The first Annual
Work Program 1995–96 included two main studies—a Comprehensive Health
Assessment Study and a study to restructure Government Information Authority, the
government’s computer center.

•

Education sector, recruitment, and welfare. Three projects in these areas were
completed in 2000. Public Expenditure Review for the Education Sector; Review and
Assessment of Recruitment Procedures for the Federal Government; and Analysis of
Distribution of Welfare in Abu Dhabi.

•

Dubai Aid City. In August 2003, the government requested Bank support in establishing
Dubai Aid City in Jebel Ali Free Zone. Terms of Reference were submitted in
January 2004 and the Bank is waiting for comments.

•

Children’s Science Museum (CSM). In May 2003, the Bank received a request from
Dubai Municipality for assisting it in establishing a CSM. This project is on hold. After
discussion with the Municipality, it was deemed not to be high on their priority list.

•

Environmental Assessment. In August of 2003, the U.A.E. showed interest in Bank
support for a U.A.E.-wide environmental assessment. A Bank needs-assessment mission
visited Dubai early this year to develop the project concept.

•

Investment Climate. In response to a request from the advisor to the Crown Prince of
Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) for assistance with Foreign Investment and Economic
Development, a World Bank mission visited the Emirates late February 2004. Following
discussion in RAK, the Bank team prepared TORs for the first phase of a four-phase
program, and an agreement was signed in late March. Implementation of the project is
expected to begin at end of April.

APPENDIX III

United Arab Emirates: Statistical Issues
1.
There are numerous shortcomings in the U.A.E.’s economic and financial data. These
reflect inadequate compilation techniques, infrequent data reporting, shortage of trained staff,
insufficient resources assigned to data gathering, and poor information flow between federal
and emirate governments, and public sector entities.19 As a result, provision of data to the
Fund between missions remains poor, except for monetary and fragmentary trade statistics.
In addition, the low frequency of official statistics—most data are produced only on an
annual basis—also hampers this provision. This appendix reviews the overall status of
statistical issues by sector. Data on core economic indicators are found in the attached Table.
2.
The U.A.E. has received four STA technical assistance missions over the past decade.
The most recent mission (December 2003) conducted a comprehensive assessment of the
country’s statistical database20, the second such assessment since June 1993. The 2003
mission concluded that, while the methodology used to compile macroeconomic statistics is
generally appropriate, in most sectors serious deficiencies exist. These are attributable to the
lack of sufficient and regular data sources in the real sector; inadequate coordination among
the data compiling agencies; and constraints from distribution of personnel and financial
resources between the federal government and the largest emirates. In response to the
authorities’ interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), the
2003 mission worked with U.A.E. officials to prepare draft GDDS metadata, which require
finalization by the authorities. This step, together with nomination of a GDDS coordinator,
and agreement by the authorities to use the GDDS as a framework for the development of the
country’s statistical system, would complete the criteria needed for the U.A.E. to become a
GDDS participant.
I.

Real Sector

3.
The Ministry of Planning (MOP) compiles an annual CPI, which is disseminated
three months after the end of the reference year. A number of shortcomings exist with respect
to the methodology of the CPI, including: (i) outdated weights are not representative for all
geographic regions; (ii) no imputations are made for missing price data; (iii) replacement
product prices are not adjusted for changes in quality; and (iv) base price and expenditure
weights refer to different periods. Because of the lack of resources, the MOP has no nearterm plans to compile the CPI monthly. MOP does not currently compile a producer price
index, an import price or an export price index, a significant deficiency, given the role of the
oil sector in the U.A.E.
19

During the period 2001–02, compilation staff in the Ministry of Planning was reduced somewhat,
as was financial support for surveys and other activities. Key members of the remaining staff (all
expatriates) are nearing retirement; questions of training and replacements are not known to have
been addressed.

APPENDIX III

4.
The MOP compiles and disseminates annual estimates of gross domestic product
(GDP) by production and expenditure approach in current and constant 1995 prices. The
national accounts compilation system suffers from a number of deficiencies. There is no
comprehensive data collection program to provide a basis for compiling national accounts
aggregates. The existing system relies heavily, instead, on administrative and other ad hoc
data collected by federal and emirate institutions. The data collected are mostly quantity data.
The last benchmark data available for compiling output are from 1995, while for intermediate
consumption from 1980. Basic data remain inadequate for manufacturing, construction,
wholesale and retail trade, and most of the other service sectors. In particular, real value
added for petrochemicals, which accounts for nearly half of total manufacturing value added,
is not estimated according to the 1993 SNA methodology. Instead, as is done with real
hydrocarbon value added, nominal value added is deflated by an estimated import price
deflator. This methodology yields a purchasing power measure of petrochemical output,
which may result in under or overestimation of volume growth, depending on changes in
crude oil prices. Despite their importance in total GDP, oil and gas sector data are estimated
by MOP staff based on news sources and data received with a lag from the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company (ADNOC). No national household budget survey has ever been
conducted. In addition to the inadequate sources, the statistical techniques used in compiling
GDP by production and expenditure approach are also not sound.
5.
Although labor statistics collected in the census are broadly in line with ILO
recommendations, there are notable divergences from ILO definitions, including
inconsistency of some concepts and irregular and incomplete updating of the census data.
Lack of regular household surveys prevents compilation of annual data on basic national
labor force statistics such as wages, unemployment, labor force and employment. Wage
statistics are, for example, available only for a small proportion of government employees.
II.

Fiscal Sector

6.
Principal deficiencies can be attributed both to the lack of coordination among the
emirates and federal government, and the low frequency in reporting of government financial
operations. The Ministry of Finance and Industry (MOFI) compiles data for the federal
government only. Separate fiscal data on the federal government and three emirates
(Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah)21, which are provided to the annual Article IV
consultations, are employed by Fund staff to provide a consolidated fiscal account for the
U.A.E. An annual, “consolidated” fiscal statement is published in the central bank’s
Statistical Bulletin, which is different from the Fund staff presentation. In particular,
investment income from government assets is not included in the fiscal account. In addition,
key information, such as investment income, and expenditure under the control of the
respective Rulers’ Offices and municipalities, remains off budget in some emirates, hindering
21

In the past, information on the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah was also included, but this information
was not available in the 2004 Article IV consultation.

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

comparison of fiscal developments across the emirates and the federal government.
International standard of economic classification of expenditure and revenue are not fully
followed.
7.
The last data reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook were for 1999 and covered only the federal government. Data on government
foreign assets and income are not provided. No financing information is provided by either
the federal authorities or any of the emirates. No sub-annual data are reported for publication
to the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS). Information on pension fund activities
that are administered by the authorities through the federal-level General Pension and Social
Security Authority (GPSSA) has been available since the 2002 consultation mission.22
III.

Monetary Sector

8.
Until recently, the principal issues in monetary statistics were limited to the
classification and sectorization of loans to the corporate, other resident, and non-resident
sectors. Starting in mid-2001, however, the Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) changed the
method for compilation of banking data, such that deposits of U.A.E. residents booked in
overseas branches/subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks were included in the measure of
broad money, and cross border flows back to head offices were treated as “domestic.”23 The
rationale behind this change, as explained by authorities, was their observation that almost all
of the funds deposited in the overseas branches (to circumvent the reserve requirement)
almost instantly found their way back into the domestic banking system. The compilation
introduced in mid-2001 does not follow internationally accepted standards that are based on
the residency principle. This compilation results in distortions in both net foreign assets of
the banking system, which are needed for the balance of payments (BOP) accounts, and in
measurement of broad money.
9.
The 2003 STA multisector mission recommended that two sets of data be compiled—
a core set for monetary reporting purposes and a supplementary data set that meets other
objectives of the authorities. The multisector mission also recommended that lags in
monetary statistics, which are compiled monthly, but reported only quarterly, be reduced; full
coverage of IMF accounts; further sectorization of financial transactions, in particular of
various emirate government accounts, that are currently reported in aggregate form; and
further instrument classification of foreign securities and domestic investments into bonds,
shares, and other equities. During the 2004 Article IV consultation mission the authorities
22

The GPSSA was established in January 1999 to provide pension and social security insurance
benefits to all nationals working in the government and the private sectors (except Abu Dhabi
government employees which have their own separate pension fund).

23

The compilation initially introduced a bias into banking statistics, especially net foreign positions of
commercial banks, of about Dh 20 billion. BOP flows are also compromised, because these statistics
are the source of banking flows in the BOP accounts.

- 39 -

APPENDIX III

indicated that publication of the corrected numbers (including relevant history), based on the
residency principle would begin with the June 2004 issue of the CBU Quarterly Bulletin.
IV.

External Sector

10.
Balance of payments (BOP) statistics suffer from a lack of primary data sources for
most transactions.24 Only one CBU staff member is assigned to BOP compilation, and
cooperation from other government agencies remains negligible. Many entries are estimates
based on incomplete or outside information, and some important transactions, such as foreign
direct investment (FDI), are not covered at all. There are major gaps in official and private
transfers, oil companies’ service payments, private and official investment income, and
financial transactions for all sectors except banks. Although technical assistance was
provided by the Fund in 1995, there has been no progress in addressing these shortcomings.
Progress continues to be hampered by staffing limitations in the compilation unit, inadequate
inter-agency cooperation, and other restrictions on the CBU with respect to collection of data
from individuals and institutions other than the banking. The U.A.E. does not report BOP
data for publication in the IMF’s IFS (with the exception of trade statistics, which have been
irregular at best), or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
11.
The authorities publish and provide data to Fund missions on banking system foreign
assets. Detailed information on central bank reserves and foreign currency liquidity is
available. Commercial bank data are also reported. These data are disseminated on a monthly
basis. Since 2000, the authorities in the emirate of Abu Dhabi have provided to Fund staff,
during Article IV consultation missions, approximate information on the Emirate’s stock of
external assets. In the 2004 Article IV consultation, some details on the stock of official
foreign assets of the government were provided; in addition to an approximate aggregate
stock figure as has been the practice since 2000.
12.
The authorities do not compile or publish an International Investment Position (IIP)
statement, despite ready availability of certain potential sources, such as banking and
government statistics. Also, no data on FDI or private nonfinancial sector external assets and
liabilities are collected—although, according to BIS statistics the U.A.E.’s external liabilities
are relatively small.
V.

Socio-demographic Statistics

13.
The U.A.E. follows the practice of many other countries, with the Central Statistics
Department (CSD) of the Ministry of Planning taking the lead in conducting the population
census and large surveys, while line ministries collect data through their administrative
reporting systems. In the area of socio-demographic statistics, cooperation between the CSD
and the various line ministries is effective, with the CSD using data from the other ministries
24

Errors and omissions averaged about 11 percent of GDP during the 1990s.

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

in its annual statistical yearbook. The CSD also cooperates with the line ministries as needed
and has provided methodological support for the various household surveys that have been
conducted. As in other countries, a population and housing census is conducted every
10 years. However, public dissemination of the latest census, which relates to 1995, is rather
limited. At present, no data exist on measures of income distribution, poverty and access to
basic services.

APPENDIX IV

United Arab Emirates:
Fiscal Sustainability with Low Debt and High Wealth
1.
Following a methodology similar to previous consultations, staff conducted a long
term sustainability of the U.A.E.’s fiscal position until it runs out of oil.25 This appendix
describes the underlying analysis for staff recommendations regarding the nature and size of
fiscal adjustment.
2.
At end-2003, U.A.E. government debt was only 7.3 percent of GDP and is projected
to decline to 3.2 percent of GDP under the baseline scenario presented in Table 6.26 The issue
of fiscal sustainability is thus one of preserving oil wealth for future generations. At the
assumed production rate (see Table 1 below), U.A.E. would have oil for another 100 years.
In addition, the U.A.E. also has largely untapped gas reserves which would last for at least
100 years. However, the U.A.E. has high dependence on revenues from its hydrocarbon
sector. During the last 10 years, for example, hydrocarbon revenues stood at 79 percent of the
consolidated government revenues (excluding staff estimates of investment income). At
current WEO prices, this ratio is projected to rise to 84 percent in 2004 and decline to
81 percent in 2009 as oil prices fall (Table 6).
3.
Due to the volatile nature of oil prices and uncertain oil production, any fiscal
adjustment that comes about as a result of adverse developments in the oil market will have
to rely on a mix of above-the-line adjustment, revenues and expenditures, and below-the-line
financing. In the absence of any sizable adjustments in non-oil revenues and structure of
expenditures, official assets have to be drawn down to finance the overall deficit. However,
this would entail giving up the government’s objective of at least maintaining real wealth
constant for future generations. Therefore, the decision to use investment income to finance
the deficit, that is, to liquidate assets, means reducing government’s gross stock of wealth.
4.
Against the above, the standard framework for fiscal sustainability in oil producing
countries is the permanent income theory which takes a long-term view of the value of oil in
the ground. A conservative and reasonable assumption within this framework calls for
maintaining government net wealth constant in real terms. Government net wealth consists of
oil wealth (present value of oil in the ground) plus official government financial assets less
government debt. As oil in the ground is being depleted, part of the government revenue
from sale of its oil is consumed and part is saved in financial assets. Therefore, as oil wealth
declines over time, financial wealth net of government debt has to increase enough in order
25

See the Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix report (SM/03/35) and the Staff Report
(SM/03/31) prepared for the 2002 Article IV consultation. This framework has been featured in
several staff reports or Selected Issues for oil rich countries.
26

Repayment of the principle on the bond issued by the Emirate of Dubai in 2003 in advance of the
Annual Meetings is the main reason for the decline.

- 43 -

APPENDIX IV

to maintain net wealth constant in real terms. Under the permanent income theory, the
required government consumption out of net wealth is in fact the maximum permissible
nonhydrocarbon deficit (excluding investment income). Any higher deficit means a declining
net wealth and any lower deficit implies rising net wealth as higher saving than that implied
by the permanent income allows a faster accumulation of financial assets.
5.
Given the U.A.E.’s fiscal vulnerability to oil price fluctuations, nonhydrocarbon fiscal
deficit (excluding investment income) should not exceed the estimated permanent income
implied under the permanent income theory.27 At the current WEO oil price projection of
US$26 per barrel over the 2004–09 period and other assumptions in Table 1 below as well as
the objective of maintaining net wealth constant in real terms, U.A.E.’s permanent income is
estimated at AED 77.7 billion. Under the same set of assumptions, but using a conservative
long run oil price of US$20 per barrel, which is roughly 20 percent below the WEO
projection for the 2004–09 period28 U.A.E.’s permanent income is estimated at
AED 63 billion per year over the 2004–09 period.29 By contrast, the projected
nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit (excluding investment income) under the baseline fiscal policy
scenario (Table 6) is AED 81 billion per year over the same period. Therefore, a fiscal
adjustment of AED 18 billion, equivalent to 20 percent of government spending in 2003 or
6 percent of 2003 GDP, is needed over the period to bring nonhydrocarbon fiscal balance
(excluding investment income) in line with the estimated permanent income. At current
WEO average oil price of US$26 per barrel, the size of adjustment is lower, amounting to
AED 3.4 billion per year which is equivalent to 3.6 percent of government spending in 2003
or 1.1 percent of 2003 GDP.
6.
If the government’s objective is to maintain net wealth per capita constant in real
terms, then a higher level of saving is need in order to allow for the population growth rate.
Given the assumed population growth rate of 2.5 percent, and other assumptions in Table 1
below, the estimated permanent income would be AED 26.8 billion. Therefore, a much larger
fiscal adjustment (AED 54.2 billion, equivalent to 60 percent of spending in 2003 or
18 percent of GDP) is needed to ensure intergenerational equity in the sense of giving each
citizen equal share of net wealth. Although this is a very tight fiscal policy and not practical
in a medium-term horizon of 3 to 5 years, it illustrates that over time the U.A.E. economy
needs to generate higher non-oil revenues and cut expenditures in order to maintain per
capita wealth constant.
27

Inclusion of investment income results in the same fiscal stance since it will be added to both the
permissible nonhydrocarbon deficit under the permanent income theory and the nonhydrocarbon
deficit in the baseline scenario.
28

This is the stated government objective although actual implementation of budget during the year is
not based on the “budgeted” assumption, but on recent price developments; see Box 2 and Para 22 for
more details.

29

This estimate therefore takes into account over 100 years of oil production.

- 44 -

APPENDIX IV

7.
Staff also conducted a long-term fiscal sustainability analysis of the U.A.E.’s baseline
fiscal policy at a horizon extending beyond 2106, the year in which the U.A.E. is estimated to
exhaust its oil reserves. Even under this long term scenario, net wealth is projected to decline
in real terms unless corrective actions are taken in the interim period. 30

APPENDIX V

Financial Sector Developments in the United Arab Emirates
Overview31
1.
This Appendix examines trends of financial soundness indicators and recent developments
in the equity, bonds, and insurance markets, as well as in the payment system. Performance in
following up on the recommendations of the FSAP mission in 2001 is also assessed.
Banking sector
2.
The soundness of the banking sector in the U.A.E. remained strong as of end-2003. All
46 banks operating in the country met the minimum 10 percent capital-assets ratio (CAR); the
system-wide CAR exceeded 18 percent (Table 1 below). While the gross nonperforming loan
(NPL) ratio remains relatively high at 14 percent, this reflected court practices that create significant
disincentives to writing off bad loans. Provisions are considerable, however, bringing the net NPL
ratio below 2 percent and no major credit problems have developed since 1998. Bank lending has
grown solidly, increasing at an annual rate of about 17 percent between end-2001 and
September 2003, but was well diversified across industries. Bank exposure to the booming
construction sector has stayed under control; that sector’s share of total loans actually fell to
15.5 percent in 2003 from 16.4 percent a year earlier.
3.
Although there has been some shift from interbank placements to securities
investments, market risk overall remained limited. Interest rate mismatches are small, since
longer-term fixed rate lending is not well developed. The share of mortgages in total loans declined
in 2003 to 4.7 percent from 6.3 percent in 2002. While banks have a substantial long dollar position,
foreign exchange risk is limited by government’s credible commitment to a dollar peg, while nondollar exposures are small. Profitability remained strong in 2003, with banking system rate of return
on assets (ROA) averaging 2.3 percent and rate of return on equity (ROE) at 16.4 percent.
4.
Banking supervision has improved. Annual comprehensive examinations of banks’ risk
control capabilities were implemented in 2003 and have been completed for about half of the banks,
including most of the major ones. These are followed up by targeted examinations of areas where
weaknesses are identified and by action plans for improvements.
5.
Several important steps have been taken in the past few years to address money
laundering and financing of terrorist activities. Tighter regulations now apply across the emirates
financial sector. Some Hawala dealers have voluntarily registered and been certified by the CBU
and are required to report on a quarterly basis to the CBU their records on transactions exceeding
AED 2000. As of end-February 2004, the CBU had received 112 applications for registration and
89 certificates had been issued.

6.
A new law dealing with financing of terrorism (FT) has been drafted and is expected to
be enacted in the near future. With the enactment of the FT law, the U.A.E. would be compliant
with most of the FATF recommendations. The U.A.E. legal and institutional regime for AML/CFT
is comprehensive, modern and reasonably implemented. A law criminalizing money laundering that
was adopted in 2002 has been widely cited as a model of best practices.

- 47 -

APPENDIX V

Payment system
7.
The CBU has implemented, as of August 2003, an automated real time gross
settlements interbank payment system for large interbank transfers that replace the previous
Telex Transfer System, which is now used only by some small banks and government agencies.
8.
The CBU has not changed its overdraft policies. Overdrafts are still granted on an
uncollateralized basis for amounts that exceed the reserve account balance of the drawing bank at a
penalty rate (5 percentage points over the three-month interbank rate) for up to six days, by which
time the bank must reconstitute a positive clearing balance. This procedure potentially exposes the
CBU but it has not been a practical problem because there have been no instances of overdraft in
recent years since the FSAP mission considered the matter in 2001.
9.
Following on an instance of ATM fraud, the CBU issued a notice in June 2003 directing
banks to tighten ATM security and to pay all legitimate customer claims promptly.
Monetary operations
10.
The CBU continues to provide CDs to banks of up to 18 months maturity at set rates on tap
and to buy them back from banks when offered. This practice has tended to inhibit the development
of a domestic interbank market, as any short-term liquidity needs of banks are met directly by the
central bank. The mission recommended that the CBU consider shifting to an auction of CDs and
extending the range of maturities out to 36 months while shifting from the current practice of
buybacks to utilizing a discount window with collateral as the key mechanism to inject liquidity.
These steps would allow an interbank market for short-term liquidity to emerge among U.A.E.
banks based on repos of outstanding CBU CDs. It would also substitute collateralized discount
window borrowing for the current arrangement of uncollateralized overdraft credit.32
Securities markets
11.
Securities markets in the U.A.E. continue to develop, with transactions volume up
40 percent in 2003. Still, market liquidity remains relatively low and speculation is restrained. The
general market index33 grew 32 percent last year, among the lowest appreciations in the GCC area,
and the average P/E ratio was only 19.
12.
There are two exchanges in the U.A.E., the Abu Dhabi Securities Market (ADSM) and
the Dubai Financial Market (DFM). Equities are also traded in an over-the-counter market, which
32

The Government of Dubai has issued dirham bonds that could also be suitable collateral for the discount
window.
33

This index is an average of prices on the two exchanges in the U.A.E., the Abu Dhabi Securities Market
and the Dubai Financial Market.

- 48 -

APPENDIX V

is a small fraction of the capitalization of the exchange-listed stocks. The two markets are fully
electronically linked, allowing investors to place orders for stocks from either exchange with
brokers from either exchange. The markets continue to settle trades on different bases, however
(ADSM at T+1 and DFM at T+2).
13.
The ADSM is the third largest stock market by capitalization in the Arab world
(behind Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) at more than AED 111 billion at end-2003. Prices on the market
rose about 22 percent in 2003. Market listings are dominated by banks and services firms (including
Etisalat, the telecommunications company). Thirty companies are listed, with ten or more expected
to be added this year. The ADSM has cross listing with Qatar and Sudan and is seeking to add an
Egyptian firm.
14.
The DFM has a market capitalization of about AED 60 billion and saw price increases
of about 45 percent last year. The higher price appreciation in Dubai reflects a greater number of
firms involved in construction and real estate, which have been booming. For example, the new
listing for AMLAK, the financing arm of Emaar Properties, the largest real estate developer in the
country, was oversubscribed some 30 times. Two domestic bond issues, for Emirates Airlines and
the Government of Dubai, are also listed on the DFM.
15.
The Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority (ECSA) is now staffed with over
35 personnel and is conducting informal visits with brokers, but not yet full examinations.
ECSA has become a member of IOSCO and indicated a willingness to have a ROSC, which was not
conducted during the 2001 FSAP.
16.
The ECSA licenses brokers on the two exchanges. Listed companies are required to
publish IAS-compliant accounts and ECSA is moving to require that all public stock companies list
on the exchanges, an action that would effectively eliminate the OTC market.
17.
The ECSA intends to merge the two exchanges; it has approached EuroNext (the common
exchange of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands) to study how to effect the merger. Regulatory
authority related to securities markets is still divided. The CBU retains licensing authority for OTC
brokers and investment advisors and regulates IPOs and investment trusts and mutual funds.
Insurance
18.
The Ministry of Economy and Commerce (MOEC) has proposed various amendments to the
Insurance Law. Among these are:
•

A new structure for the control and supervision of insurance that sets up a Supervision and
Oversight Department and Commission to ensure the financial soundness of companies. A
Higher Insurance Commission will be established to set up overall policy;

•

New rules on risk allocation and financial solvency margins that bring technical
specifications up to international good practice;

- 49 -

APPENDIX V

•

Empowerment of the Council of Ministers to establish a fund to guarantee contracts to
policy holders and beneficiaries;

•

A possible relaxation of foreign equity participation in insurance companies of up to
49 percent. At present, no participation is allowed. This amendment was previously rejected
by the Emirates Assembly and a final decision on its inclusion has not been made. The
presence of foreign insurance companies in the U.A.E. would be limited to representative
offices.

The MOEC is expected to have legal action taken in 2004.
Legal developments
19.
In addition to the proposed changes to the Insurance Law discussed above, the following
legal changes are under consideration:
•

Proposed amendments to the Companies Law are before the Cabinet. These changes
would allow foreigners to acquire a greater than 49 percent equity share of domestic
businesses (except insurance) on a case-by-case basis to be determined by the Minister of
Economy and Commerce.

•

A variety of draft amendments to the Banking Law are under consideration in the
CBU. The process of implementing Banking Law amendments has been protracted by
adding additional amendments to the vehicle on the grounds that this law has a relatively
good prospect of final enactment. Among the actions proposed are giving the CBU power to
approve external auditors of banks on fit and proper criteria, reserving to the CBU powers to
license brokerages, giving legal standing to the computerized records of banks, protecting
the legal rights of widows to joint bank accounts, strengthening the requirement for prior
CBU approval for purchase of a 5 percent or greater shareholding, and protecting
supervisors from liability in carrying out their duties.

Dubai International Financial Market
20.
Considerable progress was made in 2003 in implementation of plans to set up the
Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). The DIFC, an initiative of the Government of
Dubai, is a financial “free zone” that will be located within Dubai in a multi-billion dollar complex
of modern structures, called Capital Dubai, on which construction began in 2003. The DIFC will
encompass a comprehensive set of international financial functions, including institutional and
investment banking, asset management, insurance and re-insurance, Islamic finance, back-office
operations, and the Dubai Regional Exchange (DRX), an international exchange that will trade a
full range of financial instruments. The DIFC Operating Company (DOC) facilitates the
establishment of the center and will be responsible for its operation.

- 50 -

APPENDIX V

21.
A unique aspect of the DIFC is the nature of its regulatory structure. The strategic
conception is to provide a comprehensive, international good practice regulatory capability
supported by an extensive set of separate enabling laws and a separate judiciary at the emirate level.
This regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), is a full-scope regulator modeled on
the FSA of the U.K., much as the DIFC itself mirrors many aspects of the London Euromarkets.
This approach has been legitimated by a constitutional amendment and a U.A.E. federal law that
allow emirates to form financial free zones independent of the civil and commercial (but not
criminal) laws of the U.A.E. and the emirates. Although the architects of the DIFC have sought to
build a strong legal foundation, the structure of the DIFC is apparently without precedent and
creates untested legal risks. Furthermore, since both the operating and regulatory arms of the DIFC
are subordinate to the Government of Dubai, the governance structure holds the potential for
conflicts of interest for regulation.
22.
By design, of course, the DIFC is intended to be segregated from the financial sector of
the U.A.E. Banking operations in the DIFC are confined to institutional wholesale banking, with
both deposit taking and dealing in dirham prohibited. Moreover, since the U.A.E. pegs the dirham
to the dollar and does not follow an independent monetary policy, loss of monetary control arising
from the leakage of funds between the sectors is not major issue. Still, the opportunity for financial
innovations to exploit regulatory arbitrage and produce shifts of funds between the DIFC and the
U.A.E. will depend on the specifics of regulations and operations and will require careful
monitoring.
23.
The DIFC has strong momentum. Its basic law is essentially finalized and much of the
enabling legislation and regulations have been drafted. High level staffing of the DOC and DFSA is
advanced. Capital Dubai is under construction. A number of major international firms have
announced plans to participate and some key bond issuers, including the World Bank, have
committed to listing issues on the DRX. The current track anticipates operations beginning in
early 2005 with about 20–25 firms operating.
FSAP recommendations
24.
Following on FSAP recommendations, the U.A.E. authorities have undertaken a number
of initiatives to improve financial sector supervision and efficiency. Major actions include the
implementation of annual comprehensive risk-focused examinations of banks’ risk control,
establishment of operational capability for ECSA, liberalization of foreign ownership of real estate,
implementation of an automated RTGS interbank payment system, and improvements in the
transparency of regulatory actions (Table 2). Progress in legal reforms, however, has been slower.
The process of amending the Banking Law, for example, has been protracted by adding additional
amendments to deal with a number of relatively technical issues.

- 51 -

APPENDIX V

Table 2: Status of FSAP Recommendations
Recommendation

Status

Banking and bank supervision
(1) Provide adequate lead time to ensure that
significant structural changes can be safely and
effectively implemented.

Comments that the mission received did not indicate a
problem and the authorities appear to move
deliberately on major changes.

(2) Develop a strategy to further reduce NPLs.

The treatment of NPLs remains unchanged. Court
practices create significant disincentives to writing off
bad loans, so they remain booked and amplify the
NPL ratio. Banks, however, have provisioned heavily.
A resolution requires legislative and judicial reform.

(3) Improve the supervision of complex financial
groups through regular contacts among the different
regulators.

Although complex financial groups are not now a
factor in the UAE, the lack of a consolidated
supervisor is an important gap looking forward. Interregulator communication has improved but is still in
need of a more formalized structure.

(4) Establish procedures to pre-approve equity
holdings in banks exceeding 5 percent.

The CBU issued a circular in October 2003 requiring
approval and stricter language is included in the draft
amendments to the Banking Law.

(5) Issue appropriate rules requiring banks to have a
comprehensive risk management process.

This recommendation is being well-implemented. The
CBU has conducted comprehensive risk reviews for
nearly half of the commercial banks.

(6) Include off-balance sheet and interbank exposures
of less than 1 year in large exposures.

The CBU resists this action as too disruptive to the
bank financing of construction and thinks that risks
can be controlled through their system of monitoring
large unfunded exposures.

(7) Protect bank staff members who report suspicious
behavior from liability.

This is being dealt with through an amendment to the
Banking Law

Payment system
(1) Review overdraft policy to lend against proper
collateral.

The CBU still has a policy of extending overdraft
credit to a bank on an uncollateralized basis, although
no instance has developed since the FSAP mission
in 2001.

(2) Increase automation of procedures.

The CBU implemented in August 2001 a RTGS
automated interbank transfer system that replaces the
old Telex transfer system. Only few small banks and

- 52 -

Recommendation

Status
government participants still utilize the Telex system,
but they are expected to convert in the near future.

Securities
(1) Staff and establish operations of the Securities
Authority

ECSA has at least 35 staff and is adding more.
Informal contacts with brokers have begun, but not yet
formal exams.

(2) Rationalize the regulatory responsibilities of the
ECSA, CBU, and MOEC.

While some progress has been made along these lines
with the establishment of the ECSA, regulatory
authority regarding areas such as IPOs and mutual
funds should be shifted to the Securities Authority.

(3) Complete linkage of the electronic trading/clearing
operations of the two security exchanges.

DFM and ADSA do not cross list but have an
electronic linkage for their listed stocks. The
discrepancy between the two exchanges in settlement
dates still persists and should be addressed.

(4) Develop corporate debt market and increase
participation of nonbanks

Emirates Airlines and the Government of Dubai have
listed bond issues on the DFM.

Insurance
(1) Increase the staff and skills of the Insurance
Division of the MOEC

Amendments to insurance law that will set up a
Supervision and Control Department and improve
oversight capabilities are expected to be finalized
in 2004.

(2) Conduct a full review of insurance regulations.

Authorities stated that: (1) a Ministerial Decree was
issued to improve the transparency of information
provided by the sector and to bring its operations
closer to international standards; (2) regulations on
reserves were brought up to international standards
and improved standards are being embodied in law.

(3) Develop a deeper market for local property and
securities by allowing investment by foreign insurers.

Authorities are considering changing laws to allow
increased foreign purchases in company equities.

Legal, regulatory, and judicial systems
(1) Enact proposed amendments to companies’
legislation and make provision for improved minority

The process of amending the Companies Law is
underway. It is expected that the amendments will

operation of and accessibility to the Company
Register.

relax the constraint against majority foreign ownership
of companies, at least on a case by case basis.

(2) Improve registration of movable property.

Not yet implemented

(3) Simplify the real estate laws and improve the
operation of the Land Registry.

UAE law has been changed to allow individual
emirates to extend ownership rights for real property
to foreigners from non-GCC countries. Dubai and
other emirates have applied this change in the law. At
present, Abu Dhabi does not allow foreign purchases.

(4) Enact proposed amendments to the Banking Law.

Draft amendments to the Banking Law are being
considered by the CBU Board. These amendments
basically embody in law the current regulatory
practices of the CBU and do not contain any major
new initiatives.

(5) Consider providing specialized training for judges
on commercial matters.

Measures are under way to reform the commercial
court system in Dubai. Dubai also implemented a new
Arbitration Law to fill the legislative gap regarding
commercial disputes.

Transparency
(1) More actively seek stakeholder comments about
proposed regulations and laws relating to the financial
sector.

Market participants indicated that this
recommendation is met.

(2) The CBU should publish more information.

Market participants indicated that this
recommendation is met.

(3) The CBU should provide full sets of circulars and
regulations to market participants.

Market participants indicated that this
recommendation is met.

Issues
25.
The U.A.E. has a number of important open issues in financial sector regulation and
development. Perhaps most immediate is the need to finish the rationalization of responsibilities for

- 54 -

APPENDIX V

securities regulation. The CBU retains a principal regulatory role related to rules for IPOs and
mutual funds that should be transferred to ECSA. There are regulatory gaps that will become more
important as the financial sector develops: (a) the CBU should be empowered as the consolidated
supervisor for financial groups that include banking institutions; (b) as domestic mortgage and bond
markets develop, the central bank should move to implement procedures to require capital support
for market risk exposures. The CBU should consider moving from tap sales of CDs to an auction
supplemented by a penalty rate discount window in order to allow an interbank repo market based
on the CDs to develop. With the surging growth of Islamic banking, the CBU should begin to
develop a mechanism for institutional liquidity support that is compatible with Islamic banking
practices. Finally, since the unique nature of the governance relationships in the DIFC and its broad
scope of activities raise concerns about the nature what risks are being created, it would be useful to
have the regulatory arrangements of the DIFC fully assessed by the Fund in the near future.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director
for the United Arab Emirates
May 28, 2004
At the outset, on behalf of the authorities, I would like to thank the staff for a very
constructive and valuable consultation process. The staff report is comprehensive and
provides a thorough review of recent developments and the challenges that lie ahead.
Recent Economic Developments
Underpinned by a market-oriented and forward-looking economic development
strategy and an unwavering commitment to financial stability, the United Arab Emirates has
made impressive progress in promoting the role of the private sector and diversifying the
economy’s productive base, particularly in the areas of tourism and financial services. While
hydrocarbon is still a dominant sector in the economy and, in all likelihood, will remain so in
the foreseeable future, the authorities have been steadfast in optimizing the use of oil
resources to build up the infrastructure needed to support private sector activity in the non-oil
sectors.
Reflecting these developments, economic performance in the U.A.E. remains strong
as evidenced by the continuing improvement in economic and financial indicators. Overall,
economic growth reached 7 percent on the back of favorable developments in the oil sector
and continued robust growth of around 5 percent in the non-oil sector. While the expansion
of activity in the free zones has been a driving force in the steady increase in non-oil exports,
it is to be noted that exports from non-free zone companies are also showing healthy
increases. Along with higher oil prices, this has helped improve the external current surplus
to around 8.5 percent of GDP in 2003. Developments in the fiscal area are consistent with the
authorities’ prudent approach to the use of oil resources. The consolidated fiscal accounts are
estimated to have registered a sizeable surplus equivalent to 13.7 percent of GDP following a
similarly large surplus in 2002. These surpluses have allowed the authorities to increase their
holding of foreign assets in recent years and further support the drive toward intergenerational equity. Looking forward, the outlook for the U.A.E. economy is favorable. In
addition to higher projected oil receipts in 2004, growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector is
expected to remain robust given the continued strong activity in the areas of tourism, trade,
communication, and transport.
Fiscal Policy
The conduct of fiscal policy is guided by developments in the oil sector with the
objective of using oil resources for developing the non-oil sectors and preserving intergenerational equity. Given the concentration of oil resources in Abu Dhabi and the
institutional arrangements among the country’s seven emirates, the government of Abu
Dhabi plays a pivotal role in determining the overall direction of fiscal policy. The
authorities closely review developments in the oil market along with the Abu Dhabi National
Oil Company and adjust spending accordingly. As a rule, when the actual price falls short of
the budgeted assumptions, spending is curtailed in order to achieve the fiscal targets, while it

-2is kept constant when the price exceeds the conservative level assumed in the budget and the
resulting excess is saved. The authorities intend to continue with this prudent policy in the
period ahead.
There is a widely held recognition of the importance of improving the structure of the
budget on both the spending and revenue side for strengthening public finances dynamics.
While admittedly there is no urgency to making adjustment at this time, spending pressures
may well arise in the future to finance unfunded pension liabilities and address the potential
increase in unemployment. Consistent with their overall prudent and pre-emptive approach,
the authorities have reduced agricultural subsidies in Abu Dhabi and are considering similar
action on the national level with regard to water and electricity. To complement the ongoing
reforms on the spending side, the authorities are considering measures to broaden the tax
base and bring the non-oil sector into the revenue net. In particular, discussions are under
way in the cabinet on the introduction of a value-added tax, which should reduce reliance on
charges and fees, and more generally, on oil and gas revenues.
The federal government is now casting its budget in a three-year medium-term
framework and is applying the International Organization for Standardization quality
principles in its agencies. The authorities are also looking into other possible reform
measures in the area of public employment and pension. Important advances have been made
in improving the quality of public services and the efficiency of public spending. Progress
indeed is underway in corporatizing support services for ministries and in moving toward
performance-based budgeting.
Exchange Rate/Monetary Policy
The authorities share the staff’s view that the pegged exchange rate system, backed
by large government and central bank foreign assets and prudent financial policies, has
served the economy well. As evidenced from the buoyancy in the non-hydrocarbon sector
and the strong growth of non-oil exports over the past decade, the appreciation in the real
exchange rate since the early 1990s (notwithstanding the recent depreciation) does not appear
to have undermined the economy’s competitiveness.
In addition to the prudent fiscal policies pursued over the years, the authorities are
committed to maintaining their market-based interest rate and prudent credit policy to
support the exchange rate. While they believe that the recent increase in credit to the private
sector is consistent with developments in the non-oil sector, they stand ready to tighten
monetary conditions as needed. Given the limited availability of instruments to control
liquidity, the authorities agree with the staff on the need to lengthen the maturity of central
bank certificates of deposit and are giving consideration to moving from the current system
of tap sale to auctioning CDs.
Financial Sector Issues
The role of the U.A.E. as a regional financial sector continues to strengthen. The
banking sector is well-developed, well-supervised, and well-capitalized, with the minimum

-3requirements for the capital-assets ratio met by each of the 46 banks and exceeded by the
sector as a whole. The monetary authorities are keen on ensuring that the supervisory and
regulatory framework remains commensurate with the ongoing rapid development of the
financial sector. A number of initiatives based on the recommendations of the 2001 FSAP
mission were undertaken to strengthen the efficiency of the sector and its supervision,
including carrying out annual comprehensive examination of risk controls in banks. Tighter
regulations against money laundering and financing of terrorism apply across the system, and
a new law in this regard is expected to be enacted soon.
Moving forward, the authorities are turning their attention to three main financial
areas, namely securities market, Islamic banking, and the Dubai International Financial
Center (DIFC). Consideration is given to the transfer of the regulatory mandate over initial
public offerings and mutual funds to the Securities and Commodities Authority, and to the
development of a mechanism for institutional liquidity support for Islamic banks. The
development of the DIFC as a free financial zone segregated from the financial sector of the
U.A.E. and with a comprehensive, international good practice regulatory capability is
proceeding smoothly, and activities therein are expected to commence in 2005. Given the
original structure of the DIFC and the high priority accorded to having in place a sound
supervisory and regulatory framework, the authorities agree with the staff that it would be
useful to review the center soon after the start of its operation.
Structural Reform and Economic Diversification
In addition to promoting the development of the financial sector, a major effort has
been directed at supporting the expansion of private sector investment in tourism and
industry. This effort has been focused on improving the economy’s competitiveness so as to
allow the private sector to play a leading role in sustaining growth in the non-hydrocarbon
sector and creating employment opportunities for the growing national labor force. While
adhering to prudent macroeconomic policies, the authorities are also committed to providing
a modern and efficient infrastructure, improving the ownership and other rights for
foreigners, and privatizing public utilities. On the latter, progress has been made in
privatizing the electricity company in Abu Dhabi and the privatization of water and
electricity is planned to be concluded by 2006. In addition to announcing the launching of a
number of free zones, which have proven instrumental in encouraging non-oil sector activity,
the emirate of Dubai has extended foreign ownership of land and properties to some real
estate developments. The national government is amending the Commercial Company Law
which may include an increase in the current foreign ownership limit. A new Arbitration Law
has also been implemented in Dubai to improve the resolution of commercial disputes.
The authorities recognize the need to create employment opportunities for the
growing domestic labor force. Being mindful of the importance of addressing this issue
without undermining the competitiveness of the non-oil sector, they have developed
programs at the emirates’ level to promote domestic entrepreneurship and small- and
medium-sized enterprises, and have created a training agency to better prepare nationals for
private sector employment.

-4Statistical issues
The authorities are well aware of the problems associated with the country’s
statistical base. While the institutional arrangements among the emirates present a challenge
in this regard, particularly with regard to fiscal data, the authorities are making every effort to
address the existing weaknesses in all areas. They are redoubling their efforts to strengthen
the Inter-ministerial Statistical Committee in charge of collecting and compiling national
statistics. They are also interested in participating in the General Data Dissemination System,
which they are hopeful will anchor the ongoing efforts to improve the quality and coverage
of comprehensive national economic database.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the United Arab Emirates
On May 28, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates.1
Background
The pursuit of a highly liberal, business friendly and market-oriented growth strategy continues
to guide the evolution of U.A.E.’s economic development. Consistent with this strategy, each
emirate and the federal government conduct economic policies that reflect differences in their
natural resource endowments and their respective role within the federation. Openness and a
sound record in macroeconomic management have enhanced the role of the private sector
and contributed to the diversification of the economy.
In 2003, reflecting favorable developments in the oil market, higher oil production and prices,
the U.A.E.’s macroeconomic performance is estimated to have been strong. Non-hydrocarbon
real GDP growth is estimated to have remained robust at about 5 percent, one of the highest
in the Gulf Cooperation Council area. A number of projects were launched in 2003 in the areas
of construction, upstream gas, and downstream oil services. Inflation remained stable at
2.8 percent. Both the external current account and consolidated fiscal balances are estimated
to have recorded large surpluses, 8.5 percent and 13.7 percent of GDP, respectively.
The non-hydrocarbon deficit (excluding investment income) remained constant as a fraction of
non-hydrocarbon GDP, at about 37 percent. The stock market index, which has been rising
since 2001, increased sharply in 2003, by about 32 percent, on account of strong economic
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2conditions and optimism regarding the economic outlook. Foreign reserves of the central bank
at end-2003 remained steady at about US$15.0 billion, equivalent to about 4.0 months of
imports. The broad money stock increased by 16 percent, close to the rates of the previous
two years, mainly on account of about 13.5 percent increase in private sector credit. Much of
this credit was granted to wholesale trade, construction, and personnel loan sectors.
The financial sector continued to perform well. The U.A.E. banks remained well capitalized and
profitable. While the gross nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio at end-2003 remained relatively
high at 14 percent, though lower than 2001 and 2002, provisions are considerable, bringing
the net NPL ratio below 2 percent. The U.A.E. authorities have undertaken a number of
initiatives to improve financial sector supervision and efficiency. Several important steps have
been taken to address money laundering and financing of terrorist activities. As a result,
U.A.E. is being regarded as a best practice model in this area. Tighter regulations now apply
across the entire financial sector. Many Hawala (informal money transfers) dealers have
registered and been certified by the U.A.E. central bank and are required to report on a
quarterly basis their transactions records on transactions exceeding AED 2,000. As of
end-February 2004, the central bank has received 112 applications for registration and
89 certificates have been issued. Considerable progress was made in 2003 in implementing
plans to set up the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC)—a financial free zone—an
initiative of the Government of Dubai, which will deliver a comprehensive set of international
financial functions.
Progress in introducing structural reforms has varied among the emirates. Dubai has extended
foreign ownership of land and properties to some real estate developments and has also
announced the launch of several new free zones. Abu Dhabi is moving ahead with utility
privatization, with the objective to privatize its entire water and electricity sector by 2006.
Restrictions on foreign ownership of companies and properties, however, remain in place in
Abu Dhabi. The federal government has been implementing a series of reforms that include a
phased implementation of performance-based budgeting within a newly-introduced three-year
medium-term budget framework and corporatization of various supporting services.
In the area of labor policies, to create employment opportunities for U.A.E. nationals in the
private sector the authorities have developed at the emirates’ level programs to encourage
domestic entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Key benefits of these
programs are simple and streamlined application process, competitive interest rates, and
favorable repayment terms. Also, a National Human Resource Development and Employment
Authority was created to train nationals to ensure that they have adequate skills to be hired by
the private sector.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
United Arab Emirates for pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies, the prudent management
of oil resources, and an outward-oriented development strategy, which have resulted in low
inflation and high growth, as well as sizable fiscal and external current account surpluses, a
comfortable international reserve position, and the accumulation of foreign assets.
Further, they noted that sound policies supported by structural reforms have enhanced the role
of the private sector, contributed to growth of the nonhydrocarbon sector and diversification of
the economy, and enhanced the economy’s resilience to external shocks. Directors agreed
that the U.A.E. is in a strong position to take advantage of the global recovery and that the
macroeconomic outlook over the medium term remains strong.
To sustain these encouraging developments, Directors saw scope for further strengthening
fiscal policy and the financial sector, and further strengthening of the economic structure.
They called on the authorities to improve the structure of the budget over the medium term.
In particular, they noted the importance of reducing the deficit in the nonhydrocarbon portion of
the budget to ensure a measure of intergenerational equity. In this context, they recommended
constraining government employment and establishing a system of civil service remuneration
based on productivity and performance. Some Directors, however, noted that achieving
intergenerational equity could also be accomplished through the accumulation of productive
capital and improvement in labor productivity. Directors also supported reducing budgetary
subsidies, and in this regard welcomed the reduction in agricultural subsidies in the Emirate of
Abu Dhabi and recommended phasing out subsidies on water and electricity and replacing
them with targeted payments to nationals whose incomes fall below an established threshold.
On the revenue side, Directors were of the view that the revenue base needs to be
strengthened to reduce its reliance on oil and gas revenues, and recommended introducing a
value added tax in coordination with other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
expanding the base of the corporate income tax, and considering the introduction of a local
property tax.
While noting the efforts of some emirates and the federal government to improve the efficiency
of public administration, Directors also stressed the importance of improving fiscal data and
transparency, and the use of medium-term budget frameworks. They also encouraged the
authorities to improve fiscal policy coordination among the emirates.
Directors endorsed the pegged exchange rate arrangement. They noted that this policy has
provided an anchor for price stability, and contributed to low inflation and market confidence.
Directors agreed with the thrust of the authorities’ monetary policy and supported
strengthening the central bank’s instruments for controlling liquidity and encouraged the
authorities to move from tap sales of certificates of deposit to an auction system, in order to
allow the development of a repurchase market in certificates of deposit.
Directors noted the progress achieved in improving financial sector supervision. They also
highlighted the need to address a number of issues in financial regulation. In particular, they
supported the authorities’ intention to complete the rationalization of responsibilities for

-4securities regulation and develop a mechanism for adjusting liquidity that is compatible with
Islamic financial principles. Directors also agreed that there is a need to assess fully the
regulatory arrangements for the Dubai International Financial Center. They commended the
authorities for putting in place a comprehensive and modern AML/CFT regime, and looked
forward to the adoption of the draft law on the financing of terrorism. They also welcomed the
creation of a mechanism to monitor informal funds transfers and urged its vigorous
implementation.
Directors commended the U.A.E.’s open-border foreign labor policy, which has enabled the
private sector to recruit expatriate workers at internationally competitive wages, contributed to
economic growth, and improved competitiveness of the nonhydrocarbon economy.
They endorsed the authorities’ long-term labor market strategy to increase employment
opportunities for U.A.E. nationals. Directors stressed that such a strategy should continue to
rely on raising the skills of nationals through better education and training programs to meet
private sector labor demand, while avoiding mandatory measures such as quotas.
Directors further noted that labor market reforms should increase flexibility in hiring and firing,
and move towards equalizing benefits in the private and public sectors.
Directors encouraged the authorities to set up a transparent investment regime, and to
improve ownership rights for foreigners. In this regard, they endorsed the proposed
amendment to the Commercial Company law and a law to improve the resolution of
commercial disputes. They also encouraged the privatization of public utilities.
Directors commended the authorities for the provision of data on the government’s foreign
assets. They also welcomed the renewed efforts of the Interministerial Statistical Committee
and the authorities’ intention to participate in the GDDS. However, they noted that
improvements in the U.A.E.’s economic statistics, with regard to data quality, coverage,
periodicity, timeliness, and consistency, depend on increased coordination between the federal
and emirates’ authorities and the training of staff. They endorsed providing the Ministry of
Planning with sufficient resources to carry out its new mandate to improve the statistical data
base.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the U.A.E. will take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of
ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued
after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case.
