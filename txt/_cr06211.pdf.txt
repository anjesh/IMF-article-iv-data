EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Output growth (3.4 percent) and employment creation remained impressive in 2005—but
imbalances have intensified. Domestic demand, while decelerating mildly, has driven
growth—with the current account deficit widening to 7½ percent of GDP and the inflation
differential with the euro area rising to 1¾ percentage points. Buoyed by revenues, the
general government recorded a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2005 and public debt is
low—but spending is ratcheting up.
Policy Discussions
Short-term growth prospects are good (3.3 percent in 2006), but the medium-term outlook
is clouded by accumulated imbalances and competitiveness losses. A smooth rebalancing
(helped by firming euro-area activity and rising interest rates) underlies both official and
staff central projections. The external deficit, however, is expected to remain large. Adverse
risks stem from high net external liabilities (46 percent of GDP) reflecting household
indebtedness (110 percent of disposable income), which might prompt pronounced balancesheet and real estate valuation adjustments, and a protracted period of depressed employment
and activity. The discussions were thus centered on the role of fiscal and structural policies
in forestalling such scenarios.
The authorities were confident that appreciable fiscal surpluses would continue into 2006–
07, but saw limited scope for countercyclical spending cuts, advocated by staff, beyond
tight implementation of current plans. Revisions to the fiscal framework will introduce
cyclical flexibility, while providing greater leeway to regional governments. In the absence
of effective enforcement mechanisms, transparency will be key. Regional financing
arrangements are being reviewed, and healthcare and pension reform also remain on the
agenda.
The authorities have formulated an ambitious and detailed structural reform agenda,
articulated in their National Reform Program, to improve the productivity and dynamism of
the economy. Fostering productivity will require an early focus on deregulating and opening
sheltered sectors to competition—including sensitive areas (energy). Protracted labor market
negotiations have led to an agreement that aims to reduce the extensive use of temporary
employment, while leaving the provisions of regular contracts unchanged.
The recently concluded FSAP found a highly dynamic and competitive financial sector
under strong prudential supervision and regulation. The authorities were broadly receptive
of the FSAP’s recommendations to exercise vigilance with respect to developments in the
mortgage market; bolster the independence of financial sector supervisors; improve
governance and market discipline of savings banks; and adopt a conservative treatment of
financial institutions’ industrial participations under Basel II.

robust growth turned a budget deficit of 5
percent of GDP in 1996 into a surplus of over 1
percent of GDP in 2005, while public indebtedness was cut from 67 to 43 percent of GDP.
The past decade also witnessed an impressive expansion of the financial sector’s presence
domestically and abroad—Spanish institutions’ financial assets increased from about 220
percent of GDP in 1996 to 330 percent in 2005.

Growth has however become increasingly lopsided, as reflected in a widening
inflation differential and rising current account deficit. Domestic demand has boomed,
supported by employment and income gains; wealth effects from rising real estate and equity
prices; and rapid credit expansion in the midst of negative real interest rates. Propelled by
mortgage credit growth of 25 percent in 2005, household indebtedness reached over 110
percent of disposable income. While the authorities have allowed the full play of fiscal
revenue stabilizers and maintained a contractionary budgetary stance for several years (albeit
less so in 2005), this has been insufficient to offset very loose liquidity conditions. The
inflation differential with the euro area thus reached 1¾ percentage points in 2006:Q1, and
the 2005 current account deficit rose to 7½ percent of GDP—the second largest in absolute

terms in the world. While Spain’s oil
dependency, the weakness of its
traditional export markets, and its
advanced cyclical position have all played
a role, the current account deterioration
also reflects a steady real exchange rate
appreciation and related export-market
share losses. As documented in the
authorities’ National Reform Program
under the Lisbon Agenda, the erosion of
competitiveness goes beyond cyclical
factors: structural factors include
lackluster productivity growth and
significant rigidities in product and labor
markets.

3.
While a smooth and gradual rebalancing underlies both official and staff
projections, there are important risks. The main one is a continuation of the current
unsustainable pace in domestic spending that is followed by pronounced adjustments in
household balance sheets and real estate valuations, entailing a protracted period of
depressed employment and activity. The discussions were thus centered on the role of fiscal
and structural policies in forestalling such scenarios.

demand, the expansion was concentrated in the services, construction, and energy sectors;
sectors exposed to external competition, in contrast, experienced little growth.

High inflation persisted
through 2005 and accelerated at the
turn of the year, reflecting the passthrough of fuel prices and backward
price indexation of wages.
Comparatively high oil dependency has
resulted in a significant contribution of
energy and transportation items to
headline inflation. But core inflation also
exceeded the euro area average by a
widening margin (1.6 percentage points
in 2006:Q1), reflecting the continued
upward price drift in the sheltered
services and retail sectors. Hourly labor
costs have shown a decelerating trend
despite substantial increases in the
employment rate and reductions in
unemployment, pointing to a decline in
the NAIRU—underpinned by high
immigration and growing female
participation. Nevertheless, wages still
increased faster than the euro area
average, as did unit labor costs. Price
indexation clauses in collective wage
contracts stand to sustain price pressures
into 2006.

Liquidity conditions remain expansionary. Real lending rates are negative or close
to zero, and both household and corporate credit grew at over 20 percent in the year to
January 2006, spearheaded by mortgages and credit to real estate developers. There is little
housing equity withdrawal, and nontraditional mortgages are still relatively rare, albeit
developing quickly.

While higher nonconstruction investment played some role in the second half of the 1990s, the
recent deterioration of the current account has almost fully matched the increase in construction
investment and cannot thus be attributed to an investment-driven catch-up process, such as that
observed in some new EU members.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
With immediate growth prospects jointly seen as positive, the discussions
focused on the role of economic policies in averting adverse scenarios stemming from
accumulated imbalances and competitiveness losses and on financial sector policies in
light of FSAP recommendations. Spain’s economic policies have for several years been
largely in line with Fund policy advice (Box 1), and on this occasion too there was a broad
convergence of views on the diagnosis and policy requirements. Nuances centered on the
extent to which competitiveness losses were already a manifest concern, and consequently on
the degree of urgency and ambition of the recommended response. This also reflected the
authorities’ assessment of the measures’ feasibility, in light of the government’s emphasis on
a consensual approach and its minority position in Parliament. Furthermore, the authorities
were doubtful of the proposition that the ongoing economic expansion provided a propitious
environment for reform since “good times” diminish the perceived need for change. In this
setting, and with the current legislature ending in early 2008, staff attempted to impart a
greater sense of policy urgency, including in its outreach activities vis-à-vis parliamentarians,
trade unions, employers, regional representatives in Catalonia, and academics.

-9-

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Policies for several years have been broadly in line with Fund advice—notably in
terms of a stability-oriented fiscal policy framework and structural reforms in labor and
product markets. On the former, pending steps to enhance the cyclical sensitivity of the
fiscal framework are consistent with Fund advice, though improvements in fiscal
transparency still fall short of requirements—particularly at the subnational level,
where the new Budgetary Stability Law also provides a greater degree of leeway than
advised by the Fund.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda is consistent with Fund analyses and
recommendations, and Spain has generally taken a liberal and open position on EUwide issues—though it too appears prone to some protective reflexes as the internal
market approaches more sensitive areas (e.g., energy). Also, labor market reform has
been insufficiently bold, and that of the pension system continues to be delayed. The
authorities have consistently maintained strong financial sector prudential policies, as
recognized also in this year’s positive FSAP findings.
A. Outlook: A Bright Near-Term but Clouds Further Out
9.
Immediate growth prospects remain upbeat. Staff and official projections broadly
coincide. Growth is projected to moderate slightly to some 3.3 percent in 2006 and to 3.2
percent in 2007. A slowdown in retail sales, consumer durables, house prices, and other
leading indicators all suggest a prospective domestic demand softening. On this basis,
consumption and residential investment are expected to decelerate in 2006, with the housing
market gradually cooling off. Business investment, while remaining high as a proportion of
GDP, should plateau in response to higher capital costs. At the same time, the gathering
euro-area recovery is expected to reduce the drag from the external sector. Indeed, the
authorities noted that firming euro-area interest rates and strengthening external demand was
the ideal combination for a rebalancing of Spanish growth. Staff agreed, though euro-area
interest rates are unlikely to rise sufficiently from the Spanish economy’s standpoint. The
inflation forecast for 2006 remains close to 3½ percent, well in excess of the euro area
average.
10.
The authorities’ Stability Program, and staff, project that external imbalances
would remain large over the medium term. While the authorities envisage a continuation
of the export recovery that started in the second half of 2005, the observed high elasticity of
imports coupled with the projected growth in final demand point to a further steady
deterioration in net exports. Increased interest payments and immigrant remittances, and the
envisaged decline in EU transfers, will additionally raise the economy’s financing needs to
above 8 percent of GDP by 2008. Staff stressed that a prolonged external imbalance would
expose the economy to interest rate risk and other shocks and would be unsustainable over
the long term.

- 10 -

11.
The authorities expect their competitiveness-enhancing policy agenda to
eventually reverse this trend, while recognizing that such a turnaround would take time to
unfold. In this context, they also pointed to the role played by the intertemporal profile of
saving and investment, whereby the observed increase in the current account deficit may
have inter alia been brought about by a temporary excess of planned private investment with
respect to aggregate savings. The current level of net external liabilities could thus be
smoothed in the future through some combination of real exchange rate depreciation and a
gradual moderation of domestic absorption. In principle, they noted, there would be no need
for an abrupt adjustment. They also pointed out that EMU membership drastically expanded
the economy’s capacity to finance external deficits—inter alia, by eliminating currency risk.

Staff agreed, but noted that, by the same token, in the absence of sufficiently
flexible product and labor markets, regaining competitiveness could entail a long and
difficult process weighing on output and employment—as evidenced by some other euro
area experiences.2 In this context, the main downside risks remain real estate overvaluation

2

In this regard, the authorities forcefully felt that comparisons to either Italy or Portugal were strained
and misplaced, overlooking important differences between these realities (most notably the fiscal and
growth performances of recent years). Staff concurred, but noted that, mutatis mutandis, these
experiences still epitomized the difficulties of correcting accumulated imbalances and
competitiveness weaknesses in a monetary union.

Box 2. Spain’s Competitiveness: What is the Evidence?
The current account position has deteriorated from an average deficit of close to 2½ percent of GDP
since EU accession in 1986 to one of 7½ percent of GDP in 2005 (Panel A). This reflects primarily a
widening trade deficit, but the income and current transfer balances have also deteriorated owing to
larger interest payments (as net international liabilities increased), migrant remittances, and lower EU
transfers. The trade deterioration, in turn, reflects the cyclical position and oil prices, but also structural
competitiveness problems. In staff’s view, a range of evidence points in this direction.
Staff estimates based on a decomposition of the current account balance for the 1980–2005 period
indicate that oil prices explain about 33 percent of its variation, with the cyclical position accounting for
an additional 37 percent. The remaining unexplained residual, about 30 percent, has become increasingly
negative (particularly since 2003) and amounted to 2½ percentage points of GDP in 2005, presumably
reflecting in part underlying competitiveness losses (as well as, in part, the impact of weaker demand in
Spain’s traditional export markets). These estimates are consistent with those of private sector analysts,
discussed during the mission. A staff cross-country study3 showed that conjunctural variables have
recently underestimated Spain’s trade deficit, also pointing to emerging structural factors. As noted in the
main text, the authorities are of the view that part of the deficit could simply reflect an intertemporal
saving-investment decision, whose resolution need not entail high real sector costs, and pointed also to
the importance of EMU membership in mitigating risks associated with current account deficits. They
also noted an encouraging pickup in recent export growth as possibly indicating a turning point in the
external sector’s contribution.
Spain’s trade-weighted export market share increased until about 1998. Since then, it has stagnated,
declining as from 2003 (Panel B). Import volume penetration has risen continuously (Panel C)—with
the worldwide decline in import deflators causing a temporary recovery in nominal terms during 2001–
03. Reflecting both lower productivity and higher labor cost growth, the manufacturing unit labor cost
differential with the euro area has widened by 16 percentage points since 1995 (Panel D). As a
consequence, indicators of Spain’s export margins have exhibited the weakest evolution among other
large euro-area economies since 1995, albeit recovering somewhat since 2003 (Panel E). The authorities
agreed that these data, though susceptible to nuanced interpretations, tend to point to the presence of a
component of loss of competitiveness in explaining the current account deficit, whose extent is however
difficult to determine precisely.
Real exchange rate developments also show an erosion of competitiveness (Panel F). Given the
theoretical and practical difficulties associated with estimating equilibrium real exchange rates, the staff
employed several methodologies to assess, in a broadly illustrative manner, the improvement in
competitiveness (as measured by the real effective exchange rate) required to (a) satisfy long-term
equilibrium determinants drawn from cross-country panel data analyses (net foreign assets relative to
exports, commodity prices, labor productivity and production in the manufacturing sector), along the
lines of the Fund’s macroeconomic balance approach; (b) achieve the trade deficit that would stabilize
net external liabilities close to their current level; and (c) achieve the average trade deficit of the last 20
years. Though such methodologies have known shortcomings, with the results contingent on the

assumptions and subject to large estimation errors, they all suggest appreciable competitiveness
weakness (in a range of 23–30 percent). This magnitude needs however to be interpreted with
considerable caution. Indeed, the authorities strongly feel that the lack of consensus around the
theoretical models on which to base specifications, and the high degree of discretion in setting out the
hypotheses that condition the estimation outcomes, detract considerably from the significance of such
calculations. Furthermore, the analysis assumes that the current account adjustment would take place
exclusively through real exchange rate depreciation. However, they note, the adjustment could also come
from a gradual increase in savings.

and associated household indebtedness. A demand retrenchment accompanied by a
downward house price adjustment would negatively affect the construction sector, which
accounts for 10½ percent of output and 14 percent of employment. On the positive side,
FSAP and Bank of Spain analyses indicate that the financial system is well-positioned to
withstand shocks of a plausible magnitude—including a hypothetical fall in real house prices
of slightly over 17 percent in the first year and of 4½ percent in the subsequent year,4 a 30
percent drop in equity prices, or an abrupt depreciation of the US dollar. Nonetheless, staff
remained more concerned than the authorities about the risks attendant to the current
situation, and consequently argued for a more vigorous structural and countercyclical policy
response. There was agreement that the solution to the productivity and related
competitiveness problem lies first and foremost in structural reforms. Staff noted that these
however take time, during which fiscal policy should be directed to attenuating imbalances.
B. Dampening Demand—The Task of Fiscal Policy
13.
Buoyant tax collections resulted in
an appreciable budget surplus in 2005, but
the fiscal stance was only mildly restrictive,
if at all, owing to an expansion in outlays.
The achievement of a fiscal surplus (1.1
percent of GDP) and further reduction in
public liabilities are the result of the
authorities’ successful efforts over several
years to shore up support for sound public
finances—a support the mission found in all of
its encounters, including with the trade unions.
While welcoming this achievement, staff
argued that, from a cyclical standpoint, the
fiscal stance in 2005 had been inadequate
owing to excessive growth in public spending.
Conventional cyclically adjusted balance
estimates indicate a fiscal withdrawal of about
a ¼ percentage point of GDP. But beyond this
indicator and its related measurement
difficulties, the staff’s analysis (and work by
the Bank of Spain) indicate that public
spending increases have a significantly larger
expansionary impact on demand and the
current account than the contractive impact of

The authorities were confident that another appreciable fiscal surplus was in the
offing, laying the basis for a strong performance in 2007 as well. With 2006 revenues set
to exceed budget projections by a wide
margin (partly due to the regularization

expectation, noted that budget
spending plans again implied an
expansionary stance, with real
expenditure outpacing real GDP
growth: for example, central government consumption was budgeted to rise in real terms by
4.1 percent in 2006.
15.
Staff advocated greater expenditure-based fiscal restraint. Specifically, staff saw
merit in directing fiscal policy toward the goal of improving the 2006 general government
surplus by at least ½ percentage point of GDP (relative to 2005), based on expenditure
control, to contain demand pressures. To this end, the central government should aim to keep
spending appreciably below current ceilings and safeguard the budget’s contingency fund for
truly exceptional events. For their part, the regions should move to balance in 2006 and
surplus by 2007—consistent with the new Budget Stability Law due to take effect that year.
16.
The authorities saw only limited scope for reining in already budgeted spending.
While not disputing the expansionary impact of public spending, and sharing concerns about
its dynamics at the regional and local level, the authorities emphasized that the central
government had remained within its expenditure ceiling in 2005 and would continue to do
so. They did not however see scope for significant underspending, and pointed to the
political economy difficulties of explicitly aiming for rising fiscal surpluses, a prospect that

Box 3. Fiscal Policy: Can it Help Attenuate Imbalances?
While only structural policies can improve competitiveness and growth on a lasting basis within EMU,
the question arises of whether fiscal policy could contribute to attenuating imbalances in the short term,
as reforms take hold. Staff has analyzed the effects of fiscal policy—using a structural vector
autoregression model—with a particular focus on the current account and the (manufacturing ULCbased) real exchange rate. The results, set out in a Selected Issues paper, indicate that:
•

A 1 percent exogenous fall in real government expenditure in one quarter—which persists over
one year—improves the current account balance by about 0.15–0.16 percentage points of GDP
for one year and prompts a 0.4–0.6 percent depreciation in the real exchange rate by moderating
ULC growth. The effects of the shock decline slowly after two years.

In contrast, the effects of a tax revenue shock appear statistically insignificant. This statistical result
partially reflects the fact that, during the sample period, tax revenue increases tended to be followed
shortly thereafter by spending increases which offset the dampening effect of higher taxes. The result is
also broadly consistent with Ricardian equivalence, in which tax policy changes are countered by private
agents’ forward-looking consumption-saving decisions, of which there is also some partial evidence.

would whet spending appetites.6 The exceptional wave of immigration into Spain was
furthermore seen to generate its own, warranted expenditure needs with regard, for example,
to infrastructure, social services, education, and the judiciary. Furthermore, the government’s
emphasis on improving productivity and raising R&D spending also entailed a public effort.
C. Maintaining Fiscal Stability in the Medium and Long Term
17.
A new Budget Stability Law (BSL), introducing greater cyclical flexibility and
aiming to increase ownership and observance by the regions, is currently before
Parliament. It is expected to take effect in 2007. The draft BSL (Box 4) seeks to allow the
operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers by making budget targets contingent on the cyclical
position, while aiming for fiscal balance over the cycle—an approach consistent with past
Fund advice. Staff welcomed other positive features of the draft law. First, the new “balance
over-the-cycle” target will apply to the general government with exclusion of the social
security system (currently running a 1 percent of GDP surplus). In this respect, the
authorities noted that it is more stringent than SGP requirements. Second, the draft law bars
state bail-outs for lower government levels, a feature judged to be essential in the absence of
legally binding enforcement mechanisms. Third, the new framework envisages strengthened
reporting requirements to increase fiscal transparency of territorial governments, seen by all
as an essential counterpart to the increased flexibility granted by the new law. While
welcoming progress on this front, staff still judged the information flow to be insufficient to
allow early identification of profligate fiscal behavior, elicit public censure, and stimulate
corrective action.
18.
The mission pointed to several features of the draft law that, in providing
appreciable leeway, risked rendering “balance over-the-cycle” an elusive target.7 Staff
noted three main concerns: first, the asymmetry in specifying a deficit limit in the case of low
growth but not a commensurate surplus requirement in the high-growth scenario, entailing a
risk of insufficiently ambitious targets in good times—such as the present. The authorities
agreed that much would depend on implementation but saw drawbacks in setting a minimum
surplus target for the high-growth scenario (it could become a ceiling). Second, the exclusion
of part of capital spending was, in staff’s view, insufficiently precise. The increasing

6

After the mission, the authorities announced the intention to contain central government spending
growth in 2007 to that of nominal GDP, and an agreement on targets for territorial governments (a
deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2007 and balance thereafter). While both policy objectives improve
upon 2005–06, staff views them as insufficiently ambitious.

7

At last year’s consultation, staff and many Directors “advised that the regions should consistently
aim at budget balance, avoiding a build-up in subnational debt.” In contrast, the new BSL would, in a
low-growth scenario, allow territorial governments to incur a deficit of up to 1.1 percent of GDP.

- 17 -

Box 4. The New Budget Stability Law
Fiscal targets. The proposal targets a fiscal balance over the cycle for the general government, excluding
the social security system. To avoid the complexities of defining the cyclical position, it establishes
targets for three states of the economy: a fiscal balance for normal growth (set at between 2 and 3 percent
for the 2007–09 period); a small public deficit for low growth; and a surplus (of underdetermined size)
for high growth. For the social security system, it envisages a separate target, set to ensure its financial
sustainability.
Allocation of the targets. The low-growth deficit (up to 1 percent of GDP) is allocated predominantly
(0.75 percent of GDP) at the regional government level. No indication is provided, however, about the
level and allocation of the high-growth surplus.
Individual targets. Targets for each region will be determined by bilateral negotiations. If these are
inconsistent with the overall target, the Ministry of Economy can set individual targets.
Excluded capital expenditure. The proposed law excludes capital (and some other) expenditure aimed
at improving productivity and competitiveness, in an amount up to 0.5 percent of GDP, of which half is
allocated to the regions. Thus, the total low-growth deficit for the central and territorial governments is
1.5 percent of GDP.
Enforcement. Three-year corrective plans are envisaged for any level of government that fails to reach
the balance over-the-cycle target. Enforcement relies on expected increased transparency and timeliness
of subnational data, and on an explicit barring of regional government bail-outs.

State of the economy:

1/ The proposal excludes the social security system, which is envisaged to be in balance in the long-run. It also proposes to calculate percentages in terms of
the relevant GDP, i.e., national (regional) GDP for the central (regional) government.

recourse to off-budget capital spending by regional and municipal governments was, in this
regard, already a concern. The authorities felt that exclusion of certain spending reflected the
high priority assigned to improving Spain’s lackluster productivity performance, and that
circumvention would in any event be contained by the overall cap on such spending. Finally,
staff noted that the draft BSL did not clearly specify whether, in good times, the surplus
requirement would apply to the Autonomous Communities as a whole, or to each individual
Community. This ambiguity could give rise to conflicting interpretations, which were
evident during the mission’s discussions, and consequent implementation difficulties. The
authorities recognized the ambiguity but viewed it as constructive, providing scope to
address the main challenge to any fiscal framework in Spain: the need to coordinate the

- 18 -

highly decentralized regional and municipal budgets, which encompass over 70 percent of
public expenditure excluding social security.
19.
In sum, the authorities viewed the new fiscal framework as promoting coresponsibility in a manner that would maintain fiscal discipline while respecting the
constitutional autonomy of the regions. They noted that the framework provided for an
articulated system of annual negotiations, agreements, and monitoring among the central and
regional governments that would ensure a greater degree of buy-in than currently prevailing.
They agreed that transparency and accountability were ultimately the main enforcement
mechanisms available, and intended to give priority to strengthening the role of the entities
charged with ensuring these (the State Administration’s General Audit Office, IGAE, and the
regional coordinating council, Consejo de Politica Fiscal y Financiera). They were inclined
to leave for later consideration, while not discarding, the possibility of seeking means to
obtain an independent assessment of fiscal policies of the various levels of government and
of their consistency with the BSL. They also noted the recent progress in implementing some
recommendations of the 2005 fiscal ROSC.
20.
In parallel with the new BSL, territorial financing arrangements are also under
review. A recently agreed reform of the Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia contains changes
to financing arrangements, which could act as a broad blueprint for a more general reform of
territorial financing. The Catalonian arrangements foresee the transfer of a higher share of
taxes from the central government, alongside some greater taxing autonomy. Staff argued
that the latter needed to be the key feature of the new system: a successful decentralization of
competencies had to be accompanied by mechanisms that granted territorial governments
significant powers to set their own taxes. The authorities agreed and indicated that the new
arrangements would do so—particularly with respect to the personal income tax. They also
viewed with favor forms of regional sales tax, but issues of compatibility with EU rules
would need to be addressed. In contrast, they felt strongly that the corporate income tax
should remain uniform throughout the nation, so as to avoid undue tax competition. Staff
noted, however, that unless central government transfers were cut back, the current
institutional framework provided little incentive for regional and municipal governments to
use their enhanced tax powers—as evident from experience to date.
21.
Healthcare provision also has an important financing dimension, currently
under review—providing an opportunity for broader healthcare reform. Public
spending on healthcare (a decentralized competency) has reached 6 percent of GDP and is
growing rapidly. Given regional governments’ spending overruns in this area, healthcarerelated transfers from the central government had to be increased by 0.2 percent of GDP over
budgeted levels in 2005, and health appropriations raised in 2006, until a new cost-sharing
arrangement between levels of government is established in 2007. The authorities expect that
the new financing arrangements will provide incentives for regional budgets to contain costs
and are introducing stricter controls and rationalizing procurement. Staff argued the need for
a broader reform of the system, with effective cost containment likely to require forms of
private participation and cost-sharing, such as user co-payments to rationalize demand.

- 19 -

Similarly, it cautioned that commitments under a new disability law (Ley de Dependencia) be
costed carefully and its beneficiaries targeted closely, so as to avoid another potential source
of spending pressure.
22.
The authorities recently unveiled a limited tax reform, aimed at simplifying the
tax system and reducing distortions in the taxation of savings. They explained the
deliberate caution exercised in reducing the tax burden as being based on concerns about the
impact on current demand pressures—though, staff noted, such concerns could have been
eased, and the tax reduction been larger, if accompanied by greater spending restraint. The
reform—to enter into effect in 2007—reduces the marginal personal income tax rate and the
number of brackets, introduces a uniform rate on savings (18 percent), and foresees a phasedin reduction of the corporate tax rate by 5 percentage points, while eliminating a range of tax
deductions. Employers, however, considered the rate cut insufficient and more than offset by
the elimination of deductions, a view disputed by the authorities, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises. A generally shared positive feature of the reform is the uniform
tax on savings, which was seen to enhance competition among financial instruments. There
was however some concern that the reduction in tax-exempt contributions to private pension
plans—which are still small and need encouragement—may send a deterring signal and
heighten uncertainty about their future tax treatment. Finally, the reform did not eliminate the
mortgage deduction—a long-standing staff recommendation.
23.
From a longer-term perspective, the fiscal outlook is clouded by the lack of
progress in the reform of pension and other age-related costs. Long-term fiscal
projections prepared by the authorities and the EC’s Aging Working Group place Spain
among the EU countries with the largest age-related spending increase over the next 25–50
years—this despite upward revisions in

agree that a definitive solution will require a
reform of entitlements, but prolonged discussions with social partners have yet to come to
closure. At the time of the mission, the focus was mainly on reducing early retirement
schemes and, possibly, raising the minimum contribution period by a marginal amount. With
social security deficits expected to arise within the next decade, staff noted that reform
initiatives would need to be timely and more broad-ranging, encompassing actuarially fair
incentives to prolong the effective working life, an extension of the base period to compute
pensions, and a further expansion of private provision.

D. Creating a More Competitive Spain—Product and Labor Market Reforms
24.
The authorities have formulated an ambitious and detailed reform agenda to
improve the dynamism of the economy. It encompasses the Dynamization Plan (February
2005, updated March 2006) and the National Reform Program (NRP, October 2005), which
aim at increasing productivity and the employment rate. In the authorities’ analysis, per
capita GDP growth has been driven in recent years by rising employment rates stemming
from the incorporation into the labor force of large immigration flows and rising female
participation. As these inflows wane, however, further advances in GDP per capita will
require faster labor productivity growth, which is among the lowest in the OECD (Box 5).
Regarding specific measures, the NRP emphasizes the government provision of public goods
(infrastructure, education) and government sponsorship of activities with positive
externalities (R&D, start-up companies). It places comparatively less weight, however, on
enhancing competition-based incentives to the efficient allocation of resources, cost
reduction, and innovation.
25.
Staff agreed with the authorities’ analysis while emphasizing the central role
that fostering competition and deregulating sheltered sectors would need to play in
regaining competitiveness.8 These sectors are the major contributors to the widening price
and cost differential with trading partners. An insufficient degree of competition and the
associated pricing power—as shown by the differential evolution of markups between
tradables and nontradables—are major factors behind the persistent competitiveness losses.9
Indeed, Spain has not experienced the productivity gains in distribution and services that
have been the hallmark of economies where productivity accelerated in the last decade. Most
observers and the mission’s interlocutors attributed the sluggish performance of the services
sector to the lack of contestable markets and incentives to innovate.10
8

The authorities’ decomposition of the OECD’s index of product market regulation indicates that
Spain compares favorably on barriers to external trade and foreign investment. Its low overall raking
(19th out of 29) stems from low scores on impediments to entrepreneurship, administrative barriers,
and government presence in domestic markets.

9

For the effect of lack of competition on the inflation differential, see ECFIN Country Focus, Vol. 1–
12, July 2004; and Economic Bulletin, Bank of Spain, November 2005. Staff’s analyses also indicate
significant adverse effects of regional barriers to retail competition (see IMF Country Report 04/89,
and Hoffmaister 2006: “Prices and Barriers to Retail Competition: Evidence from Spain,” IMF
Working Paper, forthcoming).
10

The literature provides ample evidence that most of the productivity growth in advanced economies
stems from the entry and expansion of more productive firms at the expense of the exit and market
share losses of the less productive—rather than by productivity improvements within firms. See, inter
alia, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001): “Aggregate Productivity Growth: Lessons from
Microeconomic Evidence” in New Developments in Productivity Analysis, NBER / University of
Chicago Press.

26.
Despite a welcome quantification of objectives and close interministerial
monitoring of the plans’ progress, forward steps in some areas are hindered by political
economy factors. Among early positive steps is an ongoing reform of the anti-trust system,
designed to consolidate and strengthen the powers of the competition authorities and limit
the executive’s capacity to overrule its decisions. Also, the authorities have announced a plan
to restructure the loss-making public broadcasting company (RTVE). Still, in practice,
energy, utilities, telecommunications, transportation, and various professional services
remain relatively sheltered from competition. A complex area is that of retail distribution,
where responsibilities lie with regional and municipal governments who, with a view to
protecting local incumbents, have thwarted the entry of larger, more efficient firms through
licensing, zoning, opening time, and other regulations. The authorities were cautiously
hopeful that the new EU Services Directive, for which they had supported greater ambition,
could offer the opportunity to review existing constraints in this area. In line with their good
record in transposing EU Directives, staff encouraged them to exploit this opportunity fully.
Less positively, as the EU internal market reaches more sensitive areas—particularly, in the
case of Spain, energy, given its import dependence—a “national champions” reaction has
arisen. The authorities have eliminated the “golden share” option to block takeovers of
privatized public companies. In March 2006 the National Energy Commission (the sectoral
regulator) was accorded broad powers over takeovers in the sector. This was widely seen as a
move to stymie a foreign bid for a Spanish energy company, which competed with an
alternative domestic offer, and the EC has opened an infringement procedure. The authorities
observed that the objective of the legislation was to fill a regulatory void concerning
takeover bids involving companies which carry on regulated activities, with the main change
being an extension of the norm’s coverage to the target as well as the bidding company. Staff
urged the authorities to refrain from using these newly granted powers in a discriminatory

Box 5. Productivity: The Trend in Spain is Mainly Plane
Like other European economies, Spain experienced significant catch-up in labor
productivity through the mid-1980s but has since fallen behind. The subsequent
slowdown has been more pronounced than in other countries (see table, next page): the
productivity gap with respect to a 23-industrial country sample increased from 9
percent in 1985 to 30 percent in 2004 (or to 23 percent if measured at current prices).

Instead, most observers point to the key
role of low ICT capital, R&D spending,
and human capital. More deliberate
government provision of public goods in
these areas could improve productivity
performance. Nevertheless, much of the
identified deficit lies in the private sector
and will require removing obstacles to
innovate and invest in new activities.
Barriers to competition, restrictive
regulations, and labor market rigidities all
militate against a more dynamic and
entrepreneurial economic environment.

reached in early May. The reform is centered on reducing the incidence of temporary
contracts, both via legal provisions and fiscal incentives. A positive feature of the reform is
the possibility of applying indefinite contracts with lower firing costs (contratos de fomento,
introduced in 1997) to any worker currently on a temporary contract—but only during a
limited period (through end-2007). At the same time, it strengthens legal provisions against
consecutive temporary contracts, and introduces other limits to their use. Fundamentally, it
does not address the key requirement, as seen by staff, of permanently reducing the rigidity
and high dismissal costs of regular contracts.
E. Financial Sector
29.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) found a highly dynamic and
competitive financial system under strong prudential supervision and regulation (Box
6). The sector’s strengths include a high degree of financial intermediation; low
intermediation margins; well-capitalized and professionally managed institutions; and a
robust and well-developed prudential framework.11 Stress tests showed that banks and
insurance companies would be able to withstand large adverse shocks without systemic
distress. This reflects strong capitalization and risk management practices of systemically
important credit institutions, and sizeable loan-loss cushions.
30.
The main risks identified by the FSAP relate to rapid credit growth and to a
potential downturn in the housing market, particularly if combined with an adverse
macroeconomic scenario. In this connection, the authorities expressed some concern about
the recent increase in nontraditional lending products (such as interest-only, very long-term,
and adjustable amortization mortgages).12 While the wider range of financial instruments will
eventually enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation, some of these products might
test in the short term the financial sophistication of some borrowers and lenders, particularly
when agents’ expectations may be based on the recent long period of record low interest
rates. Also, although the average loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of bank’s portfolios was
relatively low, marginal LTVs had been rising. The Bank of Spain had accordingly stepped
up vigilance in these areas, including through disclosure guidelines and consumer awareness
initiatives, and indicated its readiness to consider additional prudential action if necessary.

11

As this report was being finalized, the authorities discovered large-scale fraud by two nonfinancial
investment companies, specializing in stamp trading—involving, according to some reports, €4–5
billion (about ½ percent of GDP). The event, still unfolding, has prompted a review of regulations
covering such collective investments in tangible assets. These fall outside the scope of financial sector
regulators and supervisors, and are subject, rather, to consumer protection provisions.

excessive risk-taking.
•

Adopt most conservative approaches under Basel II to contain credit institutions’

B. Financial Sector Supervision
•
Strengthen the independence of financial sector supervisors by delegating more
broadly the authority to issue norms and sanction violations to the respective agencies
(ST 1/); separate insurance supervision from the Ministry of Economy (MT 2/).
•

Clearly maintain the state-level supervisors’ sole responsibility and powers regarding
prudential supervision and regulation in the ongoing revisions of Autonomous
Communities’ Statutes. ST

•

Introduce regulations to prevent a credit institution representative serving on the board
of a nonfinancial company from taking part in the institution’s decisions regarding that
company. MT

•
Allow savings banks to merge freely, provided favorable ruling by the Bank of Spain
on the viability of the merged institution. MT

31.
Supervisory effectiveness and consistency with international best practices
would require enhancing the statutory independence of financial regulators.
Specifically, while no instances of undue interference were found, the FSAP recommended
that authority to issue norms and to sanction violations be delegated more broadly from the
Ministry of Economy and from the Council of Ministers to the respective agencies. Formal
independence of the insurance regulator is particularly constrained because it is directly part
of the Ministry of Economy. The authorities concurred and expressed their intention to
continue reforms in this direction. Since several of the regional Statutes of Autonomy are
presently being revised, staff stressed the importance that these revisions preserve the sole

- 27 -

role of the State-level supervisors in prudential oversight of financial institutions, minimizing
the potential for conflicts. The government maintained that this was the case, countering staff
concerns about possible wording ambiguities and stressing that long-standing jurisprudence
safeguarded the role of State-level supervisors.
32.
The mission discussed avenues to strengthen the governance and market
orientation of savings banks (cajas). Savings banks have been a major force in the
expansion of financial services over the last decades and currently account for about one
third and one half of credit institutions’ assets and deposits respectively. However, the nature
of their ownership structure—which excludes private shareholders and provides for a large
weight of political representation in their board of directors—requires a strong governance
framework. The authorities noted with interest several staff proposals in this direction. These
included reducing further the public sector representation ceiling in governing bodies;
promoting means to raise high quality capital, such as the issuance of cuotas participativas13
to enhance market discipline; and removing restrictions to savings banks’ mergers.
33.
The large industrial participations held by some credit institutions entail risks
associated with concentration of exposures and raise potential corporate governance
problems. The authorities argued that concentration was partly driven by the size of the
Spanish market and they underscored that ownership stakes had focused on the relatively
stable utilities sector and had been highly profitable to date. Furthermore, the higher degree
of risk was reflected in more stringent prudential requirements. Nonetheless, to mitigate risks
going forward, staff supported consideration by the Bank of Spain of adopting the most
conservative approaches to the treatment of industrial participations under Basel II. Also,
staff pointed out the possibility of conflicts of interest and informational asymmetries
between credit institutions and other investors, and recommended, as a minimum,
introducing regulations to prevent a credit institution representative serving on the board of a
nonfinancial company from taking part in the institution’s decisions regarding that company.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The decade-long expansion of the Spanish economy is continuing. The prolonged
period of robust economic growth has raised average incomes, boosted job creation, and
generated record fiscal revenues that have swung the general government balance into an
appreciable surplus. This positive performance owes much to implementation of reforms
since the early 1990s that opened the economy, enhanced its flexibility, and improved the
macroeconomic policy framework, as well as to EMU membership and related low interest
rates.
35.
Macroeconomic imbalances are, however, intensifying. A record current account
deficit is being driven by unsustainable domestic demand growth and widening cost and
13

Marketable capital participations without voting rights.

- 28 -

productivity differentials with trading partners, in addition to the effects of high oil prices.
Buoyant demand and pricing power in sheltered markets are keeping inflation significantly
above the euro-area average. Lackluster productivity growth is also weighing on
competitiveness. The rising savings-investment imbalance of the nonfinancial private sector
has been easily financed within EMU through the intermediation of a dynamic and efficient
domestic financial system—but gross and net external liabilities have reached high levels,
increasing the economy’s exposure to interest rate risk.
36.
The immediate growth outlook is buoyant, but accumulated imbalances and
competitiveness losses weigh on prospects further out. Growth is expected to remain
strong in 2006, although decelerating toward trend over the medium term, while the external
deficit remains high. A continuation of brisk domestic demand growth and further
competitiveness losses risks being followed by a pronounced private sector balance-sheet
consolidation, as households reduce their high indebtedness. A combination of market
rigidities and weak competitiveness may lead to a prolonged period of difficult, slow-growth
adjustment.
37.
Averting these risks requires stepping up the policy response. Regaining
competitiveness within EMU will require, first and foremost, the implementation of a bold
supply-oriented reform agenda, with an emphasis on enhancing product market competition
and labor market flexibility. As these reforms take hold, fiscal policy needs to contribute by
reining in domestic demand—in the absence of monetary policy, it is the only countercylical
tool to this end. In addition, even though public finances are currently on a sound footing,
their long-term sustainability hinges on early reform of the pension and healthcare systems.
The current high-growth environment offers the best opportunity to implement these policies,
minimizing their potential short-term costs.
38.
The government’s reform agenda to improve productivity and competitiveness
merits the highest priority. Official plans are well-articulated, appropriately quantified, and
are being carefully monitored. In their implementation, a greater emphasis should be placed
on competition-based incentives. Liberalizing reforms that enhance contestability and create
their own incentives for innovation are more effective than recourse to subsidy-based
measures to promote R&D. Accordingly, a key focus must be on further deregulating
sheltered sectors. Openness in all its guises has served Spain well for many years, and the
recent changes to takeover procedures in the energy sector merit reconsideration. If
maintained, it is essential that they be implemented in a nondiscriminatory manner,
consistent with Spain’s good record in the transposition of EU directives. Furthermore,
existing appointment procedures to sectoral regulatory agencies could be usefully reviewed,
so as to fully guarantee their independence.
39.
The labor market remains in need of further reform, the recent agreement on
labor contracting notwithstanding. The response to Spain’s uncommonly high rate of
temporary employment lies, as shown by earlier reforms, in permanently reducing the
rigidity and high dismissal costs of regular contracts—an aspect that remains essentially
untouched by the latest agreement. Employment protection legislation thus continues to

- 29 -

remain among the most restrictive in the OECD, restraining the necessary response to rising
global competitive pressures. In addition, the social partners should now undertake in earnest
discussions on modifications to the collective wage bargaining system, to better reflect
relative productivity developments and encourage regional mobility.
40.
Excess domestic demand calls for greater expenditure-based fiscal restraint in
2006 and 2007. The 2005 general government surplus—the first since the 1970s—is a
notable achievement, and one that sets Spain apart from other euro area countries—
including, most notably, its larger partners. But behind this achievement, underpinned by
cyclically buoyant revenues, public spending has been growing at an excessively rapid pace,
adding to demand pressures. The authorities’ intention to allow the full play of automatic
revenue stabilizers is welcome, but needs to be accompanied by spending restraint at all
levels of government. Spending policies should be consistent with increasing the central
government surplus and restoring a balanced position in regional and municipal governments
in 2006, moving to a slight surplus in 2007—in keeping with the new BSL. Indeed, an
exemplary implementation of the new framework in its first year of operation is crucial to its
longer-term credibility
41.
Spain’s highly decentralized system needs a robust budgetary framework to
promote fiscal discipline at all levels of government. Planned revisions to the BSL contain
a number of welcome features, including greater countercyclical flexibility; the safeguarding
of social security surpluses; and the proscription of state bail-outs for other levels of
government. At the same time, however, some ambiguous wording and insufficiently precise
specifications in the draft law risk allowing excessive leeway and scope for circumvention,
complicating the framework’s implementation—particularly in “good times” such as the
present, when a move into surplus would be required at all levels of government.
42.
The current review of territorial financing arrangements should aim to augment
fiscal co-responsibility. To be successful, the ongoing decentralization of competencies
must be accompanied by mechanisms that grant territorial governments significant powers to
set their own taxes, and that create incentives to utilize such powers. This, rather than heavy
reliance on the transfer of a higher share of taxes from the central government, which leaves
incentives largely unchanged, should be the defining feature of the new financing system.
43.
Increased fiscal transparency is the necessary counterpart to the greater
flexibility granted by the revised BSL and new financing arrangements. Despite
progress, including in implementing some of the 2005 fiscal ROSC recommendations,
considerable scope remains for more extensive and timely publication of territorial
governments’ fiscal data, in particular concerning budget execution, quasi-fiscal activities,
and contingent liabilities.
44.
Pension and healthcare reforms are required to ensure long-run fiscal
sustainability. The onset of the rising costs of aging—larger than elsewhere, even taking
into account Spain’s remarkable immigration phenomenon—is now only a decade or so
away. The continued reform delays only raise the size of the measures that will eventually be

- 30 -

needed. Reform measures will need to be broad-ranging, encompassing also an extension of
the base period used to compute pensions, and the further development of private pension
plans—whose tax treatment should be stable and predictable. Containing healthcare spending
will also require reform measures, including a larger role for private provision and user copayments.
45.
The FSAP found a highly dynamic, well capitalized, and profitable financial
system under strong supervision. The main risks are associated with the rapid growth of
mortgages and a potential downturn in the housing market, particularly if combined with an
adverse macroeconomic scenario, though stress tests indicate a robust resilience to shocks.
The increased Bank of Spain vigilance regarding nonconventional mortgages and other
rapidly growing credit vehicles is well advised. As regards the prudential supervisory
framework, further consistency with international best practices calls for increased
independence of the three financial sectors supervisors—most particularly that of the
insurance supervisor, formally the most constrained. Strong governance of the savings banks
is also key, and could be enhanced by fostering the issuance of instruments that enhance
market accountability, reducing the ceiling on government-nominated board directors, and
removing obstacles to savings banks’ mergers. The large industrial participations of some
credit institutions can give rise to excessive exposure to equity markets and potential conflict
of interests. As Basel II is introduced, it is recommended that the most restrictive
interpretation regarding industrial participations be adopted. Also, clear separation should be
introduced between credit institutions’ management and board directors of nonfinancial
companies in which they have a significant stake.
46.
The authorities are encouraged to continue raising their ODA toward the 0.7 percent
of GNP UN target (from 0.29 percent in 2005) and to actively contribute, within the EU, to a
significant liberalization of international trade in the Doha round, including in agriculture
and other sensitive areas. Statistical data provision is appropriate for surveillance.
Nevertheless, improvements in timeliness and standardization of regional fiscal data should
be a priority (Appendix III).
47.

It is recommended that the next consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

Spain: Statistical Issues
Areas for improvement include:
•

General government. Historical revisions, preliminary estimates, and planned fiscal
accounts data should be made available to the public shortly after being sent to
Eurostat in March and September. In addition, major revisions should be fully
documented. The reconciliation of cash and accrual general government data are
unclear. Details of these calculations would enhance monitoring at higher
frequencies.

•

Territorial governments. The reporting and transparency of fiscal outcomes has
improved with the adoption of key recommendations of the 2005 fiscal ROSC.
Nevertheless, expenditure and revenue details remain wanting and timeliness is still
an issue—regional fiscal outcomes for 2004 are now available, but the 2005
outcomes are yet to be published. Also, the reporting of PPP-related operations at all
levels of government should be improved. The importance of monitoring fiscal
developments at the territorial level is heightened by recent deviations from their
fiscal targets, and is essential for the implementation of the Budgetary Stability Law.

•

Labor market. Two different measures of unemployment are reported by the
authorities (so-called “registered” and “survey” unemployment), which vary
substantially. Data on employment growth are distorted by the flow of workers from
the informal to the formal labor force, which complicates the calculation of
productivity growth and hence unit labor costs.

•

National Accounts. These have been revised in line with the 1995 version of the
European System of Accounts. Chain-linked national accounts in base year 2000
have been published since May 2005, but pre-1995 data have not been revised yet.

inflation remained high.1 Output grew

as announced, would imply a moderately
expansionary stance—partly attributed to the entry into effect of the tax reform (see Staff
Report, ¶22)—and a continuation of the territorial governments’ deficit through 2007. The
latter deficit, in the first year of application of the new Budget Stability Law, is officially
ascribed to deficits in a number of regions and municipalities that are being addressed under
phased adjustment plans. Finally, the government announced its intention to contain central
government spending growth in 2007 at 6.7 percent, in line with nominal GDP. These targets
are largely consistent with the policy intentions outlined at the time of the discussions and—
while commendably envisaging surpluses through 2009—fall short of the expenditure-based
fiscal restraint recommended in the Staff Report (¶40) to help curb excess domestic demand
in the short term. As in the past, it is however likely—and desirable—that, with the full play
of automatic revenue stabilizers (to which the authorities are committed), budget execution
will exceed the announced targets.
4.
The social partners and the government have reached agreement on a limited
pension reform. The reform includes incentives to prolong the effective working life,
marginally extends the effective minimum contribution period (from 12.8 to 15 years), and
consolidates the agricultural and self-employed regimes into the general system. It also
extends the coverage of widowers’ pensions and increases pensions of those retired early as a
consequence of dismissal. It leaves the base period to compute pensions untouched. Overall,
while the agreement represents a helpful move in the direction advocated by staff, the longterm sustainability of the social security accounts will require further action.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 14, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Spain
On June 12, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Spain.1
Background
With growth of 3.4 percent in 2005, Spain continued its prolonged economic expansion. Over the
last year, the economy created more than 60 percent of all new jobs in the euro area,
accommodating large immigrant inflows and rising female labor force participation while
unemployment declined further. Domestic demand—notably consumption and investment in
construction, and more recently equipment—remained the main pull on activity, supported by
employment and housing wealth gains. In contrast, net exports increased their negative growth
contribution to some 2 percentage points. Growth was concentrated in nontradables, with sectors
exposed to foreign competition experiencing little gain. Advance indicators point to some gradual
softening of consumption and housing market inflation, amidst overall still buoyant activity in the
short term.
Despite recent interest rate hikes, liquidity and credit conditions remain expansionary, with real
interest rates negative or close to zero. Private sector credit grew at over 20 percent,
spearheaded by real estate lending, and household indebtedness rose to over 110 percent of
disposable income by end-2005. Headline and core inflation differentials with the euro area
widened to 1.8 and 1.6 percent respectively in the first quarter of 2006 and unit labor cost growth,
while slowing down, remained above the euro area average.
The external position deteriorated further in 2005, with the current account deficit reaching
7½ percent of GDP. Financial institutions intermediated external savings to meet the increasing
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2financing need of the nonfinancial private sector, mainly through the issuance of mortgagebacked securities in euro-area markets. Net external liabilities reached 46 percent of GDP.
Buoyant revenue drove the 2005 general government budget into a surplus of 1.1 percent of
GDP, the first since the 1970s. However, non-interest spending (adjusted for one-time operations
recorded in 2004) rising by 0.3 percentage points of GDP. As a result, fiscal demand withdrawal
was insufficient to offset loose monetary conditions. Budget and spending plans for 2006–07 also
imply a moderately expansionary stance. The Budget Stability Law and financing arrangements
with the regions are undergoing reform. These reforms aim at increasing the cyclical flexibility of
the fiscal rules and regions’ ownership and co-responsibility, while also expanding the leeway
afforded to territorial governments, with greater reliance on peer pressure to achieve budgetary
discipline. Age-related fiscal costs are set to rise considerably over the longer term, with the onset
of pension system deficits staring during the next decade.
The authorities’ National Reform Program under the Lisbon agenda aims to raise per capita
incomes and employment rates, by improving Spain’s productivity performance, which has lagged
behind internationally, and enhancing other determinants of competitiveness. Reforms
implemented in recent years in labor and product markets have improved their flexibility.
Nevertheless, distribution and retail, and other services, and domestically-oriented industries
account for most of the inflation differential and remain sheltered by significant regulatory and
administrative barriers to competition. The authorities are introducing a labor market reform
package that will temporarily ease conversion of temporary labor contracts into special openended contracts with comparatively low dismissal costs and fiscal incentives, while strengthening
restrictions for temporary contracts. No change is envisaged for regular open-ended labor
contracts.
The FSAP found that the financial system is dynamic, profitable, professionally managed, and
under strong supervision. The system is characterized by a high degree of financial
intermediation, wide access to financial services, and low intermediation margins. The payments
and securities’ settlement systems were deemed robust and well integrated internationally. The
financial system has been able to withstand substantial shocks, such as the financial disruption in
Latin America of a few years ago. The FSAP recommended exercising vigilance with respect to
developments in the mortgage market; bolstering the independence of financial sector
supervisors; improving governance and market discipline of savings banks; and adopting a
conservative treatment of financial institutions’ industrial participations under Basel II.
Executive Board Assessment
They welcomed the continued strong growth performance of the Spanish economy, marked by
robust job creation that has accommodated large immigrant flows into the labor market, a
concomitant rapid income catch-up to euro area levels, and a solid fiscal position. They
commended the authorities for the implementation of reforms since the early 1990s that have
underpinned this performance, by opening the economy, enhancing its flexibility, and establishing
stability-oriented policy frameworks.
Directors considered that short-term growth prospects remain buoyant and well above the euro
area average, with some moderation in domestic spending as a result of rising interest rates likely
to be compensated by stronger demand for Spanish exports. At the same time, however, the

-3already large current account deficit is projected to widen further. In this regard, Directors
cautioned about the possible adverse implications for the medium-term outlook of the continued
erosion of Spain’s competitive position, which has been driven by a persistent price and cost
differential and—more fundamentally—weak productivity growth. A number of Directors also
noted the risk of a more pronounced domestic demand slowdown prompted by private sector
balance sheet consolidation, as households reduce their high indebtedness and/or real estate
valuations correct.
Against this background, Directors supported the authorities’ National Reform Program (NRP),
which focuses on improving productivity, market flexibility, and competitiveness. They stressed
that regaining competitiveness within EMU will require building on the NRP through the
implementation of bold supply-oriented structural reforms.
As the NRP is implemented, Directors called for greater emphasis on competition-based
incentives to enhance the role of the private sector in research and development, and on further
deregulating sheltered sectors, with the removal of administrative and regulatory barriers to
competition in distribution, energy, transport, and other services. In distribution in particular,
productivity gains have been low by international standards and the inflation differential large due
to a range of barriers to entry. Directors welcomed steps to strengthen the competition authority,
and advised that these be complemented by procedures that ensure the full independence of
sectoral regulatory agencies. Directors noted that an open approach to competition has served
Spain well for many years, and called for it to be continued—in close collaboration with the
European Commission—as the EU internal market extends to more sensitive areas.
Directors welcomed the continued improvement in labor market performance, on the heels of
labor market reforms implemented over the past decade, but noted that there is scope for greater
labor market flexibility. They considered that the recently announced reform of labor contracting
provides some practical incentives for reducing Spain’s relatively high incidence of temporary
contracts. At the same time, a lasting reduction in the high share of temporary employment will
require reducing the rigidity and high dismissal costs of regular contracts—which are left
unchanged in the recent reform. Directors encouraged the social partners to review the collective
wage bargaining system in order to better link wage and productivity increases across industries,
firms, and regions, and to promote greater labor mobility.
Directors commended the authorities for achieving an appreciable fiscal surplus, continuing to
accumulate resources in the Pension Reserve Fund, and reducing public debt—a good example
of policies conducted in compliance with the revised Stability and Growth Pact. They noted,
however, that the 2005 fiscal surplus stemmed largely from the buoyancy of revenues, while
expenditure growth remained high, especially at the regional level, adding to demand pressures.
Against this background, Directors supported the authorities’ intention to allow the full play of
revenue stabilizers, and generally recommended that this be accompanied by greater spending
restraint at all levels of government. Some others were more cautious about the need for further
fiscal tightening at this time.
Directors welcomed the greater flexibility and cyclical sensitivity of the new Budget Stability Law
(BSL). They stressed that continued budget discipline within Spain’s highly decentralized fiscal
system requires a robust budgetary framework. In this regard, some of the BSL’s features
entailed a risk of insufficiently ambitious targets in good times. Directors stressed the importance

-4of continued progress in enhancing accountability through improvements in public reporting and
transparency, particularly at the territorial government level. In this vein, Directors recommended
that the ongoing review of regional financing arrangements aim to strengthen fiscal coresponsibility by matching the decentralization of competencies with greater taxing powers for
territorial authorities—and providing incentives to use these powers—thus avoiding reliance on
increased transfers from the central government.
Directors noted Spain’s relatively high fiscal costs of an aging population, and welcomed the
steps forward contained in the recent tripartite agreement on pension reform, including incentives
to extend the effective working life and the minimum contribution period. Placing the pension
system on a long-term sustainable path will require further steps, including changes to key
parameters such as the pension computation period. Containing rising healthcare spending will
also require reform measures.
Directors welcomed the FSAP assessment that the financial sector is highly dynamic, well
capitalized, profitable, and operating under strong supervision. Directors concurred that the main
risks relate to the ongoing rapid credit growth connected with the housing market boom. They
commended the adept supervision of the Bank of Spain. They recommended that the authorities
monitor credit quality closely and exert careful vigilance on rapidly growing new credit vehicles,
such as nonconventional mortgages. Directors looked forward to steps to strengthen the
independence of financial regulators—most particularly that of the insurance supervisor. They
emphasized the importance of preserving the current centralized prudential supervision and
regulation system. Directors encouraged the authorities to foster strong governance of Spain’s
savings banks, including through supporting the issuance of instruments that enhance market
accountability and reducing the ceiling on government representation on their boards of directors.
A number of Directors, noting the size and concentration of industrial participations in some credit
institutions’ portfolios and related risks, recommended that the most conservative approaches
under Basel II be applied to such participations.
Directors commended Spain’s commitment to double its official development assistance
allocation by 2008, ultimately aiming at reaching the UN target. They urged the authorities to
contribute, within the EU, to a successful completion of the Doha round.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Spain
and Pablo Moreno, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 12, 2006
The Spanish authorities welcome the candid and constructive dialogue held with the staff
during the Article IV and FSAP missions. The staff’s high quality set of papers provide a
useful contribution to the economic policy debate and the ongoing reform agenda; the
authorities will take careful note of their comments.
A.

ARTICLE IV

The staff analysis and policy recommendations are consistent with the authorities’
assessment. There is coincidence on the diagnostic: the Spanish economy is registering high
levels of growth and employment creation, and the short-term outlook is favorable with an
expected lower but more balanced growth pattern. There is also a shared concern on the
sustainability of longer-term growth, should the large inflation differential with the Euro-area
and the lagging productivity growth remain. The main difference on the diagnostic refers to
how much the current account deterioration is considered a sign of loss of competitiveness.
There is also agreement on the policy recommendations. The authorities policy framework is
structured around three basic axes1: (i) strengthening budgetary stability,(ii) improving the
competitive environment and enhancing productivity, and (iii) greater transparency and
quality of the regulatory framework. This economic policy strategy is oriented at maintaining
the high levels of employment creation while achieving at the same time a more balanced
growth pattern with less dependence on private consumption and the real estate sector, by
boosting productivity growth and competitiveness.
The staff’s recommendations coincide with this policy framework. The difference with the
authorities is primarily a question of timing and pace. Particularly, the staff’s assessment
mainly refers to the first two pillars, calling for greater fiscal consolidation and a faster pace
of reform. The authorities welcome the shared analysis and continue to work on the basis that
there is always room for improvement and no room for complacency. This being said, we
would stress that no-small progress has been achieved so-far.
We would highlight the following considerations on three different areas to qualify the staff’s
sense of urgency: (a) outlook, (b) fiscal policy, and (c) structural reforms.
(a)

A more benign outlook

In 2005 the Spanish GDP has grown at a rate of 3.4 percent, significantly above Euro-area
average. Unemployment has continued its downward trend, and it is now at 9.07 percent,
below that of other major European economies. For 2006, both, the staff and the authorities,
are projecting GDP growth at 3.3 percent. However, the authorities are expecting a more
balanced growth pattern, with consumption moderating its growth, and increased dynamism
1

See 2005-08 Stability ProgramUpdate:http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/about/activities/sgp/scplist_en.htm

-2of investment in equipment (in line with its accelerated path of the last year and a half), and
exports2. The latest data on exports on the first quarter of 2006 already points into this
direction with export growth accelerating to 9.1 percent year on year (the highest growth rate
since 2000). As a consequence, the drag on growth from net exports has somewhat
moderated in the last few quarters
Notwithstanding an element of loss of competitiveness, the deterioration of external
accounts also reflects a cyclical component, the weak demand on traditional export markets,
and an intense investment process. Several elements should be considered when assessing the
current account:
-

The authorities estimate that up to 44 percent of the deterioration of the trade deficit in
2005 is explained by the upturn in oil prices.

-

The recovery of exports during the first quarter of 2006 has come hand in hand with an
improvement of Spain’s traditional markets, a diversification of its target markets and a
better performance of competitiveness vis-à-vis non-EU OECD countries in the last few
months3. All this together might evidence that Spain is regaining competitiveness..

-

The current account deficit has been accompanied by an intense investment process,
which is part of the catching up process of the Spanish economy. The investment-to-GDP
ratio has increased from an average of 26.6 percent for the period 00-03 to an average of
28.7 percent for 04-05, while the Euro area average has decreased (from 20.7 percent to
20.4 percent) for the same period. At the same time, the savings-to-GDP ratio in Spain
continues to be high, well above the Euro area average (22.4 percent vs. 20.9 percent,
respectively). In part, this is due to the public sector surplus, which is, in fact, reducing
the economy’s borrowing requirement.

-

Finally, being a member of the Euro area mitigates the risks linked to a current account
deficit, since the aggregate exchange rate risk stemming from an individual member is
practically eliminated. In addition, a common currency facilitates capital movements
within the monetary union, making it easier to finance current account deficits, specially
when, as in this case, the Spanish deficit only represents a 0.3 percent of the GDP of the
Euro area and 6 percent of its savings.

The authorities are confident that inflation in 2006 will remain within the range of the
Consensus Forecast [3.0, 3.5] .However, as staff points out, prices so far have been showing
worrying dynamics this year, specially due to the evolution of oil prices4, with mixed results
observed during the first five months of 2006. Our authorities are following these
developments closely and believe that the combination of a better balanced pattern of growth,
the effects of the recent appreciation of the Euro, and the measures to increase competition

Greater oil price-developments incidence on Spanish prices is derived from both Spain’s relatively high oildependency ratio and a quite dynamic domestic demand.

-3and to make markets more flexible can lead to a more benign inflation forecast. Moreover,
real salaries in Spain have decreased in 2005, for a second year in a row, in an amount
comparable to that of Germany, the country in the Euro area with the best behavior on
salaries.
(b)

Fiscal policy

Unprecedented commitment to fiscal surplus. The 2005 general government budget closed
with a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP. Placing this number into context: (i) historically, it is
the first surplus of the public administration in the past three decades of democracy, (ii) in
the Euro-area, Spain is one of only three countries that have reached a surplus in 2005. In
cyclically-adjusted terms, these numbers imply a restrictive stance in 2005 measured by the
structural balance. Here, the authorities disagree with the staff’s assessment of procyclicality5.
Last Friday June the 2nd, the government approved the medium-term objectives of budgetary
stability, setting the target of a fiscal surplus through 2009. This will imply an unprecedented
five consecutive years of fiscal surplus for the public administration. In parallel, the
authorities will attend expenditure needs arising from immigration (which has pushed
population growth up to 10 percent in only six years), and those related to innovation, human
capital formation, and infrastructure investment in order to enhance a productivity-based
growth.
We are unconvinced by the staff argument to use fiscal policy and, more specifically,
expenditure restraint, to ease short term imbalances. We would stress that the level of public
expenditure is relatively low: the expenditure to GDP ratio in Spain is 38.2 percent, 9 points
below the Euro-area average, making it one in only two countries (together with Ireland)
with ratios below 40 percent. Furthermore, even the staff calculations point to the limited
impact of falling expenditures on improving the current account balance6.
Be that as it may, the authorities have recently announced their commitment to contribute to
a more balanced growth pattern via the introduction of an expenditure cap. According to this
measure, public expenditure growth within the 2007 budget will be limited by nominal GDP
growth, thus ensuring both a public surplus in 2007 and financial leeway in the years to
come.

5

The structural deficit indicators capture the impact of discretionary measures not linked to the cycle. Using
only the behaviour of public expenditure−as the staff does−to gauge the orientation of fiscal policy may be
misleading as it assumes that all expenditure growth is expansionary and any reduction is contractionary,
irrespective of the final impact on the balance or the cyclical situation. We would also highlight that in 2005,
expenditures have grown in line with nominal GDP growth, thereby sustaining the fiscal the surplus. Contrary
to the staff assessment, the OECD has qualified the fiscal stance in 2005 as moderately restrictive.

6

Box 3 estimates that the impact of a 1 percent reduction on real expenditure would only yield a 0.15-0.16
improvement in the current account. With this numbers, any significant result in the current account would
require a very large expenditure reduction.

-4Anchoring the fiscal consolidation framework. In 2005 and 2006 the government has been
working on three major fiscal reforms: the new Budget Stability Law (BSL), the income tax
reform, and the pension reform, which shall further anchor a fiscal framework in the main
following directions:


The new BSL, to enter into effect in 2007, strengthens the cyclical flexibility and
corresponsibility of the fiscal framework by setting the target of a fiscal balance over
the cycle for all levels of government, while safeguarding the social security system,
which will remain on its current separate accounting. The BSL addresses previous legal
inconsistencies as it complies with the principle of financial autonomy recognized in the
Constitution to the regions. The new system is born with widespread support across
national and regional parties and will be based on a consensual and coordinated
approach, with regional ownership of fiscal stabilization. The BSL establishes as the
general rule that Autonomous Communities will hold a balanced or in surplus budget
(regional fiscal surpluses are ensured in expansionary periods). The exception to the
rule is to allow a cyclical deficit when national growth is below the reference level (2
percent).



The ongoing income tax reform, now in Parliamentary procedure, introduces a more
streamlined and efficient income tax. The reform envisages a reduction of the
corporate tax rate (down to 30 percent and to 25 percent for small and medium
companies) better aligning it to European levels. The personal income tax will be
simplified with key features such as: reducing the number of brackets, setting a higher
exempt minimum income, a uniform rate on savings, or lowering marginal rates.



The government has announced on mid-May the agreement among partners on the
social dialogue on pension reform. The agreement will conclude on a wide range reform
on pensions in line with the commitments of the Pacto de Toledo reinforcing long-term
fiscal sustainability, with measures such as prolonging the effective working life and
the extension of the minimum affiliation period to compute pensions.
(c)

Structural reforms

Setting a new forward-looking, comprehensive, and closely monitored reform system.
The economic reform process is structured around two major programs launched in 2005: the
Plan de Dinamización, and the National Reform Plan under the European Union Lisbon
strategy7. These programs introduce a new system of economic reform based on the
following main principles: (i) predictability, specific measures and timetables for reform are
targeted, (ii) accountability, the programs identify the center responsible for carrying out the
measures as well as transparent monitoring procedures, (iii) comprehensiveness, economic
reform is understood as a process that affects the full range of economic activity including
fiscal stabilization, product and labor market liberalization, provision of public goods

-5(infrastructure, education), government sponsorship of activities with positive externalities
(R&D, startup companies), or environmental protection, (iv) continuous review, the process
of continuous monitoring and evaluation of reforms paths the way for new initiatives.
Key measures have been achieved during the past year:


The government has made a point of ensuring that the labor market reform is based on
a successful social dialogue as the best way to cement its effectiveness. A key issue
addressed in the dialogue has been the very high incidence of temporary employment in
Spain8. On May 9th, the government and the social partners have completed an
agreement on labor market reform that sets the basis for the reduction of temporary
employment through greater utilization of the contrato de fomento (the indefinite
contract with the lowest dismissal cost). The agreement also establishes a reinforcement
of the services in charge of active labor market policies.



In its first year of implementation, the Plan de Dinamización has registered an 85
percent success rate in the number of initiatives carried out, which have focused on
product and service markets5. Among the main measures undertaken we would stress:
the modernization of the competition authority, with an independent and better funded
National Commission of Competition to be established in 2007; final steps on the
liberalization of telecommunications services; the establishment of new licenses on
railroad transportation; a fast-track judicial procedure for the house rental market; or the
beginning of operations of the national registry of rights of emission under the Kyoto
protocol. According to its commitment on policies’ continuous review and up-date, in
March the authorities implemented an actualization of the Plan de Dinamización. Along
these new guidelines, the above mentioned expenditure-cap and a reform on the
mortgage law (currently under public consultation) are worth mentioning. Other
measures on the pipeline include the liberalization of railroad transportation of cargo,
and increased competition on the energy sector.

Official Development Aid
On official development aid, the authorities are committed to duplicate the amount of ODA
as a share of GDP, in order to reach 05% of GDP by 2008 and ultimately achieve the UN
goal of 0.7% of GDP in the near future.
B.

FSAP

The Spanish authorities have very much appreciated the deep and fresh-perspective provided
by the FSAP team on their analysis of the financial system. The staff concludes with a very
positive assessment on the resilience and competitiveness of the financial system stressing its
high degree of financial intermediation, efficient allocation of savings, high capitalization

employment.

-6and reduced risk-profile of its institutions, wide and competitive access to financial services,
a well-regulated system, and a cutting-edge prudential supervisory framework.
The main risks to this positive scenario are associated to the expansion of credit to the
housing and construction sectors, and to the developments in the housing market and the
competitiveness of the Spanish economy. Nonetheless, the stress-tests indicate a strong
resilience of the financial system to shocks in these markets, even under extreme case
scenarios considered by the staff (beyond standard stress-testing). This resilience reflects the
soundness of the financial position and the adequate risk management of credit institutions.
The authorities will take full account the staff’s assessment and FSAP recommendations.
We would nonetheless highlight the following considerations with respect to some of the
specific proposals:


The recommendation of delegation of more normative and sanctioning power to
supervisory agencies does not fit into the Spanish legal system. The capacity to
legislate the financial system and to approve and repeal licenses to institutions belongs
to the public administration. Formally, the Bank of Spain does not belong to the
Spanish public administration and therefore cannot legally be invested with such
powers. The system does however establish a central role for supervisory agencies both
in regulation and in licensing. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (ME) elaborates
prudential rules and the supervisors independently enforce those rules and develop their
detail through their own directives. License revocations are to be sanctioned by the
Ministry only after proposal at the initiative of the supervisor.
Furthermore, beyond it being a legal constraint, the attribution of the regulatory power
to the government is also a more efficient system in the case of Spain. In the absence of
a single financial supervisor, the ME is the only institution which has a global view of
the three financial sub-sectors (banking, insurance and securities) and the only one that
can thereby ensure a consistent financial regulation. The Ministry is also the institution
responsible for negotiating and transposing the EU legislation on financial services.



The staff raises concerns on how the ongoing reform of the Estatutos of Autonomous
Communities could affect prudential supervision and regulation. Here, the
authorities would like to reassure that the current system safeguards a centralized
prudential supervision and regulation system. Constitutional jurisprudence establishes
that supervision and sanction on solvency matters belongs exclusively to the State.



As noted by the staff on footnote 12 of the FSSA, the Ministry and the supervisors
signed a cooperation agreement last February. This agreement addresses the staff
recommendation on coordination among supervisors by creating a high level
Committee on Financial Stability, which will hold its first meeting this week.



On savings banks, the staff appropriately notes that they are well regulated and
supervised institutions that compete in equal footing with banks. On their regulatory
framework we would like to mention that, as stated in paragraph 12 of the FSSA report,

-7savings banks can merge within and across Autonomous Communities. The staff also
recommends promoting new means to raise high-quality capital, such as the issuance of
cuotas participativas. The authorities agree that these securities can play a useful role
and their promotion was in fact one the main reasons behind the 2004 regulation related
to these instruments. The current framework provides savings banks with a high degree
of legal certainty to strengthen their capital. In relation to the issue of corporate
governance, important steps have been taken, including, the irrevocability of the
mandate and reduction of the ceiling on public sector representation on the boards, and
the obligation to publish an annual report on corporate governance for all savings banks
issuing securities admitted to trading in official markets.
