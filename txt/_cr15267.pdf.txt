IMF Executive Board Completes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Myanmar
On August 28, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation1 with Myanmar.
Myanmar’s economic growth remains strong, but macroeconomic imbalances have increased
significantly over the past year. Real GDP growth for fiscal year (FY) 2014/15 (April-March)
is estimated to have reached 8.5 percent, while inflation rose to 8 percent (y/y) in May, up
from 4 percent in October 2014, reflecting mainly strong domestic demand. The fiscal deficit
increased to 3 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15, while credit to the private sector continued to
grow strongly at 35 percent (y/y) in March, albeit lower than in FY 2013/14. The current
account deficit widened to over 6 percent of GDP, largely reflecting a rapidly rising trade
deficit. The official reference exchange rate came under strong downward pressure and
depreciated by about 20 percent from Sept 2014 to July 2015. At end-March 2015, the
Central Bank of Myanmar’s (CBM) foreign reserves covered around 3 months of imports.
The Myanmar economy is set for strong growth this year amid signs of overheating. The
economy is expected to grow by 8.5 percent, reflecting strong growth momentum and
expansionary macroeconomic policies. The projected increase in the fiscal deficit in the FY
2015/16 budget will provide an expansionary stimulus and contribute to strong credit growth
and a rising current account deficit. With higher deficit anticipated, CBM financing of the
deficit is likely to remain significant while credit growth is expected to accelerate. As a
result, inflation is expected to rise further in FY 2015/16 and the current account deficit to
widen.
Downside risks to growth and stability in the near term have increased, and have been
amplified by recent floods. Lower natural gas prices would further reduce export earnings
and government revenue, and could also lead to lower-than-expected FDI (Foreign direct
investment) inflows in the medium to long run. A sharper-than-expected slowdown in
China’s growth would also have a negative impact on Myanmar through the trade channel.
Moreover, a tightening of monetary policy in the United States could strengthen the U.S.

dollar and put renewed downward pressure on the kyat. Increasing vulnerabilities resulting
from rapid credit growth, a widening current account deficit, and an expansionary budget
pose increasing risks to price and external stability. Despite its overall benefits, the ongoing
liberalization of the financial sector, with the admittance of new foreign banks this year also
comes with risks as the CBM’s regulatory and supervisory capacity is still relatively weak.
On the other hand, a well-received election outcome and peace process may provide an
upside surprise, resulting in higher-than-expected FDI inflows.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Myanmar’s strong growth momentum and the advancement
of the authorities’ reform programs. Noting signs of economic overheating and the impact of
the recent floods on the economy, Directors urged the authorities to strike a balance between
the need to support economic recovery and reconstruction and the imperative to maintain
macroeconomic stability.
Directors stressed the importance of containing the fiscal deficit to address the signs of
economic overheating. At the same time, they noted that additional resources may be needed
for recovery and reconstruction spending, with support from development partners. Noting
the low revenue collection, large development needs, and the necessity to ensure fiscal
sustainability, Directors encouraged the authorities to broaden the tax base, prepare for the
introduction of a value-added tax, limit tax incentives, condition transfers to states and
regions on implementation capacity, and further reprioritize expenditures. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative Standard. While commending the authorities for launching treasury bill auctions,
Directors also stressed the urgency of allowing the interest rate at T-bill auctions to rise in
order to attract higher bid volumes and terminate the Central Bank of Myanmar’s (CBM)
financing of fiscal deficits.
Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten monetary policy in order to reduce
macroeconomic vulnerabilities arising from the signs of overheating. Given the recent floods,
it was also noted that some flexibility in monetary tightening may be needed should the
floods lead to a spike in demand for liquidity. The October target date for the implementation
of the recalibrated reserve requirement should be maintained, and the CBM should be
prepared to increase the reserve requirement and scale up deposit auctions should signs of
second-round effects from food price increases on inflation emerge. Directors welcomed the
recent move by the CBM to realign its reference exchange rate with the wider market

exchange rates, and noted the importance of maintaining exchange rate flexibility to cushion
Myanmar from exogenous shocks and maintain external competitiveness in light of its
relatively high inflation.
Directors stressed that existing prudential measures should be enforced and, where needed,
tightened, in order to contain credit growth and reduce financial sector risks. The CBM
should speed up the issuance of remaining prudential instructions and the strengthening of its
supervisory capacity, particularly in view of the entry of nine foreign banks this year.
Reforming state-owned banks and strengthening the supervision of policy banks and
non-bank financial institutions will also be critical to safeguarding financial stability.
Directors highlighted the importance of compiling and releasing consistent financial
soundness indicators and of implementing measures on anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism to protect Myanmar’s correspondence bank
relationships.
Directors emphasized that implementing the structural reform agenda is essential to achieve
inclusive and sustainable growth. Measures should focus on further improving the business
environment, financial inclusion, health services, and education. Further improvements in
institutional capacity, supported by continued technical assistance, and better economic
statistics will be important to enhance macroeconomic management.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 14, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Myanmar is undergoing a historical political transition, with its first general
elections since the start of reforms scheduled on November 8, 2015. Meanwhile,
negotiations with armed ethnic groups to reach a final ceasefire agreement are
continuing against a tight deadline before the elections. Favorable outcomes on these
two fronts would pave the way for greater political and social stability and underpin
continued economic transition.
Economic Situation and Outlook: Growth remains strong, but signs of economic
overheating have emerged in the face of supply bottlenecks and loose financial
conditions. Vulnerabilities have increased significantly amid rising macroeconomic
imbalances as reflected in rising inflation, depreciation pressure and a widening current
account deficit driven by strong domestic demand and rapid credit growth. With an
expansionary 2015/16 budget and limited tools available to tighten monetary policy,
inflation is likely to accelerate, the current account deficit to widen, and foreign reserve
coverage to fall in the short term.
Medium-long term prospects: With continued structural reforms and foreign direct
investment, economic prospects remain favorable. Macroeconomic stability will be
critical for sustaining growth and building up policy buffers.
Policy Recommendations: In the short term, concerted efforts are needed to tighten
financial conditions. The authorities should reduce the fiscal deficit through revenue
mobilization and expenditure reprioritization. Direct deficit financing by the Central Bank
of Myanmar (CBM) needs to be replaced with Treasury bill issuance through auctions.
The CBM should withdraw liquidity from the banking system by stepping up deposit
auctions and implementing the recalibrated reserve requirement. Enforcing prudential
measures will also be critical to slow credit growth and reduce financial sector risks. Over
the medium-long term, continued structural reforms and capacity building are crucial for
inclusive growth. Sustained efforts will be needed to mobilize revenues to support
priority spending, modernize the regulatory and supervisory framework to safeguard
financial stability and enhance financial inclusion, and improve the business environment
to foster private enterprise.

CONTEXT
1.
Myanmar is undergoing a historical political transition. On November 8, the country is
scheduled to hold its first general elections since the start of reforms in 2011. Also of historical
significance is the ongoing peace process. The Myanmar government has recently signed a draft
ceasefire agreement with 16 armed ethnic groups, and negotiations to reach a final agreement
before the elections are continuing. Favorable outcomes on these two fronts would pave the way for
greater political and social stability and underpin continued economic transition.
2.
Myanmar has made impressive strides in economic reform but the country continues
to face daunting development challenges. Trade and financial liberalization has moved forward
rapidly with the dismantling of trade barriers and the opening of the banking sector. This year marks
the entry of nine foreign banks and the operation of the Thilawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which
will provide an initial platform for Myanmar’s export-oriented growth. Despite these advances,
Myanmar remains the poorest country in Southeast Asia and its development indicators are well
below its peers in the region (Table 6). Moreover, Myanmar’s capacity for economic management is
low. The authorities have received considerable technical assistance from the Fund and have made
good progress in implementing Fund policy recommendations, although much remains on the
reform agenda (see the Appendix I).
3.
The key challenge in this election year is to maintain macroeconomic stability.
Following three years of strong growth supported by loosening financial conditions, the economy is
running into supply constraints, including shortages of infrastructure services (e.g., electricity) and
skilled and semi-skilled labor. While productive capacity will increase over time with continued
structural reforms and investment, policy adjustments are necessary to slow the growth of aggregate
demand in the short run. This is all the more important in the face of lower commodity prices which
make it difficult to sustain current policy settings without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS

The 2014/15 fiscal deficit is estimated at 3 percent of GDP, but the underlying deficit is estimated at
5½ percent once one-off receipts from telecom and gas companies are excluded (Table 2). The
current account deficit widened to over 6 percent of GDP, largely reflecting a rapidly rising trade
deficit, which increased from 4½ percent of GDP to 8¼ percent (Table 3). Since late 2014, the kyat
has come under pressure to depreciate, and its value against the U.S. dollar has declined by
about 20 percent. At end-March 2015, the Central Bank of Myanmar’s (CBM) foreign reserves
covered around 3 months of imports, well below the estimated adequate level of 5−6 months of
imports.1 Credit to the private sector continued to grow strongly at 35 percent (y/y) in March, albeit
lower than the 53½ percent in 2013/14 (Table 4).

while credit to private sector is expected to
expand by about 45 percent. As a result, inflation is expected to rise to around 13 percent (end-year)
in 2015/16 and the current account deficit to widen to about 9 percent of GDP, with the CBM’s
foreign reserves falling to about 2½ months of imports.

Downside risks to growth and
stability in the near term have increased
(Table 7). The formula-based price smoothing
mechanism under the contract has mitigated
the impact of the fall in international
commodity prices on Myanmar’s gas export
earnings, and the overall terms of trade
remains favorable given that Myanmar is a net
importer of fuel. However, lower natural gas
prices would further reduce export earnings
and government revenue, and could also lead

The IMF’s new metric for low-income countries suggests an adequate level of reserves of about 4½−7 months of
imports for Myanmar. Given Myanmar’s huge development needs, it would be appropriate for Myanmar to target
around 5−6 months of prospective import cover.

to lower-than-expected FDI inflows in the medium-long run. A sharper-than-expected slowdown in
China’s growth would also have a negative impact on Myanmar. Moreover, a tightening of US
monetary policy and uncertainty over Greece’s economic situation could strengthen the US dollar
and put further downward pressure on the kyat. Increasing vulnerabilities resulting from rapid credit
growth, a widening current account deficit, and an expansionary budget pose increasing risks to
price and external stability. The ongoing liberalization of the financial sector—despite its overall
benefits—also comes with risks as the CBM’s regulatory and supervisory capacity is still relatively
weak. A combination of these potential shocks—if materialized amid political uncertainty related to
the general elections—could severely strain the economy (see scenario analysis in the following
section). On the other hand, a well-received election outcome and peace process may provide an
upside surprise, resulting in higher-than-expected FDI inflows.
7.
Myanmar’s medium-long term growth prospects remain favorable on account of
continued reform and FDI inflows (Table 5). Staff currently projects a long-term growth rate of
around 7 percent. Given its low income level, Myanmar can sustain such rapid growth for a long time
to come through catch up. With its strategic location and proximity to a dynamic East and Southeast
Asia, Myanmar stands to benefit from an expected relocation of FDIs in manufacturing around the
region in search of lower labor cost. To take advantage of this opportunity, Myanmar will need to
continue to pursue market-oriented reform and improve its business environment.

Authorities’ Views
8.
The authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s assessment of the current
economic situation and outlook. However, they project growth at 9⅓ percent in 2015/16 on
account of strong FDI inflows to support rapid growth in energy and manufacturing industries. A
booming tourism sector will also help boost transportation and construction industries.
Infrastructure development under the next Five-Year National Development Plan will help sustain
economic growth in the long run.

MAINTAINING NEAR-TERM MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY
9.
The authorities’ 2015/16 budget projects an overall fiscal deficit of just
under 5 percent of GDP. Staff’s projections show a deficit of 4¾ percent of GDP after incorporating
more plausible revenue and expenditure outcomes in contrast to the authorities’ very conservative
revenue projection and an ambitious and perhaps unsustainable reduction in capital expenditure.
Nevertheless, the budget represents a fiscal expansion of nearly 2 percent of GDP from last year,
largely reflecting a substantial wage increase for public sector employees, albeit from a very low
base (a little over 2 percent of GDP).
10.
Credit to the private sector has been growing by 50 percent annually on average
during 2011/12–2014/15 and is expected to increase by about 45 percent this year. Much of

construction (including real estate) and agriculture,
which collectively account for more than two-thirds of
total credit. Over 90 percent of the credit is extended
through loans for 12 months or less, which are
routinely rolled over with capitalization of interest.
Loans through hire-purchase are also rising, although
they still account for less than 10 percent of total
loans outstanding. Meanwhile, most banks are undercapitalized and data on loan quality and provisioning
continue to pose difficulties for proper analysis.

Myanmar is facing challenges in implementing anti-money laundering/combating
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures. It remains listed by the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) as a country that has not made sufficient progress in implementing its action plan to address
its significant AML/CFT shortcomings. Without progress, Myanmar banks’ correspondent banking
relationships in major financial markets could be adversely affected if the FATF calls for
countermeasures against Myanmar. It is thus urgent that the authorities promulgate FATF–compliant
AML/CFT laws and regulations and implement them effectively.

Staff’s Views
12.
Myanmar’s top policy priority in the near term is to address increasing macroeconomic
imbalances and the resulting vulnerabilities. This calls for a tightening of monetary and fiscal
policies along with exchange rate flexibility. Given the ongoing pressure on the kyat, early action to
tighten policies and enforce prudential measures is needed to address the underlying causes of the
growing macroeconomic imbalances.
Reducing the fiscal deficit and terminating CBM financing
13.
Reducing the fiscal deficit is urgently
needed to contain immediate inflationary
pressure and anchor exchange rate
expectations. Staff recommends that the fiscal
deficit be reduced to about 4 percent of GDP
in 2015/16, which would constitute a
countercyclical measure to address the growing
macroeconomic imbalances. This target can be
achieved through a combination of measures in
revenue mobilization and expenditure

on goods and services, and travel expenses. While expenditures on health, education and
infrastructure should be protected, transfers to Regions and States should be contained in line with
their implementation capacity and spending responsibilities. Over the medium term, a new fiscal rule
aimed at addressing volatile gas revenues can be considered (see paragraph 24).

Automatic CBM financing of the residual gap in the fiscal deficit should be terminated
and replaced by issuance of government securities. Staff welcomes the establishment of the
Treasury Department in September 2014 and the launch of T-bill auctions in January 2015. To attract
substantially larger volumes of bids that are needed to meet the CBM’s reserve money target, it is
urgent that the Ministry of Finance allows the interest rate at T-bill auctions to rise. Continued efforts
will also be needed to integrate the auction with budget execution and cash management. In
particular, the volume of fortnightly T-bill sales needs to be spread out to reduce pressures to issue
large volumes of T-bills to the CBM at the end of the fiscal year. In addition, like domestic banks,
foreign bank branches operating in Myanmar should be allowed to purchase government securities
to broaden the government's funding base. This will also provide better options for bank liquidity
management and aid the development of the money markets.

continues to encourage the authorities to convert the CBM’s legacy debt portfolio to marketable
government securities that can be used for open market operations. As inflation is expected to rise
over the course of 2015/16, the CBM and government should consider increasing the current
regulated minimum deposit and maximum lending rates, the CBM discount rate, and the fixed rates
offered on Treasury bonds to improve the attractiveness of the instruments.
16.
Staff welcomes the CBM’s recent bold move to close the exchange rate gap by aligning
its reference rate with parallel market rates. Exchange rate flexibility is critical to maintaining
external stability. The current downward pressure on the kyat is largely a result of macroeconomic
policy inconsistency—monetary and fiscal policies are too loose to anchor the exchange rate
expectations, although external shocks have also played a role (Box 1). Under the current
macroeconomic policy settings, resisting depreciation pressure could lead to a quick rundown of
reserves. A priority import window for supply of FX to importers of fuel and cooking oil was
introduced in late-June, prior to the recent realignment of the reference rate and parallel market
rates (Box 2). Staff is examining any jurisdictional implications arising from the operation of the
window. The authorities noted their intention to phase out the window.
Strengthening prudential measures
17.
Prudential measures, as well as liquidity tightening, are needed to arrest credit
expansion and minimize financial sector risks. Because of the uncertainty over the sustainable
pace of financial deepening, prudential measures will need to be introduced quickly and measures
already in place should be enforced and tightened where needed to ensure credit to the private
sector grow at a safe pace. In this regard, a top priority is to finalize and issue the remaining six out
of the eight instructions on prudential regulations. This would help empower the supervisors to
ensure that all banks meet capital and liquidity requirements in a reasonably short timeframe, that
prudent loan classification and loss provisioning are followed and that loans are sound before they
are rolled over. The authorities should also strengthen monitoring of hire purchase and credit
funded by foreign loans, and start to prepare a bank resolution framework.
Reducing risks and improving growth sustainability
18.
Two alternative scenarios prepared by staff illustrate the importance of taking
concerted actions to tighten macro policies and strengthen prudential measures outlined
above (Box 3). The (policy) adjustment scenario highlights the potential benefits of taking early
action to address the imbalances identified in the baseline. The result of tightening policies and
strengthening prudential measures would be reduced vulnerabilities and improved policy buffers.
Real GDP growth would be somewhat lower than in the baseline because of less expansionary
macroeconomic policies, but this growth path would be more sustainable. In contrast, the adverse
scenario provides a stress test of a situation where fiscal policy slippages and deteriorating
prudential standards further increase credit expansion (as reflected in the rising money multiplier), to
around 60 percent compared with 45 percent in the baseline. If Myanmar were also hit by further
declines in the price and production of natural gas and lower FDI inflows arising from electionsrelated uncertainty, growth would be slower and economic vulnerabilities would rise further. In

particular, the fiscal deficit in 2015/16 could rise to over 6 percent, the current account deficit widen
to 10 percent, and CBM reserves fall to 1⅓ months of imports, with a further decline to less than 1
month in 2016/17.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s policy recommendations. They
pointed out that they have been able to keep fiscal deficits lower than budgeted in recent years.
While acknowledging the need to raise interest rates at T-bill auctions, they were concerned about
increases in interest costs to the budget. They indicated that cutting maintenance cost and capital
spending in the 2015/16 budget is necessary to meet the deficit target. The authorities indicated
that increased transfers to sub-national governments are part of a political process for federalism.
20.
The authorities recognized the need to tighten monetary condition and intended to
scale up deposit auctions to reduce liquidity and anchor exchange rate expectations. The CBM
has operational autonomy to mop up sufficient amount of liquidity. The authorities’ initial reluctance
to allow the CBM reference rate to align with the market rates was out of concerns over a potential
downward depreciation-inflation spiral once the CBM reference rate is allowed to reflect market
conditions. The authorities also recognized the need to implement prudential measures and
strengthen monitoring of banks’ balance sheets. In areas where prudential instructions are yet to be
issued, the CBM has been using moral suasion to influence banks’ behavior.

LAYING FOUNDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE, INCLUSIVE
GROWTH
21.
Myanmar lacks a well-developed private sector and is currently short of public goods
and social services to support inclusive growth. The authorities’ Framework for Economic and
Social Reforms (FESR) appropriately targets infrastructure development as a priority, as lack of
infrastructure services, particularly electricity supply, is a major constraint on business activities.
Expenditure on health and education, another well-identified priority, has increased in recent years,
but public resources devoted to this area are well below in those found in peer countries. At the
same time, access to finance is limited, particularly for the vast rural population and small and
medium-sized enterprises, and Myanmar’s regulatory regime imposes heavy burdens on businesses.

Staff’s Views
22.
Myanmar needs to implement well-focused reforms to foster inclusive growth. Given
the current circumstances, policies should aim to mobilize and make the best use of public resources
available, strengthen regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector, and continue to
improve the business environment to create the enabling condition for private enterprise to flourish.
Building institutional capacity is critical to moving forward in these areas.

Revenue mobilization remains a top priority to increase public resources available for
promoting inclusive growth. Tax revenue has increased significantly over the last three years, but it
is still well below levels in most peer countries because of a narrow tax base, exacerbated by
extensive tax incentives and weak administration. Staff recommends that as an initial step to reduce
tax incentives, tax expenditure be estimated and presented as part of annual budgets. Preparatory
work on the introduction of a value added tax (VAT)

allocated to the field offices and Internal Revenue Department (IRD) headquarters to boost their
capacity, including through staffing and ICT improvement. The extension of self-assessment to
medium taxpayers should be delayed until new procedures and systems, especially for effective
audit, are put in place in the LTO.
24.
Myanmar should continue to prioritize expenditure on infrastructure and social
programs and improve public financial management. In this respect, the cut in capital spending
budgeted for 2015/16 is neither desirable nor consistent with the authorities’ stated expenditure
priorities. While it is important to raise public sector wages to retain and attract talents, the pace and
structure of wage increases should be implemented in conjunction with a public service reform. Staff
also encourages the authorities to assess the impact of expected increases in inflation on the poor
and consider introducing well-targeted social programs as needed, such as free school meals to
pupils attending compulsory education in public schools and free hospital treatments to pregnant
and nursing women and elderly individuals. In the area of public financial management, the
government should adopt a medium-term fiscal framework and consider introducing, over time, a
fiscal rule to smooth spending against volatile gas revenues. The reform of state economic
enterprises (SEEs) should be accelerated with a view to improving their efficiency and profitability in
order to minimize contingent liabilities. This includes revising MOGE’s financial requirements to
reflect its role in collecting natural gas rents on behalf of the government.
25.
Given the limited fiscal resources and huge spending needs, it is all the more important
that Myanmar maintain fiscal discipline to ensure debt sustainability. Myanmar’s risk of debt
distress remains low (see the DSA), but overall public debt is projected to rise over time given the
large financing needs for development. This highlights the importance of keeping deficits low and

pursuing prudent external borrowing with an emphasis on concessional loans. Based on debt
sustainability simulations, staff advised the government to lower its fiscal deficit target from
5 percent of GDP to 4½ percent of GDP over the medium to long term in order to safeguard fiscal
sustainability.

Improving financial inclusion and promoting private enterprise
26.
Improving financial inclusion will require safeguarding financial stability as well as
broadening funding sources and reducing costs. Staff welcomes recent progress in preparing the
Banks and Financial Institutions Law, the Investment Law and Company Law, and looks forward to
their early approval by parliament. The enactment of these laws will help clarify the regulatory
environment and make it more attractive to FDIs. The CBM should speed up approval of investment
and other capital inflows consistent with these laws while maintaining appropriate capital
management measures (such as setting annual ceilings of new borrowings) to safeguard financial
stability. In addition, the CBM should consider allowing foreign exchange swaps and forwards to
enable financial institutions and companies to hedge exchange rate risks and promote money
market development. Foreign micro-finance institutions (MFIs) should be allowed to raise domestic
kyat funding to facilitate more stable access to credit in the sector. Myanmar should take full
advantage of the presence of nine foreign banks by end-September to modernize its banking sector
while minimizing associated risks, such as volatility in capital flows (Selected Issues Paper 2).
27.
Reforms of state banks should be accelerated, and policy banks, cooperatives, and
MFIs need to be properly regulated and supervised (Box 4). Staff welcomes progress being
made in the diagnostics of state banks with assistance of the World Bank and encourages the
authorities to move expeditiously in formulating a reform plan to redefine the role of state banks
and reduce financial and fiscal risks. One option would be to consolidate these banks and the many
policy banks into one or two development banks with clear development mandates and a modern

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

governance structure. Proper prudential regulations need to be applied to policy banks, cooperatives
and MFIs, and their risks exposure, including foreign currency risks, should be monitored closely.
Over time, the authorities should consider reducing fragmentation of financial supervision, with
supervision power being consolidated in the CBM as its capacity develops.
28.
Continued efforts will be needed to improve the business environment and external
competitiveness. It is important to continue with regulatory reforms to reduce the cost of doing
business, particularly in the areas of contract enforcement and business start-up, where Myanmar
lags behind most of its peers. Myanmar has a great opportunity to leverage its participation in the
ASEAN Economic Community to improve the business environment, as well as to take advantage of
the dynamic regional market and value chains to implement its export-oriented development
strategy, which entails export diversification to promote manufacturing activities (Selected Issues
Paper 3). Raising labor productivity through education and training will be important to improve
competitiveness, including in agriculture.

Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities attach great importance to promoting inclusive growth. They are fully
aware of the need to raise revenue but have noted that their efforts are often hampered by capacity
constraints. To build up human capital and reduce poverty, the 2015/16 budget provided an
extension of the free basic education program and more resources for medical education to train
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MYANMAR

more healthcare professionals. The authorities are also planning to increase hospital coverage in
rural areas and provide free books in primary and secondary public schools. The authorities
recognize the need to improve the regulatory and supervisory framework to safeguard financial
stability when promoting financial inclusion. Their approach to improve the business climate includes
setting up special economic zones to make localized improvement in infrastructure and the
regulatory regime.

DEVELOPING CAPACITY FOR MACROECONOMIC
MANAGEMENT
30.
Myanmar has an ambitious technical assistance (TA) program and is one of the largest
recipients of Fund assistance. To meet the authorities’ priorities, Fund TA has focused on central
bank operations; financial sector supervision; revenue administration and tax reform; public financial
management; macroeconomic analysis; AML/CFT; and statistics. Delivery is through a mix of resident
advisors, experts in the Bangkok-based Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar
(TAOLAM), and short-term HQ and expert missions. Considerable efforts have been made in
collaboration and coordination with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank as well as bilateral
development partners. Given the weak capacity in Myanmar, Fund assistance is likely to play a critical
role for some time to come.
Staff’s Views
31.
Strong leadership is critical to continued improvement in the effectiveness of technical
assistance and capacity building. Staff welcomes the establishment of a steering committee and
working groups with officials from various departments of the CBM to develop and refine monetary
policy tools and to improve financial market and legal infrastructure. In the area of accounting and
the payment system, a strong push from the top management is needed to increase the momentum.
32.
Continued improvements in macroeconomic statistics are important for timely and
informed policy-making. Significant progress has been made in reducing the time lags of releasing
data, particularly on monetary statistics, but serious data shortcomings, as discussed in the Statistical
Issues Appendix, still pose significant challenges to macroeconomic surveillance. Data shortcomings
include, among others, those in the areas of national accounts and external sector statistics. Staff
encourages the authorities to prioritize the compilation of consistent financial soundness indicators
(FSIs) and expedite the release of the rebased CPI.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities recognize the importance of capacity building. They intend to strengthen
leadership in this area and enhance absorptive capacity by facilitating suitably qualified officials to
work closely with external experts. The rebased CPI is scheduled for release in the second half
of 2015 and Fund technical assistance will be sought to improve FSIs.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The year 2015 marks a major milestone in Myanmar’s political transition. A successful
conduct of the November general elections and a timely conclusion of the peace negotiations will
provide a firm basis for greater political and social stability and underpin continued economic
transition.
35.
The growth momentum remains strong, but signs of economic overheating have
emerged in the face of supply bottlenecks and loose financial conditions. Downside risks to
growth and stability have thus increased amid rising macroeconomic imbalances and a volatile
external environment. This calls for urgent actions to reduce vulnerabilities.
36.
An immediate policy priority is to tighten monetary condition. This action is essential to
curb the rapid credit growth, a key factor behind the rising inflation and widening current account
deficit, which in turn drive kyat depreciation. The CBM should scale up deposit auctions and
promptly implement the recalibrated reserve requirement to mop up liquidity. Staff welcomes the
CBM’s willingness to allow interest rates at deposit and securities auctions to rise, which will help
attract more deposits and Treasury bill purchases by banks.
37.
Prudential measures need to be enforced to help curb credit expansion and minimize
financial risks. The CBM should ensure that banks meet capital and liquidity requirements, and that
their loan portfolios are properly classified and provisioning is adequate. Where needed, prudential
standards should be tightened. Building on recent progress, the CBM should promptly finalize and
issue remaining instructions on prudential regulations. More broadly, increased efforts will be
needed to modernize the regulatory framework and strengthen the supervisory capacity.
38.
Staff welcomes the recent bold move by the CBM to realign its reference rate with the
wider market exchange rates. This policy change has helped balance the FX market by bringing FX
supply back to the formal market and reducing excess FX demand. It is critical that the CBM support
the exchange rate by tightening monetary condition to forestall any potential depreciation-inflation
spiral. The kyat is broadly in line with its medium-term fundamentals, and staff encourages the
authorities to advance structural reforms to improve external competitiveness.
39.
Addressing economic overheating will also require reducing the fiscal deficit in the
near term and terminating automatic CBM financing of the fiscal deficit. Raising tax revenue by
commencing the collection of the commercial tax on telecommunication service and reducing tax
incentives should be among the immediate priorities. On the expenditure side, the authorities should
consider curbing transfers to States and Regions and cutting low-priority recurrent expenditure. Staff
welcomes the launch of T-bill auctions and advises that interest rates be raised to attract
substantially higher bid volumes to mop up liquidity.
40.
Sustained efforts will be needed for revenue mobilization to meet Myanmar’s huge
development needs. Staff welcomes the operation of the Large Taxpayers Office and suggests that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MYANMAR

more resources be provided to the IRD to boost capacity. Legislation on the special commercial tax
should be passed expeditiously and preparations for the introduction of a VAT should begin in
earnest, as should work on estimating tax expenditure as part of annual budgets. Self-assessment of
income taxes should not be extended to medium taxpayers until it works well in the LTO.
41.
A large reform agenda remains on improving financial inclusion and the business
environment to foster inclusive growth. Staff welcomes progress made in preparing relevant
legislation and encourages its early approval in parliament. Much remains to be done in reforming
state banks, strengthening supervision of policy banks and non-bank financial institutions, and
facilitating market development to provide more reliable and affordable funding to these
institutions. Early action is also needed to implement AML/CFT measures. Reducing the cost of doing
business is important for fostering private enterprise, as is investing in human capital for raising
labor productivity.
42.
Continued technical assistance and capacity building are imperative to strengthen
institutions for macroeconomic management. Staff encourages the authorities to provide strong
leadership in implementing capacity building programs and make continued efforts to improve
macroeconomic statistics, including early release of the rebased CPI and FSIs.
43.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for approval of a multiple currency practice
subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 3. The current multi-price FX auction is a
necessary but temporary mechanism for price discovery and liquidity management given Myanmar’s
current underdeveloped FX market. The MCP arises from the mechanism of the foreign exchange
auction and is maintained principally for non-balance of payments reasons. However, since the MCP
does not materially impede the member’s balance of payments adjustments, does not harm the
interests of other members, and does not discriminate among members and is temporary, and the
authorities are unable to replace it at present, staff recommends Executive Board approval for its
retention until August 27, 2016 or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation, whichever is
earlier.
44.

16

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
Myanmar’s inflation-based real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciated by 3¾ percent between
mid-2014 and March 2015. This has reversed the trend
depreciation since 2012 when exchange rates were
unified. However, the nominal exchange rate has
depreciated significantly since March 2015, by as much
as 16 percent against the U.S. dollar. Given that
anticipated inflation differentials is expected to be much
less than the nominal depreciation, it is likely that the
REER has also adjusted downwards since March 2015.
Since 2010, trade restrictions and controls on FX
transactions have been gradually lifted. Pent-up import
demand has widened the current account deficit, and
external shocks such as lower gas prices have exerted
downward pressure on the kyat. This trend is likely to continue until financial policies are tightened to rein in
aggregate demand.
Given this background, the kyat appears to be broadly in line with Myanmar’s medium-term
fundamentals. Data limitations and structural changes make it difficult to apply conventional econometricsbased evaluation methods. However, the Central Bank of Myanmar’s recent decision to move its reference
exchange rate in line with the broad market rates has brought the exchange rate closer in line with the

fundamentals. From September 2014 until mid-July 2015, the CBM was allowing the reference exchange rate
to depreciate more slowly than the parallel market rate. However, in mid-July, the CBM brought its reference
rate in line with market rates (a 6.7 percent depreciation). Staff projections, however, show that the current
account deficit will likely remain elevated over the medium term as Myanmar continues to meet pent-up
import demand. A moderate depreciation of the REER will help ensure that the deficit will narrow over the
medium term.
Myanmar will also need to strengthen macroeconomic stability and undertake structural reforms to
improve its external position. Pent-up import demand unleashed by trade liberalization must be
contained by tighter financial conditions. Over time, however, structural reforms to improve productivity are
essential to raise Myanmar’s external competitiveness. Labor costs in Myanmar remain among the lowest in
Asia, but productivity is also low due to skill shortages and supply bottlenecks. Market liberalization and
regulatory reforms, as recently seen in telecommunications, can bring down the cost of doing business and
attract FDI.

Box 2. Recent Foreign Exchange Market Developments
The CBM has experienced considerable challenges in managing depreciation pressures on the kyat.
Beginning in October 2014, the CBM attempted to slow kyat depreciation by setting its reference rate (the
cut-off rate at the auction) at a more appreciated rate than the parallel market rate, causing the gap
between the two rates to diverge significantly. Although the CBM allowed the reference rate to depreciate, it
was always lagging behind the parallel market rate and it was not until July 13, 2015 that the CBM took a
bold move to realign the reference rate with the parallel market rate. This has largely restored the price
discovery mechanism embedded in the auction rules and led to a sharp depreciation of the CBM reference
rate. A gap between the two continues to exist but it is now less than 2 percent. Balance has been restored
in the FX market and the kyat appears to have stabilized for now.
The kyat has depreciated significantly since
September 2014 reflecting both external and
internal factors. It has depreciated by
about 20 percent against the US dollar and about
6¾ percent on a nominal effective basis. This has
largely resulted from strong import demand and rising
inflation pressures, reflecting ongoing fiscal stimulus
and easy monetary and credit conditions. However,
other factors have also played a role, including a
strengthening US dollar, declines in natural gas prices,
and political uncertainty ahead of the elections in
November.

imbalance in the FX market and putting further pressure
on the kyat.
Prior to the recent exchange rate realignment, foreign exchange became scarce in the formal
authorized dealer market forcing importers into the informal markets. As authorized dealers are
required to trade FX within 0.8 percent of the CBM reference rate they quickly became uncompetitive
purchasers of FX relative to informal market dealers who were trading FX at rates up to 10 percent more
depreciated relative to the CBM reference rate. Turnover with authorized dealers and legal money changers
thus declined as banks turned away all but their best customers looking to purchase FX. In late June, a
priority import window was introduced whereby unrestricted FX would be supplied to importers of cooking
oil and fuel at the reference rate, although some transactions may have taken place initially at a different
rate. With the July 13 exchange rate realignment, importers are now able to obtain FX from the formal
market and all transactions under the window are now taking place at the reference rate, which has been
within 2 percent of parallel market rates since July 13.

Box 3. A Scenario Analysis of the Myanmar Economy
This box provides comparisons between the baseline, an adjustment scenario, and an adverse
scenario. The comparisons illustrate possible macroeconomic outcomes through macro-financial linkages.
The baseline assumes a rising fiscal deficit that is in large part financed through issuance of government
securities, and a slight tightening of monetary conditions, which lead to continued rapid credit growth and
rising inflation. Import demand remains strong and the current account deficit widens further, with reserve
coverage falling from the previous year, albeit moderately (Table below). While the economic situation is
likely to improve gradually over the medium term, it is vulnerable to internal and external shocks.



The adjustment scenario assumes that policy action is taken to mitigate the risks outlined above.
Monetary policy is tightened by outright elimination of CBM’s deficit financing in 2015/16, which implies
that the government will substantially scale up T-bill auctions to meet its full financing needs. At the
same time, prudential standards are more vigorously enforced. As a result, reserve money and credit
growth is slower, and inflation pressure is eased. Fiscal policy is also tightened through containing
transfers to sub-national governments, reducing low-priority spending, broadening the tax base on the
commercial tax, and cutting tax incentives. Collectively, these measures help boost investor confidence,
increase FDI inflows (which helps offset some of the contractionary effect of policy tightening), reduce
the current account deficit, and boost foreign reserves.



The adverse scenario provides a stress test of how certain shocks could affect the economy. It is
assumed that the gas price and production decline by 15 percent and 5 percent, respectively, relative to
the baseline, and political uncertainty related to the elections and easy monetary condition dents
business confidence, resulting in lower FDI and other investment. On the fiscal front, revenue is lower
than expected due to glitches in the newly introduced self-assessment of income taxes, and spending is
higher due to political pressure. The resulting increase in the fiscal deficit is financed by the CBM,
leading to more rapid growth in reserve money and private sector credit, and ultimately higher inflation,
a further widening of the current account deficit, and lower foreign reserves. As banks are awash with
liquidity, lending standards deteriorate, feeding back to credit growth (as reflected in the rising money
multiplier). Ultimately, these lead to slower economic growth and greater vulnerabilities.

Box 4. State-Owned and Policy Banks in Myanmar
Ongoing economic transformation is reducing the
dominance once enjoyed by state-owned banks
(SOBs). Total banking sector assets have increased by
10 percent of GDP over the past two years, reaching
58½ percent of GDP at end February 2015. Assets
owned by private banks now account for half of the
total, up by 12½ percentage points, whereas SOB assets
amount to 29½ percent of GDP, a decline of
2½ percentage points.

advances to the private sector by private banks
increased by more than twofold over the past two years, now accounting for 14 percent of GDP. At the same
time, SOB lending to the private sector has increased much less rapidly and now accounts for a
disproportionately small share in lending to the private sector (2½ percent of GDP). Myanmar Economic Bank,
for example, has a large deposit base (5¼ percent of GDP), but its loans to the private sector account for only
about 15 percent of its deposits. SOBs have also shifted their asset holdings to government securities.
A number of policy banks have been established in recent years, raising concerns over contingent
liabilities for the government. These banks tend to be sponsored by a line ministry with private sector
contributions and have a narrow sectoral focus for lending (e.g., tourism or construction). Like commercial
banks, the policy banks take deposits and extend loans at

The government is in the process of formulating a
reform strategy for SOBs and this will affect policy
banks as well. This work is supported by the World Bank
through comprehensive diagnostic studies of SOBs, with
two finished already. The enactment of the Banks and
Financial Institutions Act will provide a new regulatory
framework for SOBs and policy banks, which will be
required to reapply for licenses, providing an opportunity
to eliminate regulatory arbitrage by policy banks. Staff has
in the past recommended to consolidate SOBs and policy
banks into a couple of policy banks.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The kyat had been pegged to the SDR at K 8.5057 per SDR since May 2, 1977. On April 1, 2012, the
authorities replaced the official peg to the SDR with a managed float. The Central Bank of Myanmar
(CBM) started daily two-way multiple-price foreign currency auctions with technical assistance (TA)
provided by Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). The auctions provide a mechanism
for the market to determine an exchange rate that the CBM can use to set its new reference rate.
However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene to moderate excessive exchange rate volatility in
the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat
exchange rate or its trading range, and expects the kyat exchange rate to fluctuate according to
supply and demand in the market. The de jure exchange rate arrangement was reclassified as
managed float, and the de facto exchange rate regime is classified as other managed arrangement.
Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has
eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar has made significant progress toward satisfying
Article VIII obligations. Almost all current account restrictions have been removed through the
implementation of the 2012 Foreign Exchange Management Law. However, Myanmar still maintains
exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII. Exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction arise from (i) requirement of tax
certification for authorizing transfers of net investment income abroad, and (ii) limitations on the
remittance abroad of net salaries. The MCP arises from the two-way, multi-price foreign currency
auction, and the authorities have sought a further IMF approval of the retention of this MCP. The
Foreign Exchange Management Regulations were issued on September 30, 2014, as planned.
Article IV Consultation
Myanmar is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were conducted on June 4–17, 2014 in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. The Executive Board
concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation on September 24, 2014.
Technical Assistance
Myanmar is now one of the largest recipients of IMF technical assistance (TA). Delivery is through a
mix of resident advisors; experts in the Bangkok-based Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R.
and Myanmar (TAOLAM) and short-term HQ and expert missions. The key areas of focus are:


Central Banking: a resident foreign exchange advisor and a monetary operations advisor based
in TAOLAM provide frequent responsive advice, supported by HQ missions. In addition regular
expert missions are conducted in order to assist the CBM strengthen its accounting framework
and systems.



Financial Sector Supervision: work in this area is led by a resident advisor in Yangon supported
by HQ and expert missions, including on AML/CFT.



Revenue Reform: a resident tax administration advisor is supported by HQ and expert missions
aimed at modernizing the Internal Revenue Department (IRD). Work on tax policy is delivered
through HQ missions.



Public Financial Management: the focus is on capacity development of the Treasury Department,
following its establishment in October 2014, which is led by an advisor based in TAOLAM and
supported by HQ and expert missions.



Statistics: the work plan in this area has been developed following a multi-sector diagnostic
mission in 2013. As a result, external sector and government finance statistics advisors have
taken up duties in TAOLAM and expert visits continue to assist in the development of price
statistics. A rebased CPI is scheduled to be released in 2015/16.



Macroeconomic Analysis: an advisor based in TAOLAM leads the work in this area that is closely
integrated with the broader IMF training program.

In all areas the IMF coordinates closely with other development partners. In the financial sector, the
IMF team has assisted the Central Bank of Myanmar develop a framework for coordination of
international technical assistance.

The Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar (TAOLAM)
The IMF opened TAOLAM in Bangkok in October 2012. The new office has been providing IMF
technical assistance and training, in collaboration with the Bank of Thailand and the Government of
Japan. There are currently five TA advisors in the office, covering public financial management,
monetary operations, macroeconomics training, government financial statistics, and external sector
statistics, for both Lao P.D. R. and Myanmar. Mr. David Cowen will head the office after the
completion of assignment by Ms. Susan Creane in July 2015.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(July 2015)
The Fund and the Bank country teams for Myanmar, led by Mr. Yang (International Monetary
Fund, IMF) and by Mr. Zachau (World Bank Group, WBG), maintain excellent working relations
and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues.
The level of cooperation and coordination is excellent, and is becoming more regular as both
institutions have been scaling up their engagement in Myanmar. Staffs routinely share country
documents prepared by both institutions for their respective Executive Boards and collaborate
regularly in areas of mutual interest.
Following the clearance of arrears to the International Development Association (IDA) in
January 2013, the Bank has resumed normal lending relations with Myanmar and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) commenced its investment and advisory activities. A
pre-arrears clearance IDA grant to finance a National community Driven Development Project
preceded an initial Development Policy Operation in support of a program around macroeconomic
stability and arrears clearance. Since then, four IDA financed projects have been approved by the
Executive Board of Directors in electricity, telecommunications, public financial management, and
education. The IFC has made investments in microfinance, hospitality and banking sector through
the Global Trade Finance Program Facility. There are four IDA credit operations in the pipeline for
delivery within the next 12 months: on health, agriculture, integrated river basin management, and
electricity (guarantee for Independent Power Producer). IFC is developing its pipeline of investments
in several sectors. The WBG has also significantly scaled up its analytical and advisory services.
Following the completion of the 2013 Staff Monitored Program, the IMF is continuing to
provide intensive policy advice and technical assistance to Myanmar. On the surveillance side,
annual Article IV consultations are supplemented with regular staff visits and frequent engagement
through the resident representative office which was opened in 2013. Technical Assistance continues
to intensify with two (three up to end July) resident advisors in Myanmar and five in the Bangkokbased TAOLAM alongside regular HQ-missions. Key TA priorities include development of monetary
and exchange rate policy tools, enhancing bank supervision, strengthening tax policy and
administration, enhancing budget preparation and execution, strengthening macro policy analysis
and developing macroeconomic statistics. The Fund also has a wide-ranging training program for
Myanmar.
There is strong collaboration between the WBG and IMF.


Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. Representatives from the WB participate in
discussions during IMF Article IV missions to Myanmar. They also jointly carry out the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In this context, staffs from both institutions discuss
macroeconomic policies and the main messages to the authorities. Discussions with the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development were initiated recently on joint TA
for real sector monitoring.


In the financial sector the World Bank and IMF have been coordinating technical assistance
through regular information sharing based on an earlier joint note on IMF-WB Financial Sector
TA Plan for Myanmar. World Bank TA has focused on strengthening the financial sector legal
and regulatory framework (including technical input on the Banks and Financial Institutions
Law, and microfinance and insurance regulation and supervision); state-owned bank reform,
through completion of diagnostics of the four main state-owned banks; regulatory framework
for mobile financial services; and development of a Financial Sector Development Strategy.



On fiscal management, the World Bank and the Fund have collaborated on producing a
macro-fiscal analysis for the recently completed Public Expenditure Review; coordinating TA to
the Large Taxpayers’ Office in its efforts to introduce a risk-based audit system; coordinating
TA to the Treasury Department and the Myanmar Economic Bank on strengthening of the
payment and settlement system; coordinating TA on debt sustainability analysis; and
coordinating policy dialogue through participation in the PFM sector working group.



On structural reforms during the process of the preparation of the Myanmar Investment Law,
the WBG has consulted frequently with the IMF on many provisions, in particular on issues
related to capital and current account transfers and taxation. The IMF provided written
comments on the 1st and 2nd drafts of the Investment Law to the IFC and the government.



On statistics, there has been good ongoing collaboration including a joint IMF-ADB-WB
mission to Myanmar under the auspices of the National Strategy for the Development of
Statistics (NSDS) project to coordinate support and advice to the government. The IMF is
primarily providing TA to government finance statistics (Ministry of Finance), balance of
payments (Central Bank of Myanmar), prices (Central Statistical Organization) and monetary
statistics/central bank balance sheets. The ADB is providing TA on the SNA compilation
framework. The World Bank is currently focusing support to overall statistical strategy
development, institutional reform, and poverty monitoring.

Based on the above partnership, the World Bank and the Fund share a common view about
Myanmar’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. Important reform priorities include:


Promoting long-term growth and diversification. Modernizing Myanmar’s economy will
require removing impediments to growth by enhancing the business and investment climate,
encouraging financial sector development, and further liberalizing trade and foreign direct
investment. The government’s Framework for Economic and Social Reform would benefit from
coordination across government agencies, broader consultation with stakeholders, and
lessons from other countries’ experiences through substantial capacity building efforts.



Macroeconomic stability. Sustainable and inclusive growth will require macroeconomic
stability, which must be underpinned by a consistent macroeconomic policy mix.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

Macroeconomic imbalances in Myanmar have increased over the past year as seen in rising
inflation and higher current account and fiscal deficits. These imbalances need to be
addressed by a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate flexibility.


Foreign exchange policy. The authorities have come a long way in liberalizing the foreign
exchange regime, including the re-unification of multiple exchange rates and the introduction
of a daily FX auction in 2012. Foreign Exchange Management Regulations have been issued by
the CBM. However, important work remains ahead, including finalizing and parliamentary
approval of the Investment Law, which will replace the Foreign Investment Law and the
Myanmar Citizens Investment Law. Deepening the foreign exchange market will require strong
commitment by the CBM to follow the FX auction rules under the managed floating regime
and further development of the interbank foreign exchange market.



Monetary policy. Strengthening the CBM’s capacity to conduct monetary policy is a critical
prerequisite for macroeconomic management. To this end, the authorities need to ensure the
CBM is granted full budgetary autonomy with a strengthened balance sheet and improved
accounting systems. Continued attention to building tools and capacity for monetary policy is
required. Priorities include regularly conducting basic open market operations, reforming
reserve requirements, and refining the reserve money forecasting and targeting framework.



Financial sector. Liberalization of the financial sector needs to be complemented with a
stronger regulatory and supervisory framework to maintain financial stability. Changes should
be implemented step by step, in line with the development of needed supervisory capability
and banks’ capacity. For instance, developing money markets and improving banks’ risk
management are necessary precursors to liberalization of lending rates and maturities. The
new Banks and Financial Institutions Law, drafted based on close collaboration of the WB and
the Fund, will help set the sector on a modern footing. It will require the development and
enforcement of modernized prudential regulations, including on bank capital, nonperforming
loans, connected lending, and large exposures. This has become particularly urgent given the
entry of foreign banks, which will also require regulations on foreign exchange lending, and
revised regulations on capital flows and net open positions. The IMF and World Bank teams
will work closely with the authorities in the coming months. Other priorities include
developing a plan to reform the state-owned banks, establishing appropriate regulation of
nonbank financial institutions, enhancing financial inclusion, modernizing financial
infrastructure including the payments system and a credit bureau, and allowing banks to
provide trade finance based on documentary collection.



Fiscal discipline and sustainability: Myanmar faces considerable fiscal pressures due to
significant spending needs on the one hand and a narrow revenue base on the other. The
increased in the budget deficit this year highlights the importance of maintaining fiscal
discipline. Priorities include: (i) strengthened revenue collection, including through collection
of the commercial tax on telecommunication services, more transparent management of
natural resource rents, and rationalization of tax exemptions; (ii) strengthened debt
management, including preparation of a debt strategy that explicitly reviews the costs and

risks of borrowing decisions; (iii) control in growth of the wage bill by linking any future
changes to fiscal sustainability and civil service performance considerations; and (iv) continued
efforts at promoting fiscal transparency.


Prioritizing fiscal policies toward social and infrastructure spending. Continued increases
in budgetary allocations towards health and education are welcome. There is still room for
reallocating further resources to social sectors where spending levels remain relatively low.
Further room remains also for increased efficiency in spending on infrastructure which is
currently in a poor state and negatively affecting the business climate.



Strengthening statistical capacity. The Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development has outlined six priority areas for statistical development: (i) modernizing the
system of national accounts by adopting the SNA 2008 framework and improving source data;
(ii) strengthening the monitoring of poverty and living conditions; (iii) revising and updating
the Central Statistical Authority Act 1952; (iv) developing and adopting a National Strategy for
Development of Statistics; (v) establishing inter-agency statistical clusters to improve
coordination and collaboration on statistical issues; (vi) strengthen capacity of Central
Statistics Organization including through staffing and budget allocations.
These are very sensible priorities, which will need to be implemented in a prioritized and
sequenced manner. In the short term the government aims to implement SNA 2008 (today
they broadly follow SNA 1968). This implies developing complementary data systems to
produce the minimum required data sets and constructing a Supply-Use Table (SUT). The ADB
is providing TA on the compilation framework/SUT and IMF is providing TA to selected
sectors.
WB is in discussions with the government on financial and technical support for a new
household survey. Besides information on poverty and household living conditions, a new
household survey will be an important source of data on the household final consumption for
the SUT.



Private Sector Development. To enhance investment (especially FDI) reforms are needed to
streamline procedures around funds transfers, including the inflow and repatriate of profits
and capital. The Investment Law ensures the rights for funds transfer, but there is a great deal
of uncertainty in regard to the procedures and time required for funds transfers to be
approved by the CBM.
The teams are committed to continue their close cooperation going forward. The table
below details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period
June 2015–May 2016.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(July 2015)
Myanmar became a member of the World Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, IDA in 1962, and MIGA in 2013.
By 1987, the Bank’s total portfolio amounted to US$804 million equivalent, of which US$752.8 million
equivalent had been disbursed. New lending ceased after 1987. The last formal Consultative Group
meeting was held in January 1986 in Tokyo, chaired by the World Bank.
Myanmar went into arrears with the World Bank in January 1998 and subsequently into nonaccrual
status in September 1998. All credits that had been approved but which had not fully disbursed were
cancelled and Myanmar was not eligible for new loans. The World Bank’s engagement with Myanmar
became limited to monitoring economic and social developments in the country.
Relations between Myanmar and the World Bank were recently normalized. The World Bank provided a
US$80 million grant in 2012 for a Community Driven Development Project. The Government of
Myanmar cleared the full amount of its arrears to the World Bank in January 2013, in the amount of
US$420 million through a bridge loan from the Government of Japan. The World Bank resumed lending
to support Myanmar’s foreign exchange needs, including those associated with IDA arrears clearance.
The World Bank opened its first ever country office in Myanmar on August 1, 2012. Initial engagement
with Myanmar was guided by an Interim Strategy Note (FY13–14). This was followed by a Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD) that identified priorities for accelerating progress towards the twin goals that
the WBG has committed to helping attain in its member countries: ending poverty and boosting shared
prosperity.
The SCD provided the basis for a Country Partnership Framework (CPF), the first full country strategy for
Myanmar since 1984. The CPF program, which runs from FY2015 to FY2017, has three areas of focus:
reducing rural poverty; investing in people and effective institutions for people; and supporting a
dynamic private sector to create jobs.
Myanmar’s provisional IDA 17 allocation is US$1.6 billion. The CPF identifies an indicative program
based on this amount, with significant frontloading. In addition, IFC expects to provide up to
US$1 billion in investments over the CPF period and US$20 million in technical assistance. MIGA will
provide insurance against political risks based on demand by private investors.
Since the approval of the pre-arrears grant to finance a National Community Driven Development
Project, seven IDA lending projects have been approved by the Executive Board of Directors in
agriculture, additional financing for the community driven development project, river basin
management, electricity, telecommunications, public financial management, health and education. IFC
has made investments in microfinance, hospitality and banking sector through the Global Trade Finance
Program Facility,
There are several WB lending projects in the pipeline for delivery within the next 12 months: on financial
inclusion, health financing, electrification, and power generation. IFC is developing its pipeline of
investments in several sectors. Apart from lending programs, the World Bank has significantly scaled up
its analytical and advisory services.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
(July 2015)
Myanmar joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and operations started the same year.
In 2012, as the international community resumed engagement with Myanmar as a result of significant
economic and political reforms, the AsDB developed a road map for resumption of normal operations.
The activities included initial assessments of the economy and of key sectors, provision of technical
assistance, and development of an interim country partnership strategy for 2012–2014.
AsDB’s interim country partnership strategy for 2012–2014 (extended to 2016) seeks to support the
government in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. It focuses on (i) building human resources
and capacities (capacity building in ministries in core areas of AsDB involvement, and education); (ii)
promoting an enabling economic environment (macroeconomic and fiscal management; and trade,
investment and financial sector reform); and (iii) creating access and connectivity (rural livelihoods and
infrastructure development, especially energy and transport). AsDB will mainstream the thematic areas
of good governance, environmental sustainability, private sector development, and regional
cooperation and integration into its operations. AsDB will focus on the crosscutting areas of knowledge
and partnerships. The AsDB Country Operations Business Plan 2014–2016 (finalized in November 2013),
laid out an investment program covering energy, transport (roads), agriculture and natural resources,
and urban development.
In 2014, AsDB commenced analytical and consultative work for a full Country Partnership Strategy,
planned for the period 2017–2021, to be submitted for Board endorsement in 2016. The Country
Partnership Strategy as well as the annual Country Operations Business Plans for 2015–2017 (finalized in
January 2015) reflect a gradual shift towards increased sector focus and selectivity, focusing on
transport, energy, and education and training as core sectors. It will apply a long-term programmatic
approach in the core sectors, and is coordinated and aligned with evolving strategies and sector
activities of other development partners.
Myanmar cleared its arrears to AsDB in January 2013. The AsDB has so far provided 35 loans totaling
US$1,246,4 million for 29 projects and one policy-based operation. Of these, two loans amounting to
US$6.6 million were from the AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR) which have already been prepaid, and 33 loans were from concessional Asian Development Fund resources. The AsDB has so far
provided technical assistance (TA) totaling US$49.0 million for 71 projects. Of these 71 TA projects,
41 were approved since AsDB reengaged with Myanmar in 2012.
With resumption of its engagement with the international community, Myanmar is an increasingly
active participant in the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). AsDB coordinates closely with the IMF, the World
Bank, the UNDP, and other development partners and is actively engaged in various sector and
thematic working groups formed by the government for aid coordination purposes.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of July 1, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Data are not
provided in a timely manner, and official and independent estimates of key macroeconomic variables differ
widely.
National Accounts: Myanmar’s national accounts broadly follow the concepts and definitions of the System
of National Accounts 1968. National accounts data are only available on an annual basis. Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is compiled at current and constant prices, by economic activity. While both production and
expenditure approaches are used, significant discrepancies exist between the two. GDP is estimated at
producer prices, instead of the internationally recommended market prices. The accuracy of the GDP in
volume measure is hampered by the weaknesses of current price value-added estimates and the lack of
relevant price indexes, such as the producer price index. Coverage of the growing private sector is incomplete
due to a lack of comprehensive annual establishment/enterprise economic surveys. National accounts
estimates do not completely account for informal sector activity. Estimates of some economic activities,
particularly in agriculture, construction, and public administration, need major improvement. Resource
constraints at the Planning Department and the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), along with the lack of
interagency coordination and a clear delineation of responsibilities, limit the conduct of surveys and other
data collection. Technical assistance (TA) is being provided by Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) to improve the national accounts and to implement the 2008 SNA.
Price Statistics: The current CPI weights are based on the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey
(HIES). The CPI does not reflect international standards and best practices due to a number of methodological
weaknesses: weights only represent urban households; some construction inputs are included; rentals of
owner-occupied housing are excluded; missing prices are not imputed; and the classification of items is
outdated. The CSO is expected to address these issues when it introduces a new CPI, with weights based on
the results of the 2012 HIES. The IMF Statistics Department (STA) has been providing TA to develop the new
CPI since March 2013. In recent months, the CSO has made significant progress in updating the CPI. The
authorities have committed to releasing an updated and improved index that more fully reflects
international standards. It is planned that the new index will be released in September 2015.
Government Finance Statistics: There is no comprehensive monthly or quarterly compilation of fiscal data.
Monthly cash-based budget execution data are available in local language, but are not published. Annual
comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to 12 months after the end of the reference year. In
addition, some transactions of state economic enterprises are recorded partly on an accrual and partly on a
cash basis. Fiscal and monetary data are not consistent. Budget estimates and actual expenditures tend to
differ by wide margins. In addition, recording of debt statistics is not comprehensive.
Myanmar is participating in a three-year program funded by the government of Japan designed to improve
government finance statistics in the Asia and Pacific Region. The next mission under the program is planned
in 2015. In addition, a long-term GFS advisor is currently stationed at the IMF's Technical Assistance Office for
the Lao PDR and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (TAOLAM) in Bangkok, Thailand, also funded by the
government of Japan, but under a separate program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

Monetary and Financial Statistics: The monetary survey compiled by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM)
covers the central bank and all commercial banks (public and private). Reporting of monetary data in the
Standardized Report Forms, which accord with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual classification
principles, was established in January 2012. Nine finance companies and a multiple of deposit taking
microfinance institutions have been established in 2013–14. In addition, nine foreign bank branches will
commence their operations in 2015. They are currently not part of the monetary survey statistics. The quality
of monetary statistics could be improved by: (i) expanding the coverage of institutions; (ii) monitoring the
consistency of the reciprocal/interbank accounts that show positions between the CBM and the commercial
banks; and initiating data review and resolution of large inconsistencies; (iii) using electronic means to capture
and share data to minimize mistakes; (iv) in due course, adopting market or fair value-based valuation of
financial instruments; and (v) reviewing the accuracy of recording of the IMF Accounts in the CBM’s balance
sheet.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities do not provide financial soundness indicators (FSI) to STA for
dissemination. The CBM is currently implementing regulatory prudential measures. Compiling FSIs for all
financial institutions and disseminating these data will be critical for effective surveillance of the financial
sector.
External sector statistics: The balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) are compiled
on the basis of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Myanmar has not yet participated
in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) or the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).
The reliability of the balance of payments and IIP is impacted by coverage gaps. Several components of the
balance of payments and IIP (e.g., some services, direct investment assets, portfolio investment assets and
liabilities, and other investment assets) are missing. There are also concerned with the quality of the data on
other aspects. The revaluation of the national currency in April 2012 has resulted in a large break in the
balance of payments and IIP series.
An STA three-year project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics in Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar started
in March 2014. Under the project, TA is provided by the external sector statistics resident advisor stationed at
the TAOLAM in Bangkok, Thailand.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Myanmar began participating in the IMF’s General
Data Dissemination System in November 2013.
No data ROSC is available.

Myanmar submits data to STA with a lag of two to six
months. Quarterly balance of payments and IIP data are
reported on an annual basis for the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook. No fiscal data are reported
to STA for publication in the IFS. Annual data on the
operations of the consolidated central government were
last reported for 2005 to STA for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, but do not
include an economic classification of expenditure.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATIONS—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

August 14, 2015

Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared By
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

Myanmar is assessed to remain at low risk of debt distress.123 Under the baseline scenario,
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt burden indicators remain well below
their indicative thresholds. Similarly, total public debt will also remain below the
benchmark, even as it will rise over the long term. While Myanmar’s risk of debt distress is
characterized as low, it requires close monitoring, in particular because there is potential
for both domestic and external downside risks to materialize that may adversely affect the
level of debt. On the domestic front these risks include fiscal slippages from the
authorities’ current target of below 5 percent of GDP and lower growth. On the external
side, shocks include further declines in gas prices and depreciation of the kyat. While these
shocks do not lead to breaches of the indicative thresholds or benchmarks in the medium
term,4 keeping a low risk of debt distress will require prudent fiscal policy, sound public
financial management and increasing use of concessional finance while limiting
nonconcessional borrowing to viable and growth-enhancing projects.

1

External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt and public domestic debt dynamics are assessed using
the LIC DSA framework, which recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to manage
higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. The quality of a country’s policies
and institutions are normally measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA). The most conservative thresholds are applied for the purposes of this DSA based on the average CPIA
index of the last two years which indicate a weak rating.
2
The DSA was jointly prepared by the IMF and the World Bank.
3
This risk rating is unchanged from the previous DSA which had incorporated the resolution of the external
arrears with the Paris Club, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
4
These are standard shock scenarios in the DSA template.

MYANMAR

BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard LIC DSA
framework. The DSA framework presents the projected path of Myanmar’s external and public sector debt
burden indicators, and draws conclusions on the sustainability of debt.
2.
The underlying macroeconomic assumptions remain broadly unchanged compared with the
last DSA but updates have been made taking into account several changes in both the external and
domestic environment since the last Article IV consultation. Main changes in the estimates and
projections are below:

5



In 2014/15, the real GDP growth was 8.5 percent reflecting robust investment in productive sectors
including manufacturing and services, particularly in telecommunications. It is expected that the
average medium-term GDP growth rate will remain strong at 8.1 percent as production in the
special export zones also picks up. Accordingly, growth has been revised slightly upward over the
longer term, taking into account that many of these new investment projects could help raise longterm growth.56



Inflation in 2014/15 increased to over 7.5 percent (end of period) and is projected to be higher in
the medium term compared to the last DSA mainly due to expected kyat depreciation and higher
inflationary expectations. However, it will converge back to the almost the same long-term trend as
in the previous DSA.



In 2014/15, the fiscal deficit was 2.9 percent of GDP, benefiting from considerable windfall gains
from telecommunications and oil and gas licenses (which will be spread over a few years). In the
medium term, the fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 4.5 percent of GDP due to structural
increases in expenditure, including in the public sector wage bill. Revenues, however, have been
revised downward both in the medium and long-term due to lower projected State-owned
Economic Enterprises’ (SEEs) revenues. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to 4.2 percent
of GDP in the long-term.



The current account deficit widened in 2014/15, driven primarily by an increase in import demand.
Given the downward revision in gas prices (expected to be 20 percent lower in 2015/16 compared
with 2014/15), it is expected that the current account deficit will widen significantly in the mediumterm compared to the last DSA.

The staff of the World Bank and the IMF, while strong supporters of the overall reform effort, reserve some caution given the

newness of the reform program. In addition, there are possible downside risks stemming from the international environment.
6

The long-term growth projections were also underpinned by growth diagnostics conducted by IMF staff f in 2014/15
DSA which based projections on age-specific population growth and sectoral level productivity based on the
experience of similar countries. The final results were based on consultation with the World Bank.

3.
As in the previous DSA, this analysis incorporates the resolution of Myanmar’s arrears with
its multilateral and bilateral creditors completed in 2013/14. In late-January 2013, the Paris Club
reached an agreement with the Myanmar authorities on a debt treatment to be completed in early 2014.
Paris Club members agreed to write off 50 percent of all arrears and reschedule the remaining arrears
over 15 years with a 7-year grace period. The treatment was phased, with 25 percent of the write-off
occurring immediately and 75 percent on the successful completion of a staff-monitored program with the
IMF. Furthermore, Myanmar resolved its arrears to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in
January 2013, with the help of bridge financing from Japan.
4.
Myanmar is also expected to gradually reduce its reliance on external nonconcessional
financing over the medium term, as assumed in the previous DSA. With the resolution of its arrears and
the re-engagement with traditional donors, Myanmar is expected to gradually regain access to concessional
resources. In particular, after the resolution of arrears with its multilateral creditors (the World Bank and the
Asian development Bank), Myanmar has begun to receive concessional financing from these two
institutions. Myanmar’s current largest bilateral creditors are Japan and China. It is expected that as the Paris
Club donors re-engage with Myanmar, and gradually identify suitable projects, the share of
nonconcessional financing will decline over the medium term. The average new disbursements from the
non-Paris Club members in the past few years were around 90 percent of total disbursements. We assume
that this number will decrease by more than 50 percent in the medium-term, but it will gradually increase
over the long-term as Myanmar becomes more developed and will be able to access financial markets.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
5.

Recent developments have kept the stock of external debt at relatively low levels.


The resolution of the arrears in 2013/14 after the successful completion of the Staff Monitored
Program had helped reduce the external debt stock (this was also incorporated in the last DSA);



Furthermore, the valuation effect of recent exchange rate changes has resulted in a reduction
of the stock of external debt at end 2014/15.7



Finally, there has been only modest external borrowing in 2014/15.

7

The kyat (reference rate) appreciated against a basket of currencies in which Myanmar’s external debt is
denominated.

MYANMAR

6.
Debt sustainability analysis shows that public and publically guaranteed external debt will
remain well below the indicative thresholds throughout the project period. Several of the standard
stress tests reflect downside risks currently faced by Myanmar. In particular, these include a reduction in the
value of exports (in Myanmar this may be caused by a further drop in gas price), and a depreciation of the
exchange rate. Although the standard stress tests indicate that no thresholds will be breached,8 there can be
an increase in debt service (for example, a one-time depreciation increases the debt service to revenue ratio
in Figure f in the Panel Chart 1a). It will, therefore, be important to exercise prudence in external borrowing
in a volatile international environment where exchange rate changes can have a large impact –either
positive or negative – on the debt burden. Furthermore, continued strong performance of the external
sector is critical, including by maintaining high export growth in manufacturing and agriculture, in addition
to gas, attracting FDI to fund investment projects and obtaining more concessional financing.
7.
Total public sector debt will also remain below the indicative benchmark under the baseline
scenario but is vulnerable to shocks. The present value of total public debt as a percentage of GDP
remains below the indicative benchmark throughout the projection period but it continues to rise over the
long-term. This trajectory reflects the significant development needs of Myanmar and the associated overall
fiscal deficits assumed in the baseline scenario. This level of debt can give rise to vulnerabilities including a
high debt service burden. Overall, the standard stress tests show that public debt sustainability is vulnerable
to lower real GDP growth and fiscal slippages.9 Risks are somewhat mitigated as the authorities aim to use
their borrowing to only finance economically viable projects in priority sectors. The authorities plan to keep
the fiscal deficit below 5 percent of GDP in the medium term. Based on DSA simulations, however, staff
advised the authorities to lower the deficit target to 4½ percent, which would help keep public debt below
the indicative benchmark in the long run. The authorities’ 5 percent target could lead to a breach of the
benchmark in the long run.
8.
Myanmar will need to maintain fiscal discipline to ensure debt sustainability. Public finances
are dependent on natural resource revenues. Tax revenues are very low and the tax base remains narrow, in
part due to widespread exemptions. In addition, transfers to sub-national governments without devolving
spending responsibilities will increase the overall public sector deficit. It is expected that in 2015/16, the
balance of the aggregate SEEs will turn negative underscoring the need to implement reforms that increase
SEEs efficiency. Furthermore, only prudent borrowing by the policy banks10 should be allowed as guarantees
for the policy banks could pose risks to debt control and complicate fiscal management. It is imperative to
improve the collection of statistics on these institutions.
9.
Fiscal risks can be mitigated by taking several steps, some of which are already under
consideration by the authorities. Higher revenue is needed to provide a solid foundation for financing
development. To this end, introducing a value added tax (VAT) and reducing tax incentives are key steps.
Fiscal decentralization and reforms of SEEs finances need to be carefully planned and implemented to
8

The typical historical scenario is not shown in this analysis. In the case of Myanmar, the historical scenario would
imply an unlikely return to pre-reform policies: low noninterest current account deficits (consistent with binding
international sanctions) and sustained real exchange rate pressures.
9
In the present value of total public debt to GDP ratio, the most extreme shock is the growth shock which causes a
breach in the indicative benchmark in 2023/34 while fixing the primary balance causes a breach in 2033/34.

safeguard fiscal sustainability. Proper use of windfall revenues—such as those from oil and gas
exploration—can also help strong the fiscal position, especially in the context of a medium-term fiscal
framework.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
10.
Myanmar is assessed to be at low risk of debt distress, but prudent macroeconomic policies
and sound debt management will be required to keep debt sustainable. Under the baseline scenario,
all indicators for the external debt are below their indicative thresholds and standard stress tests show that
shocks will not cause breaches although shocks such as a one-time depreciation can cause debt service
(expressed as a ratio of revenue) to increase. Under the baseline scenario, the total public debt also remains
below the benchmark although it rises throughout the projection period and is vulnerable to fiscal slippages
and low real GDP growth. Preventing total public debt vulnerability from increasing will require prudent
fiscal policy, improvements in revenue performance and public financial management, limiting contingent
liabilities by improving the performance of SEEs as well as prudent borrowing by policy banks, and
increasing use of concessional finance.
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with these conclusions and with the thrust of the analysis.
They concurred with staff on the need to be cautious on nonconcessional borrowing and reconfirmed their
intention to use nonconcessional external borrowing only to finance economically viable projects in priority
sectors, at levels consistent with low risk of debt distress. In order to limit the use of nonconcessional
financing, the authorities reiterated their aim to keep the fiscal deficit below 5 percent of GDP over the
medium term.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared by

Asia and Pacific Department

1. This supplement provides preliminary information on the impact of the recent floods in
Myanmar since the staff report was finalized in early August. Staff’s assessment is that in the
short term the fiscal and current account deficits are likely to be higher, and overall growth this year
weaker than previously projected, which may warrant a modest adjustment to the timing and pace
at which some of the staff’s policy recommendations should be implemented. Paragraph 4 of this
supplement forms part of the staff’s assessment of the recent developments, and paragraphs 5 and
6 outline the possible recalibration of some of the policy recommendations in the staff appraisal.
2. Floods triggered by monsoon rains together with Cyclone Komen have caused major
casualties and damages since July. As of mid-August, the floods and associated landslides
killed 117 people and affected more than 1 million people (Myanmar’s population is estimated to
be around 51 million). About 1.4 million acres of farmland are reportedly affected by flooding with
about half of the affected totally damaged (around 3 percent of the estimated total sown area), and
over 16,000 homes and 3,000 school buildings have been damaged by floods. The authorities are
working on preliminary estimates of damages and losses, but it will take some time before an
official comprehensive assessment of damages and losses can be completed. Nevertheless, the total
damages and losses are expected to be significant. The authorities have requested World Bank
assistance to carry out a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA).
3. A state of emergency has been declared in the four worst-hit states and regions in the
west of the country and the government has appealed for international assistance. Food,
shelter, clean water and sanitation are in immediate need. The authorities have set up a National
Natural Disaster Management Committee headed by a Vice President. Apart from immediate
disaster relief, the government is organizing the distribution of seeds and providing support to the
use of farm equipment for replanting. Repair of infrastructure, such as bridges and railroads, is
already under way. A number of development partners have provided immediate disaster relief and
humanitarian assistance. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank plan to tap into their
emergency assistance facilities, as well as to bring forward disbursement of some of the existing
resources allocated for Myanmar, to assist the country’s recovery and reconstruction efforts. The
authorities intend to request Fund assistance under the Rapid Credit Facility.

MYANMAR

4. While an accurate assessment will require a PDNA, staff expects the floods to add
significant short-term pressure on inflation, government spending, and the external position.
Some food prices have already experienced a spike, and it is expected that inflation will rise further
from already elevated levels. Apart from an increase in spending in the immediate aftermath of the
disaster, additional public resources will be needed for recovery and reconstruction through the
next fiscal year. The increased spending will contribute to the already rapid growth of imports, and
together with the reduced exports of crops, the balance of payments situation is likely to worsen
compared with staff’s baseline projections. On the other hand, the impact on the private banking
sector is expected to be limited, as commercial banks in Myanmar have limited exposure to the
agricultural sector, which appears to have borne the brunt of the disaster impact, although some
businesses in urban areas may also have been affected by the floods. State-owned banks will likely
be more affected as they are more involved in lending to the agricultural sector – losses here will
impact on the fiscal position via a deterioration of the state economic enterprise sector balance.
5. The expected impact of the floods may affect the timing of fiscal consolidation. The
authorities should continue to aim for an early phase-out of CBM financing of the fiscal deficit and
scale up Treasury bill auctions, but a temporarily larger fiscal deficit in this and next fiscal year,
commensurate with the additional resources needed for recovery and reconstruction, should be
accommodated. To the extent that at least part of the additional spending needs will be covered by
external assistance, the inflationary impact of moderately higher fiscal deficits will be limited, but a
more decisive fiscal consolidation may be necessary in the outer years to preserve the fiscal target
and debt sustainability. To this end, the authorities should also aim for grants and concessional
loans in seeking external assistance. If external assistance falls short of the need, the authorities
should consider further reprioritizing expenditure to protect spending targeted at the vulnerable
and poor.
6. On the monetary front, some short-term adjustment to the monetary policy stance may
be required. The early October target for the full implementation of the recalibrated reserve
requirement should be maintained, but the CBM may need to adjust the timing of sterilization
operations if pressures on liquidity begin to appear. The CBM’s discount window could also be used
to meet temporary increases in liquidity demand. However, the CBM should be prepared to resume
tightening the monetary stance through increasing the reserve requirement and scaling up deposit
auctions if there are signs of a long-lasting effect of higher food prices on aggregate inflation. Staff
continues to advise the authorities to maintain exchange rate flexibility, which would help mitigate
the impact of the floods on the external position and facilitate economic recovery.

Statement by Ms. Pornvipa Tangcharoenmonkong, Alternate Executive Director
and Ms. Nwe Ni Tun, Advisor to the Executive Director
August 28, 2015
Introduction
1.
On behalf of the Myanmar authorities, we would like to express our deep
appreciation to Mr. Yongzheng Yang and his team for the productive discussions during
the 2015 Article IV Consultation and for their comprehensive set of reports.
2.
The authorities highly value the Fund’s constructive policy advice and technical
assistance which significantly complements and contributes to Myanmar’s ongoing
economic reform agenda. While Myanmar has made substantial achievements in most
areas of the economic reform program, the authorities recognize the need to further
accelerate the ongoing reform process. The authorities broadly agree with staff's
recommendations and recognize the importance of sustaining economic and structural
reforms through creating fiscal space to boost public investment, strengthening banking
regulation and supervision to maintain financial stability, and improving the business
environment to support inclusive growth. Our authorities broadly concur with the staff
appraisal and remain fully committed to the economic reform process.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
3.
In line with the objectives under the Framework for Economic and Social Reform
(FESR)1, Myanmar has continued its growth momentum over the years. In fiscal year2
(FY) 2014/15 – the fourth year of the authorities’ Five-Year National Development Plan
(Five-Year Plan) - real GDP growth is estimated to grow at 8.5 percent3, similar to
8.4 percent recorded in FY 2013/2014. The services and other sector is the largest
contributor to GDP, with a share of 37.7 percent, followed by the industry sector
(34.4 percent), and the agricultural, livestock, fishery and forestry sector (27.9 percent).
The average CPI inflation, which increased slightly to 5.9 percent in FY 2014/15
(FY 2013/14: 5.7 percent), is expected to rise further as a result of strong domestic
demand from expansionary fiscal policy and rapid growth in private sector credit. The
severe flooding in several parts of Myanmar in July which has affected about 1.3 million
people and destroyed large areas of rice fields could pose an upside risk to inflation in
FY 2015/16.

The Framework for Economic and Social Reform (FESR) was developed to set the government’s policy
priorities for 2012- 2015 in order to achieve the long-term goals of the 20-year National Comprehensive
Development Plan 2011-2031.
2
The fiscal year (FY) starts April 1and ends March 31.

Staff’s estimation.

2
4.
The current account deficit is estimated to widen to around 6 percent of GDP in
FY 2014/15 (FY 2013/14: 5 percent of GDP) due mainly to the higher trade deficit,
reflecting strong import growth. Gross international reserves held by the Central Bank of
Myanmar (CBM) increased to US$ 5.12 billion, which is sufficient to finance about three
months of imports.
5.
Credit to the private sector is estimated to expand by 35.5 percent in FY 2014/15
(FY 2013/14: 52.5 percent), in light of increased government expenditure and better
access to credit by the private sector, increased business opportunities, and the
development of credit facilities to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
6.
The authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s assessment on the economic
outlook. Medium-to long-term growth prospects remain favorable. However, the
authorities’ real GDP growth estimate for FY 2014/15 and projection for FY 2015/16 are
9.1 percent and 9.3 percent respectively, slightly higher than staff’s projections. For
FY 2015/16, the authorities expect to achieve a higher growth rate in the agriculture,
livestock and fishery, energy, construction and transportation sectors, which are likely to
receive a boost from reform measures that were implemented over the first four years of
Myanmar’s Five-Year Plan. Notably, reform measures targeted improvements in
electricity and water supply, job creation and development in agriculture, tourism, trade
and investment, and the financial sector.
Fiscal Policy
7.
In line with the policy priorities and objectives of the FESR – a credible,
responsive and transparent planning and budget process – the medium term fiscal
framework for FY 2015/16 to 2017/18 has been laid out in order to achieve higher budget
credibility, enhance fiscal discipline and improve strategic resource allocation.
8.
The authorities have gradually tightened fiscal policy and remain committed to
reducing central bank deficit financing. The authorities will ensure fiscal sustainability
through greater revenue mobilization and expenditure re-prioritization. In addition, the
government continues to scrutinize wage and salary increases and reduce non-productive
expenditure.
9.
The authorities are committed to the Public Finance Management (PFM) reform
to strengthen budget formulation and fiscal discipline, control expenditure, as well as
improve fiscal accounting and reporting processes. The authorities continue to focus on
maintaining fiscal discipline in order to ensure debt sustainability and create the fiscal
space needed. With the assistance of the World Bank and other development partners, the
Myanmar Modernization of Public Finance Management Project is being implemented to

3
support efficient, accountable and responsive delivery of public services through
Myanmar’s PFM systems as well as to strengthen institutional capacity.
10.
In order to develop cash and debt management operations, the authorities have
established the Treasury Department under the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The Treasury
bill auction was introduced in January 2015 to reduce central bank deficit financing and
to access financial resources of the private sector. To develop a more effective market
with market-determined interest rates and sufficient volume of bids, the authorities plan
to issue Treasury bills with different maturities, on top of the existing 3-month bill, lower
the minimum face amount of bids, and switch from single to multiple pricing auctions for
government securities.
11.
Under the fiscal reform program, the authorities have underscored the importance
of increasing tax revenue by broadening the tax base and improving tax administration.
Continuous efforts have been made to introduce the value-added tax and property tax,
simplify the tax system, develop the legal and administrative framework, and implement
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)4. Thus far, the establishment of
the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO) in 2014 has been effective in improving tax
compliance and tax administration while the ongoing Internal Revenue Department (IRD)
reform program will continue to help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
IRD and move it closer to international standards of tax administration.
12.
On the expenditure side, the authorities will prioritize infrastructure development,
socio-economic development, rural development and poverty alleviation. The authorities
are committed to ensure the efficiency of spending in these priority areas.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
13.
The authorities have made significant progress in the area of monetary and
exchange rate policies, including moving towards a managed float exchange rate system,
enacting the new Central Bank Law, and introducing the deposit auction and Treasury
bill auction after the CBM was granted its autonomy in July, 2013.
14.
The authorities concur with staff's recommendations in various areas regarding
the monetary sector. The authorities recognize the risk of increasing inflation as a result
of rapid credit growth to the private sector and expansion of government expenditure.
Accordingly, the authorities continue to maintain a tight monetary policy stance in line
with the monetary target which is reviewed frequently. Substantial progress has also been
made in improving the liquidity management framework. The deposit auction introduced
in 2013 allows market driven interest rates and more terms of deposits with greater
participation by commercial banks and greater flexibility for the CBM to target specific
4

4
types of banks in the deposit auctions. In addition, the authorities have also introduced a
new reserve requirement for banks and financial institutions in April 2015, with full
compliance required by October 2, 2015.
15.
In addition, the introduction of Treasury bill auctions in January 2015, in close
cooperation with the MoF and with technical assistance from the Fund, has reduced
central bank financing of the fiscal deficit, thereby decreasing inflationary pressures
stemming from fiscal expansion.
16.
To develop the government securities market, the Securities Steering Group and
Working Group, which include senior officials from CBM and MoF, have been
established to implement the development plans in this area. The authorities plan to
introduce Treasury bond auctions in the near future to further promote the development
of the Treasury bond market. This will further promote market-determined interest rate
and attract investor participation in the Treasury bond market. Allowing the purchase of
government securities by foreign banks would be the next step when all prerequisites are
met.
17.
The authorities have also taken note of staff's recommendation to tighten the
access to the CBM discount window to prevent the use of the discount window as a de
facto revolving credit facility. In this regard, the authorities plan to abolish the CBM
discount window facility and replace it with the overnight window when the CBM Net
system5 can be fully implemented in 2016.
18.
On the exchange rate regime, in line with staff's recommendation, the authorities
have taken steps to reduce the divergence between the official reference rate and market
rate as well as to abolish multiple exchange rates starting from July 13, 2015. As a result,
the divergence between the CBM reference rate and the market rate has narrowed and
will be unified in the near future. This will help deepen the foreign exchange interbank
market, paving the way for completion of the remaining obligations under Article VIII.
19.
Due to the strengthening of the US dollar and strong demand in the domestic
market, the volatility in the foreign exchange market has increased towards the end
of 2014, resulting in a shortage of foreign currencies. This in turn led to the depreciation
of the Kyat. In response, the CBM started sales of foreign currencies to major importers
by using CBM’s foreign exchange reserves and was able to keep the Kyat broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals. Amidst the unfavorable external environment,
potentially lower rice exports as a result of the recent flooding may put further pressure
5

The CBM is implementing the project of “Modernizing the Funds, Payment and Securities Settlement Systems” by
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) since February 2014 which is a grant aid program. This project
includes Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), Securities Settlement System and Mechanized Clearing House
System (MCH).

on the Kyat. Although the use of CBM's reserves has helped to meet the demand for
foreign exchange and to smooth exchange rate fluctuations at this juncture, the authorities
see the need to accumulate more reserves and are cognizant that adjusting
macroeconomic policies are of the utmost importance in the longer term.
20.
The authorities underscore their commitment to become an Article VIII member
country and have made significant progress towards eliminating most of the Article XIV
restrictions. The authorities are also taking active steps to address gaps that are
preventing them from fully eliminating the present multiple currency practice. In this
regard, the authorities have phased out foreign exchange certificates and the Foreign
Exchange Management Law and accompanying regulations were enacted in August 2012
and September 2014, respectively.
21.
Nevertheless, due to the absence of a mechanism in the multiple price foreign
currency auction that would prevent exchange rates of accepted bids from deviating by
more than 2 percent, the authorities would like to request the Fund’s approval for
Myanmar to retain the multiple currency practice under Article VIII, Section 3 until
August 27, 2016 or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation with Myanmar,
whichever is earlier.
Financial Sector Developments
22.
With the growing economy, Myanmar’s financial sector is rapidly expanding. In
ensuring that the financial sector remains supportive of growth without undermining
financial sector stability, the authorities are highly committed to strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framework. Private sector credit growth, although remains
elevated, has started to moderate. Progress has been made in strengthening the
supervisory framework, including upgrading prudential regulations, revising supervisory
framework, developing supervisory techniques in line with international standards, and
enhancing the capacity of the supervisors through training and seminars with the
assistance of international institutions, regional organizations and other development
partners. The CBM has allocated its most qualified staff to work closely with the Fund to
further enhance the supervisory framework.
23.
In order to achieve greater access to international markets, the CBM, on
October 1, 2014, granted preliminary approval to nine foreign banks to begin
preparations to commence banking operations in Myanmar. Thus far, the CBM has issued
final licenses to eight of the nine foreign banks, enabling them to begin their operations.
In this regard, the authorities are concurrently strengthening the capacity of supervisors to
supervise and regulate foreign banks. The presence of foreign bank operations will also
help to promote greater use of technology and encourage international standard practices
in the banking industry.

6
24.
The authorities have made significant progress in improving the financial
infrastructure to strengthen the financial system and to modernize its financial
framework. Several laws and related regulations have been enacted, namely, the new
Foreign Exchange Management Law (August 2012), the new Central Bank of Myanmar
Law (July 2013), the Securities Exchange Law (July 2013) and the regulations of Foreign
Exchange Management Law (September 2014). The enacting of a new Financial
Institutions of Myanmar Law (FIML) and CBM rules and regulations are in the final
stages. In particular, the rules and regulations under the FIML are expected to further
modernize financial institutions.
25.
The Anti-money Laundering and Counter Terrorism (AML/CFT) Law was
enacted in March 2014 and its accompanying regulations are currently being drafted with
high priority. A number of supervisory tools were developed under the IMF TA project
with the objective of assisting the CBM to strengthen its overall AML/CFT legal
framework and bring it in line with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
Recommendations. As a result, the CBM has issued a Risk Management Guidance Note
for banks on January 27, 2015. Moreover, to address concerns of the FATF identified in
the Public Statement, the updated risk based CDD Directive has been prepared with the
assistance of IMF and will be issued soon.
26.
The enactment of the Securities Exchange Law in July 2013 was a major
milestone as it enabled the establishment of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)
to supervise and manage the securities market and also paved the way for further capital
market development. The authorities have also adopted a concrete plan to establish a
stock exchange in late 2015.
27.
To develop greater financial access and promote a more inclusive financial
system, the authorities have taken steps to expand the branch network of the banking
system, encourage microfinance, and enhance innovations in ATMs, point-of-sale
systems and mobile banking. In addition, the payment and settlement systems will be
further enhanced with the establishment of the CBM Net system.
28.
In addition, the Interbank Market Steering Committee will undertake continued
and extensive efforts towards the establishment of a functioning and active interbank FX
market and money market.
29.
The authorities also place great importance on strengthening institutional
foundation and capacity. Some programs are still ongoing and include, among others,
introducing the “Modernizing the Funds, Payment and Securities Settlement Systems”
project, developing the interbank foreign exchange market and money market,
implementing new accounting standards and preparing a financial sector development
master plan with the technical assistance from the regional and international community.

Macroeconomic and Structural Reforms
30.
Comprehensive macroeconomic reforms are critical to maintaining economic
stability, promoting sustainable growth and reducing poverty. In addition to the ambitious
reforms in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate as well as financial sector policies, key
reforms in business and trade sectors remain on track.
31.
Recognizing the importance of creating a conducive investment climate and
positive business environment to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), some laws
relating to investments have been enacted while existing laws are being revised. Notably,
the enacting of the new Foreign Investment Law (2012) has helped to attract more FDI
by providing foreign companies access to a wide range of new businesses, longer term
leases, favorable tax incentives with various tax and customs duty exemptions, and
improving transparency of the foreign investment regulations and implementations. The
establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), with a new SEZs law (January 2014),
will also help to promote local and foreign investment. Further, to support export
development and competitiveness, the authorities are developing the National Export
Strategy (NES) in cooperation with the International Trade Centre (ITC) and Deutsche
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).
32.
The restructuring and privatization of state enterprises are crucial for sustained
growth. In this regard, some state economic enterprises (SEEs) have been privatized,
especially in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. This has also helped to reduce the
fiscal deficit. To strengthen SMEs, the authorities have placed a strong emphasis on
improving the legal framework and funding for SMEs. Various laws relating to the
industrial sectors have also been enacted with the aim to transform Myanmar into an
industrialized economy.
33.
To enhance overall socio-economic development, the authorities have affirmed
the development of the telecommunication sector as part of its economic reforms. In this
regard, progress has been made in issuing telecom licenses to foreign companies. The
authorities also underscore their commitment to promote inclusive growth through
improving health and education services. The authorities recognize the importance of
timely macroeconomic statistics for macroeconomic surveillance and have committed to
undertake further efforts in this area.
34.
The authorities deeply appreciate the Fund’s constructive policy advice and
technical assistance. However, given the vast challenges that Myanmar is facing and with
TAs available only to some reform areas, the economy continues to face significant
difficulties in expediting the comprehensive reforms.

8
Conclusion
35.
Myanmar is undergoing a major economic transition towards a market oriented
economy. Despite its positive economic growth performance over the years, Myanmar
still faces significant challenges in implementing the economic reform agenda given the
constraints in human capital, institutions and infrastructure. The authorities remain
committed to continuing efforts in those needed areas under the ongoing reform agenda.
In this regard, the authorities firmly believe that the technical assistance, capacity
building and valuable advice from regional partners and the international community will
enable Myanmar to overcome the remaining challenges and ultimately achieve its longterm economic development goals.
36.
Finally, the authorities would like to express their gratitude to the Fund as well as
to the World Bank and the ADB, for their unwavering support and valuable policy
recommendations over the years. The authorities look forward to continuous support and
cooperation as they press ahead with the ongoing economic reform agenda.
