EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Sri Lanka’s recent growth performance, while impressive, has been underpinned in
part by monetary and fiscal stimulus, resulting in strong demand pressures. Rising
inflation, a high current account deficit, and low unemployment rate indicate that the
economy may be operating at full capacity. High oil prices, slow fiscal consolidation, and
security concerns are key risks to the near-term growth-inflation outlook.
High stock of public debt, rising near-term debt service needs, and a low level of
reserves point to elevated external vulnerabilities. Fiscal deficits in the past few years
resulted in an accumulation of short-term dollar-denominated commercial debt, posing
refinancing risks.
Concerted tightening in macroeconomic policies is needed in the near term to reduce
inflation and vulnerabilities, while facilitating the refinancing of the domestic
dollar-denominated commercial debt.
•

A more determined fiscal consolidation is essential for demand management and
debt sustainability. The revised 2007 budget deficit target (at 7.8 percent of GDP)
represents a modest withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, but remains high. Additional measures
of about ½ percent of GDP may be required in the remainder of the year to help limit
inflationary financing. Further overruns on wages and military spending pose upside risks
to the fiscal deficit. Going forward, a credible fiscal consolidation in 2008 and over the
medium-term, supported by well-defined and quality revenue measures, is essential for
ensuring macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.

•

Further monetary tightening is warranted in view of the current fiscal stance and
high rate of inflation. Open market operations should be stepped up and treasury
security rates be allowed to adjust to levels that would help contain liquidity and bring
inflation down to single digits.

•

Greater flexibility in the exchange rate is essential to safeguard reserves. The real
effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with economic fundamentals and
competitiveness does not seem to be of immediate concern. Nevertheless, sustained high
oil prices and an emerging refinancing burden from the public dollar-denominated
commercial debt could strain the balance of payments. Further exchange rate flexibility
will help contain vulnerabilities.

Sri Lanka’s medium-term economic prospects depend critically on peace, the pace of
fiscal consolidation, and other policy adjustments to reduce external risks. Essential
structural reforms are also key to improve competitiveness and productivity through
broadening the tax base, improving debt dynamics, and strengthening the stability and
efficiency of the financial system.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Sri Lanka’s strong economic growth in the past four years has lifted per capita
income to about $1,300, well exceeding its regional peers. To support this favorable
growth momentum, the authorities launched a Ten-Year Horizon Development Plan (Plan) in
early 2007, aimed at strengthening investment in industrial infrastructure (including power,
roads, and ports). Bilateral and multilateral funding for some of these projects has been
secured and implementation is underway.
2.
This growth-oriented strategy, which is increasingly relying on commercial
borrowing, requires Sri Lanka to implement policies that will improve economic
fundamentals and foster favorable investor sentiment. This strategy requires skillful
management on several policy fronts to contain vulnerabilities while ensuring sustainable
growth.
3.
The near-term macroeconomic impact of the conflict is expected to be limited
but remains a concern. The government has recently captured a large part of the East and
administrative institutions are being established. However, there has been limited progress on
future peace talks.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Sri Lanka’s growth performance continued to reflect strong resilience to shocks,
including the impact of high oil prices, the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA),
and a period of sharp deterioration in security conditions. Real GDP growth in 2006, at
7½ percent, was broad-based and supported by buoyant domestic demand, growing at about
8.7 percent (Table 1, Figure 1).

5.
CPI inflation accelerated to nearly 18 percent by end-2006 (from about
4 percent at end-2005). Strong demand pressure was the primary factor underlying this
trend, and to a lesser extent adjustments in administered prices during September–
October 2006 (a weighted average of about 25 percent on fuel products, electricity, and
transportation). Under the pressure from labor unions, the government approved in May 2007

5
a major increase in minimum wages for the public sector (from Rs. 3000 to Rs. 5000 per
month). Consequently, Sri Lanka’s overall minimum wage index increased by about
40 percent during May-August, correcting a cumulative real term decline of about 30 percent
since June 2004.
6.
Monetary policy was tightened in several steps in 2006 but insufficient to contain
inflation, and additional measures were taken in early 2007. The Central Bank of
Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced its “Road Map” in January, aiming at reducing inflation to
single digits by end-2007 (Table 2). The CBSL also limited banks’ access to the reverse repo
window to contain liquidity, together with a strengthening in prudential measures to contain
excessive exposure to sectoral risks. Moreover, the CBSL stepped up its open market
operations and allowed further increases in treasury security rates to about 17½ percent at
end-April (from 12½ percent at end-2006). These measures, together with a dissipation of
pass-through effects from administered price adjustments, contributed to a deceleration in
inflation to (annualized) single digits in the first four months of 2007, and real interest rates
turned positive.
7.
This favorable inflation trend has reversed, however, since May and inflation
increased to 21¾ percent (yoy) in August. The combined effect of the elimination of
remaining fuel subsidies (a weighted average increase of 22 percent during May-July, on top
of a 25 percent adjustment in last September-October), increases in food prices, and a pause
in further monetary tightening during July-August (evidenced by the refusal of bids in a
number of treasury auctions to limit further increases in treasury security rates) contributed
to an acceleration in inflation.
8.
The authorities’ revised fiscal deficit target for 2007, at 7.8 percent of GDP,
indicates a modest fiscal consolidation from a deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP in
2006 (Table 3). Compared with the 2006 outcome, the revised fiscal projection envisages a
substantial increase in tax revenue, a full elimination of fuel subsidies, and a containment of
the wage bill. Together, they are expected to more than offset increases in military
expenditure, spending on goods and services, and capital spending. Revenue grew by
25 percent in the first half of 2007, but it was still at about 40 percent of the ambitious annual
target. Wages and military spending appeared to be in line with their respective targets as of
June, but they could continue to pose fiscal risks in the period ahead.

The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 4.6 percent of GDP in
2007 (from 5 percent in 2006) while reserves are expected to remain below comfortable
levels (Table 4, Figure 2). In the first half of 2007, exports and remittances continued to
grow strongly, while import growth decelerated mainly owing to limited increases in world
oil prices during that period. For the year as a whole, healthy exports and remittances are
expected to be largely offset by the implementation of mega infrastructure projects and high
oil prices since July.
10.
The rupee exchange rate depreciated gradually (5¼ percent) during
January–September 2007, supported by two-way intervention. The CBSL purchased
foreign exchange of $196 million during January-April, contributing to reserve build up.
However, pressures started to emerge in May and the CBSL intervened by selling foreign
exchange amounting to $272 million during May-September, while transaction volumes in
the spot market declined sharply. As a result, gross international reserves declined to below
$2.6 billion (2.2 months of imports of goods and services) at end-September 2007, from its
peak of $2.9 billion in April.

11.
In light of favorable local and global liquidity conditions in the last two years,
the government has continued to resort to dollar-denominated borrowing to finance the
budget while supporting reserves. By end-2006, public domestic dollar commercial debt
reached $1.6 billion (or 6 percent of GDP) at an average maturity of 1½ years. Over
90 percent of this debt was financed from domestic sources, including remittances. A build
up of this debt has resulted in a bunching of foreign exchange debt service over the next few

7
years, but so far favorable market conditions have allowed the government to refinance this
debt at low cost.1 In October, the government successfully issued its first $500 million
international sovereign bond at a yield of 8¼ percent and maturity of 5 years.2
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
While growth remains robust, near-term risks have increased since the last
Article IV consultation. Demand pressures are intensifying, high world oil prices remain a
challenge, and Sri Lanka’s increased reliance on dollar-denominated commercial debt also
exposes the economy to refinancing risks.
•

Real GDP growth is projected at around 6 percent in 2007 (taking into account the
preliminary official estimates of 6¼ percent in the first half of 2007). Strong domestic
demand is expected to continue to offset weaker external demand.3 Inflation is
projected to moderate to 13 percent (eop) by end-2007, as the administered price
pass-through effects are expected to dissipate and macroeconomic policies be further
tightened towards the end of 2007.

•

Risks to this growth-inflation outlook remain significant. They include a worsening
of the security situation, a surge in world oil prices, and a larger than projected fiscal
deficit that requires significant inflationary financing and/or further recourse to
dollar-denominated debt.

•

Key risks to the current account outlook arise from stiff competition in the apparel
sector, slower-than-expected remittance growth, and further oil price hikes. A
significant global growth slowdown could also affect Sri Lanka’s exports given its
exposure to the United States and European Union.

•

Capital account risks arise mainly from the need to refinance the existing public
dollar-denominated commercial debt. Over the next 2–3 years, about $1.6 billion of
such debt is expected to fall due given its short average maturity. At the same time,
external concessional financing as a ratio to GDP is expected to gradually decline as
Sri Lanka moves towards emerging market status.

1

This includes the issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDB) of $215 million and syndicated loans of
$210 million (both with maturities of 2–3 years). In addition, the government issued $400 million
rupee-denominated treasury bonds to nonresidents during January-April.
2

The recent turmoil in global financial markets has had limited impact on Sri Lanka. The Colombo Stock
Exchange Index increased by about 1½ percent since August, following a decrease of about 10 percent during
January–July 2007.

3

See Chapter I of the Selected Issues.

8
13.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook depends critically on peace, the pace
of fiscal consolidation, and other policy adjustments to strengthen the balance of
payments to deal with shocks.
•

Real GDP growth is projected at 6 percent over 2008–12, supported in part by a
major increase in investment to address supply bottlenecks in key sectors, a continued
expansion of the services sector, and improvement in productivity. However, major
downside risks, including a sustained oil shock and intensified security concerns,
could lower growth.

•

Fiscal consolidation, if delivered without delay, would provide scope for private
sector-led growth, reduce debt service pressures, and improve investor confidence.
The authorities envisage a fiscal consolidation path to lower the deficit to 5 percent of
GDP and bring about a primary balance by 2010 (Table 5). However, the lack of
clearly-defined quality measures to broaden the tax base and risks of wages and
military spending overruns remain serious concerns.

•

The external current account deficit is expected to narrow to 3 percent of GDP by
2011 as oil imports pose less of a burden as prices stabilize and mega infrastructure
developments are completed. Nevertheless, public debt service is expected to remain
high, and external reserve coverage is projected at around 2½ months of imports in
the absence of significant increases in capital inflows.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

Growing vulnerabilities appear to be rooted primarily in domestic policies of the past few
years. The current trend of high fiscal deficits, if not reversed timely and decisively, could
lead to intensified macroeconomic imbalances and a deterioration in public debt dynamics,
which would require deeper policy adjustments eventually.
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
Staff stressed that the authorities revised 2007 fiscal deficit target is still high,
but is a step in the right direction. To achieve a more balanced policy mix and foster a
lower inflationary environment, further fiscal tightening amounting to about ½ percent of
GDP in 2007 is needed to contain budget financing in line with the CBSL’s “Road Map”
targets. Revenue performance has been encouraging so far, but meeting the revised revenue
target of 18.5 percent of GDP (from 17.1 percent of GDP in 2006) remains a challenge and
will require further administrative efforts. Restraint is also essential to limit potential
recurrent expenditure overruns in order to protect priority development spending while
delivering a lower deficit. Preliminary data as of mid-October indicate that external project
financing was significantly lower than expected. Staff advised that, with more than three
quarters of the year already gone, there may be a need to further rationalize the portion of the
capital budget that is not fully externally financed. This will help contain domestic financing

9
of the budget, reduce inflation risks and debt service cost going forward, and support private
sector and capital market developments.
15.
The authorities were confident that the revised fiscal deficit target for 2007 will
be met, or even lowered in the event of external financing shortfall. They expected the
strong revenue performance to continue in the second half of 2007, and intended to further
strengthen their efforts in tax administration to ensure that measures introduced in 2006–07,
as well as new mid-year measures, are effectively implemented.4 They noted that the
elimination of the oil subsidy in the budget removed a major fiscal risk. Also, as the revised
capital budget is still above the historical trend, there is further scope to rationalize projects
that are not fully externally financed.
16.
The authorities indicated their renewed commitment to the medium-term fiscal
consolidation to reduce the budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP and achieve a primary
balance by 2010–11. Staff supported this consolidation path as it would reduce total public
debt to 73 percent of GDP by 2010 (from 95 percent of GDP at end-2006), lower interest
costs, create space for private investment, and support demand management. In particular,
staff noted the importance of a credible fiscal consolidation in 2008 to reduce the budget
deficit to 6¼ percent of GDP (as indicated in the recent Budget Call) while articulating
clearly the fiscal strategy underpinning this deficit reduction.
17.
Staff emphasized, and the authorities agreed, that quality measures are needed
to support the medium-term fiscal consolidation. They envisaged a further broadening of
the income tax base, a strengthening of tax administration, and a gradual simplification of the
VAT system. However, they saw political difficulties in extending the VAT net to cover the
retail and wholesale sectors over the next few years. They noted objections of the provincial
councils regarding revenue sharing over sales taxes, which are currently being collected and
retained by local governments. Staff highlighted risks to fiscal consolidation in the absence
of strong and sustainable revenue measures which could undermine investor confidence.
18.
Staff further stressed the importance of streamlining tax incentives starting in
2008, and the need to conduct a fresh review of benefits and costs of the current
exemption regime. In particular, staff expressed concerns over new exemptions introduced
in the 2007 budget (including leather, construction, film, rubber, and coconut processing
industries). The current corporate exemption regime under the Board of Investment (BOI)
also distorts resource allocation and undermines tax buoyancy. This is particularly worrisome
given that mega infrastructure projects are likely to fall under these schemes. The authorities
4

These include income tax measures to increase the top corporate rate, register 38,000 additional taxpayers, and
place limits on loss carry forward; and VAT measures to raise the markup on imports to counter underinvoicing.

10
indicated that while BOI companies pay little corporate tax, their contribution to growth,
income generation, employment, and other taxes are significant. They also noted that tax
incentives have been widely used in Asia, and Sri Lanka has to operate within this
competitive environment to meet its goal of industrial development.
19.
The authorities have identified loopholes in VAT refunds as a major factor
undermining the VAT system. They noted that a large number of fraudulent claims were
found, and steps have been taken to separate high risk traders from the rest. Staff suggested
that announcing a clear timetable for returning to a normal refund schedule f ollowing the
cleanup process will help facilitate the forward planning of the business community and
protect the credibility of the VAT system.
20.
Sri Lanka’s ambitious public investment plan over the next few years has placed
a premium on the need to rationalize recurrent expenditure. In particular, staff advised
restraint on real wage growth going forward, supported by policies to reduce inflation, limit
public sector hiring, and resist pressures on sharp nominal wage increases. The authorities
responded that overall public nominal wage increases have been limited to 20 percent over
2007–09, and real wage growth has already been curtailed in 2007 (compared to the outcome
in 2006).
21.
The authorities concurred that financial viability of the energy sector is central
to fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability over the medium term. Ceylon Electricity
Board (CEB) is likely to incur financial losses of about Rs. 20 billion (¾ percent of GDP)
in 2007, due primarily to the lack of adjustment in electricity tariffs, which have fallen well
below cost recovery levels. A large part of these losses was financed by loans from public
banks, posing risks to the financial sector. The authorities’ medium-term strategy is to use
alternative and cheaper energy sources to reduce Sri Lanka’s heavy reliance on oil-based
thermal power generation. The construction of three coal power plants (total 900 MW) is
expected to be completed during 2008–10. This will not only address the acute energy
shortage in Sri Lanka but also significantly lower the cost of energy production (by about
one-third from the current level) and bring the CEB to cost recovery levels.
B. Monetary Policy
22.
Staff advised a tighter monetary stance to contain demand pressures and
improve the near term growth-inflation outlook. The CBSL’s policy decision to allow the
treasury security rates to increase by 500 bps during the first half of 2007 has been
instrumental in bringing about positive real interest rates and contributed to reduce inflation.
In fact, these rates have de facto become the key indicators to transmit the CBSL’s policy
stance, as well as influence banks’ decisions on setting their lending and deposit rates.
However, the recent pause in monetary tightening is a source of concern in view of fiscal
risks, continued high domestic credit growth, and rising inflationary expectations. Going

11
forward, it is critical to step up open market operations and allow treasury rates to increase to
levels that will help effectively contain liquidity and reduce inflation to single digits.
23.
The authorities underscored that limiting banks’ access to the reverse repo
window has been effective in containing liquidity. Nevertheless, they concurred that this
measure is not the first best and has resulted in periodic increases in volatility in the call
money market. Staff advised and the authorities agreed that, when inflation moderates
sufficiently, the CBSL should consider a gradual exit from this arrangement, accompanied by
adjustments in policy rates to align with treasury security rates to restore the signaling role of
policy rates in the conduct of monetary policy and proper functioning of the standing facility.
24.
Improved coordination between monetary and fiscal policy is critical to support
demand management. Meeting the CBSL’s “Road Map” targets for external reserve
accumulation and domestic credit growth is a critical step in fighting inflation, particularly in
light of fiscal risks in the current budget framework. The recent pick up in bank financing of
the budget to above target levels during August-September warrants intensified coordination
to identify timely corrective actions if needed. Improving open market operations will also
require a stepped up coordination between the CBSL and Ministry of Finance in liquidity
forecasting.
C. Exchange Rate Policy
25.
Staff analysis suggests that the real effective exchange rate (REER) appears
broadly in line with economic fundamentals and competitiveness does not seem to be an
immediate concern.5
•

Sri Lanka’s REER is broadly in the range of regional competitors although it has
exhibited substantial variation over time. Following a depreciation of 23 percent
during 1998–2004, the REER appreciated by about 14 percent in 2005–2006,
reflecting largely the impact of tsunami-related inflows and high domestic inflation.
The unwinding of these effects, together with a nominal exchange rate depreciation of
3 percent, has resulted in a REER depreciation of about 2 percent in the first half of
2007. Estimates of the equilibrium REER using various approaches also indicate that
the REER in the first half of 2007 is close to equilibrium.

•

Trade performance indicators suggest that REER competitiveness may not be of
immediate concern. While Sri Lanka’s apparel exports to the United States has
slowed, utilization of the European Union’s GSP II quotas has increased, together
with Sri Lanka’s E.U. market share. Moreover, other exports continue to enjoy

5

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues.

12
relatively high profit margins, which may be an indication of Sri Lanka’s comparative
advantage in certain commodity markets (e.g., tea and spices).
•

Nevertheless, other indicators warrant close monitoring, particularly in view of
Sri Lanka’s labor productivity, which appears to be low relative to regional
competitors. Wage growth seems to have outpaced labor productivity in the past few
years and unit labor costs in industry appear to be increasing. Moreover, the export
base remains narrow and vulnerable to global commodity and apparel price changes.

26.
In response, the authorities indicated that the export performance has been
healthy despite stiff competition and the post MFA shock. They noted that exports
continue to grow at above 10 percent in dollar terms and order books of the apparel sector in
2007 are full. Also, efforts are being made to strengthen export sector competitiveness,
including by establishing backward linkages of the apparel industry to the textile sector.
27.
Turning to exchange rate management, staff noted that a more market-based
exchange rate regime would serve Sri Lanka well. Given the persistent nature of high oil
prices, a rising debt service burden going forward, and low level of reserves, growing
pressures on the foreign exchange market are likely and should not be resisted. In this
context, staff advised greater flexibility in the rupee exchange rate to help contain external
vulnerabilities and safeguard reserves and limiting intervention to smoothing excessive
volatility.
28.
The authorities underscored their commitment to a market-based exchange rate.
They emphasized that the rupee has been allowed to depreciate in an orderly manner
throughout the year. They explained that increased intervention has been prompted primarily
by lumpy oil import bills which were far larger than the daily size of the foreign exchange
market. To help minimize the future impact of oil bills on the foreign exchange market, steps
have been taken to allow the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC, a state-owned oil
company) to gradually accumulate foreign exchange funds earmarked for future oil imports.
29.
The authorities confirmed that import margin requirements (50 percent) with
respect to certain goods, introduced in October 2006, were removed in May 2007.
However, they plan to maintain the margin requirements (100 percent) with respect to certain
vehicles in view of continued high demand for vehicle imports. They agreed to review this
decision during the 2008 Article IV consultation discussions. The Board approval of this
restriction expired on November 2, 2007. At this point, staff do not propose an approval of
this restriction.

D. Debt Policy6
30.
The main challenge in the near term is to lengthen the maturity of domestic
dollar-denominated commercial debt. While this short-term financing for the budget was
at more favorable interest rates than rupee funds, it has rendered Sri Lanka vulnerable to
exchange rate and refinancing risks. Unless addressed promptly, the ensuing foreign
exchange debt service bunching could lead to a sharp deterioration in debt sustainability.
31.
To address the near-term debt service challenge, the authorities are currently
reviewing all options. This includes issuing longer-term SLDBs to replace those with
shorter maturity falling due and tapping funds from international financial markets under
favorable conditions. The recent success in issuing Sri Lanka’s first sovereign debt of
$500 million with five-year maturity is encouraging, and this would help set a benchmark for
issuing longer term SLDBs. Staff advised that proceeds from international bond issue should
be used mainly to retire the short-term dollar-denominated commercial debt and/or the most
expensive rupee debt. Efforts to mobilize other funding sources, including remittances,
remain important. Staff underscored that sound macroeconomic policies are critical to foster
stability and investor confidence to further lengthen the maturity of the public debt. In
particular, a comfortable level of external reserves is indispensable during the transition
period towards improved debt dynamics.
32.
The authorities noted that a new debt management strategy (mainly on domestic
rupee debt) has been endorsed by the Cabinet and implementation is underway. As a
first step, trading of treasury securities has been extended to retail investors through bank
branches in the urban and rural areas. Continued efforts will be made to develop the
benchmark issues with longer maturities, introduce inflation indexed bonds, and develop a
domestic corporate bond market. Several challenges remain, including strengthening the
primary dealer system, providing adequate incentives to brokers to promote government
securities, and encouraging long-term savings.
33.
Staff sought clarification regarding the financing modalities of mega
infrastructure projects under the Plan. Out of a total of $4.5 billion targeted for key
infrastructure development during 2007−09, about $1.5 billion has been secured from major
bilateral and multilateral donors, mostly with long maturities and on concessional or soft
terms. The government is currently seeking financing for the remaining $3 billion, including
from private sector investors in the form of PPPs. The authorities indicated that they are
being guided by the principle of ensuring balanced risk sharing with the private sector and
minimizing contingent liabilities. In this context, staff recommended that a legal framework
governing the PPPs should be the first step to ensure proper risk management and good
6

14
governance. Staff also advised that financing of the mega infrastructure projects should be
fully accounted for in the medium-term budget framework.
34.
Staff shared its debt sustainability analysis (DSA) with the authorities,
indicating that Sri Lanka has a moderate risk of external debt distress. However, the
risk of debt distress increased to moderate-to-high for total foreign exchange debt, assuming
refinanced and new dollar-denominated commercial debt are at maturity of 2 years.
Lengthening the maturity of the dollar-denominated debt could significantly reduce the debt
service burden and improve debt dynamics.
•

While the external debt-service ratios are contained, total debt service in foreign
exchange, including for servicing the public domestic dollar-denominated
commercial debt, is projected to increase sharply over 2008−2009 (to $600 and
$800 million based on the end-2006 stock).

•

An illustrative simulation, assuming full refinancing of the end-2006 debt stock at
existing maturities with new money of $300 million each year starting from 2008,
indicates an increased total debt service in foreign exchange to about 20−25 percent
of exports over the medium term. Mitigating factors include mobilizing medium to
long-term international and domestic funds to retire the short-term foreign exchange
commercial debt.

•

However, debt dynamics are highly sensitive to fiscal deficit, growth, exports, and
interest rates. Extreme stress tests including lower growth, lower exports, and interest
rate shocks, could bring total debt service in foreign exchange to around 30 percent,
indicating a high risk of debt distress.
E. Financial Sector Policy7

35.
Since the 2002 FSAP, the authorities have made significant progress in
improving financial sector stability. Salient features include a sharp decline in the NPL
ratios across banks, a marked strengthening in the capital base of the banking industry, and a
sustained improvement in banks’ operating profits (Table 6). Moreover, implementation of
the Basel Core Principles has advanced to facilitate a planned adoption of Basel II in 2008.
Nevertheless, underlying structural and operational weaknesses remain. Further efforts
should focus on:
•

7

Improving banking sector resilience to shocks through improving asset quality and
strengthening credit and liquidity risk management: Stress testing indicates that more

Among the issues identified by the overlapping FSAP update mission (June 20–July 2), staff focused on the
issues that have significant macroeconomic implications. For details, see Sri Lanka FSAP Update, 2007.

15
than half of the banking system assets are highly vulnerable to interest rate and
liquidity shocks, and to a lesser extent to exchange rate risk and deterioration in asset
quality. The sharp rise in credit to deposit ratios (from about 80 percent in 2003 to
94 percent in 2006) suggests that banks have become increasingly reliant on
commercial borrowing to fund their asset growth, thereby accentuating credit and
liquidity risks in the banking system.
•

Strengthening risk-based supervision: This is particularly important in view of the
recent rapid growth in sectoral lending. While the expansion in private sector credit
over the past few years reflects financial deepening to a large extent8, its uneven
growth and concentration across sectors is a source of concern. In particular,
consumer and housing sectors grew by 59 percent and 45 percent by end-March,
respectively, on top of high growth in 2006, which have contributed to asset price
inflation.

•

Advancing structural and operational restructuring in state-owned banks and limiting
state interference: During 2002–06, NPLs in state-owned banks declined markedly
while the capital base strengthened (Bank of Ceylon’s capital adequacy ratio is well
above the 10 percent minimum requirement). Commercial business of these banks has
also shown a healthy expansion. However, state influence remains significant
evidenced by large loan exposures of these banks to the government and public
corporations, as well as directed lending to some sectors. Moreover, overstaffing has
resulted in high personnel costs, accounting for three-quarters of total operating cost.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

36.
Sri Lanka’s recent growth performance has been impressive, supporting a sharp
reduction in unemployment and an improvement in per capita income. Sustaining this
growth momentum over the medium term will require macroeconomic stability and
strengthened structural reforms to improve competitiveness, promote FDI, and enhance
productivity. Emphasis should be placed on tax reforms to broaden the resource base,
streamline tax incentives, improve the stability and efficiency of the financial sector, and
address financial imbalances in the energy sector.
37.
Concerted policy tightening is needed in the near term to reduce inflation and
vulnerabilities. While the economy continues to show remarkable resilience against adverse
shocks, near-term risks have emerged. Inflation has been rising, the external current account
deficit remains large, and gross official reserves are below comfortable levels. A tighter

8

See Chapter III of the Selected Issues.

16
macroeconomic policy stance is needed to rebalance the growth-inflation outlook while
ensuring balance of payments viability.
38.
A more determined fiscal consolidation in 2007 is critical for demand
management and debt sustainability. The revised lower fiscal deficit target in 2007 is a
step in the right direction, but it still remains high. Additional fiscal measures may be
required to contain the fiscal deficit to 7½ percent of GDP so as to limit inflationary
financing and help meet the “Road Map” targets. This may call for additional rationalization
of capital spending to the historical norms while protecting key development spending.
Meeting the revised ambitious revenue target remains a challenge despite strong performance
in the first half of 2007, and it will require continued efforts to ensure that measures
introduced in 2006–07 are fully implemented. Prudence is also important going forward to
limit risks of future recurrent expenditure overrun.
39.
Further monetary tightening in the near term is warranted in view of the
current fiscal stance and the rate of inflation. Further efforts are necessary to conduct
open market operations so as to allow treasury security rates to adjust to levels that would
help bring down inflation to single digit levels. At the same time, policy rates could be
adjusted upwards gradually to align with treasury security rates, restoring its signaling role in
the conduct of monetary policy and allowing a proper functioning of the standing facility in
liquidity management. Timely actions on these fronts will be instrumental in ensuring
macroeconomic stability.
40.
Looking ahead, greater downward flexibility in the exchange rate is needed to
help reduce vulnerability and safeguard reserves in a challenging environment.
Sustained high oil prices and an emerging refinancing burden from the existing public
dollar-denominated commercial debt could exert pressures on the balance of payments and
will require improved exchange rate policy to manage risks. Frequent intervention may send
mixed signals to the market and generate uncertainty. The authorities should limit
intervention in the foreign exchange market to smoothing excessive volatility. The REER
appears to be in line with economic fundamentals given the recent trade performance.
Nevertheless, other indicators warrant close monitoring, particularly in view of Sri Lanka’s
relatively low labor productivity.
41.
Over the next few years, managing the refinancing of the public
dollar-denominated commercial debt is expected to take center stage. The key is to limit
further reliance on short-term dollar-denominated commercial borrowing and managing
refinancing of this debt through longer maturity while favorable market conditions last. This
will need to be underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies to ensure stability and
investor confidence. Continued efforts in broadening financing sources, including through
remittances and long-term international market funds are crucial.

17
42.
Sri Lanka’s medium-term debt sustainability hinges critically on the strength of
fiscal consolidation and prospects for attracting nondebt-creating flows. In this context,
it is essential to advance fiscal consolidation without delay. The authorities’ fiscal
consolidation path to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2011 will help reduce
the public debt stock, lower debt service pressures, and create space for productive
investment over the medium term. This requires the adoption of sound and sustainable
revenue enhancing measures, including extending VAT to retail and wholesale stages,
further broadening the income tax base, and strengthening tax administration, supported by
greater prioritization and efficiency in expenditure. Moreover, financing of the mega
infrastructure projects will need to be fully incorporated in the medium-term budget
framework. Efforts should also be made to establish a legal framework for PPPs to ensure
that quasi-fiscal risks are minimized.
43.
Financial sector reform efforts could focus on implementing the FSAP update
recommendations. Priorities include further improving the resilience of the banking sector,
strengthening risk-based supervision, advancing the preparatory work for Basel II adoption
in 2008, and accelerating operational restructuring of the public banks to improve their risk
management and efficiency. State interference in public bank should also be limited.
44.
The authorities’ energy policy may help lower the cost of energy production over
the medium term, but timely measures are needed during the transition period to
address the current financial imbalances in CEB. The most effective and sound approach
is to increase electricity tariffs to cost recovery levels, starting in the 2008 budget, to help
minimize the quasi-fiscal losses and potential damage to public banks. Safety net provisions
could be considered to protect the poor.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka take place on
a standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Managed float. The central bank floated the rupee on January 23, 2001. The CBSL has
removed the foreign exchange regulations that were imposed after the float. All import
margin requirements (50 percent) with respect to certain goods (which are a “normal short
term banking and credit facility” under Article XXX(d)), introduced in last October, were
removed in May 2007, but the 100 percent margin requirements on the import of certain
vehicles remain in place.
VIII.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBSL is subject to a full safeguards
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement which was approved on April 18, 2003.
The assessment was completed on July 30, 2003 and concluded that the CBSL had made
commendable progress in strengthening its safeguards since the 2001 assessment. As a result,
the risk ratings have been upgraded in four of the five areas of the safeguards framework.
The report found a few remaining vulnerabilities that could be addressed through a series of
measures to further strengthen the CBSL’s operations. The authorities have already
implemented most of the proposed measures, including the full implementation of
International Accounting Standards, and committed to implementation of the outstanding
ones, including in the context of the new Central Banking Act.

Article IV Consultation

It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka will be in accordance with

ANNEX II: SRI LANKA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP9
(As of October 12, 2007)
The Bank’s last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka was presented at a time
of great optimism in April 2003. Since that time, much has happened in Sri Lanka—most
notably, the devastating tsunami in December 2004. In addition, the peace talks have
stalled and the country is engulfed in renewed violence. While average growth has
remained at about 5-6 percent, this has not been adequate for significantly reducing poverty
beyond urban areas. The fiscal situation remains under stress and needed reforms have
proved elusive in the face of the political instability. In short, the political constraints and
uncertainties have affected the peace process, policy implementation and the environment for
pro-poor, broad-based economic growth.
A. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
World Bank Activities
Support on the implementation of reforms in public administration and public expenditure
management, include the e-Sri Lanka Development Project that aims to enhance growth,
employment and equity by promoting affordable access to and wide use of on-line public
information and services by citizens and businesses and private sector competitiveness,
particularly of knowledge industries and small and medium enterprises. The Bank has also
led the dialogue on public expenditure issues, primarily to assist in the efforts to implement a
medium term budget framework (MTBF).
In the health sector, the ongoing National HIV/AIDS Prevention project is assisting in
curbing the spread of HIV infection. The Bank also worked closely with the authorities in
developing a health sector strategy/program that resulted in the financing of the Health
Sector Development operation. Analytical work is underway on ageing and was recently
completed on nutrition.
In the education sector, the Bank is involved in the Education Sector Development Project,
which promotes equitable access to and improved quality of basic and secondary education.
With regard to reform of the tertiary sector, Bank support is being provided through the
Improving the Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education project.
In rural development, the Bank completed a major study—“Sri Lanka: Promoting
Agricultural and Rural Non-Farm Sector Growth”—that identified key constraints,
including poor access to critical infrastructure and services, ineffective public sector
9

Prepared by the World Bank staff.

33
expenditure programs, poor flow of information on technology transfer and dominance of
public sector as a service provider and underutilization of private sector initiatives. Another
major study focuses on the constraints to and actions needed to sustain the growth of the tea
and rubber sectors, and to improve the welfare of the large number of tea and rubber
dependent households. The Community Development and Livelihood “Gemi Diriya” project
addresses poverty reduction and reinvigoration of the rural economy.
In the area of peace and reconstruction of the North and East (NE), the North East Irrigated
Agriculture Project II (NEIAP II) helps conflict-affected communities in the NE and
adjoining areas in restoring livelihoods, enhancing agricultural and other production and
incomes, and building capacity for sustainable, social and economic reintegration. To address
housing needs, the North East Housing Reconstruction Project (NEHRP) is providing the
poorest conflict-affected families in the NE (that meet accepted vulnerability criteria) with
improved and affordable housing units. The Sri Lanka Puttalam Housing Project supports
the integration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Puttalam by upgrading and
improving the habitat, water and sanitation facilities of both IDPs and select non-IDPs.
To assess and improve the environment for the private sector, the Bank and ADB jointly
conducted a comprehensive Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) of the urban formal
sector and entrepreneurship in the rural areas. The Legal and Judicial Reform Project,
which closed in early 2007 with a second stage now under preparation, focused on making
the existing legal and judicial framework more efficient, transparent and responsive.
Through the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) project,
the Bank is helping to improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable
energy technologies to bring electricity to remote communities and promote private sector
power generation from renewable energy resources from the main grid. In addition,
through the Second Community Water Supply and Sanitation (CWSSP II) project, the
Bank is supporting the implementation of demand-responsive and sustainable rural water
and sanitation services. A large Road Sector Assistance Project aims to lower transportation
costs through sustainable delivery of an efficient national road system.Related to the
tsunami, the Bank—in collaboration with ADB and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation—conducted a preliminary damage and needs assessment and released a joint
report in early February 2005. The assessment formed the basis for a Tsunami Emergency
Recovery Program (TERP) covering roads, rail, power, water, housing, health, education
and livelihoods.
World Bank and IMF Collaboration
The Bank and the IMF are working closely together on financial sector issues. The Bank is
embarking on a Corporate Governance Review of the Banking Sector, which will
complement the upcoming IMF FSAP review. Previously, a completed sector work entitled
“Sri Lanka: Improving Access to Financial Services” highlighted numerous opportunities for

34
promoting higher financial inclusion and points to the need for a multi-pronged approach to
address current gaps and serve the diverse needs of households and businesses.
Finally, given the importance of trade to achieving Sri Lanka’s growth and poverty reduction
objectives, the Bank carried out a trade policy analysis as part of the last Development Policy
Review. The contribution of the IMF will continue to be on supporting trade reforms focused
on making progress toward a simplified and transparent two-band tariff system, including
reducing agricultural protection.
B. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
Country Assistance Strategy. The CAS for Sri Lanka was considered by the Bank’s Board
on April 1, 2003. The CAS was designed to support the 2003 PRSP’s three core themes:
peace, growth and equity. In December 2005, a CAS Progress Report was prepared to reflect
the significantly changed operating environment. While the program continues to provide
strong support to the peace and equity pillars along with the added assistance to
tsunami-related reconstruction and recovery, the emphasis of the program has shifted with
regard to the growth pillar. In this revised program of support, there is a strong bias towards
lending operations that: (i) support human development; (ii) further recovery in the
conflict-affected areas; and (iii) assist roads and irrigation as the core infrastructure needed to
support-pro-poor growth via reduced transport costs and sustained access to water for
agriculture. A new CAS is now under preparation and will to go to the Board in mid-FY08.
Bank Assistance Program in Sri Lanka. The Bank’s active portfolio as of October
12, 2007 comprises 13 IDA credits/grants and one Global Environmental Facility
(GEF) grant for a total commitment (net of cancellation) of $778.4 million (Table II.1). The
FY07 lending program included one new project (Puttalam Housing) approved in
February 2007 and a supplemental financing (Renewable Energy) approved in June 2007.
Economic and Sector Work. A number of important sector reports/policy notes were
completed during FY04–FY07, including: Treasures of the Education System in Sri Lanka:
Restoring Performance, Expanding Opportunities and Enhancing Prospects; Sri Lanka:
Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate; Post-Tsunami Recovery Program:
Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment; Sri Lanka Development Forum: The Economy,
The Tsunami and Poverty Reduction; Attaining the Millennium Development Goals in
Sri Lanka; Sri Lanka: Improving Access to Financial Services; Decentralization and Service
Delivery in Sri Lanka: Assessment and Options; Poverty Assessment for Sri Lanka—
Engendering Growth with Equity: Opportunities and Challenges; and Tea and Rubber
Sector Review.
Other key diagnostic work completed over the last few years includes the Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), ROSC Accounting and Auditing Assessment, Health Sector Policy Note and Roads
Policy Note. Economic and sector work currently under way includes work on ageing,

35
corporate governance in the banking sector, higher education, private renewable energy and
growth potential in lagging regions.

IFC’s Activities in Sri Lanka. As of September 30, 2007, IFC’s held portfolio in Sri Lanka
consisted of investments in eight companies, with a total committed exposure of
US$155 million. The portfolio is spread over financial institutions, power, health care,
manufacturing, ports and telecommunications. Greater investment involvement is linked to
progress on the political/security situation. IFC remains interested in investing in Sri Lanka
(especially in infrastructure, manufacturing and financial markets) depending upon progress
on reforms. In FY06, IFC opened a dedicated small and medium enterprise development
technical assistance program for Sri Lanka and the Maldives under the South Asia Enterprise
Development Facility (‘IFC-SEDF’). The IFC and the Governments of the Netherlands and
Norway have provided the initial funding of US$5.5 million. Fund raising efforts are
continuing and Program activities will be expanded as more donors participate in the
Program. The program aims to support the growth of SMEs through three components:

36
Access to Finance, Value Addition to Firms (VAF) and Business Enabling environment. It
contributes to broader-based economic growth, and hence to sustainable poverty reduction in
Sri Lanka and Maldives.

ANNEX III: SRI LANKA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Sri Lanka has received $3.76 billion for 135 public sector loans and $93.90 million for
223 technical assistance projects since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966.
As of December 2006, there were 47 ongoing public sector loans for a total loan amount of
$1.7 billion, including $156 million in three program loans and one from the Asian Tsunami
Fund. Of these 47 loans, 12 were financed from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and 34 from
the Asian Development Fund (ADF).
The Asian Development Bank approved supplementary financing of $60 million for the
Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project in 2006.
The project has a significant community participation component, involving all stakeholders
in project design, which is especially relevant for its components in the north and east of the
country. Some of the loans scheduled for 2006 were postponed to 2007, but lot of work was
completed in 2006. The project to expand Colombo Port moved ahead with a memorandum of
understanding signed between the minister of ports and aviation and ADB in September 2006.
The bulk of the work for a small and medium-sized enterprise development project was
completed in 2006. Major progress has been made on the upgrading of a major expressway to the
south to four lanes.
ADB approved four technical assistance grants in 2006 for a total of $ 2.3 million.
ADB is working on the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Sri Lanka in 2007. The new
strategy will determine ADB’s assistance program for the next three years, including the sectors
and project pipeline. The new CPS will take into consideration the conflict situation, within
which operations have to be carried out. It will also reflect government priorities outlined in the
national strategy, the “Mahinda Chinthana.”
ADB’s top priorities in Sri Lanka are supporting broad-based economic growth, advancing
social development and supporting improved governance. Emphasis will be placed on poorer
regions and those encountering particular hardship.
As of December 2006, the sectoral distribution of the loan portfolio was Agriculture and Natural
Resources, 14 percent; Education, 10 percent; Energy, 6 percent; Finance, 8 percent; Industry
and Trade, 4 percent; Law, Economic Management and Public Policy, 4 percent; Transport and
Communications, 24 percent; Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste Management, 15 percent;
Multi-sectors, 14 percent.

ANNEX IV: SRI LANKA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
Staff Assessment
Overall, the coverage and timeliness of available data are adequate for program monitoring and
surveillance purposes. The authorities supply key data to the Fund on a timely basis, and
publish data regularly, including daily information on stock, money, and foreign exchange
through electronic media. However, as noted below, there are deficiencies in the statistical base
which, if rectified, would improve the ability to monitor developments and formulate economic
policies. Sri Lanka is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s DSBB in July 2000. Quarterly national accounts and
monthly monetary and fiscal revenue data are published regularly. The authorities have
expressed their intention to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
appointed an SDDS coordinator in February 2003. However, substantial work is still needed for
meeting all SDDS requirements and preparing the necessary metadata before Sri Lanka is ready
for subscription.
Most data ROSC recommendations have been implemented while others are expected to be
implemented in the near future. In particular, most data are now being disseminated in the
Census and Statistics and central bank websites; a census of industries is underway while a
Census of Agriculture (including the North and East) has been finalized; a labor force survey is
being conducted on a quarterly basis; the CBSL has issued an advance release calendar and
designated a contact person to assist data users.
Outstanding Statistical Issues
Real Sector
Several consumer price indices are produced. The official price measures are the Sri Lanka
Consumer Price Index (SLCPI) and the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), produced by
the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). The SLCPI is based on the spending patterns
of the lowest 80 percent of households for the entire country excluding the Northern and
Eastern provinces. The CCPI is based on the spending patterns of the lowest 40 percent of
households within the Colombo municipal area. The CCPI, however, uses an outdated
consumption basket and weighting system and has become increasingly irrelevant as a measure
of general inflation. The DCS also publishes a Greater Colombo Price Index (GCPI), including
Colombo city and the suburbs. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) produces a Colombo
District CPI (CDCPI) and a Wholesale cum-Producer Price Index (WPI/PPI).
The national accounts suffer from a lack of data sources and from undeveloped statistical
techniques. Sri Lanka does not have periodic comprehensive benchmarks or a system for
conducting regular annual surveys of establishments. A statistical business register, which
would serve as the main basis for conducting sample surveys, is not available. As a result, the
few surveys that are conducted do not have good sample frames. Most of the data used for

39
regular compilation are obtained on a timely basis. However, detailed data needed to measure
both output and intermediate consumption are mostly unavailable or not collected. As a result,
the estimates of gross value added are prepared directly relying on outdated fixed ratios
established from the base year 1996, often with outdated studies or ad hoc assumptions.
Quarterly indicators are used for compiling quarterly value added estimates. The methodology
for deriving GDP at constant prices is not satisfactory. Expenditure estimates are available only
annually and rely mostly on commodity flow techniques. Whenever possible, estimates are
validated and checked with other sources.
Fiscal Sector
In May 2003, a STA mission followed up on the ROSC recommendation to develop
a migration path to compile data in accordance with the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). As part of that plan, the authorities agreed to revise
from end–2003 the budgetary classifications and the accounting structure to eventually
match the GFSM 2001 classifications of stocks and flows and to apply that chart of accounts
to all general government units. Progress with the implementation of these improvements
needs to be assessed. Cash data through 2005 were reported for publication in the 2006 GFS
Yearbook. These data cover only the budgetary accounts of central government. No data on
the four extra-budgetary funds or the provincial and local governments are provided. No
sub-annual data are provided for publication in IFS.
Monetary Sector
Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) are classified as resident institutions in the monetary
survey since 1998. To adjust for the proportion of nonresident foreign currency deposits
(NRFC), which are actually held by residents (mainly returning migrant workers), 50 percent of
these deposits are reclassified from foreign liabilities to domestic deposits.
In June 2003, a STA mission followed up on issues raised during the 2001 ROSC mission. In
particular, the mission clarified the methodology for the treatment of Fund accounts;
recommended that repos be treated as collateralized loans (rather than on a change of
ownership basis); and resolved discrepancies between the monetary authorities’ data reported
to STA and to APD, which reflected problems in the valuation of Fund accounts and different
methodological treatments.
The authorities have not submitted data for the monetary authorities’ accounts since
September 2006 and the most recent data published in IFS are for April 2006.
External Sector
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka publishes balance of payments statistics on a quarterly and
annual basis. Quarterly data are available three months after the end of the quarter. The data
largely follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.

40
A STA mission visited Colombo in December 2004. The highest priority issues identified by
the mission included dealing with some shortcomings in the international transactions reporting
system (ITRS), which is the primary data source for the balance of payments. The
recommended improvements included addressing the large values of unclassified transactions,
inclusion of FCBUs (foreign currency banking units) in the data, and providing an instruction
book to assist ITRS reporters to apply classifications and coding more accurately. The mission
advised the authorities on the need to develop a comprehensive survey to implement their
medium-term plan to introduce international investment position statistics. The GDDS website
indicates that FCBUs are now included in the data and that work has been done toward
compiling international investment position statistics.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
SRI LANKA
Debt Sustainability Analysis 2007
Prepared by the Staff Representatives of the International Monetary Fund1
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Mark Plant
November 7, 2007
The low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA) for Sri Lanka indicates a
moderate risk of debt distress for the external debt. However, this risk rises to moderate-tohigh when total debt service in foreign exchange, including public dollar-denominated
domestic commercial debt, is taken into account.2 The public DSA suggests that although Sri
Lanka’s overall debt dynamics are sustainable over the projection period, sound fiscal
adjustment and prudent macroeconomic policies are critical to help reduce the debt burden,
promote a favorable environment for refinancing, and lower interest costs going forward.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Sri Lanka’s total public debt stock (including publicly guaranteed debt) declined
to 95 percent of GDP in 2006 from its peak of 106 percent of GDP in 2003, benefiting
mainly from buoyant economic growth. The debt stock is composed of 46 percent, 7 percent,
and 47 percent of external debt, domestic dollar-denominated commercial debt, and domestic
rupee debt, respectively.
A. External Debt
2.
Sri Lanka’s external debt remains primarily concessional and public or publicly
guaranteed. Historically, multilateral and bilateral donors have been Sri Lanka’s main external
creditors comprising about 70 percent of total external debt during 2001–2006. At end-2006,
1

World Bank Staff were consulted in the preparation of this DSA. Co-authorship with the Bank is no longer
required as Sri Lanka has recently become a “gap” country for IDA.

2

Debt classification in Sri Lanka is based on the residency criterion. Public dollar-denominated commercial debt
issued to residents is classified under domestic public debt and includes SLDBs, FCBU borrowings and syndicated
loans from domestic sources; rupee-denominated public debt to nonresidents is classified under external debt; and
international sovereign bond issues as external debt.

43
medium-to-long-term debt accounted for about 82 percent of total external debt with an
effective interest rate of just over 2.5 percent, and a stable currency composition comprising
primarily SDRs, Japanese yens, and U.S. dollars.
3.
Although high in a regional context, Sri Lanka’s external debt stock and service
indicators have shown signs of

Paris club debt moratorium in 2005 and
subsequent resumption of payments in 2006.
B. Public Dollar-denominated Commercial Debt
4.
Sri Lanka has become increasingly reliant on dollar-denominated commercial debt
in the last two years to finance its budget while supporting reserves. The stock of debt
reached $1.6 billion by end-2006 (or 6 percent of GDP and about 65 percent of gross official
reserves). This debt consists mainly of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDB), loans from the
Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs), and syndicated loans from local and offshore banks.
The major funding source of SLDBs and FCBUs has been domestic foreign currency deposits
(FCDs), originated to a large extent from remittance inflows. The stock of this debt has an
average interest rate of LIBOR+150 bps and a short average maturity of 1½ year, resulting in a
bunching of debt service over 2007–09.
5.
In the first eight months of 2007 public dollar-denominated commercial borrowing
has continued mainly to rollover existing debt falling due. In March, the government issued
$215 million of SLDBs and in April borrowed an additional $210 million in syndicated loans
through foreign banks. The average maturity of the new debt increased to about 2½ years and
interest rates have remained favorable (i.e., LIBOR+150 bps). Nevertheless, debt service
pressures are expected to increase sharply from 2008 given the short maturity of this debt.
Preliminary estimates indicate that about $165 million would come due in the fourth quarter of
2007, and a total of about $600 and $800 million, respectively, are expected in 2008 and 2009.
6.
In October 2007, the government successfully debuted its $500 million Eurobond,
attracting $1.25 billion bids and was issued at a yield of 8¼ percent and maturity of
5 years. The authorities indicated that proceeds will be used in part to retire the most expansive
rupee debt. This issuance is also expected to help set a benchmark for the refinancing of future
SLDBs coming due, as well as for future issuance of corporate bonds.

44
C. Domestic Rupee Debt
7.
Sri Lanka’s domestic rupee debt consists mainly of treasury bonds and bills
(about 70 percent) and other loans including advances from banks. In recent years, the
share of longer term treasury bonds in the total stock of this debt has increased, reaching nearly
three times of treasury bills outstanding at end 2006. Interest rates on treasury securities have
increased substantially in recent years, from around 7½–10 percent during 2004–05 to about
12 percent by end 2006, and further to 18¼ percent at mid-October 2007, reflecting monetary
tightening of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in fighting inflation.
II. BASELINE
8.
Sri Lanka’s DSA builds on a baseline scenario of modest growth, fiscal
consolidation, and a gradual increase in commercial borrowing as concessional financing
declines in real terms (Box 1). Baseline assumptions take into account historical ten-averages,
a period of intense civil conflict, and also four-year historical averages since 2002 when the
peace agreement was signed. Given the current scale of the conflict, the latter may be the more
appropriate benchmark.

45
Box 1. Baseline Assumptions
• Real GDP growth over 2007–2012 is projected at 6 percent, spurred by increased economic activity
as mega infrastructure projects in the energy, ports, and roads come online. Over the longer run, real
growth is projected to moderate to 5.5 percent as the mega investments unwind and the economy returns
to a more modest growth rate. This is slightly above the historical ten-year average growth rate of
5 percent reflecting efficiency gains from earlier investments, but less than the historical four-year average
growth rate of 6¼ percent.
• The GDP deflator is projected to increase at 9 percent over 2007–2012 in local currency terms and
about 2.5 percent in U.S. dollar terms.
• Fiscal consolidation assumes a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 8½ percent of GDP in 2006 to
5 percent of GDP by 2010, and gradually to about 3 percent of GDP by 2027 while the primary fiscal
surplus (excluding grants) would be achieved from 2011 onwards. Key components of achieving this
target are tax revenue measures, including those introduced in the 2006–07 budgets (i.e., to broaden the
income tax base, strengthen tax administration, and improve the VAT system). These measures have
increased revenue by about one percent of GDP in 2006 and another 1 percent of GDP is expected in
2007. Rationalization of the recurrent expenditure and prioritization of the capital budget are expected to
compliment revenue efforts. Effective interest rates for public debt service are assumed to be positive in
real terms (averaged at about 2 percent).
• The current account balance is projected to decline from 5 percent of GDP in 2006 to about
3 percent of GDP by 2012 (as mega infrastructure investment imports decrease) and remain at that level
in the long-term. Export value growth is assumed at 9 percent over 2007–2012 and 8 percent over
2013–2027, slightly lower than the average growth rates of 10 percent over 2003–2006 due to increased
competition in the apparel and textile sector. Import value growth is projected at 9 percent over
2007–2012, higher than the historical average of 7 percent given higher oil prices and increased
investment imports for infrastructure investments. From 2013–2027, import growth is expected to
moderate to 8 percent.
• External reserves are assumed at around 2–2½ months of imports of goods and services over the
projection period. External financing in concessional terms is expected to decline as a ratio to GDP,
reflecting Sri Lanka’s income per capita increases to above IDA thresholds. A net increase in foreign
exchange borrowing is needed to compensate for this decline and would help maintain minimum reserve
coverage. Based on discussions on future financing plans with the authorities, the baseline assumes net
commercial borrowing from external creditors of about $100 million per year over 2008–12 and
$200 million from 2013 onwards; net borrowing in dollars from domestic sources of $300 million per year
over 2008−2012 and $200 million from 2013 onwards. The recent $500 million Eurobond issue has been
included, on the assumption of full refinancing when it falls due.

• Mega infrastructure financing of $2.5 billion, out of a targeted total of $4.5 billion, has been
included in the baseline over 2007−2012. Debt financing from bilateral and multilateral sources on soft
terms has been assumed, $1.5 billion of which has been committed as of mid-2007.

46
III. EXTERNAL DSA
A. Baseline
9.
The baseline scenario indicates medium-term external debt ratios are on a
sustainable path, reflecting a gradual decline in external concessional debt. Ratios of the
NPV of PPG external debt, as a percent of GDP, exports, and revenues, are projected to decline
over 2007–2027 (Table 1 and 2, and Figure 1) and remain well below the indicative thresholds
of debt distress for low-income countries with medium policy frameworks.12 The grant element
in external debt is projected to fall continuously, together with a mild degree of debt
decummulation given the projected extent of Sri Lanka’s market access.
10.
The baseline and historical scenarios reflect similar tendencies in the medium term
over 2007–2012. In the longer term they diverge slightly as the historical scenario reflects the
severe conflict, whereas the baseline reflects a moderate level of disruption to economic
activity from any renewed conflict. Nevertheless, both scenarios indicate that debt stock ratios,
including the planned mega infrastructure investments, would be contained even under a lowgrowth scenario as illustrated by the historical scenario.
11.
External debt-service ratios appear to be contained within the debt distress
thresholds. Both debt-service ratios initially decline over 2007−2012 as concessional debt
(including repayment of the Paris Club moratorium) is repaid, but subsequently rise from
2012 as repayments for the medium-term external commercial debt commences. This is
particularly marked for the debt-service-to-revenue ratio indicating that fiscal consolidation is
key to containing debt service pressures in the long-term.

Based on debt and debt service thresholds approved by Boards of the Fund and Work Bank for use in the
assessment of LIC DSA framework. Sri Lanka is classified as a medium performing country based on the average
of its 2004−06 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index (CPIA) score of 3.62.

47
B. Stress Tests
12.
Sensitivity analyses show a contained trajectory for PPG external debt stock ratios
but indicate potential vulnerabilities in the debt-service ratio under simultaneous shocks.
While a one standard deviation shock to the historical export value growth would increase the
NPV of external debt to GDP to 40 percent in 2009, a combined shock on GDP, exports, the
deflator and new borrowing, would increase it to 47 percent. Stress tests on the debt-service
indicators reflect increased vulnerability to export growth and combination shocks, particularly
in 2012 when the most extreme test shows an increase in the debt-service ratio to about
17 percent of exports and to 27 percent of revenues.
C. Inclusion of Public Dollar-Denominated Commercial Debt
13.
While the baseline external debt-service ratios are contained, total debt service in
foreign exchange including for servicing the public dollar-denominated commercial debt
is projected to increase sharply over 2008−2009. An illustrative simulation indicates that full
refinancing of the end-2006 debt stock at existing maturities (about two years), with new
money of $300 million each year over 2008-2012 and $200 million over 2013–2027, could
increase debt service in total foreign exchange to close to the debt service distress threshold of
20 percent of exports over the medium term (i.e., for countries with a medium CPIA rating).
Under the same scenario, debt-service to revenue would increase to 30–35 percent, above the
debt distress threshold of 30 percent (Figure 2).
14.
Lengthening the maturity of this short-term debt to beyond three years will be
essential to ease the bunching pressures in debt service going forward. In this regard, the
recent successful international bond issuance of $500 million at 5-year maturity (with a
substantial oversubscription) is encouraging, indicating a favorable market appetite for longerterm dollar instruments from Sri Lanka. This issuance would also help set a benchmark for
future issuance of longer term SLDBs. While FCD inflows are relatively stable, net annual
inflows, at about $200–$300 million in recently years, limit the scope for raising additional
funds from this source. As a result, Sri Lanka may need to continue to rely on international
capital markets for funds, in which case an increase in global risk aversion could lead to a surge
in risk premia.
IV. PUBLIC DSA
A. Baseline
15.
The baseline brings the path of the total central government debt to GDP from
about 90 percent in 2007 to 69 percent in 2012, and further to about 32 percent in
2027 (Table 3 and 4, Figure 3). Under this scenario, NPV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-revenue, and
debt service-to-revenue are expected to decline at a similar rate. The main contributor to this
improvement is fiscal consolidation and a continued growth/interest rate differential (as the real

48
growth rate is assumed to exceed the real interest rate on government debt by about 3 percent,
broadly similar to the historical average of the past 10 years).
B. Stress Tests
16.
Sensitivity tests indicate that a lack of fiscal consolidation could subject the
baseline to substantial risks. Assuming the baseline growth rate, but with fiscal deficit staying
around 7½ percent of GDP, the NPV of debt–to-GDP would decline to only about 83 percent
by 2027, well above the values in the baseline. Moreover, the NPV of debt-to-revenue and debt
service-to-revenue ratios would also exceed the baseline values by substantial margins. The
baseline is also sensitive to interest rate shocks. A one standard deviation increase in the
LIBOR and treasury rates (about 2 percentage and 3 percentage points, respectively) for 2008–
09 increases debt service costs as a share of revenue by about 4 percent over 2011–17,
narrowing to about 2 percent of revenue by 2027.
V. CONCLUSION
17.
Sri Lanka has a moderate risk of debt distress based on external debt service
indicators and a declining public debt stock to GDP under the baseline scenario of modest
growth and fiscal consolidation. The public DSA suggests that overall debt dynamics are
sustainable over the projection period. However, the risk of debt distress increases to moderateto-high when the total debt service in foreign exchange is taken into account. A credible fiscal
consolidation path over the medium term, together with prudent macroeconomic policies to
contain inflation and an effective debt management strategy to lengthening maturity, are critical
to help reduce Sri Lanka’s high stock of debt and debt service burden.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting
adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
SRI LANKA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asian and Pacific Department
(In consultation with PDR)
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Mark Plant
November 19, 2007
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This supplement provides information on recent economic developments that have
become available since the issuance of the staff report, including staff’s preliminary
assessment of Sri Lanka’s 2008 budget proposal unveiled on November 7. The new
information dose not change the analysis and policy recommendations contained in the
staff report. Paragraphs 9–12 below should be considered part of the staff appraisal.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
2.
The CBSL has recently revised down its real GDP growth projection to 6.7 percent
for 2007, from the original projection of 7.5 percent and closer to the staff projection of
6 percent. While overall economic activity has remained broadly strong, tea and rice
production has been adversely affected by labor disputes and adverse weather conditions,
while tourism continued to suffer from the unsettled security situation. Inflation sustained
at around 22 percent in September, reflecting a combination of demand pressures, rising
oil prices, and possibly an emerging wage effect following the minimum wage adjustment
in May/June.
3.
Market sentiment has been boosted by the recent issuance of Sri Lanka’s first
medium-term sovereign bond of $500 million. This bond issue helped a buildup in external
reserves to $3.2 billion by mid-November (from $2.6 billion at end-September), covering
2.7 months of imports. The improved prospects for the funding of the government also
helped to ease pressures on the rupee, which has appreciated by about 2 percent since late
October.
4.
The government has used the full amount of Rs. 56 billion from the bond issue to
retire high interest rupee treasury bills held by the CBSL, thereby reducing the CBSL’s
direct financing of the budget. The lowering of the government’s domestic borrowing

57
requirement seems to have helped to drive treasury security rates down to 15¾ percent in
mid November, from a peak of 18¼ percent in early October, while call money rates fell to
13–15 percent.
5.
Continuing increases in international oil prices have heightened balance of
payments risks. Based on the latest WEO projections, the current account deficit is
expected to widen to 5 percent of GDP in 2007 and 6½ percent of GDP in 2008.
III. THE 2008 BUDGET
6.
The 2008 budget proposal targets a marginal reduction in the fiscal deficit to
7.7 percent of GDP (from an estimated 7.8 percent of GDP in 2007). This falls
considerably short of the authorities’ earlier plan to lower the deficit to 6.3 percent of GDP
in 2008 (under the 2008 Budget Call announced in July), which was supported by staff.
The budget also entails major risks on both revenue and expenditure sides, raising
questions on the feasibility of the authorities’ medium-term plan to reduce the budget
deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2010 (Table 1).
7.
Achieving the proposed tax revenue target of 17.7 percent of GDP in 2008 (from an
estimated 16.3 percent in 2007) will be a challenge, in view of new measures estimated to
yield only about 0.6 percent of GDP.
•

The budget introduced some base-broadening measures, including limiting tax
holidays (i.e., by allowing the existing 5-year tax holidays to lapse, while
restricting future tax holidays to 3 years for major investment only), further
broadening the income tax base, and improving the collection of tax arrears. In
addition, significant increases are proposed in excises on motor vehicles and other
consumer durables, telecommunication, and liquor and cigarettes, as well as fees
and levies on services. Measures on trade, including a broadening of the cess
regime and an increase in surcharges on custom duties, could contribute to tax
revenue, but they may also potentially distort the trade system.

•

At the same time, the budget granted numerous new tax concessions (including for
the fishery, gem and jewelry, shipping, and textile industries), waived VAT on all
key development projects, and substantially reduced VAT on petrol to partly offset
the impact of price adjustments required under the automatic formula.

8.
Recurrent expenditure is budgeted to be contained in real terms, but its potential
overrun is sizable (estimated at around 2 percent of GDP).
•

The overall subsidies appear to be substantially underestimated in the budget. The
authorities decided to deviate from the automatic pricing formula for diesel and
kerosene, starting from January 1, 2008. The likely cost of this decision is
estimated at about 1 percent of GDP, while the budget seems to have omitted this
cost (by applying the oil price at $70 per barrel). Other subsidies, which are

58
budgeted to decline by 0.4 percent of GDP from the level in 2007, also seem to be
low.
•

Provisions for wages and salaries, as well as living and pension allowances, also
seem to be low, particularly as a number of new measures is expected to boost
recurrent spending. This includes the planned new recruitment of an additional
15,000 college graduates into public service, as well as additional funds to help
resolve distressed debt of government employees. Preliminary estimates indicate
that the costing of these policies could be around ½ percent of GDP.

•

Nevertheless, the ambitious capital budget, up by 2¾ percent of GDP (compared to
the historical trend) or by 1¾ percent of GDP (compared to the projected level in
2007), could provide a buffer (as in the past).

9.
Staff assessment indicates that the 2008 budget deficit target, at 7.7 percent of
GDP, is only a marginal consolidation (from 2007) and subject to significant risks of
deficit overrun, with heightened risks for debt sustainability and that could adversely affect
debt distress. Even if tax revenue targets are fully met, there could still be a potential
overrun in the recurrent spending, amounting to about 2 percent of GDP, mainly due to
oil subsidies and wages and allowances.1 In addition, to ensure the credibility of the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, there is a need to overperform the
2008 budget deficit target by about 1¼ percent of GDP in order to deliver the fiscal
consolidation path planned earlier.
10.
Staff calls for a total fiscal adjustment of about 1¼ percent of GDP (after
adjusting the buffer of 2 percent of GDP in the capital budget) to deliver the fiscal deficit
of 6½ percent of GDP in 2008 as indicated in the Staff Report. To this end, implementing
concrete revenue measures under the budget to deliver their intended targets will be
crucial. Additional measures to further streamline tax exemptions and broaden the VAT
base may also be needed to ensure that the impact of new tax incentives in the budget will
be fully compensated.
11.
On the expenditure side, staff urge the authorities to conduct an early review of oil
subsidies in light of the recent developments in world oil prices. The decision to deviate
from the automatic pricing formula for diesel and kerosene in 2008 could expose the
budget to large fiscal and quasi-fiscal risks, as recent increases in international oil prices
seem unlikely to be reversed any time soon. The authorities are encouraged to consider
full, or at a minimum, substantial partial pass-through to contain these risks, and also to
help promote energy conservation. This should be supported by a stronger social safety net
to protect the poor.
1

Military expenditure is budged at 3.9 percent of GDP in 2008, compared to the projected 4.2 percent of GDP
in 2007.

59
12.
The new public hiring is expected to have a lasting impact on the budget. While
near term corrective measures may be required, the authorities should also seek assistance
from the World Bank to review the need for civil service reform, aimed at containing the
overall wage bill in real terms as stipulated under the authorities’ medium-term
consolidation plan.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/138
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 29, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Sri Lanka
On November 21, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka.1
Background
Sri Lanka’s strong economic growth in the past four years has lifted per capita income to about
$1,300, well exceeding regional peers. Reflecting the economy’s resilience, in 2006, real growth
accelerated to 7½ percent despite the oil price shock and heightened security conditions.
There are, however, indications that the economy may be operating at full capacity given rising
inflation, a low unemployment rate, and a high current account deficit. High oil prices, slow fiscal
consolidation, and security concerns are key risks to the near term growth-inflation outlook.
Monetary policy tightening in 2006 was insufficient to contain inflation, but additional measures
were taken in early 2007. In January 2007, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced its
“Road Map” aiming at reducing inflation to single digit levels by the end of the year through a
tighter monetary stance. To this end, the CBSL limited banks’ access to the reverse repo
window and strengthened prudential measures to contain excessive exposure to sectoral risks.
Also, the CBSL stepped up open market operations and allowed treasury rates to increase to
17½ percent during January-June (from 12½ percent at end-2006). These measures, together
with a dissipation of pass-through effects from administered price adjustments, contributed to a
deceleration in inflation to (annualized) single digits in the first four months of 2007, and real
interest rates started to turn positive. This favorable inflation trend has, however, reversed since
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

62
May and inflation increased to 21¾ percent (yoy) in August due to the combined effect of the
elimination of remaining fuel subsidies, increases in food prices, and a pause in further
monetary tightening during that period.
The fiscal deficit target for 2007, at 7.8 percent of GDP, indicates a modest fiscal consolidation
from a deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP in 2006. This target envisages a substantial increase in tax
revenue, a full elimination of fuel subsidies, and a containment of the wage bill. Together, they
are expected to more than offset increases in military expenditure, spending on goods and
services, and capital spending. Revenue grew by 25 percent in the first half of 2007, but it was
still at about 40 percent of the ambitious annual target. Wages and military spending have been
contained as of June, but they could continue to be key fiscal risks in the period ahead. The
2008 budget proposal targets a marginal reduction in the fiscal deficit to 7.7 percent of GDP.
This falls considerably short of the authorities’ earlier plans to lower the deficit to 6.3 percent of
GDP in 2008 (under the 2008 Budget Call announced in July).
The external current account deficit is projected to sustain at around 5 percent of GDP in
2007 while reserves are expected to remain at around 2½ months of imports. In the first half of
2007, exports and remittances continued to grow strongly, while import growth decelerated
mainly owing to limited increases in world oil prices during that period. For the year as a whole,
healthy exports and remittances are expected to be largely offset by the implementation of
mega infrastructure projects and high oil prices since July.
In light of favorable local and global liquidity conditions in the last two years, the government
has continued to resort to dollar-denominated borrowing to finance the budget while supporting
reserves. By end-2006, the public domestic dollar commercial debt reached $1.6 billion
(or 6 percent of GDP) at an average maturity of 1½ years. Over 90 percent of this debt was
financed from domestic sources, including remittances. This has resulted in a bunching of
foreign exchange debt service over the next few years, but so far favorable market conditions
have allowed the government to refinance this debt at low cost. In October the government
successfully issued its first $500 million international sovereign bond at a yield of 8¼ percent
and maturity of 5 years.
Significant progress has been made in improving financial sector stability. Salient features
include a sharp decline in the NPL ratios across banks, a marked strengthening in the capital
base of the banking industry, and a sustained improvement in banks’ operating profits.
Moreover, implementation of the Basel Core Principles has advanced to facilitate a planned
adoption of Basel II in 2008. Nevertheless, underlying structural and operational weaknesses
remain. Further efforts should focus on improving banking sector resilience to shocks through
improving asset quality and strengthening credit and liquidity risk management; strengthening
risk-based supervision; and advancing structural and operational restructuring in public banks
and limiting state interference.
Financial viability of the energy sector is central to fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability
over the medium term. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is likely to incur financial losses of about
20 billion rupees (¾ percent of GDP) in 2007, due primarily to the lack of adjustment in
electricity tariffs, which have fallen well below cost recovery levels. A large part of these losses

63
was financed by loans from public banks, posing risks to the financial sector. The authorities’
medium-term strategy is to use alternative and cheaper energy sources to reduce Sri Lanka’s
heavy reliance on oil-based thermal power generation. The construction of three coal power
plants (total 900 MW) is expected to be completed during 2008–10. This will not only address
the acute energy shortage in Sri Lanka but also significantly lower the cost of energy production
(by about one-third from the current level) and bring the CEB to cost recovery levels.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Sri Lanka’s impressive recent growth performance, which has
led to a sharp reduction in unemployment and rising per capita income. At the same time,
Directors noted that growth has been underpinned in part by expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies, leading to an increase in macroeconomic and external sector vulnerabilities. In
particular, inflation has accelerated, the external current account deficit remains large, and
gross official reserves are relatively low. Directors urged the authorities to tighten
macroeconomic policies, while acknowledging that a return to political stability will also be
crucial in underpinning sustained economic progress going forward.
Against this background, Directors called for a determined effort to reduce the fiscal deficit to
5 percent of GDP by 2010–11 as planned. This will be essential to ensure public debt
sustainability and to create space for productive and social investment. Revenue mobilization
and current expenditure rationalization should be key elements of the adjustment effort. In
particular, Directors underscored the importance of streamlining tax exemptions, broadening the
income and value added tax base, simplifying the value added tax, and strengthening tax
administration. In this regard, Directors welcomed the downward revision of the fiscal deficit
target for 2007 stemming from an increase in tax revenue, elimination of fuel subsidies, and
containment of the wage bill. They called for a sharper fiscal adjustment than envisaged in the
2008 budget proposal, to ensure that the 2008 budget deficit target is consistent with the
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.
Directors noted the significant risk of public debt distress in Sri Lanka, arising from heavy
reliance on dollar-denominated, short-term commercial debt. They stressed the need to
lengthen and smoothen the maturity profile of the debt to reduce rollover and liquidity risks,
including through capital market refinancing, and to improve debt management in general.
Directors were concerned that the decision to deviate from the automatic pricing formula for
diesel and kerosene in 2008 could expose the budget to large fiscal and quasi-fiscal risks, if
international oil prices remain high or continue to rise. They called for full or significant passthrough of international oil price movements to contain these risks and to promote energy
conservation.
Directors considered that further monetary tightening in the near term is warranted in view of the
current fiscal risks, strong growth of credit, and inflationary pressures. They advised that open
market operations be stepped up and that treasury security rates be allowed to adjust to levels
that would help bring down inflation to single digit levels. Policy rates should also be adjusted
gradually to align them with market interest rates, thereby restoring their signaling role in the

64
conduct of monetary policy. Directors also encouraged the authorities to improve the
coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
Most Directors agreed that the real effective exchange rate remains broadly in line with
economic fundamentals, given the recent trade performance. Directors underscored that greater
flexibility of the exchange rate will be needed to reduce external vulnerabilities and safeguard
official reserves. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to let the exchange
rate be market determined, and called for continued attention to the exchange rate in light of
potential external pressures arising from high oil prices and the emerging debt refinancing
burden. They recommended that intervention in the foreign exchange market be limited to
smoothing excessive volatility of the exchange rate, while allowing for a build-up of foreign
reserves to more comfortable levels. The authorities were urged to eliminate the exchange
restriction arising from the remaining import margin requirement on motor vehicles
expeditiously.
Directors commended the progress in strengthening prudential regulations, enhancing
banking and insurance supervision and central bank operations, and improving financial
market infrastructure. They encouraged continued financial sector reform, guided by the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, with particular emphasis on further
improving banking sector resilience, strengthening risk-based supervision, advancing the
preparatory work for Basel II adoption in 2008, and accelerating the operational restructuring of
state-owned banks. Directors also urged the authorities to limit state interference in the
operations of state-owned banks, and some Directors renewed the call for privatization of these
banks.
Directors welcomed the launch of the authorities’ broad-based Ten-Year Horizon Development
Plan (2006–2016), which includes a comprehensive growth and poverty reduction strategy.
They underlined the importance of building consensus on the targeted mix of policies and
reforms. Regarding the energy sector restructuring plan, Directors welcomed the emphasis on
reducing energy costs. However, they called for timely measures to address the current
financial imbalances in the Ceylon Electricity Board, including adjustment of electricity tariffs to
cost-recovery levels accompanied by adoption of an appropriate safety net to protect the poor.

Despite numerous challenges faced during the year, Sri Lanka has been able to maintain its
growth momentum at a historically high level. Following the high growth of 7.7 percent in 2006,
Sri Lankan economy grew by 6.2 per cent in the first six months of 2007. The growth is broad
based with manufacturing and services sectors growing faster and agriculture sector too
contributing positively. The economy is projected to grow by 6.7 per cent in 2007. The
unemployment rate which dropped to a record low of 6.2 per cent in the first quarter 2007, has risen
marginally to 6.5 per cent during the second quarter largely due to a decline in employment in the
agriculture sector. However, unemployment will remain low due to creation of new employment
opportunities in the manufacturing and services sectors.
4.
Our authorities are well aware of the need to contain high inflation that is prevalent
at present. The inflation which decelerated till June 2007 reversed its trend since July
2007 attributable to upward adjustments in certain administered prices and removal of fairly high
subsidies on diesel and kerosene prices. Removal of subsidies, however, is expected to contribute
positively in lowering inflation in the future as it would reduce inflationary financing of the
Government budget. With a view to addressing the issue of high inflation Sri Lankan authorities
have also announced a “Road Map for Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2007 and
Beyond” indicating their commitment to contain growth in money supply and to bring down
inflation to a single digit level by end 2007. To contain money growth at targeted levels, a tight
monetary policy stance has been adopted by the Central Bank. Policy interest rates were raised by
50 basis points during the year whilst resorting to aggressive open market operations to maintain
market liquidity at a desired level. The tight monetary policy measures have enabled the Central
Bank to achieve reserve money targets during the first three quarters of the year. To ensure greater
transparency, our authorities have taken steps to strengthen the communication policy of the Central
Bank by issuing regular and occasional press releases for information of the public.
5.
As stated in our Buff statement last year, Sri Lankan authorities were well aware of the need
to contain fiscal deficit to avoid adverse ramifications associated with it. They also understand that

67
fiscal prudence is a necessary condition in successful economic management. While confirming the
line, our authorities have given priority to further strengthening fiscal consolidation process
through enhancing government revenue and rationalizing expenditure whilst maintaining adequate
public investment to provide impetus to growth. The authorities have taken measures to strengthen
tax administration, streamline tax incentives and exemptions whilst enhancing tax compliance and
enforcement. As a result of this concerted effort tax revenue has increased by 20.9 per cent in the
first nine months of 2007. The recurrent expenditure is expected to decline to 17.8 per cent in 2007
compared to 18.7 per cent in 2006 as a percentage of GDP. The overall fiscal deficit has been
declining steadily from 10.8 per cent in 2001. The revised Government Budget 2007 projects to
reduce the overall deficit to 7.2 per cent of the GDP as compared to 8.1 per cent in 2006. The
Budget 2008 proposes a further reduction of the deficit, although marginally, to 7.0 per cent of
GDP.
6.
Sri Lankan authorities are committed to maintaining a market determined exchange rate
with limited intervention in the domestic foreign exchange market only for smoothening any
excessive volatility. As noted by the staff in their paper on “Selected Issues” Sri Lanka’s external
competitiveness estimates of the equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) under various
approaches indicate that the current level of REER is broadly in line with economic fundamentals.
Import margin requirement (50 per cent) which was introduced in October 2006 on selected goods
was removed in May 2007. However, Sri Lankan authorities are compelled to maintain the 100 per
cent margin requirement imposed on selected vehicle imports purely as a prudential measure to
ensure broader macro economic stability.
7.
As an oil importing country, Sri Lanka is experiencing difficulties due to high and rising oil
prices. Oil import bill accounted for 20 per cent of imports in 2006. The rising oil bill continues to
exert pressure on the exchange rate and drain on reserves. The authorities have already removed
the subsidy on domestic prices and allowed petroleum companies to revise domestic prices of their
products in line with international market prices since July 2006. Further, the authorities have
encouraged the state owned oil company to enter into hedging arrangements as a risk management
measure. In spite of rising oil and food import prices, the external sector has shown a significant
improvement in the first 8 months of 2007. Export growth has been 11.7 per cent and this together
with slower growth of imports at 3.5 per cent, has resulted in a reduced trade deficit. Terms of
Trade too have shown a marginal improvement. The remittances by Sri Lankans employed abroad
have shown a growth of 17 per cent and this has helped finance over 80 per cent of the trade deficit
whilst containing the current account deficit at a low level. The foreign direct investments have
reached a record level of US$ 604 million in 2006 and the authorities are confident that this trend is
continuing further in 2007. With increased capital inflows, the overall Balance of Payments (BOP)
showed a surplus of US$ 192 million during the first half of 2007 and is projected to record a
surplus of US$ 450 million by end 2007. As a result, the gross official reserves are expected to
increase from US dollars 2,526 million at end 2006 to US dollars 2,971 million by end 2007. Our
authorities are committed to maintain this trend in the medium-term, as well.

The high level of public debt has drawn the attention of the authorities. The debt to GDP
ratio has continuously declined in response to the prudent measures adopted since 2004 when
public debt outstanding stood at 102.5 per cent of GDP. According to latest estimates, the
outstanding Government debt would decline further to 85.5 per cent of GDP in 2007. The
authorities are mindful of the issues discussed in the staff paper on Debt Sustainability Analysis.
Financial Sector Developments and Stability
9.
Financial sector in Sri Lanka expanded further assisted by increased competition,
innovations and growth in economic activities. Profitability, capital and asset quality indicators of
banks improved thereby witnessing the financial sector stability. However, some degree of
volatility in the money, exchange and capital markets was observed due to market uncertainty and
high inflation expectations. The authorities have adopted measures to improve risk management,
enhance access to finance, strengthen payments and settlement systems and improve supervision
and regulation of financial institutions. The Inter Regulatory Institutions Council was set up in
early 2007 to ensure effective regulation of financial conglomerates. The outlook for financial
system stability remains favourable as the capacity of the financial system to withstand and manage
risks at the institutional and infrastructure level has improved significantly. The Real Time Gross
Settlement System has operated with almost 100 per cent system availability. The cheque imaging
and truncation system became operational since early 2007.
10.
As stated in our Buff statement last year, our authorities do not consider privatization as a
panacea. Instead of privatization option, the two state owned banks have been given commercial
autonomy and they have performed extremely well manifesting this right decision. The financial
performance of the two state banks in 2006 outclassed many private and foreign banks in a highly
competitive environment of the banking industry in Sri Lanka. As a further step towards gradual
liberalization of the financial sector, foreign investors have been permitted to invest in Sri Lanka
Rupee denominated Government Securities subject to a limit. A new Companies Act incorporating
international best practices was enacted in 2007. The implementation of Basel II from January
2008, adoption of a mandatory Code of Corporate Governance for banks and moving towards
International Accounting Standards for financial reporting would undoubtedly contribute to further
improvement of stability in the financial sector.
11.
Our authorities are pleased with the success of the debut international bound issue of
US$ 500 million which was launched last month. It is encouraging to note that in the back drop of
adverse market conditions such as the subprime crisis, affecting investor sentiments around the
world, Sri Lanka’s inaugural bond issue received an overwhelming response from investors across
the globe. The authorities believe, that this is a clear manifestation of investor confidence in the Sri
Lankan economy. The authorities are of the view that the debut bond issue has enabled Sri Lanka
to establish its presence in the international capital markets and broaden the country’s investor base.
Further, the bench mark established by the Government with this bond issue would assist the large
private corporates of Sri Lanka to access international capital markets in the future. The authorities
intend to invest the proceeds of the bond issue in a number of large infrastructure projects including

69
a sea port, two power plants, two highway projects and several irrigation projects construction of
which have been approved in the Budget 2007.
12.
Recognising the value of the FSAP, our authorities engaged with the Fund and the Bank to
have an assessment early, in 2002. The recent update of the FSAP was requested for as many
improvements have been instituted in the financial system since the initial assessment. The
authorities have engaged in major reforms that have further enhanced the financial system as
acknowledged in the FSAP report. The resilience of the banking sector has grown with strong
improvements in the key performance indicators, in a challenging macro economic environment.
Legislative changes and other reforms have strengthened the regulatory and supervisory capacity of
the Central Bank and other regulatory bodies. With the implementation of Basel II from the
beginning of 2008, the risk management of banks and supervision of the banking system would be
strengthened further. The infrastructure for financial sector activity has been greatly improved. A
real time gross settlement system, a scripless security settlement system and a central depository
system for government securities have been put in place, as has a cheque imaging and truncation
system. Thus, a modern, efficient and reliable payment and settlement system is in operation.
13.
The authorities broadly agree with the observations by staff in the FSAP update. The
specific comment of the authorities on the two ROSCs are noted in Appendix I and Appendix II to
the FSAP. We would like to highlight a few comments in this Buff.
(a)
Our authorities are strongly of the view that privatization is not the only way to
improve the performance of state-owned enterprises. It can be achieved by
providing greater autonomy and operational independence. In fact, the vast
improvement in the performance of the two state-owned commercial banks in recent
years is clear testimony to this.
(b)

There is no evidence that the presence of the Secretary to the Treasury, in the
governing board of the Central Bank carries the risk of conflict of interest and lack
of independence. In fact, his presence on the Board has helped to ensure consistency
in policy and close co-operation between the Central Bank and the Ministry of
Finance.

14.
Our authorities are deeply conscious of the fact that continuous improvements are required
in any financial system to ensure its continued strength and resilience. As such, they will continue
to implement policies and changes to strengthen the stability of the financial system.
Structural Issues and Reforms
15.
Our authorities are well aware of the need for structural changes, reforms and market
development in order to sustain the growth momentum and alleviate poverty. Progress has been
made in introducing reforms in the existing public enterprises through the Strategic Enterprise
Management Agency which was set up a few years ago. Reforms in public administration includes
the introduction of IT systems in the registration of births, marriages and deaths and its data base

70
management. A legal reform project is underway at present and several regional Appeal Courts
were set up, this year, to accelerate legal proceedings relating to appeal cases which were hitherto
confined to one Appeal Court in Colombo.
Future Directions
16.
Our authorities have emphasized that the future direction of the economy will fall within the
framework of “Mahinda Chintana”, vision for a new Sri Lanka, a Ten Year Horizon Development
Framework 2006-2016” The strategies of this policy framework has been built on the basis of free
market concepts with domestic aspirations to provide necessary support to domestic enterprises
including small and medium enterprises and to encourage foreign investment. With the adoption of
this strategy our authorities are confident in maintaining a high economic growth ensuring a
regionally balanced growth whilst providing better livelihood for people including those who are in
abject poverty. The Sri Lankan authorities have embarked on several key infrastructure projects in
the areas of power generation, irrigation, high ways, ports and airports as part of the growth
strategy.
17.
Pursuant of efforts to widen the ambit of Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA)
to go beyond the horizon of trade in goods and include trade in services to facilitate greater
investment flows between the two countries as well as to explore new areas of economic
corporation, the Sri Lankan authorities have held several rounds of negotiations with the Indian
authorities under the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement signed between India and
Sri Lanka a few years ago. The relaxation of rules of origin, reduction of the existing negative list,
resolving the issues relating to implementation under ISLFTA, Customs co-operation and trade
facilitation, dispute resolution and preferential safeguard measures will facilitate further trade
expansion between the two countries. Sri Lanka which depends heavily on trade has a great
potential for trade expansion particularly with countries in the region.
