EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Macroeconomic performance over the past decade has been strong and steady, due in part to
confidence-enhancing policy frameworks and generally sound implementation. However, in
2005, growth slowed and inflation rose, reflecting an abrupt deceleration of house price
increases and a sharp increase in oil prices. While public debt is moderate, the fiscal deficit
remained above 3 percent of GDP in FY2004/05. The financial system is generally healthy,
although a substantial increase in the pricing of risk would pose risks. Evidence that a portion
of the population is not saving enough for retirement is raising concerns about the political
sustainability of the relatively frugal state pension system.
Key policy issues
Outlook: In 2006–07, growth is likely to pick up and CPI inflation to stabilize at the target.
However, large uncertainties—particularly from house prices, energy prices and
immigration—surround prospects for demand and supply. The current account deficit and the
negative net international investment position are not major concerns. The Treasury sees the
output gap as sizable but others—including staff—consider it to be modest.
Monetary policy: Staff agreed with the BOE’s response to slowing demand and rising
inflation in 2005, including the ¼ percentage point interest rate cut in August. MPC members
and staff generally considered the current policy stance to be appropriate, though some MPC
members saw downside risks to the growth forecast. Staff advocated that policy rate
decisions be focused in the very near term on averting second round effects of the energy
price increase and—after the pay rounds in early 2006—on ensuring that the recovery of
demand to trend growth is sustained.
Fiscal policy: The overall deficit is projected to narrow to 3 percent of GDP in FY2005/06,
reflecting mainly higher revenues from energy production and the booming financial sector.
The deficit is expected to narrow further over the medium term, due to expenditure restraint,
a tax increase on North sea oil and gas producers, and revenue buoyancy as the output gap
closes. On the basis on the same policy assumptions, the Treasury projects a deficit of 1½
percent of GDP in the medium term, while staff project 2 percent of GDP—still adequate to
stabilize debt at about 40 percent of GDP. The main difference between the projections
relates to the revenue gain from closing the output gap.
Financial stability: The banking system is well-capitalized and highly profitable. The health
of the insurance sector has improved substantially. Credit risk transfer instruments are
helping to diversify credit risk, but their rapid growth may also be creating new risks.
Payment and settlement systems have been strengthened.
Pensions: The Pensions Commission has proposed reforms that would largely address the
main obstacles to private saving for retirement identified last year. Treasury officials raised
several questions, including about affordability, a concern shared by staff.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
Macroeconomic performance in the
U.K. over the past decade has been strong and
steady. Between 1995 and 2004, the growth of
real GDP per capita was higher and less volatile
than in other G7 countries. Unemployment and
inflation were low and stable, and the current
account deficit was moderate. This impressive
performance was due in part to confidenceenhancing frameworks for monetary, fiscal,
financial, and structural policies, as well as
generally sound implementation (Box 1).

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation1
Fiscal policy: For several years, the Fund has pressed for policy measures to narrow the large fiscal deficit
and ensure that the fiscal rules are met. While the proposed adjustment was not initiated immediately,
better-than-expected oil and personal income tax revenue performance and recent commitments have
narrowed the gap between policy and Fund advice. The Fund and the authorities share the view that the
rules-based fiscal framework has constrained discretion and allowed automatic stabilizers to operate. In
the past year, the authorities broadened the scope of independent audit of the budget assumptions, as
recommended by the Fund.
Monetary policy: The Fund has praised the inflation targeting framework for its overall design and
consistently strong implementation.
Financial stability: In line with the recommendations of the 2002 FSAP, the authorities have enhanced
their surveillance of the financial system, improved the supervision of insurance companies, and
strengthened payment and settlement systems.
Structural policies: The Fund has supported the authorities’ strategies to boost productivity growth,
increase labor force participation, and encourage housing supply.

2.
However, in 2005, policymakers faced
their toughest challenges in several years. The
slowdown in real GDP growth and the rise in
inflation were sharper than in other G7 countries,
presenting a dilemma for monetary policy. The
deterioration in the general government balance
between 2000–04 was greater than in other G7
countries, so the fiscal deficit was large coming
into 2005. While the health of the U.K. banking
system compares favorably with that in other G7
countries, the possible reversal of unusually low

long-term interest rates in global financial markets poses a risk to the U.K., given the size of

II. BACKGROUND
3.
Slowing growth and rising inflation in 2005 reflected the U.K.’s advanced
cyclical position, the abrupt deceleration in house prices, and the sharp increase in oil
prices (Table 1). With economic activity above potential in 2004, some easing of growth and
rise of inflation were expected. In the event, the slowdown, which may be overstated in the
current national accounts data, was sharper than expected.1 It was driven primarily by private
consumption, which reflected previous monetary policy tightening, the cooling of the
housing market, and rising tax revenues (Box 2). In line with the deceleration in the increase
of house prices, the growth of residential investment fell sharply; business investment growth
was steady. As domestic demand decelerated, import growth slowed, but a drop in net
services inflows (due in part to insurance payments related to Hurricane Katrina) led to a
slight widening of the current account deficit. Employment growth remained surprisingly
rapid, owing in part to strong supply effects (immigration and increased labor force
participation by older people). The rise in CPI inflation reflected both the earlier testing of
supply constraints and the sharp increase in energy prices.

1

Current national accounts data for the first half of 2005 may overstate the slowdown, as
other indicators (employment, business surveys, profits, and tax receipts) imply stronger
activity. Real GDP growth is revised up after three years on average by ½ percentage point.

Box 2. Consumption and Housing Wealth
The cooling of the housing market over the past year can explain part of the recent weakness in
consumption. Staff have re-examined the relationship between consumption, disposable income,
unemployment, interest rates, financial wealth, and housing wealth, using data from 1987 (after
financial liberalization) –2005.1 An error-correction model suggests that a 10 percent increase in
housing wealth boosts consumption by about 0.7 percent in the long run, though the uncertainty
surrounding this estimate is large.
Consumption Growth

The model captures well the slowdown in
consumption growth between mid-2004 and mid-2005. A
counterfactual exercise suggests that—if real housing
wealth had continued to rise by about 2 percent per quarter
(the average in 2003) instead of flattening out—quarterly
consumption growth would have been higher by about
¼ percentage point. Looking forward, if house prices
grow less quickly than nominal GDP, the household
saving rate is likely to rise further.

The lowest growth rate and highest inflation rate since BOE independence
presented monetary policy with conflicting signals. In the early part of this decade, the

cut to 4½ percent in August.
5.
After having a strongly countercyclical influence during FY2001/02 and
FY2002/03, fiscal impulses were procyclical in FY2003/04 and FY2004/05.2 Over much
of the past decade, fiscal policy managed to contain—even reduce—debt while playing a
useful countercyclical role; fiscal consolidation during the boom of the late 1990s was
followed by fiscal expansion during the downturn of the early part of this decade. However,
the sharp increase in government spending on public infrastructure and public services that
began in FY2000/01 continued in FY2003/04—FY2004/05. The result, as growth picked up,
was a procyclical stimulus, a growing deficit, and a rising debt ratio. Yet, with low debt
compared to other G7 countries and a benign international environment, interest rates on
government debt remained low.

A longer-term question is whether private saving is adequate to support an
aging population in the context of a frugal state pension system. Prima facie, long-term
fiscal sustainability in the U.K. is helped by less severe population aging and a less generous
state pension system than in other G7 countries. However, if the working generation does not
save enough for its own retirement, future governments may be forced to increase state
pensions. A year ago, a government-appointed, but independent, Pensions Commission
concluded that almost half of the working age population over 35 (mostly middle-income
earners) is not saving enough to meet likely expectations of retirement income. The report
found that the main obstacles to higher private saving are the complexity of the pension
system, disincentives from means testing, the high cost of private pension products, and the
difficulty of making rational decisions about long-term saving.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Introduction
8.
The authorities and staff broadly agreed that policies were successful in the
difficult environment of 2005 and are well-positioned to ensure strong performance in
the future. Real GDP growth is expected to pick up in 2006–07 and CPI inflation to settle at
the 2 percent target. Monetary policy continues to anchor inflation expectations at the
inflation target. The financial sector is well-regulated and well-supervised and the outlook for
the sector is favorable, though supervisors are keenly aware of risks in the present global
environment. The authorities were confident that, with recently-announced initiatives, fiscal
policy will contain debt over the medium term below the 40 percent ceiling and keep the
current budget in balance over the officially-projected economic cycle. For the long term, the
authorities were less convinced than the Pensions Commission that private saving is
inadequate but welcomed the debate started by its final report, released just prior to the
mission’s arrival. The mission focused on four main questions:
•

How is the government responding to persistent large fiscal deficits, which—if
unchecked—would pose a threat to the fiscal rules?

•

How robust is the emerging recovery and how will it change the balance of risks from
weak demand growth and high energy prices in the BOE’s assessment?

•

How are the supervisory authorities addressing the possibility that low long-term
interest rates may reverse?

•

How much of a problem is low household saving for retirement and how could
shortfalls be remedied given limited public resources?

- 10 -

B. Economic Outlook
9.
A gentle pickup in economic growth is likely (Tables 2 and 3). In line with the
projections presented by officials at the Treasury and the Bank of England, staff expect that
real GDP growth will rise to 2½ percent in 2006 and 2¾ percent in 2007. This assumes a
continued favorable external environment. Private consumption growth, supported by
continued robust employment growth, is expected to return close to trend as the adverse
effects of rising debt service and energy prices, as well as of the deceleration of house prices,
wane. Business investment growth is projected to rise modestly, underpinned by robust
profitability, ample liquidity, and benign financial market conditions. The size of the increase
will be dampened, however, by continued high leverage and pension deficits, as well as the
ongoing adjustment to higher energy prices. Export growth is projected to remain strong, in
line with robust global growth, while import growth should pick up modestly in line with
domestic demand. CPI inflation is expected to fall slightly below the 2 percent target during
2006, as the effects of higher oil prices and previous pressures on capacity wane, and then
rise to target during 2007, as output growth picks up and import prices increase.

to 2008, a remarkably long period for an economy that is generally regarded as being quite
resilient.

The negative international investment position (IIP) and current account deficit
are not major concerns. The U.K.’s role as an international financial center implies large
gross external assets and liabilities, much larger (as a share of GDP) than in any other G7
country. As a result, valuation changes have big effects on the IIP, usually bigger than flow
effects; the standard deviation for both net portfolio investment and net foreign direct
investment is about 10 percent of GDP
(Appendix IV). Specifically, the fall in the IIP
Net International Investment Position
over the past two years was mostly due to

(in percent of GDP)
sterling appreciation against the U.S. dollar. The
authorities and staff expected the substantial

account to persist, noting that the U.K. earns

significant margins of uncertainty, staff observed that the latest CGER exercise suggests that
sterling is 0–15 percent above its medium-term equilibrium on a multilateral basis. Officials
concurred that there is not strong evidence of overvaluation and that the floating exchange
rate system is satisfactory.

Large uncertainties, however, surround prospects for both demand and supply:

•

Staff suggested that house prices are likely still overvalued, noting the elevated
ratios of house prices to average earnings and of house prices to rents. BOE officials
observed that estimates of overvaluation are highly sensitive to the level of real
interest rates—an increase in interest rates would significantly increase estimates of
overvaluation. However, the degree of estimated overvaluation is tempered by the
growing number of households,

The sharp increase in energy prices to date has raised the inflation rate and will
likely reduce aggregate supply. Staff analysis suggests that the doubling of energy
prices between end-2003 and end-2005 led to a peak first-round effect on inflation of
about ¾ percentage point and will cause a cumulative loss of output of about
1 percent, spread over 2006–08 (Box 3). BOE officials noted that their analysis
indicates the need for a fall in the real consumption wage of about 1½ percent. Staff
cautioned that, because the rise in energy prices has only recently come to be seen as
permanent, adverse effects on potential output are still likely. Any further price
increases would have negative consequences for growth and inflation.

•

Officials and staff concurred that significant immigration has likely helped to
alleviate specific skill shortages and thus acted to relieve inflationary pressures.
However, the magnitude and persistence of supply effects are difficult to judge.
Given the lack of reliable statistics, officials offered different views on the extent to
which increased immigration is a new phenomenon. Some argued that it has been
apparent for a while, for example in the reports of the BOE’s regional agents. Others,
however, pointed to an increase in immigration following the relaxation of border
regulations in May 2004 to allow new members of the EU full access to the U.K.
labor market. The latter argued that the number of additional migrants could well be
about 100,000 (about ¼ percent of the working-age population). The net impact on
economic slack depends on migrants’ effect on aggregate demand, but it is likely to
be positive. Going forward, immigration from new EU members could slow (if the
stock adjustment has already largely occurred) or rise (as migration pathways become
more established). In either case, labor supply will likely be more elastic than in the
past.

•

Officials acknowledged risks of a sharp change in exchange rates, but thought
that they were low probability. A disorderly resolution of global imbalances could
result in exchange rate appreciation, although—in the past—sterling appreciation
against the U.S. dollar has been largely offset by depreciation against the euro. In
contrast, further increases in US and euro area short-term interest rates (combined
with roughly unchanged U.K. rates) could put downward pressure on sterling.
C. Monetary Policy

13.
The combination of slowing house price appreciation and rising energy prices
was a challenge for monetary policy in 2005. Members of the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) had different perspectives on the extent to which the cooling housing market was a
cause rather than a symptom of the economic soft patch. They agreed, however, that the
weakness of aggregate demand in 2005 had—other things equal—raised the question of
whether monetary policy easing was needed. At the same time, the boost to inflation from

- 14 -

Oil prices roughly doubled between end-2003 and
end-2005. The evolution of futures prices suggests that
expectations of the permanent component of the price
increase rose gradually over that period. Using a
variant of the Fund’s Global Economic Model
incorporating energy (oil and natural gas), staff
estimate the impact on the U.K. economy of this price

energy, while the initial decline in domestic demand
was modest, because a large portion of the price
increase was expected to be temporary. However,
looking ahead, the negative effects on both demand and supply are projected to grow over the next
three years to about 1 percent. The adverse supply impact is due to firms’ adjustment to the
permanent increase in a factor cost, while the negative demand effects reflect households’ realization
that their real incomes will be permanently lower and firms’ reduced demand for investment goods.
Over time, the positive effect on energy production is more than offset by the adverse impact on nonenergy output.
The results suggest that about half of the 1½ percentage points rise in CPI inflation between
September 2004 and September 2005 was due to the energy price shock. Inflation should fall back to
baseline quickly, as long as three conditions hold: the reduction in the economy’s supply capacity is
fully recognized in monetary policy, labor suppliers accept the permanent reduction in their real
wages, and energy prices do not increase further.

higher energy prices had risked affecting inflation
expectations, suggesting the need for caution in cutting
interest rates. Supporting the MPC’s decision in August
2005 to cut the policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point to
4½ percent, staff agreed that it had been a finely balanced
one.
14.
Most MPC members and staff considered the
current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate. In
the BOE’s—and staff’s—baseline projections, CPI inflation
is expected to reach the 2 percent target at the 2-year
horizon, assuming no second-round effects from oil prices,
a narrowing of the small output gap, continued increases in
import prices, and well-anchored inflation expectations.
The spread between nominal and RPI-indexed bond yields
is stable at 2¾ percent, consistent with the CPI target of
2 percent.3 Some MPC members were concerned about
downside risks to the growth forecast and the minutes of
the MPC meeting immediately preceding the mission
showed that one MPC member felt that rates should be
lower. The authorities and staff saw the current policy rate
as broadly within a neutral range, though some MPC
members characterized it as mildly accommodative.

The flat yield curve reflects low long-term interest rates rather than tight
monetary policy. The decline in long-term rates over the past year could be due to a variety
of factors, including a fall in the risk premium (possibly reflecting the entrenchment of
macroeconomic stability), increased household saving for retirement, and a portfolio shift
toward long-term bonds (especially by pension funds). More generally, low long-term rates
are a worldwide phenomenon, likely reflecting a combination of high desired saving relative
to desired investment and a possible under-pricing of risk.
16.
The next policy move should depend mainly on wage developments and evolving
evidence on strengthening demand, an approach staff supported. Some MPC members
saw avoiding second-round effects from higher energy prices as the priority, while others
were more concerned about prospects for a recovery of demand growth. Thus far, there is no
sign that workers are resisting the decline in the real consumption wage implied by higher
energy prices, with average earnings growth subdued and pay settlements steady at their
recent historical average. However, many wage negotiations are traditionally concluded in
the early part of the year, so it will be important to monitor them for evidence of real wage

resistance. At the same time, with a rebound in
consumption already underway, MPC members
would be looking for evidence that other components
of demand—notably business investment and
exports—are picking up as envisaged in their baseline
projections. Staff observed that opposing effects on
aggregate supply from higher energy prices and
increased immigration would also influence prospects
for inflation. An important medium-term
consideration is whether the government will deliver
on promised expenditure restraint starting in 2008,
potentially producing a negative fiscal impulse. The
authorities noted that this is still beyond the 2-year
horizon relevant for monetary policy decisions.

D. Fiscal Policy
17.
The expected improvement in the fiscal balance in FY2005/06 is the beginning of
a planned medium-term reversal of recent large deficits (Table 5). The December 2005
Pre-Budget Report (PBR05) projects a reduction in the cyclically-adjusted overall deficit
relative to GDP of ¾ percentage point in FY2005/06. The cyclically-adjusted current deficit
is expected to narrow even more, given the projected increase in capital spending. The two
main factors behind the improvement are higher tax revenues from North Sea energy
production and higher tax revenues from the financial sector, reflecting a combination of the
continued strength of global financial activity, the relatively high effective tax rates on
financial sector incomes, and anti-avoidance measures. Staff concur with the changes in the
cyclically-adjusted balances in FY2005/06 relative to FY2004/05, though not with the levels
of the cyclically-adjusted balances in FY2005/06, reflecting the differences between the
Treasury’s and staff’s estimates of the output gap.

18.
Treasury officials expected the overall deficit to narrow to about 1½ percent of
GDP over the medium term. The further improvement in the cyclically-adjusted deficit
relative to GDP by ¾ percentage point during FY2005/06—FY2010/11 reflects three main
factors: fiscal drag; expenditure restraint starting in FY2008/09; and a recently-announced
increase in the supplementary income tax rate on North Sea corporations. Specific plans to
underpin the envisaged expenditure restraint are currently being developed as part of an
overall review of government spending, the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR), due to
be completed in mid-2007. The Treasury expects the non-cyclically adjusted balance to
improve by an additional ¾ percentage points of GDP. The underlying and unadjusted
current balances would improve by similar amounts, as capital spending is projected to
remain roughly constant as a share of GDP.
19.
Staff welcomed both the intention to further reduce the overall deficit and the
emphasis on spending restraint, which are in line with Fund advice. The desirability of
early adjustment based on slowing the growth of current spending is underlined by staff
analysis (Box 4). With nondiscretionary spending (Annually Managed Expenditure), such as
social security benefits and interest payments, amounting to about 40 percent of total
spending, the real growth of discretionary spending (Departmental Expenditure Limits) will
need to fall to less than half of recent rates. Regarding the possible adverse effect of the

- 18 -

announced increase in income taxes on North Sea corporations for incentives to invest in
energy extraction, Treasury officials noted that—with higher energy prices—expected aftertax rates of return on investment are still high (above 20 percent). Staff analysis suggests that
corporate taxation becomes less distortionary as profit margins rise.

Box 4. Fiscal Adjustment—Timing and Composition
Early fiscal adjustment focused on containing the growth of spending would have the most
favorable impact on output in the medium term, according to staff estimates based on simulations
using the IMF’s Global Fiscal Model calibrated to the U.K..1 In the baseline scenario (delayed
consolidation), fiscal deficits are financed for five years by issuing debt, before taxes are eventually
raised. Alternatively, early consolidation dampens aggregate demand in the short term but increases
output in the long term because the government’s interest payments—and thus tax rates—are lower.
Regarding the composition of adjustment, spending restraint has a more favorable effect on output
than tax increases because of the adverse supply effects of higher taxes. In net present value terms,
the gain is about 6 percent of one year’s GDP for early consolidation through spending restraint and
about 3 percent through higher revenue. Corporate income taxation is less distortionary if profit
margins are higher, because a larger share of the tax burden falls on rents rather than the return to
capital.

Staff projections suggest that the overall deficit will narrow to 2 percent of GDP
by FY2010/11, somewhat less than projected by the Treasury but still adequate to
stabilize debt. Given expected nominal GDP growth of about 5 percent over the medium
term, an overall deficit of about 2 percent of GDP is sufficient to contain net debt at about
40 percent of GDP. Staff project the current balance to improve to about ¼ percent of GDP

by FY2010/11. Given that the policy assumptions are the same, the main difference between
staff’s and Treasury’s medium-term projections relates to the revenue gain from closing the
output gap. In addition, staff projects a more

Staff noted that the fiscal framework is at the forefront of international best
practice. Although fiscal policy has recently produced large deficits and not avoided
procyclical behavior, there appears to be widespread acceptance that the framework has
constrained discretion. Moreover, the framework—which goes well beyond the rules per
se—has particular strengths, including clarity, transparency, and reliance on independent
audit. The National Audit Office (NAO), which is independent of the government and reports
directly to Parliament, audits key assumptions and conventions underpinning the fiscal
projections (Box 5). Staff welcomed the Treasury’s recent decision to ask the NAO to audit
the redesignation of the start of the current economic cycle from 1999 to 1997.4 Treasury
officials noted that the NAO had found the Treasury’s methodology to be reasonable. Staff
suggested that, for the government to get due credit for its fiscal framework, transparency
would be improved by extending the reach of NAO audit.

4

The dating of the economic cycle is critical to measuring fiscal performance against the
golden rule (current balance or better over the cycle).

- 20 -

Box 5. National Audit Office (NAO)
The NAO was established with a view to creating robust arrangements to ensure the independence of
public auditors from the government. The 1983 National Audit Act gave the Comptroller and Auditor
General express power to report to Parliament at his own discretion on the economy as well as on the
efficiency and effectiveness of government spending. In 1997, the government invited the NAO to
audit key assumptions and conventions underpinning the fiscal projections, so as to ensure that the
forecasts are consistent with the principles of transparency and responsibility. This role was formalized
under the Code for Fiscal Stability in 1998, which also requires the Treasury to publish any advice it
receives. Since 2000, the NAO has audited key assumptions at the time of the Budget and Pre-Budget
Report on a three-year rolling basis.

Staff asked whether the precise dating of the cycle might be undermining the
objective of the golden rule. Staff supported the rule as a means of protecting investment
spending and guarding against procyclical fiscal policy, but noted two problems with its
current application. First, different methodologies yield different interpretations of the
economic cycle, so the attempt to be precise about dating the cycle inevitably leads to
controversy.5 Second, meeting the rule could require procyclical policy toward the end of a
cycle.6 Staff suggested that an exclusively forward-looking interpretation of the golden
rule—for example, a rolling target of balance 3-years hence for the current budget—would
reduce these drawbacks. However, to preserve credibility, a new interpretation of the golden
rule should not be introduced until the current budget is back in balance. The authorities
responded that precise dating provides a clear ex post test of whether the golden rule has been
met, arguing that under previous governments fiscal rules had foundered because they lacked
such a test.
5

For example, on staff’s estimate of the output gap, the previous cycle ended in FY2003/04.
Had a new cycle of FY2004/05 to FY2008/09 been designated, the golden rule would not be
met on the authorities’ or staff’s current projections.

E. Financial Stability
23.
Increased macroeconomic stability and financial innovation are positive
developments, but are also changing the landscape of risk. Low and stable inflation and
less volatile economic growth have reduced uncertainty about future cash flows, but this may
be leading some investors to be overly optimistic about policymakers’ ability to offset
macroeconomic shocks. At the same time, rapid financial innovation, notably in derivative
and securitization markets, has facilitated risk diversification, allowing banks in particular to
transfer credit risk to a wide base of investors, and thus increased the capacity of the financial
system to bear risk. However, the authorities and staff agreed that risk transfer markets have
made the ultimate destination of these risks more opaque, complicated contract enforcement
problems, and enabled the build-up of leverage. Together, macroeconomic stability and
financial innovation have contributed to expectations of continued low asset price volatility
and low risk premia, though some investors may be overly sanguine about the underlying
risks of some financial products, particularly in the current low yield environment.
24.
In this environment, the authorities are pursuing several policy strategies. First,
they are raising awareness by publicizing risks to the outlook, to focus attention on common
exposures. Second, they are continuously improving their ability to respond to shocks,
including through crisis simulation exercises based on natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and
macroeconomic events. Third, they are broadening and deepening their analysis, for example
to smaller financial institutions and to the strategic interactions between investors.

sudden shifts in international capital flows could disrupt a wide range of asset markets,
potentially leading to costly and disorderly adjustments in banks’ balance sheets. Staff and
officials agreed that the banking system is well-positioned to absorb substantial shocks.
26.
The health of the insurance sector has improved substantially over the past three
years. Balance sheets have benefited from rising equity prices, and progress has been made
in reducing risk within investment portfolios. Officials agreed that the quality of capital
remains weak for some insurers and that risk management expertise is still variable across
firms. Accordingly, the authorities introduced in January 2005 a risk-based approach to
determining capital adequacy (the Individual Capital Assessment regime), which aims to
improve risk management through an interactive process between insurance companies and
the FSA. The FSA is also pushing for greater contract certainty.
27.
Credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments are helping to diversify credit risk, but
their rapid growth is creating new risks. Noting that London, along with New York, is a
global center for the CRT market, officials shared staff’s concern that the pace of innovation
may have exceeded the development of market infrastructure and financial institutions’ risk
management systems, leading to a risk that a shock to the financial system could be
exacerbated by increased exposures to these instruments. Recognizing that the confirmation
and assignment backlogs in structured credit markets could give rise to settlement problems,
officials said that market participants have been collaborating with regulators in the U.K. and
abroad to eliminate these backlogs. While staff analysis suggests that exposures may be welldiversified across large U.K. banks and insurance companies (Box 6), staff asked about the
scope to increase market participants’ disclosure to the FSA of exposures to CRT
instruments. Officials acknowledged that supervisors in other major financial centers collect
more data, but were reluctant to increase the formal reporting burden on U.K. financial
institutions, especially when they are not sure which data series would adequately capture
key risks.8 For the time being, they preferred to focus on gathering market intelligence.

Officials noted the high regulatory burden on financial institutions from the implementation
of Basel II, IOSCO rules, IFRS, and other EU and U.K. initiatives.

Box 6. Financial Stability and the Credit Risk Transfer Market
Staff analysis suggests that the rapidly-growing global credit derivatives and structured credit market
does not pose a substantial threat to large U.K. financial institutions.1 A direct assessment of
financial institutions’ exposures is not possible, given the lack of information on their portfolio
holdings. An indirect approach is to proxy exposures by the extent to which the variability of a
financial institution’s equity returns is explained by the variability of actively-traded collateralized
debt obligation (CDO) tranches. In this market, banks have

protection) and insurance companies net buyers of CDOs
(sellers of protection). The empirical results suggest that
large insurance companies are more exposed to volatility

in the more senior (i.e. less risky) CDO tranches, while
large banks are more exposed to the junior tranches. The
results also suggest that large U.K. financial institutions as 3

However, this indirect approach cannot address the
exposures of financial institutions that do not have market0

28.
Officials pointed to the strengthening of payment and settlement systems in line
with the recommendations of the 2002 FSAP. Over the past two years, actions have been
taken to reduce the level of intraday interbank exposures and to reduce settlement risk in
money market instruments and retail payments. The mission observed that clearing activities
are increasingly being undertaken within banks, for example in the processing of CRT
transactions, so these activities are becoming more important for financial stability.
F. Population Aging
29.
Population aging will increase pressures on pension and health spending.
Officials noted that the Budget presents illustrative 30-year fiscal projections and the LongTerm Public Finance (LTPF) Report provides more detailed scenarios and sensitivity
analysis of long-term risks. The baseline projections in the December 2005 LTPF Report
suggest that, to stay below the 40 percent of GDP net debt ceiling, the required improvement
in the primary balance is only about ¼–½ percentage points of GDP per decade starting in
the 2040s.
30.
The Pensions Commission has proposed reforms that would largely address the
main obstacles to private saving for retirement identified last year (complexity, meanstesting, cost, and myopia). There are three key recommendations: (i) to reduce the spread of

- 24 -

means testing by indexing the flat-rate state pension to average earnings from 2010 (it is now
indexed to inflation), (ii) to introduce a national defined-contribution scheme with automatic
enrolment and low operating costs, and (iii) to raise the state pensionable age from 2020,
which would help offset the fiscal cost of the more generous flat-rate state pension. Staff
observed that the recommendations would retain the complexity of the current system. A
member of the Pensions Commission did not disagree, but noted that over the long term the
system would become simpler and that a radical shift to a simpler system now would be too
disruptive and costly.
31.
Treasury officials had mixed reactions to the Pensions Commission’s proposals,
ahead of the government’s official response expected in the spring. First, officials
noted—as in the past—that the Pensions Commission does not take housing wealth into
account in forecasting the saving gap. Staff concurred that estimates of the gap are uncertain.
Second, to the extent that a saving gap exists, officials agreed with staff that a definedcontribution scheme with automatic enrolment could be useful. Third, regarding the state
pension system, officials noted that the Commission’s proposals would involve higher
government spending, especially during 2010–20. They argued that this spending would have
to compete with other government priorities and should be considered as part of the CSR.
Staff agreed with this concern, but observed that the reform proposals would be close to
fiscally neutral by 2050. Fourth, officials saw no definitive evidence that means testing
reduced saving and that—in any event—the spread of means testing could be reduced by
lowering the minimum guaranteed pension income relative to average earnings. Staff
observed that, under reasonable assumptions and in the absence of reform, about 70–
80 percent of retirees would be subject to means-tested benefits by 2050. Moreover, the
introduction of a defined-contribution scheme would be less successful if the state pension
system were not reformed, as the spread of means testing would discourage private saving.
32.
The Treasury projects that health
spending will rise by only 1½ percentage points
of GDP between 2007–50. This relatively small
increase in spending is consistent with less
pronounced population aging in the U.K.
compared to other industrial countries. However,
the relative price of health services has increased
steadily over the past 50 years, reflecting
technology-driven cost increases and shifts in
consumer preferences. In staff’s central scenario,
based on historical trends in the price of health
services, health spending will rise relative to GDP
by 6 percentage points between 2007–50.9
Treasury officials said that uncertainties

are large and noted that the EU Aging Working Group has not yet reached a consensus on
how to incorporate such factors. Staff welcomed the discussion in the LTPF Report of these
uncertainties and urged that quantitative analysis of nondemographic factors be published to
promote fiscal transparency and thus raise the level of the public debate.
G. Other Issues
33.
The labor market is flexible and dynamic, though labor productivity lags the G7
average. The employment rate is the highest among the G7 countries and the government’s
aspiration is to increase it further. In line with OECD recommendations, staff supported the
authorities’ strategy to lower the inactivity rate due to incapacity through a combination of
expanded active labor market policies and a planned reform of the incapacity benefit, which
would increase conditionality and reduce complexity. Although the growth of output per
hour in the U.K. has been faster than in other G7 countries over the past decade, a
productivity gap remains. Staff backed the authorities’ strategy of addressing the five main
drivers of productivity growth (innovation, enterprise, competition, investment, and skills),
including its current focus on regulatory reform. Staff and the authorities agreed that
immigration, particularly from new EU members since mid-2004, was helping to relieve skill
shortages.

The U.K. is a strong supporter of the Doha Round and of further reform of the
EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). While the EU has agreed, within the Doha
Round negotiations, to end all agricultural export subsidies by 2013, the authorities would
have prefered an end date of 2010. The authorities support a WTO agreement that reduces
trade-distorting agricultural protection. Officials added that the government is working
through the EU to ensure that WTO members, particularly industrial countries, make
significant offers on financial services in the coming negotiation round. Within the EU,
where financial services are already covered by a number of legislative measures designed to
open up the single market, notably under the Financial Services Action Plan, the U.K. will
continue to work toward the liberalization of markets for other services.

The U.K. is committed to achieving the United Nations’ target for ODA of

FY2007/08, with the goal of reaching the target by 2013. Officials noted that, if the proposed

The U.K. is continuing to strengthen its AML/CFT regime, in line with FSAP
recommendations. New guidance, produced by the financial sector to help implement
legislative requirements, came into effect in January 2006. This guidance will allow financial
firms to take responsibility for establishing their own risk-based approaches for focusing
compliance resources on the most vulnerable areas. Officials emphasized that proposals for
new measures should be assessed using cost-benefit principles, as with other aspects of
financial sector regulation. On the international front, the U.K. drafted a joint proposal and
action plan for AML/CMT, which was endorsed by the G7 in April 2005 and has
subsequently improved collaboration in asset freezing, information sharing, and the
disruption of criminal activity.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Macroeconomic performance in the United Kingdom remains remarkable. The
economy has now expanded continuously for more than 13 years, with only shallow
fluctuations in growth. Employment has risen strongly as temporary slowdowns in demand
were absorbed mainly by moderation of wage growth rather than by increases in
unemployment, which remains close to its historic low. The economy is in the longest period
of sustained low inflation since the 1960s. This success is due in part to monetary, fiscal,
financial, and structural policy frameworks that have increasingly instilled confidence that
policies will be conducted to achieve a strong and stable economy.
38.
In 2005, these frameworks were tested. The slowdown in real GDP growth and rise
in inflation were the sharpest in a decade, presenting the Bank of England with unusually
difficult choices. The slowdown also complicated fiscal policy: with no adjustment during
the cyclical upswing in 2003–04 and a fiscal deficit above the Maastricht limit of 3 percent of
GDP, policy action needed to be initiated in a weaker setting. On the financial side,
supervisors, overseeing a system with strong performance indicators, were cognizant of the

- 27 -

need to stay abreast of financial innovations in an environment marked by concerns about
possible global underpricing of risk. And in a longer term perspective, the authorities are
confronting evidence that inadequate private savings for retirement may threaten the
sustainability of a relatively frugal state pension system.
39.
Prospects for 2006–07 suggest a more favorable environment. As the factors that
dampened demand in 2005—especially the deceleration of house prices and earlier monetary
policy tightening—start to wane, real GDP growth is projected to rise to 2½ percent in 2006
and 2¾ percent in 2007. CPI inflation is expected to fall slightly below target in 2006,
reflecting the opening of the output gap, and then to rise to target in 2007. The current
account should remain in moderate deficit. A risk to the outlook is the housing market, where
valuations remain high by some metrics despite the stabilization of prices during the past
year.
40.
Against this background, monetary policy decisions remain delicately balanced.
In 2005 monetary policy successfully navigated the slowdown in demand and rise in energy
prices. With no signs of second-round effects of the oil price increase but a sharp
deceleration in demand, the ¼ percentage point cut in the policy interest rate in August
acknowledged the downside risks to demand, while keeping the rate in a neutral range.
Looking ahead, the immediate focus of policy should be on remaining risks of second-round
effects from the oil price increase. Once such risks have eased further, interest rate decisions
should be increasingly guided by whether demand remains on track to close the output gap.
Decisions will also need to take into account the experience of the next year with
immigration, which should help resolve questions about the size and duration of the surge in
inflows.
41.
The authorities’ plans for fiscal adjustment are welcome. The underlying overall
and current deficits are on track to narrow substantially this fiscal year, reflecting windfall
revenues from higher energy prices as well as strong personal income and corporate tax
revenues, especially from the booming financial sector. A plan to reduce the fiscal deficit—
including fiscal drag, current spending restraint to start in FY2008/09, and the recentlyannounced increase in the tax rate on energy company profits—is coming increasingly into
focus. On staff’s projections, these actions would move the current budget to a small surplus
and the overall deficit to about 2 percent of GDP. This would be sufficient to stabilize net
debt at 40 percent of GDP, though not to reach the government’s target of an overall deficit
of 1½ percent of GDP. Nor would these measures be sufficient to avoid the risk of
procyclical policy under the present interpretation of the golden rule (current balance or
better over the cycle).
42.
The envisaged expenditure restraint will require careful planning. Given the
relatively small share of discretionary spending in total and the government’s intention to
keep capital spending at post build-up levels, the choices will be extremely difficult. The test
will be to ensure that early promises do not fade in the face of what will undoubtedly be
tough decisions and that these decisions truly target the least productive or essential

- 28 -

expenditures. The process will benefit from the zero-based approach to the forthcoming
Comprehensive Spending Review, due for completion in mid-2007.
43.
The fiscal framework, combining a high standard of transparency and concrete
measures of performance, remains impressive. One particular strength of the fiscal
framework is the use of independent auditing, which puts the U.K. at the forefront of
international best practice. Since 1997, the government has asked the NAO—which is
independent of the government and reports directly to parliament—to audit 11 assumptions
and conventions underlying the fiscal projections. This has been instrumental in building
confidence in the bases for the projections. In the past year, the government added to that role
by subjecting to audit the decision to move the start of the present cycle back two years.
Further extending the range of NAO audit—for example, to include the current amount of
economic slack—would be welcome.
44.
However, the important role of the fiscal framework is being weakened by a
peripheral controversy regarding the dating of the economic cycle. While staff see the
framework as having constrained discretion, the authorities’ redating of the cycle—both
backward and forward—has generated public criticism and even skepticism. Therefore, once
current balance is regained, consideration should be given to alternative interpretations of the
golden rule that place less emphasis on the definition of the cycle—a difficult concept in an
economy that displays unusually muted cyclical behavior. In this vein, the government could
consider a more forward-looking formulation that ensures fiscal policy is positioned to
produce current balance in a set number of years. A shift to a more forward-looking
interpretation of the golden rule would best be accompanied by an extension of the range of
independent audit to bolster credibility.
45.
Financial authorities are skillfully meeting the challenge of overseeing a global
financial center. Well-capitalized and cost-efficient, banks appear to be well-positioned to
absorb losses that might arise from the most likely types of financial market disturbances.
Supervisors’ judgment that specific risks—including from exposures to commercial property,
a possible loosening of corporate lending standards, and the growth of sub-prime lending—
are manageable seems reasonable. Nevertheless, the authorities’ warnings that investors may
be underpricing risk, particularly given concerns about global imbalances, are welcome. The
rapid growth of credit risk transfer instruments, which are providing important diversification
benefits, is also creating some risks. The authorities’ efforts, again, to publicize risks, but
also to address the transactions backlog are right. And with due attention to the costs and
benefits of new regulatory burdens, the authorities should continue to strengthen surveillance
of the market and encourage initiatives to improve disclosure CRT exposures.
46.
Evidence that a portion of the population is not saving enough to meet
retirement income expectations requires attention. The findings and recommendations
of the independent Pensions Commission are a key first step in the process. The
government now needs to develop a consensus on the extent of the problem and
measures that address it. The Commission has made a rather compelling case for the
introduction of a national defined-contribution scheme with automatic enrollment and low

- 29 -

operating costs, changes to the state pension system to simplify it and strengthen incentives
for private saving, and increases in the state pensionable age to reflect longer life expectancy.
Any changes, however, must recognize that increasing the generosity of the currently frugal
pension system will come at the cost of other public expenditures. Ensuring that the
trade-offs are accurately and circumspectly considered will be critical.
47.
The flexible and dynamic labor market is one of the economy’s key strengths.
The policy of allowing new members of the EU full access to the labor market has likely
helped relieve specific skill shortages and thus acted to relieve inflationary pressures. The
authorities’ strategy to stimulate productivity growth is appropriate, including the current
emphasis on further reducing the regulatory burden and developing additional policies to
improve the skills base. The government’s aspiration of further increasing the already high
employment rate—including through innovative measures to help incapacity benefit
claimants find work—is ambitious and welcome.
48.
The U.K. continues to play a leadership role in trade and aid. Its strong stand in
favor of trade liberalization, especially of agricultural trade, is commendable. The recent and
planned increases in ODA are welcome.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX III

United Kingdom: Statistical Issues

The United Kingdom maintains high standards of economic data provision. The authorities
publish a full range of economic and financial data that is available electronically and have
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The U.K. shifted to ESA95
in September 1997. In recent years, the authorities have implemented a number of important
methodological changes to the national accounts dataset, most of which were related to the
adoption of ESA95. In 2003 the authorities introduced further revisions reflecting a shift to
annual chain-linking, corrections for import fraud, and revisions in some volatile
construction data.

APPENDIX IV

United Kingdom: Sustainability Exercises
Fiscal sustainability

The analysis, conducted using the standard template, shows that the rise in public debt is
unlikely to cause financing difficulties over the next few years, given that net public sector
debt starts from a low level and increases only slowly over time.
In the baseline scenario, which assumes that no policy action is taken, the net public debt-toGDP ratio grows from 37¾ percent of GDP in 2005 to 44¼ percent of GDP in 2010, given
the staff projection that the primary balance remains in deficit during this period (Table A1).
This rise in the public debt ratio is unlikely to create debt management problems, given that it
is relatively slow and from a level that is one of the lowest among industrial countries. The
stabilization of the public debt ratio would require an improvement of the primary balance.
In the alternative scenarios, the evolution of the public debt-to-GDP ratio is generally similar
to that in the baseline. Only Scenario A1 shows a decline in the debt ratio, reflecting the
assumption (consistent with the historical average) that the primary balance is in surplus.
Scenario A2 indicates a somewhat larger increase in the debt ratio, consistent with the
assumption of constant primary balance in 2006–10.
In the bound test scenarios, the debt ratio stays below 50 percent of GDP in most cases. The
worst deterioration—to just about 55 percent of GDP—occurs under the assumption that
contingent liabilities amounting to 10 percent of GDP materialize in 2006.
External sustainability

External debt sustainability does not appear to be an issue in the United Kingdom
(Table A2). The U.K.’s role as an international financial center implies large gross external
assets and liabilities (gross external liabilities in 2004 were 350 percent of GDP, compared to
about 100 percent of GDP in the United States). The impact of revaluations on the net
external position has been greater than that of financial flows in all but one year since 1990
(valuation changes have been dominated by currency effects). Cross-border mergers and
acquisitions can also have a sizable impact on the net external position. As a result, one
standard deviation for both net portfolio investment and net foreign direct investment
(calculated over the last ten years) is about 10 percentage points of GDP. The recent
widening of net external liabilities reflects primarily valuation changes and is not especially
large. It is mainly due to a reduction in the net foreign asset holdings of the private nonfinancial sector (the reduction is concentrated in their net portfolio investment position). The
FSAP concluded in 2003 found that the large cross-border financial operations associated
with the role of London as an international financial center do not pose a systemic risk to the
domestic financial system.

1/ Defined as net debt, which includes liquid assets (mainly official reserve assets and bank deposits) amounting to about 5 percent of GDP. Based on fiscal year (April-March). Definition of net public debt ratio in
this exercise differs from official and staff projections. Official and staff projections use centered-GDP as the denominator. Public sector includes general government and public companies.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Statement by Tom Scholar, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
March 1, 2006

My authorities are most grateful to staff for their work and will take careful note of their
comments. There is a broad measure of agreement between staff and the authorities on most
aspects of economic policy.
Economic prospects
Growth was below trend in 2005 at 1.8 percent, in the face of rising oil prices, weak demand
in the euro area and the necessary slowing of the housing market and consumer spending.
Nevertheless the UK was among the fastest growing European economies and continues to
enjoy an unprecedented period of economic stability, with 54 consecutive quarters of growth,
the longest unbroken expansion on record. The economic fundamentals remain sound: CPI
inflation at 1.9 percent, short term interest rates at 4.5 percent, and employment at record
levels of 75 percent. Growth is forecast (in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report) to increase to 2 to
2½ percent in 2006, and 2 ¾ to 3 ¼ percent in 2007, with inflation at or close to target. As
staff note, there are risks: my authorities remain vigilant to these and agree with staff on the
need for cautious macroeconomic polices, to which they are fully committed.
Monetary and fiscal policy
My authorities will continue to set policy on the basis of the policy framework established in
1997, and based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and accountability:
•

Fiscal policy set according to two fiscal rules:
o the golden rule—over the cycle, the Government will borrow only to invest;
o the sustainable investment rule—over the cycle, public sector net debt will be held at
a stable and prudent level, defined as 40 percent or less;

•

Monetary policy set by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee to meet a
symmetric inflation target.

My authorities agree with staff that the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks have served
the UK well, anchoring expectations and delivering long-term stability.
Fiscal policy will, as usual, be set in the Budget. The latest official projections show a
gradual reduction in the deficit to 1½ percent of GDP, with an average annual surplus on the
current budget over the cycle, and net debt stabilising at 38 percent of GDP. My authorities
are therefore meeting the fiscal rules.
Staff project a slightly higher medium-term deficit (2 percent), reflecting a different view of
the output gap. My authorities believe that recent average earnings and labour market data

-2point to considerable spare capacity in the economy. On prospects for the public finances,
they expect the recent strength in monthly receipts to be sustained through 2006/07, and
corporation tax to return to its long-term average. In any case they view the difference of
view expressed by staff as modest, and well within the normal margins of error on mediumterm fiscal projections.
Staff recognise that the fiscal rules have constrained discretion, as intended, and that they
provide a means of protecting investment spending and guarding against pro-cyclical fiscal
policy. But they suggest replacing a rule defined over the cycle (and which allows the
automatic stabilizers to operate) with one requiring the current budget to be in balance three
years ahead. My authorities believe this could introduce a risk of pro-cyclicality, given the
typical pattern of economic cycles, and recall the unsuccessful experience with such a rule
during the 1980s.
Staff suggest extending the scope of NAO audit. My authorities keep this constantly under
review, and last year extended it to include the dating of the economic cycle (where, as staff
note, the NAO endorsed the Treasury methodology as reasonable and concluded that the
change would not reduce the extent of caution in the fiscal projections). There is also
extensive external scrutiny of the government’s assessment of the output gap and the cyclical
position of the economy.
On pensions, my authorities believe that the UK system is better placed than most to confront
future demographic challenges. Nevertheless there are issues to be addressed, and the
Pensions Commission’s report and the Treasury’s Long Term Public Finances Report
provide useful analytical material for doing so. My authorities will provide their response to
the Pensions Commission’s proposals in the coming months.
My authorities welcome the FSAP Follow-Up Report in the Selected Issues papers. This is
well-focused, concentrating on what the UK authorities have been doing to implement the
recommendations in the 2002 FSAP, and providing an assessment of current risks to the UK
financial sector outlook. As a general policy matter it will be interesting to see whether this
new approach will strengthen follow-up on FSAP findings in Article IV reports across the
membership.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
United Kingdom
On March 1, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom.1
Background
Macroeconomic stability remains remarkable, due in part to confidence-enhancing policy
frameworks and generally sound implementation. With economic activity above potential in
2004, some easing of real GDP growth and rise of inflation in 2005 were expected. In the
event, the slowdown in growth and rise in inflation were sharper than envisaged. The growth
slowdown was driven mainly by a fall in private consumption growth, reflecting the cooling of
the housing market, previous monetary policy tightening, and rising personal income tax
revenues. Employment growth remained surprisingly rapid, owing in part to strong immigration
and increased labor force participation by older people. CPI inflation peaked at 2½ percent in
September, reflecting the earlier testing of supply constraints and the sharp increase in energy
prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The simultaneous slowdown in aggregate demand and the large rise in energy prices
presented monetary policy with conflicting signals. Higher energy prices produced an increase
in the overall price level and a risk of second-round effects on inflation. A further consideration
was the strength of immigration, especially from new EU members, which may have boosted
labor supply relative to demand for goods and services. The only change in the policy interest
rate in 2005 was a ¼ percentage point cut to 4½ percent in August.
Over much of the past decade, fiscal policy managed to contain—even reduce—debt while
playing a useful countercyclical role. However, the sharp increase in government spending on
public infrastructure and public services that began in FY2000/01 continued in FY2003/04 and
FY2004/05. The result, as growth picked up, was procyclical stimulus, a growing deficit, and a
rising debt ratio. In FY2004/05, the overall public sector deficit was 3¼ percent of GDP and
end-year net debt amounted to almost 35 percent of GDP.
The banking system is strong, though the possible reversal of low global interest rates poses a
risk. Ratings agencies continue to rank the U.K. banking system as one of the strongest
among G7 countries. However, over the medium term, increasing leverage and the continuing
search for yield represent downside risks. These risks, while global, are particularly relevant
for the U.K. given the size and openness of its financial sector.
A longer-term question is whether private saving is adequate to support an aging population in
the context of a frugal state pension system. Long-term fiscal sustainability in the U.K. is
helped by less severe population aging and a less generous state pension system than in
other G7 countries. However, if the working generation does not save enough for retirement,
future governments may be forced to increase state pensions. There is evidence that a portion
of the population is not saving enough to meet likely expectations of retirement income.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the U.K. economy’s remarkable performance that has lasted
more than a decade, and has been marked by continued economic expansion, falling
unemployment, and sustained low inflation. Directors attributed this success to sound policies
implemented by strong institutions and underpinned by monetary, fiscal, financial, and
structural policy frameworks that have increasingly instilled confidence in the authorities’
conduct of macroeconomic policies. Developments in 2005 put these policy frameworks to the
test, with a slowdown in real GDP growth and a rise in inflation that were the sharpest in a
decade, reflecting the economy’s advanced cyclical position, the abrupt deceleration in house
prices, and the sharp rise in oil prices. Monetary policy faced difficult choices, while fiscal
policy needed adjustment in order to meet the authorities’ fiscal rules.
Prospects for the U.K. economy going forward are favorable, with growth expected to pick up
in 2006-2007 on the strength of private consumption, and inflation remaining stable around the
target. Directors observed that the current account deficit and the negative international
investment position are not major concerns, and that there is no clear evidence of
overvaluation of the exchange rate. At the same time, Directors noted that important
uncertainties and risks surround the outlook, to which the authorities will need to remain

-3vigilant. These include the degree of overvaluation of house prices; the impact of high energy
prices on potential output; the potential effects of immigration on aggregate supply and
demand; and—on the external side—the risk that a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances
could affect the value of sterling.
Directors agreed that monetary policy decisions remain delicately balanced. The cut in the
policy interest rate last August appropriately acknowledged the downside risks to demand,
while maintaining the rate in a neutral range. Looking ahead, Directors concurred that policy
rate decisions should be focused in the very near term on averting second-round effects of the
energy price increases and—following the pay rounds to be concluded in early 2006—on
ensuring that the recovery of demand remains on track to close the output gap.
Directors noted that the structural fiscal deficit in the current fiscal year is on track to narrow
substantially, reflecting windfall revenues from higher energy prices and strong personal
income and corporate tax revenues, especially from the booming financial sector.
They underscored the importance of full implementation of the authorities’ plans to reduce the
deficit further, including through the announced rise in the tax rate on North Sea oil and gas
company profits, and restraint in the growth of current expenditure from FY2008/09. Directors
agreed with the view that these measures should be sufficient to stabilize net debt. At the
same time, they noted the uncertainties surrounding the estimates of the output gap, and the
associated risk of the authorities’ fiscal projections being somewhat more optimistic than
warranted.
Directors observed that the envisaged expenditure restraint will involve difficult decisions and
require careful planning, given the small share of discretionary spending in total spending and
the authorities’ intention to maintain the share of capital spending in GDP. They stressed the
need to target the least productive expenditures, and looked forward to specific
recommendations from the Comprehensive Spending Review, due for completion in mid-2007.
Directors agreed that the U.K fiscal framework is at the forefront of international best practice,
particularly in terms of clarity and transparency. They observed that one particular strength of
the framework is its use of independent audit of key assumptions and conventions underlying
the fiscal projections. They welcomed the expansion of the role of the National Audit Office
(NAO) over the past year and the authorities’ intention to keep this issue under review. Several
Directors saw merit in further broadening the scope of the NAO audit.
Directors agreed that the fiscal rules have played an important role in constraining discretion
and disciplining fiscal policy. However, many Directors saw room for improving the credibility of
the framework further in light of the unusually muted cyclical behavior of the economy and
concerns regarding the redating of the economic cycle, although a number of Directors noted
that the framework continues to serve the United Kingdom well. Directors noted the suggestion
that, once current balance is regained, the authorities consider adopting a more forwardlooking formulation that requires fiscal policy to be positioned to attain current balance in a set
number of years. To bolster credibility, this could be accompanied by an independent audit of
assumptions concerning the economy’s cyclical position. A number of Directors, however,
expressed reservations about these proposals.

-4Directors commended the supervisory authorities for skillfully meeting the challenge of
overseeing a global financial center, and in particular for staying abreast of financial
innovations in an environment marked by concerns about possible global underpricing of risk.
They agreed that the banking system is well-capitalized and cost-efficient, and hence is wellpositioned to absorb potential losses from financial market disturbances. Directors noted that
specific risks—including exposures to commercial property, a possible loosening of corporate
lending standards, and the growth of sub-prime lending—appear to be manageable. The rapid
growth of credit risk transfer instruments, while providing important diversification benefits, has
also created new risks. Directors therefore welcomed the authorities’ efforts to publicize these
risks and to address the transactions backlog. Going forward, it will be important to ensure that
the development of market infrastructure and of financial institutions’ risk management
systems keeps pace with these innovations. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue
to strengthen market surveillance and encourage market initiatives to improve disclosure,
while paying due attention to the costs and benefits of new regulatory burdens.
They welcomed the FSAP follow-up report and the impressive progress in implementing the
2002 FSAP recommendations.
Directors noted with concern the evidence that a portion of the population is not saving enough
to meet retirement income expectations, and underlined the importance of strengthening
incentives for private saving. They welcomed the findings and recommendations of the
independent Pensions Commission as a key first step in developing a consensus on the extent
of the problem and measures to address it. Directors recognized that increasing the generosity
of the currently frugal state pension system would come at the cost of other public
expenditures, and ensuring that the trade-offs are accurately and circumspectly considered will
be critical.
Directors noted that the flexible and dynamic labor market is one of the U.K. economy’s key
strengths. They commended the policy of allowing new members of the EU full access to the
labor market, which has relieved specific skill shortages and helped mitigate inflationary
pressures. Directors considered that the authorities’ strategy to stimulate productivity growth is
appropriate, including the current emphasis on reducing the regulatory burden and improving
the skills base. They welcomed the authorities’ aspiration to increase the already high
employment rate further, including through innovative measures to help incapacity benefit
recipients find work.
Directors praised the United Kingdom for its leadership role in promoting trade liberalization,
especially of agricultural trade. They also commended the government for the recent and
planned increases in overseas development assistance.
