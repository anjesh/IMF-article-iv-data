MOROCCO
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 19, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Background: Several years of sound macroeconomic policies and political reforms left
Morocco well-equipped to address the 2008 international crisis and to respond to
pressing social demands. In this challenging environment, Morocco has performed well
economically and has seen its social indicators improve.
Growth prospects: Despite the slow recovery in the Euro zone—Morocco’s main
trading partner—overall GDP is expected to grow between 4½–5 percent owing to
good agricultural production and the strong performance of the nonagricultural sector,
particularly services and domestic consumption. Unemployment is about 9 percent, but
urban and youth unemployment remains high. The major medium-term challenge is to
achieve high real GDP growth rates to reduce unemployment and improve living
standards. Slow growth in Europe could affect economic activity and worsen prospects.
Resuming fiscal consolidation: Prudent policies in previous years provided a financial
margin to deal with the international crisis and its aftermath. In 2011, the authorities
addressed social demands by increasing public sector wages and keeping fuel and
certain food prices stable through large subsidies. While there is fiscal space in the
short run for spending to support the political reform process and ensure social
cohesion, starting in 2012 Morocco would need to adopt significant fiscal measures,
particularly reforming the generalized subsidies scheme, to ensure medium-term
sustainability. While implementing the subsidy reform will be politically difficult, the
government is committed to improving the targeting of subsidies, reducing their cost
to 3 percent of GDP, and reducing public wages to 10 percent of GDP over the medium
term.
Continuing financial sector development: The financial sector has reached a
significant size, but further domestic resource mobilization is needed to support credit
growth. With the budget financed domestically, there may be some risk of crowding
out. The authorities have taken significant measures to encourage higher financial
intermediation, savings, and new financial products. The funding of Moroccan banks,
which includes funding for foreign subsidiaries, mainly relies on Moroccan deposits in
Dirhams, which would help to mitigate risks associated with tighter liquidity in the Euro
money market.
Improving productivity: Deepening structural reforms is essential to sustaining
Morocco’s productivity. The government has launched reforms to improve the business
environment and social indicators to boost potential growth while reducing
unemployment.

MOROCCO

INTRODUCTION
1.
Morocco has successfully met major
challenges following the global crisis.
Thanks to several years of sound
macroeconomic policies and political reforms,
Morocco was well equipped to address
the 2008 international crisis and to respond to
the social demands that have emerged during
the Arab Spring. In this challenging
environment, Morocco has performed well
economically and has seen its social indicators
improve.
2.
While the medium-term economic
outlook remains generally favorable, the
major challenge for Morocco remains that

of achieving a GDP growth rate that will
help reduce unemployment and improve
living standards, while ensuring mediumterm fiscal sustainability. Since early 2011,
declining growth among Morocco’s main
trading partners and rising commodity prices
have complicated policymaking. Although
in 2011 the Moroccan government has begun
implementing short-term policies to address
social constraints, in 2012 the government
intends to start reorienting and reducing
public expenditure to achieve fiscal
sustainability while fostering inclusive and
sustainable growth in the medium term.
(Box 1).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
In response to social demands, the
Moroccan government is pursuing
significant constitutional and political
reforms, and has increased spending
during 2011 on subsidies, wages, and
pensions. The aim is for the political system to
shift toward a constitutional monarchy, create
the institutional framework for expanding
voice and participation in the political process,
promote social, gender, and regional equality,
and increase transparency and accountability.
A referendum on July 1, 2011, overwhelmingly
supported these reforms. The government is
planning additional legislation to underpin
new constitutional provisions, including
measures to ensure fiscal sustainability, and—
in consultation with the private sector—
improve the business climate. Such policies are
expected to support living standards while
enhancing potential growth. Parliamentary
elections have been called for November 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4.
Morocco’s recent economic
performance has been favorable overall:


Strong performance by nonagricultural
GDP: Nonagricultural GDP grew by
4.5 percent in 2010 compared to about
1 percent in 2009, reflecting the recovery
in certain Euro zone countries, Morocco’s
main trading partners, as well as the higher
demand of its phosphate products from
non-EU countries. However, because of a
contraction in agricultural output, which
represents 13–17 percent of GDP, overall
real GDP grew by only 3.7 percent in 2010.
GDP growth performance is expected to
be much stronger in 2011, at about 4½5 percent, one of the highest in the region,
reflecting sustained growth in the
nonagricultural sector, particularly
services—including the tourism sector—
and domestic private and public

MOROCCO

consumption, and a rebound in
agricultural output (Table 1, Figure 1). The
authorities project GDP growth at
4.8 percent in 2011.






Inflation remains low and under control.
In 2010, period average inflation remained
at 1 percent. In 2011, a fall in domestic
food prices—resulting from the higher
local supply of food—as well as the
existing subsidies, which prevented
inflationary pressures stemming from
higher international prices and secondround effects resulting from public wage
increases, are expected to help limit the
increase in the average inflation to around
1½ percent (Table 1).
The sharp increase in expenditures is
deteriorating the budget deficit. The
budget deficit may reach 5½-6 percent of
GDP due to an increase in expenditures
amounting to 3 percent of GDP relative to
the 2011 budget, largely resulting from the
upturn in outlays to compensate for prices
of petroleum products and certain
foodstuffs (Tables 2–3, Figure 2, Box 6),
despite strong offsetting measures to
control other areas of spending.
A terms-of-trade shock has caused a slight
deterioration in the external balance. The
current account deficit may increase to
about 5 percent of GDP at end-2011.
Although Moroccan exports, including
phosphate and its derivatives, have
performed well, and transfers from
Moroccans living abroad and tourism
receipts—despite the terroristic attack in
Marrakesh on April 28—have grown, this
may not completely offset the increase in
imports caused by rising international food
and oil prices. In addition, the effects of

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the terms of-trade shock have been
exacerbated by keeping fuel and certain
food prices stable through large subsidies,
which has suppressed substitution effects
in consumption decisions. Gross
international reserves are expected to
decline slightly at end-2011, while
remaining comfortable, at above 5 months
of imports of goods and services (Table 4).


Growth in credit continued against a
backdrop of declining liquidity. Credit to
the economy grew by 7.4 percent in 2010,
after 10.9 percent in 2009. During the first
five months of 2011, growth in credit
slowed down and deposits decreased
slightly, while banks’ resources were
supported by the mobilization of deposit
certificates. Systemic liquidity contracted
as a result of a decrease in foreign assets
and a larger-than-usual increase in
currency in circulation during the first five
months of 2011. The staff expects credit to
increase by 6.2 percent in 2011; while the
authorities project credit growth at
8 percent for the year (Table 5, Figure 3).



Near-term downside risks to the economic
outlook are related to the economic
performance of European partners, the
development of food and fuel prices, and
regional political developments. Spillovers
from sluggish growth in European partners
and/or further regional instability could
affect economic activity and the balance of
payments (BOP) through lower tourism
receipts, foreign direct investment (FDI),
and trade. The ongoing political reforms,
including the recent changes to the
constitution and forthcoming elections,
should help mitigate political risks. The
government could also undertake further
social spending measures beyond those

MOROCCO

already under way, which might further
adversely affect public finances, debt
dynamics, and liquidity. On the upside,

Morocco would benefit from higher
phosphate prices (Box 2).

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
5.
The world economic recovery
in 2010 to some extent supported growth
in Morocco; yet new risks emerged in 2011.
The slowdown in growth in a number of
countries in the Euro zone, Morocco’s main
trading partner, could affect economic activity
and worsen medium-term prospects
Furthermore, persistently high commodity
prices, the regional context, and global
financial instability add uncertainties to the
economic outlook.
6.
Morocco is expected to continue
recording a strong economic performance.
Despite increasing productivity, growth is
expected to remain at about 4½-5 percent

in 2012 due to the impact of fiscal
consolidation on domestic demand. Over the
medium term, growth could reach 6 percent.
This will hinge on continued macroeconomic
stability and the implementation of planned
structural reforms. For this purpose, the
authorities intend to bring the medium-term
budget deficit down to around 3 percent of
GDP, which should bring public debt to about
50 percent of GDP over the medium term. This
should slow down the pace of imports, in
particular of energy products and of consumer
goods, which could help reduce the current
account deficit to about 2½ percent of GDP
and external debt to below 23 percent of GDP
in 2016.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability in the Context of Social and Political
Challenges
7.
During the fiscal year 2011 and
following domestic unrest, the authorities
have increased public spending in some
areas. Maintaining prices for certain food
products and fuel unchanged in the context of
rising international commodity prices, will
require spending on food and fuel subsidies of
about 5½ percent of GDP in 2011,
considerably in excess of the 2.1 percent of
GDP estimated in the 2011 budget. In addition,
all civil service wages were increased by a
nominal amount of about US$75, which is
expected to increase the wage bill by
0.2 percent of GDP to 10.7 percent of GDP

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

in 2011. The wage increase had been partially
anticipated in the 2011 budget, which explains
the limited additional impact from this
measure on the 2011 outcome. Other policy
measures, including the acceleration of
promotions for civil servants, and an increase
in the minimum wage, are not expected to
affect the fiscal outcome for 2011. The general
increase in the minimum pension will affect
the mandatory pension schemes, which might
in turn require some not-yet-quantified
transfers from the government in the coming
years. Overall, these measures are projected to

MOROCCO

increase spending by 2½ percent of GDP
compared to the 2011 budget.

8.
At the same time, the authorities
took significant offsetting measures, which
will help to contain the budget deficit at
around 5.7 percent of GDP. Revenue efforts
were intensified and better-than-budgeted
revenue collections in the first half of 2011—
mainly from indirect taxes—are expected to
continue in the second half. This is expected to
result in an improvement in revenues of
1 percent of GDP compared to the 2011
budget. Despite the implementation of the
third phase of the income tax reform, including
an increase in the tax threshold, tax brackets,
and reduced rates, stronger revenue collection
efforts are now expected to leave total
revenues almost unchanged compared to 2010
at 25 percent of GDP. On the expenditure side,
all budget entities have been requested to
economize 10 percent of budgeted allocations
for several nonessential current spending
items. In addition, budgeted transfers to
several public entities with treasury surpluses
will be reduced without affecting their
spending capacity. These two measures are
expected to produce savings of just above
1 percent of GDP compared to the 2011
budget. The cost of the elections scheduled in
November will be absorbed in the existing
budget envelope. Staff underlined that there
will be no room for any additional spending
increases for 2011. Overall, counterbalancing
measures on the revenue and expenditure side
would amount to 2 percent of GDP, which
limits the expected deterioration of the fiscal
balance to 1½ percent of GDP compared to
the 2011 budget.
9.
The authorities agreed that after
containing fiscal expansion in 2011, a firm

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

consolidation plan is required for 2012 and
the medium term to ensure fiscal
sustainability. Fiscal consolidation—reducing
the budget deficit to maintain public debt at
sustainable levels—should come from a
combination of increased revenues and
expenditure containment. In line with
Article 77 of the new constitution and the draft
organic budget law, which lay down the
principle of safeguarding fiscal stability, the
authorities intend to bring the deficit back to
about 3 percent of GDP in the medium term.
This would be in line with a debt-to-GDP ratio
converging to a level of about 50 percent
(Table 9). In the absence of corrective
measures, the budget deficit may reach 6½–
7½ percent of GDP and consequently public
debt will continue to rise (see Box 3).
10.
To achieve this fiscal adjustment,
the authorities intend to resume and
accelerate the implementation of the
following reforms:


Raise revenue. The authorities intend to
intensify their revenue collection efforts by:
(i) broadening the tax base; and
(ii) improving revenue administration.
Nontax revenues would also be expected
to improve as publicly owned enterprises
benefit from the economic recovery and
augment their contribution to the budget.
The mission suggested that the authorities
should redesign the envisaged VAT
reform—reducing the number of VAT rates
from four to two—to maintain the current
revenue level or to increase revenues.
These and other reforms would allow
maintaining or even improving upon the
current revenue levels despite losses in
customs revenues from continued trade
liberalization.

Contain expenditure. Civil service reform
would improve expenditure efficiency and
would also help bring the wage bill back to
below 10 percent of GDP, as aimed for by
the authorities. Furthermore, a reform of
fuel subsidies—replacing universal
subsidies with targeted transfer
programs—is envisaged. Such a reform
could significantly reduce the burden to
the budget and eliminate the vulnerability
of public finances with respect to world
market developments while rationalizing
consumption. The authorities emphasized
that subsidy reform will be politically
difficult. The mission underlined that to be
successful a subsidy reform would need to
overcome public and political resistance
through good targeting and a welldesigned and well-implemented
communication strategy. Given that
reforms take time, a price mechanism
allowing for some gradual adjustment in
prices could be introduced as a transition
to a more comprehensive reform.



Enhance expenditure efficiency. The
authorities also intend to improve the
efficiency of public investment by
enhancing the project selection process
and by giving more room to private
investment, including investment in
infrastructure. This, together with subsidy
reforms would allow for social spending
that would include universal health
services and education.1 The mission
pointed out that private sector
participation in public investment—for
example in the context of public private
partnerships (PPPs)—requires a solid

institutional and legal framework to
adequately manage fiscal risks from such
arrangements. The authorities intend to
design and implement a framework based
on first experiences with forthcoming
projects. Given the lack of experience with
PPPs in the public administration, this
approach could be risky if initial projects
have sizable fiscal implications, such as
might arise from contingent liabilities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Ensure the sustainability of the compulsory
public pension system. According to the
latest actuarial projections, compulsory
public pension plans will soon have to rely
on their capital base to finance pension
payments. The Caisse Marocaine des
Retraites, which manages pensions for civil
servants and military personal, will start
depleting its reserves from 2014 on. The
other two major compulsory pension
schemes will have more time but would
eventually reach a situation where pension
payments exceed contributions.
A technical commission has proposed a
two step reform. First, a parametric reform,
including the gradual increase of the
retirement age and contributions to the
pension system, together with a revision of
the base salary used to calculate the
pension, would give the pension funds
some more years of financial sustainability.
Second, a comprehensive reform aiming at
enlarging the coverage of the pension
scheme2 and the introduction of a multipillar system, including a basic pension
under a pay-as-you-go scheme, a
compulsory scheme, and a fully funded
optional scheme.2 Staff stressed that apart

According to the ILO, only 26 percent of the active
population is currently covered by the pension system.

MOROCCO

from the basic pension, all pension
schemes should be designed to be fully

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

funded to ensure financial sustainability in
the future.

B. Monetary Policy Framework in Transition
11.
Monetary policy has kept inflation in
line with the objectives set by Bank AlMaghrib (BAM). BAM assesses inflation risks
based on a multiple-criterion approach and
aims at influencing the overnight interest rate
(operational target) to address inflationary
risks while maintaining a fixed exchange rate
and partial capital controls. Core inflation
remained below 2 percent since early 2009,
and rising international prices for certain
commodities did not pass through, which also
contributed to keep headline inflation low.
12.
BAM’s efficient liquidity
management helped to keep the overnight
interest rate close to its benchmark interest
rate. BAM targeted banks’ liquidity needs
accurately enough to keep the overnight rate
close to its benchmark interest rate, which has
been set at 3.25 percent since March 2009.
Facing a significant decline in systemic liquidity
due to a decrease in official reserves, BAM
lowered the reserve requirement from 16½ to
6 percent in five steps and withdrew passbook
savings accounts from the reserve base on
April 21, 2011 to ease the pressures on the
interbank market. However, BAM also had to
increase its refinancing to banks up to
5 percent of their deposits at end-July 2011, as
the structural liquidity position of the banks
reached a low point. Staff considers that there
is now limited room for reducing the reserve
requirement further as the authorities should
make sure that the banks maintain a sufficient
level of reserve at the central bank to address
liquidity risks in the current context of
tightening liquidity.

13.
The authorities are envisaging an
eventual move to a more formal inflation
targeting system in conjunction with a
more flexible exchange rate. Staff considers
that BAM has the necessary independence,
expertise, technical resources, range of
instruments, and level of foreign reserves to
introduce an inflation-targeting framework
and a flexible exchange rate. Bank supervision
for risk management is effective and foreign
currency exposure is at a low level. Staff is of
the view that a more flexible exchange rate
regime would reduce the need for frequent
changes in the reserve requirement and would
remove the constraint of offsetting capital
flows which may occur subsequent to changes
in the interest rate policy in a fixed exchange
rate arrangement. However, the authorities
emphasized, and staff concurs, that the timing
should be carefully considered, since the
transition to a flexible exchange rate requires
measures to ensure fiscal sustainability,
particularly reforming the universal subsidy
scheme, and to prevent an adverse impact on
financial stability. In the short term, the foreign
exchange market could be further developed
by broadening the central bank spread from
0.6 percent to at least 2 percent (the IMF
standard for conventional peg regimes) to
encourage the development of interbank
foreign exchange transactions.
14.
A more flexible exchange rate would
also enhance competitiveness. Fund staff
analysis of Morocco’s real exchange rate,
based on the three CGER methodologies, finds
that the deviation from the equilibrium rate
varies widely among the three methodologies

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MOROCCO

used, from a range of –8 percent to
23 percent. As a result, results should be
interpreted with caution. However—and
despite the fact that the real effective
exchange rate depreciated by about 4 percent
in 2010—staff believes that trends in the
current account balance since 2007 could

point to eroding external competitiveness in
the Moroccan economy (Figure 5). Staff
considers that improving competitiveness,
through bold structural reforms and an
eventual move to a more flexible exchange
rate regime, remains an important priority.

C. Mobilizing Resources and Enhancing Asset and Liability Management–
Banks’ Challenges in a Post–Excess–Liquidity Scene
15.
Morocco’s financial sector has made
considerable headway, but it would need to
mobilize additional resources to support
financial development and adequate credit
growth. The banking sector is important,
exceeding 110 percent of GDP, supported by
the deposits of Moroccans living abroad and
the establishment of banking networks in
Africa by Moroccan banks. The Casablanca
stock exchange is one of the most capitalized
and diversified, in terms of sectors, in Africa.
The authorities issued the statute “Casablanca
Finance City” in December 2010 and
nominated the “Moroccan Financial Board” to
pilot the promotion of Casablanca as an
international (and regional) financial center.
The authorities have taken steps to promote
access to banking and savings services to
support banks’ deposit mobilization, which has
slowed down, and to develop markets to
facilitate the asset and liability management of
banks, whose resource utilization exceeds
100 percent on average (Box 4). Moroccan
banks’ funding, including funding for foreign
subsidiaries, relies mainly on Moroccan
deposits in Dirhams, while wholesale foreign
currency funding and external rollover needs
are limited, reducing the risk related to
difficulties in the Euro money market.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

16.
The policy of strengthening core
capital has been generally successful but
efforts to further increase the capital of
certain institutions should continue. The
capital adequacy ratio of the system had risen
to 12.3 percent at end-2010, up from
11.8 percent in 2009, and NPLs steadily
declined from 6.1 percent of total loans
in 2008 to 4.8 percent in 2010 (Table 6).
However, credit quality appears to have
slipped since 2009, as indicated by the
increase in the cost of risk in 2009–2010 and a
slight increase in the NPL ratio during the first
five months of 2011. Efforts to strengthen core
capital will continue, in particular for those
institutions that have failed to reach the
threshold of 9 percent of exposures as
targeted by BAM. Although banks’ solvency
appears strong by international standards, staff
considers that BAM should continue
encouraging banks to reinforce their core
capital (common equity and reserves) because
of risks related to their relatively high “large
exposures ratio to Tiers 1” (Table 6) and to
Moroccan banks’ subsidiaries abroad.

MOROCCO

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

D. Social and Structural Reforms
17.
The authorities are continuing their
efforts to implement an ambitious program
of structural reforms to enhance
productivity. The favorable economic
performance recorded over the past decade is
largely attributed to reforms in key economic
sectors (such as the financial sector and public
enterprises) and to efforts to improve the
business climate, which needs to be
strengthened further. In this context, the
authorities have set a committee to enhance
the business environment’s ability to
continuously attract FDI (Box 5).
18.
Unemployment has decreased
considerably in recent years, but it remains
high, especially among the youth.
Unemployment fell from 13.4 percent in 2000
to 9.1 percent in 2009 (Table 7) but this trend
came to a halt in 2009 due to the global crisis.
Unemployment remains an urban
phenomenon. The average education level of
the unemployed is higher than that for the
total labor force, signaling the difficulties for
people with secondary and higher education in
finding jobs. In addition, unemployment
among the youth remains particularly high and
has proven more difficult to tackle. In this
context, reforms designed to enhance labor
market flexibility are essential. The reform of
the Labor Code in 2004 has brought more
flexibility to the labor market and better
regulation, especially in the hours of work, the
right to strike, and in syndicated
representation and collective bargaining.
However, further reforms aimed at reducing
minimum wages and hiring costs are critical to

reduce youth unemployment (Selected Issues
Paper on Unemployment).
19.
Despite important gains in living
standards, social challenges remain. The
authorities have continued to support social
policies which have helped lower the poverty
rate by 7½ percent between 1994 and 2008,
while improving social indicators (Table 7). Still,
segments of the population remain socially
and economically disadvantaged. Health
indicators—especially for women and
children—are below the norm, with high
incidence of mortality. Literacy rates remain
low relative to other countries with similar
income levels. In addition, although access to
primary education is universal, only two-thirds
of children aged 6–11 complete primary
school. The National Human Development
Initiative for 2011-15, the recent extension of
medical coverage to include disadvantaged
populations, and the regionalization process
are designed to tackle these issues.
20.
Morocco may also benefit politically
and economically in the medium term from
the “advanced status” it secured with the
EU which could lead to freer access to the
European labor market and enhance FDI
attractiveness. However, trade liberalization
under the EU-Mediterranean Association
Agreements needs to be strengthened as it
remains incomplete, with many barriers still
hampering market access, particularly in the
agricultural and service sectors.

STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Morocco has recorded a strong
economic performance but important
challenges remain ahead. Morocco has
enjoyed sustained growth over the last decade
owing to prudent macroeconomic policies and
the implementation of structural reforms. This
performance helped achieve a solid fiscal
position while reducing public debt. However,
productivity and the business climate need
further improvement to enhance the role of
the private sector in promoting long-term
sustainable growth. Unemployment remains
high, especially among the youth, stressing the
need to accelerate structural reforms.
22.
Containing public expenditure,
particularly by reforming the generalized
subsidies system, will be key to ensuring
medium-term fiscal sustainability. The
increase of subsidies and public wages to
respond to social demands will adversely affect
the medium-term fiscal position. The
deterioration of the fiscal position will be
largely due to the current subsidy system,
which is expensive, highly inefficient and
inequitable as it fails to provide an efficient
support to the least favored segments of the
population. A well-targeted subsidy system will
be less costly and would better support the
poor. Given that upward pressures on
expenditure will likely continue, with higher
commodity prices and growing social
demands, a reorientation of spending is
essential to ensure medium-term fiscal
sustainability. Wage increases should be in line
with productivity, and universal subsidies
should be replaced by targeted transfers,
which would allow for more effective social
spending, providing more room for social
protection and health and education spending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

While these reforms may be politically difficult,
staff strongly encourages the authorities to
pursue their efforts to implement the intended
reforms, including in the event of delays some
gradual price adjustment mechanism as a
transition to a more comprehensive reform. In
addition, the authorities should continue to
intensify their revenue collection efforts by
broadening the tax base and improving tax
administration. Additional revenue efforts
could help achieve more ambitious
consolidation path reducing the debt level to
below 50 percent of GDP or if necessary
compensate for slower than expected
implementation of expenditure reforms. In this
respect, the planned VAT reform should be
designed to ensure stable—or even higher—
revenues.
23.
The authorities should improve the
efficiency and the quality of expenditure to
allow for sufficient, well-targeted social
spending. In order to achieve medium-term
sustainability, the authorities aim to improve
the efficiency in public investment projects by
developing better procedures for the selection
of projects and allowing a greater participation
of the private sector. Moreover, the authorities
are also contemplating a reform of the public
pension system to ensure its long-term
financial sustainability. Staff considers that
these measures would help reorient
expenditures toward key priority areas, such as
education and health.
24.
An eventual move to a flexible
exchange rate would strengthen the BAM
monetary policy framework. Staff is also of
the view that a flexible exchange rate would
support a more active interest rate policy in
line with the BAM monetary policy framework.

MOROCCO

A more flexible exchange rate would also
enhance competitiveness. Staff concurs with
the authorities that the timing should be
carefully considered and coordinated with
other macroeconomic policies and necessary
preparatory measures, so as to preserve
medium-term fiscal sustainability and financial
stability—which underscores the need to
proceed promptly with those supporting
policies.
25.
The financial sector has been
growing considerably, but further
development will hinge on the ability to
mobilize domestic savings. Given lower
external flows and higher government
financing requirements, financial development
and appropriate credit growth will require
effective domestic resource mobilization. Staff
supports the authorities’ efforts to improve
financial intermediation and secure the
mobilization of a greater share of savings to
provide additional resources to the financial
sector. In the context of tighter liquidity, the
authorities should be careful that domestic
financing of the government deficit does not

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

crowd out and further reduce credit to the
private sector. Moreover, the authorities could
further encourage banks to reinforce their core
capital to make them more resilient to shocks.
26.
Accelerating structural reforms is
necessary to boost potential growth and
social indicators. Morocco has made
important progress in improving governance
and attracting foreign direct investments.
However, additional efforts are required to
strengthen governance, the business climate,
and trade integration with European partners,
in order to continue to attract FDI and increase
human capital. In this regard, staff considers
that the recent constitutional reform and the
creation of the National Committee for the
Business Environment should promote
inclusive growth. Moreover, further reforms
aimed at reducing minimum wages and hiring
costs are critical to reducing youth
unemployment.
27.
It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Although investment rates to GDP have increased
significantly over the last decade in Morocco, this
has not translated into higher economic growth.
While during 1999-2010 Morocco’s investment rate
was the second largest in the sample below, its
growth rate is relatively lower.1 The quality and

Although the efficiency of investment, measured by
the ICOR,2 for Morocco has declined during 2005-10,
it remains high relative to the sample below,
suggesting inefficiencies in the production process.
While the ICOR analysis above is useful to highlight
economic inefficiencies that hamper actual growth
performance, it says little about Morocco's growth
potential. In particular, modern growth theory
emphasizes the “advantage of backwardness.”3 In
other words, the more distant a country is from the
global technological frontier, the faster it is expected
to grow, but only if it has institutions and policies
that facilitate catching up with relevant technologies
developed elsewhere. In this respect, Morocco has
not made full use of this potential advantage as it
still needs to further implement critical structural
reforms. Economic openness, improvements in
institutional quality, and strengthening of human
capital are key for such technological adaptation or
catching up to occur.

Box 2. The Contribution of the OCP to the Moroccan Economy
The Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP) Group is
the largest Moroccan enterprise and its activities
cover the entire phosphate value chain, from
phosphate rock mining to chemical processing of
phosphoric acid and fertilizers. With the world’s
largest phosphate reserves, mostly located in the
Khouribga base in the center of Morocco, the OCP is
the first exporter of rock phosphate and phosphoric
acid in the world and one of the main exporters of
phosphate-based fertilizers.

The phosphate sector is a key driver of the country’s
economy, employing more than 18,000 employees
and representing, in value, approximately one
quarter of Morocco's total exports and about
3.5 percent of GDP.
In recent years, the OCP has set up several
processing joint ventures with plants located in
Morocco and abroad with partners including Brazil,
Belgium, Germany, India, and Pakistan. Over the
medium term, the OCP plans to increase its rock
production capacity to 50 million tons and its
downstream fertilizer production through targeted
strategic partnerships.

Box 3. Downside Risk Fiscal Scenario: Key Macroeconomic Indicators
The alternative scenario reflects the medium-term
outlook for a case of no expenditure reforms and
without additional revenue efforts. If the envisaged
public spending reforms and revenue efforts were
not implemented, fiscal consolidation would not be
achieved and overall economic outcomes would be
less favorable, specifically, growth and productivity
would be more constrained in the medium term, and
the current account would worsen.
Under the alternative scenario, fiscal sustainability
would be at risk, as deficits could reach 7½ percent
of GDP. If the size of the wage bill and spending on
food and fuel subsidies are not addressed by the
envisaged reforms, public expenditure would remain
at about 32 percent of GDP.

Also, government revenues are expected to remain
at current levels of about 25 percent of GDP if no
efforts are undertaken to expand the revenue base.
Under these circumstances, the fiscal deficit could
reach between 6.5 and 7.3 percent of GDP in the
medium term. Under this scenario, government debt
would reach, by the end of the projection period,
over 65 percent of GDP, which is considerably higher
than the level of 50 percent of GDP, which could be
generally considered advisable for an emerging
market country.

Box 4. Banks’ Asset-Liabilities Management and Resource Mobilization Challenges
After years of easily accessible resources due to
abundant liquidity generated by a strong BOP and
rapid credit growth, banks will have to adapt their
resource mobilization and asset-liability
management strategy to avoid having the current
situation of tighter liquidity and higher deposit
utilization constrain their activities.
Enhanced resource mobilization
 Fostering financial intermediation. Under
the supervision of BAM, the postal bank,
licensed in 2009, started rolling over its business
plan progressively in 2010 to ensure that risks
were adequately addressed. The creation of the
postal bank was part of a World Bank DPL loan
and its design draws on successful international
experiences. The postal bank upgraded the
services previously provided by the post office
and now offers a larger range of deposit and
payment services which are expected to attract
new clients not yet targeted by commercial
banks. Other measures were taken to encourage
the recourse to banking services instead of cash
for payments. Moreover, BAM signaled to
commercial banks that they should not rely
excessively on its refinancing facilities but
should strengthen efforts to enlarge their
deposit base. Overall, the authorities aim at
reaching a ratio of access to financial services of
66 percent by end-2013.

 Increasing savings. The Ministry of Finance
lifted the ceiling on savings accounts and
introduced new savings products linked to the
purchase of real estate and stocks and
education financing to boost savings.
Asset-liability management
 Tapping market resources: The
development of a market for certificates of
deposit (CDs) would help banks to diversify their
resources away from deposits. Larger
depositors, such as companies, converted some
time deposits into CDs, which have the
advantage of stabilizing debt maturities for
banks, as large depositors tended to withdraw
their time deposits before maturity. BAM also
included DCs among the eligible collateral for its
refinancing operations, supporting the liquidity
of the DC market and lengthening their
maturities.
 Securitizing banks’ assets: the authorities
allowed banks to issue covered bonds to
address banks’ balance sheet maturity
mismatches. Although any type of banks’ claim
is eligible for securitization, mortgage loans are
typically those most likely to be securitized.
 Developing a yield curve: The Treasury
started benchmarking certain maturities, and the
BAM is publishing repo rates for different
maturities to support the development a yield
curve.

Box 5. FDI Attractiveness and Business Climate
Before the global crisis, Morocco was attracting
growing volumes of foreign direct investment
(FDI)—from 2003–08, the annual average growth of
FDI has been 5.1 percent, compared to about
3 percent over 1999-2002. The fact that FDI was
growing until recently reflects the significant
progress that Morocco has made in improving
investment conditions, especially by enhancing the
transparency and predictability of policies and
regulations governing investment, as well as by
reducing the time and cost of administrative
procedures. Based on the OECD FDI regulatory
restrictiveness index, the average level of Morocco’s
restrictions is comparable with the median of the
OECD and non-OECD countries that adhere to the
OECD Declaration on International Investment and
Multinational Enterprises.
As indicated by the high negative correlation
between the FDI regulatory restrictiveness index and
the share of FDI to GDP, the relatively low level of
restrictions in Morocco has played an important role
in attracting FDI into the country. However,
additional efforts to improve the business climate,

especially for local entrepreneurs, would be needed
to restore the pre-crisis growth rate of FDI. The
Doing Business 2001 Report ranked Morocco 114th
out of 183 economies in Ease of Doing Business.
In this context, by end-2009, the authorities created
the National Committee for the Business
Environment to implement reforms to the business
climate, in partnership with the private sector.
In 2010, the Committee’s action plan included
12 priority activities intended to facilitate
achievement of the following four objectives:
(i) streamlining and strengthening transparency of
administrative procedures, (ii) modernizing business
law, (iii) improving the settlement of commercial
disputes, and (iv) enhancing collaboration and
communication related to reforms. The 2011 action
plan includes two main priorities: (i) facilitating
access to land, and (ii) in the context of the
regionalization process, the harmonization and the
regulation of the administrative procedures at the
regional level. These reforms should facilitate greater
economic diversification, create jobs, and lower
unemployment.

Box 6. Subsidies
Subsidies are granted for energy products including
fuel and butane gas, as well as for sugar and
specified qualities of flour.
 Over 85 percent of the total 2011
expenditure on subsidies is expected to be
spent on energy products. Subsidies for fuel and
butane are determined by a pricing formula as
the difference between an adjusted market price
and the politically set consumer price. Consumer
prices were last adjusted in 2008.

 The consumption of sugar per person is
very high. The price for sugar has been kept
constant since 2006. The subsidy for basic flour
is targeted to the poor. The subsidized volume is
fixed, and the subsidized products are
distributed by criteria that should channel the
product mostly to the poor. Since 2007,
following widespread protests, subsidies are also
provided for the flour used for the production of
standard bread.
Food subsidies are less costly and better
targeted than subsidies for fuel and butane. The
need for reform of energy subsidies is thus more
pressing than for food subsidies.

 Subsidies for food were introduced to
support the consumption of staple items.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.

9/

The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Annex I. Transition of Fiscal Presentation to GFS2001
Table A1 shows how the traditional presentation of central government translates into the
GFS2001 conform presentation. There are several items in the traditional presentation that
include sub-items that are allocated to separate lines in the GFS2001 presentation. This
decomposition can only be done based on detailed information that is usually not available in
the traditional presentation. Thus, the GFS2001 presentation for historical data—data before the
submission of GFS2001 conform data started in 2006—can only be approximated. The second
column in Table A1 presents the classification adapted for the approximation. This approximation
is also used to translate the budget 2011 into the GFS2001 conform presentation as the budget
is presented in the traditional format. Tables A2 and A3 show the GFS2001 conform fiscal
presentation for 2009 through 2016.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Morocco
On October 5, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
Background
Thanks to several years of sound macroeconomic policies and political reforms, Morocco was
well equipped to address the 2008 international crisis and to respond to the social demands that
have emerged during the Arab Spring. In this challenging environment, Morocco has performed
well economically and has seen its social indicators improve.
Despite the slow recovery in the Euro zone—Morocco’s main trading partner—overall GDP is
expected to grow between 4½–5 percent, one of the highest in the region, reflecting sustained
growth in the nonagricultural sector—including the tourism sector—and a rebound in agricultural
output. Unemployment is stable at about 9 percent, but urban and youth unemployment remains
high. In 2011, a fall in domestic food prices—resulting from the higher local supply of food—as
well as the existing subsidies, which prevented inflationary pressures stemming from higher
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

international prices, are expected to help limit the increase in the average inflation to around
1½ percent.
During the fiscal year 2011 and following domestic unrest, the authorities have increased public
spending in some areas. Maintaining prices for certain food products and fuel unchanged in the
context of rising international commodity prices, will require spending on food and fuel subsidies
of about 5½ percent of GDP in 2011, considerably in excess of the 2.1 percent of GDP
estimated in the 2011 budget. In addition, all civil service wages were increased by a nominal
amount of about US$75, which is expected to increase the wage bill by 0.2 percent of GDP to
10.7 percent of GDP. At the same time, the authorities took significant offsetting measures,
which will help containing the budget deficit at around 5.7 percent of GDP. The authorities are
preparing to implement fiscal consolidation measures starting in 2012 to bring the deficit down
to 3 percent of GDP in the medium term, which would bring the total public debt to about
50 percent of GDP in the medium term.
The external balance has slightly deteriorated due to a terms-of-trade shock. The current
account deficit may increase to about 5 percent of GDP at end-2011. Although Moroccan
exports, including phosphate and its derivatives, have performed well, and transfers from
Moroccans living abroad and tourism receipts—despite the terroristic attack in Marrakesh on
April 28—have grown, this may not completely offset the increase in imports caused by rising
international food and oil prices. Gross international reserves are expected to decline slightly at
end-2011, while remaining comfortable, at above 5 months of imports of goods and services.
Morocco’s financial sector has made considerable headway, but it would need to mobilize
additional resources to support financial development and adequate credit growth. The capital
adequacy ratio of the system had risen to 12.3 percent at end-2010, up from 11.8 percent
in 2009, and NPLs steadily declined from 6.1 percent of total loans in 2008 to 4.8 percent
in 2010. However, credit quality appears to have slipped since 2009 as indicated by the
increase in the cost of risk in 2009-2010 and a slight increase in NPL ratio during the first five
months of 2011. Efforts to strengthen core capital will continue.
The authorities are continuing their efforts to implement an ambitious program of structural
reforms to enhance productivity. In this context, the authorities have set a committee to
enhance the business environment to continuously attract FDI.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic policies and
structural and political reforms that have helped Morocco weather the global crisis and respond
to pressing social needs. Looking ahead, Directors noted that significant challenges remain,
including the uncertain economic outlook in Europe and the region, the need for fiscal

3

consolidation in the face of large popular demands, and the urgency to implement an ambitious
agenda to boost employment and inclusive growth. Rebuilding policy buffers and accelerating
reforms are critical to strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks and lay a solid foundation
for sustained growth over the medium term.
Directors stressed that containing and reorienting public expenditure, particularly by reforming
the generalized subsidies system, will be key to ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability. A
well-targeted subsidy system would be less costly and better support the most needy segment
of the population. Directors encouraged further efforts to strengthen revenue collection by
broadening the tax base and improving tax administration, and commended the authorities for
securing the mobilization of a greater share of domestic savings to provide additional resources
to the financial sector.
Directors noted that moving to a flexible exchange rate would strengthen the central bank’s
monetary policy framework and enhance policy flexibility and together with structural reforms
could help competitiveness going forward. They agreed with the authorities that the timing
should be carefully considered and coordinated with other macroeconomic policies and
necessary preparatory measures, so as to preserve medium-term fiscal sustainability and
financial stability.
Directors stressed the critical importance of boosting growth to help reduce unemployment and
improve living standards. They encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the ongoing and
planned structural reforms, including by improving the efficiency and composition of public
spending. Directors agreed that further efforts are required to improve governance, the business
climate, and trade integration at the regional and global levels, and to strengthen human capital
to increase private investment and continue to attract FDI. Further reforms to increase labor
market flexibility and contain hiring costs also remain important to reduce youth unemployment.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
October 5, 2011
My authorities appreciate the hard work and dedication of staff and broadly concur with their
analysis and conclusions in the concise and well-written report. After demonstrating strong
resilience to the global financial crisis and the food and fuel price shock, Morocco is
undergoing a major reform process to meet the expectations of its population toward more
democracy and inclusiveness, increased employment opportunities, and improved social
conditions. Early commitment of the highest authorities to political reform in response to the
“Arab Spring” has paved the way for a peaceful and orderly transition to a constitutional and
democratic monarchy. The new constitution approved on July 1 consecrates the rule of law,
the principles of good governance, human rights protection and gender and regional
equality, and strengthens the role and accountability of the executive branch, the
responsibilities and oversight of parliament, as well as the independence of the judiciary.
The build-up of fiscal and foreign reserve buffers in the period preceding the global crisis
provided the authorities with the policy space needed to support the economy and absorb
the food and fuel price shock, and to make further progress in improving social indicators,
including under the comprehensive National Initiative for Human Development. They were
successful in striking the right balance between supporting economic activity, employment,
and incomes, and maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability. Higher public
investment in key infrastructure and social spending, moderate increases in wages and
minimum pensions, and cuts in the high personal income tax rates consistent with the
ongoing tax reform, in addition to the non pass-through of higher food and fuel prices,
helped support domestic demand and growth. Monetary policy was also appropriately
accommodative, providing the liquidity needed to meet private sector credit demand within
a sound and effective regulatory and supervisory framework.
In a difficult external environment, Morocco’s economic performance was broadly
satisfactory. Growth averaged 4½ percent during 2009–11, with nonagricultural GDP growing
by 4½ percent in 2010 and 5 percent in 2011; inflation remained within the 1-1½ range; and
while declining somewhat, reserve coverage remained comfortable. More important,
unemployment declined from 13.6 percent in 2000 to stabilize at around 9 percent
during 2009–10, even though youth unemployment remained high. In view of the strength of
Morocco’s fundamentals and economic performance in a difficult external environment, its
investment grade sovereign debt rating issued by Fitch in 2007 was confirmed by Standard &
Poor’s in 2010.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to rebuild the fiscal buffers used since the onset of
the global crisis. They have reiterated their commitment to resume fiscal consolidation by
reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio to less than 50 percent
over the medium term, while increasing pro-growth, pro-poor spending, simplifying and

2
modernizing the tax system, and further strengthening public financial management and the
budgetary framework. To strengthen the foundations for sound policies, the new constitution
requires both parliament and the government to safeguard fiscal balances, and the draft
organic finance law being finalized introduces a medium term framework and results-based
budgeting, as well as greater transparency and parliamentary involvement in the budget
process. Also, as described in the staff report, the authorities have prepared a comprehensive
reform of the compulsory public pension schemes to ensure their long term sustainability.
The authorities are firmly committed to reforming the subsidy system to achieve better
targeting and rationalization and reduce the budgetary cost. Their decision to keep the prices
of subsidized food and fuel products unchanged was motivated by their desire to mitigate
the impact of price shocks on the poor, pending completion of the preparatory work and
mobilization of the necessary consensus for moving to a better targeted system. To this end,
and based on experiences from several countries and with World Bank assistance, they have
started implementing pilot programs combining conditional cash transfers aimed at reducing
school drop-outs (TAISSIR), which affects young girls in particular, and provision of free basic
health to the poor (RAMED). These pilot programs were expanded under the 2011 budget
and will be evaluated before their roll-out as part of the subsidy reform. However, the recent
regional unrest made implementation of the reform politically difficult.
In an effort to limit the fiscal impact of increased spending on subsidies, the authorities
reduced nonpriority recurrent spending in mid–2011 and limited transfers to public entities
to what is needed for their investment program, while strengthening revenue collection. As a
result, the deficit in 2011 is expected to increase by only 1.1 percent of GDP compared
to 2010, despite an increase in subsidies by 2.2 percent of GDP. Over the medium term, their
objective is to limit the cost of the subsidy system, including targeted social transfers, to
3 percent of GDP, down from 5.7 percent in 2011.
Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) has been successful in maintaining very low inflation, helped by the
decision to keep subsidized food and fuel prices unchanged, and the well- established
credibility of monetary policy. The moderation of credit growth since 2010, after the rapid
increase in previous years, does not seem to unduly constrain economic activity and has
helped reduce risks from excessive credit expansion. Indeed, the slowdown mainly affected
credit to real estate developers, whereas credit to investment and housing (in particular social
housing) has remained in double-digits. The impact of the decline in foreign reserves on
liquidity was offset by the provision of central bank liquidity, the lowering of reserve
requirements, and diversification of bank resources through issuance of certificates of
deposit. After increasing by 5.9 percent on a 12–month basis through May, credit to the
private sector expanded by 7.1 percent through July and is expected to grow by more than
8 percent by end–2011.

The authorities are comforted by the resilience of the financial sector, its increased
soundness and profitability, as well as its regional expansion, with Moroccan banks now
present in some 20 countries in Sub-Saharan and North Africa. NPLs have continued to
decline, reaching 4.8 percent of total loans at end–2010, as against 15.7 percent in 2005.
Nevertheless, BAM remains vigilant to prevent the build-up of risks. It proactively raised
capital requirements for all banks, instructed some banks to meet higher requirements as
needed, and required constitution of provisions to mitigate the risks from large exposures,
even though Morocco has the lowest large loan exposure along with the largest loan
concentration in SMEs in the MENA region.1 Following the implementation of the standard
approach under Basel II in 2007, BAM has issued regulations regarding the advanced
approach, which is being implemented by the major banks, and is currently preparing banks
for Basel III. It is also closely monitoring asset prices, which do not show signs of bubbles,
and household indebtedness, which remains moderate.
The central bank law and the banking law are being revised to introduce a supervisory
framework for systemic risks within a comprehensive approach to financial stability, including
establishment of close coordination among interested parties. Activities of Moroccan bank
subsidiaries are closely monitored, including through cooperation agreements with host
country regulators. The authorities have also taken steps to enhance domestic savings
mobilization, including a more favorable tax treatment of long-term savings and the
expansion of the network and the range of services provided by the postal bank. The legal
framework and governance structure for Casablanca Finance City has been adopted, together
with a favorable tax treatment to promote it as an international and regional financial hub.
The authorities take note of staff assessment of the real exchange rate and their
recommendation for greater exchange flexibility. The range of estimates for the REER and the
analytical and data shortcomings involved are not conducive to firm conclusions. However,
recent trends indicate some improvement in competitiveness, which has been confirmed by
the relatively good performance of exports reflecting wage moderation and the success of
various sectoral strategies developed in close cooperation with the private sector. Indeed,
exports increased by 26 percent in 2010 and are projected to grow at a similar pace in 2011,
with non-phosphate related exports growing by 23 percent. Tourism receipts and workers’
remittances are projected to grow in 2011 by 13 percent and 11 percent respectively. This
being said, although the authorities believe that improved competitiveness is better achieved
through structural reforms, they reaffirm their readiness to move to a more flexible exchange
rate system and to inflation targeting, once all necessary prerequisites are in place, including
stronger foundations for medium-term fiscal sustainability.

Further improving the environment for private sector development continues to be central to
the authorities’ strategy of promoting employment and high and sustainable growth. In this
regard, they attach high priority to human resource development to increase productivity
and to support greater diversification toward higher value-added activities. In addition to the
ongoing acceleration of infrastructure spending by the government, they intend to promote
PPPs to diversify sources of financing and improve project selection and implementation
through private sector participation. To improve transparency and good governance in this
area and mitigate potential moral hazard, a regulatory framework in line with best
international practices will be put in place. To reduce informality and level the playing field
for businesses, a preferential tax treatment has been put in place for small businesses, which
will bring them into the tax net while preserving their crucial role in production and
employment. Concerns about the environment and energy security are being addressed
through the development of renewable energy sources, including solar energy in which
Morocco is playing a pioneer role through implementation of an ambitious program. Efforts
continue to be made to improve governance and fight corruption, including through the
establishment of an independent Council on Competition and a Central Authority for
Corruption Prevention. The recently-announced advanced regionalization program, following
a broad consultative process, should help achieve better integrated and more regionally
balanced, sustainable, and equitable growth, while increasing ownership and accountability
and improving efficiency of resource use.
The authorities agree on the importance of wage moderation and labor market flexibility for
promoting employment and competitiveness. To this end, partners under the Social Dialogue
agreed to a net income approach instead of focusing on nominal wage increases in their
negotiations, and a large part of the improvement in employees’ incomes in public and the
private sectors in recent years reflected the decline in payroll taxes. Increases in minimum
wages have been moderate in recent years, and a degree of flexibility has been introduced in
their implementation, in particular for export-oriented sectors affected by the global crisis,
which led to a decline in unit labor costs. It is expected that greater labor market flexibility
will be introduced together with an unemployment protection system. Measures are also
being taken to improve workers’ social protection in line with international best practices
which should result in improved productivity.
The authorities are committed to staying the course of prudent macroeconomic policy and
structural reforms to promote employment and high and inclusive growth. They see the
ongoing political reform as a golden opportunity to strengthen ownership of and support to
sound economic and social policies. They are also firmly committed to strengthen regional
cooperation, including within the Maghreb countries and with the Gulf Cooperation Council
and other partners.
