IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran

On February 24, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Economic growth rebounded over the course of 2016/17 on the back of higher oil production.
Real GDP grew by 7.4 percent in the first half 2016/17, rebounding from recession in 2015/16.
However, growth in the non-oil sector averaged 0.9 percent, despite the pick-up registered in the
second quarter, reflecting continued difficulties in access to finance and domestic financial
sector and structural weaknesses. Inflation declined to single digits and has hovered in the 9.5
percent range, year-on-year, since mid-2016. The foreign exchange market stabilized although it
experienced some volatility towards end-2016 before recovering in January 2017. The spread
between the official and the market rate has narrowed to about 15 percent.
Growth is projected to stabilize at 4.5 percent over the medium-term as the recovery broadens.
Real GDP growth is expected to reach 6.6 percent in 2016/17 and to ease to 3.3 percent in
2017/18 as oil production remains at the OPEC target. Thereafter, higher FDI and a gradual
improvement in domestic financial conditions drive investment and stronger non-oil sector
growth. The current account is forecast to remain in surplus as higher exports offset the pick-up
in imports related to investment. Inflation is expected to temporarily rise to 11.9 percent (yearon-year) by end-2017/18 reflecting recent liquidity growth and pass-through from exchange rate
depreciation, but to return to single digits on the back of prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
The pace of job creation lags that needed to absorb the large number of new entrants to the labor
market and unemployment remains high.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities for achieving an impressive recovery in economic growth
after the lifting of nuclear sanctions in 2016, maintaining inflation in single digits, and stabilizing
the foreign exchange market. Given the renewed uncertainty, Directors emphasized the
importance of maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and building buffers, strengthening
the financial sector, and advancing reforms to lessen Iran’s reliance on oil and develop the
private sector. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment in this regard and the thrust of their
reform plans.
Directors saw an urgent need for financial sector reforms to sustain financial stability and finance
growth. They recommended enhanced supervision of distressed banks and an asset quality
review to identify viable banks that warrant recapitalization and nonviable banks to be resolved.
They encouraged the authorities to support recapitalization of public banks with measures that
improve their commercial viability and wind down directed credit schemes. They looked forward
to the approval of the new banking bill that would give the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) the
supervisory powers to implement reforms. Directors also encouraged quick passage of the
central bank bill to modernize the monetary policy framework and provide greater operational
independence to the CBI to pursue low and stable inflation.
Directors urged the authorities to implement a medium-term fiscal framework to underpin their
commitment to prudent fiscal policy and ensure gradual fiscal adjustment while funding financial
sector reform costs. Higher revenue collections, further fuel price adjustment, and better
targeting of cash transfers would create space to support growth and equity through higher public
investment and cash transfers to the poor. Directors encouraged the authorities to explore the
scope to use oil revenues to fund bank recapitalization, and noted the importance of replenishing
the Oil Stabilization Fund to provide the budget a buffer.
Directors welcomed recent steps to strengthen the AML/CFT framework, the introduction of
IFRS reporting in banks, and the audit and securitization of government arrears, which will help
unlock corporates’ and banks’ balance sheets and facilitate greater investment. They urged the
authorities to fully implement the FATF action plan, further enhance the AML/CFT framework,
and improve the transparency of corporate ownership to facilitate re-integration into the global
financial system and restore correspondent banking relationships. They noted that reducing the
role of the state and improving the business climate would foster foreign investment and aid job
creation. Labor market reforms, including specific measures to facilitate youth and female
employment, would ensure that more people have opportunities to work and make growth more
inclusive.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors approved retention of the temporary exchange restriction and multiple currency
practices, but underscored the authorities’ commitment to unify the exchange rate and shift to a
managed float by early 2018, in order to provide flexibility for managing shocks. Directors urged
the authorities to improve the quality, timeliness, and availability of data, including by
implementing the Enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS).

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 9, 2017

KEY ISSUES
Context. The lifting of nuclear sanctions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA) has spurred growth, but banking system weaknesses, structural bottlenecks,
and hesitation by foreign banks to re-establish financial links have held back expansion
of non-oil activity.
Outlook and risks. Iran could grow by about 4½ percent over the medium-term with
the implementation of reforms. Risks are to the downside, however, reflecting renewed
external uncertainty and a demanding reform agenda that requires broad political
support.
Policy discussions focused on the sequencing and implementation of the
authorities’ reform plan, and equipping the policy framework to support stability
and address shocks:
Comprehensive banking sector reform is urgently needed. Banks should be
restructured and recapitalized to safeguard financial stability, reduce high lending rates,
and support growth. This would reduce banks’ reliance on Central Bank funding and
bolster capital levels.
Reforms to the monetary policy framework would anchor low and stable inflation.
The central bank requires operational independence and instruments to safeguard low
inflation and pave the way for exchange rate unification.
Fiscal policy needs to create space for reform costs and pro-growth spending.
Public debt will rise as the government clears its liabilities and recapitalizes banks. A
medium-term fiscal framework that targets a gradual reduction in the non-oil deficit
and expansion in tax revenue would accommodate higher spending, support growth,
and safeguard inflation and fiscal sustainability.
Structural reforms that facilitate foreign investment would ease domestic
financing constraints while labor market reforms would foster job creation for all.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

CONTEXT
1.
Higher oil production and exports, following the removal of nuclear sanctions in
January 2016, is supporting a strong rebound in growth. The prudent monetary and fiscal
policies implemented in recent years paved the way for inflation to fall to single digits and stabilized
the foreign exchange market. Progress was made in addressing Anti-Money Laundering/Combating
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) deficiencies, including passage of a CFT law. Foreign investors
are planning sizeable investments in the hydrocarbon and manufacturing sectors.
2.
Still Iran faces considerable challenges in realizing its full potential. The fall in oil prices
since their 2014 peak further reduced fiscal space and buffers already eroded under sanctions.
Limited access to correspondent banking relations (CBR) has constrained trade, investment inflows
and access to international reserves (Box 1). More recently, renewed uncertainty regarding sanctions
is dampening sentiment. Domestically, the banking system is fragile and unable to support the
recovery. Unemployment remains high and private sector job creation is slow. With per capita
incomes unchanged from a decade ago and poverty on the rise, pressure to realize rapid gains is
high. Presidential elections are scheduled for May 2017.
3.
The authorities are putting in place the elements of an ambitious reform plan to
address these challenges, consistent with past IMF advice. They remain committed to prudent
monetary and fiscal policies to underpin hard won economic stability. Under their Financial Sector
Reform Plan, draft Central Bank and Banking bills aim to modernize the monetary policy framework
and strengthen supervisory powers. The government has begun to clear its payment arrears,
provided seed funds to recapitalize some banks, and plans to expand tax collections. The Sixth
National Development Plan (NDP) aims to develop the private sector and reduce oil dependency.
The challenge will be to prioritize and coordinate these complex reforms to definitively address
structural weaknesses, sustain economic and financial stability, and secure higher, more inclusive
growth.
Box 1. Impediments to Correspondent Banking with Iran
Despite the lifting of nuclear sanctions by the JCPOA—a multilateral agreement reached between Iran and the
P5+1 which was ratified by the UN—on January 16, 2016, non-U.S. global banks are reluctant to re-engage Iranian
banks because of remaining sanctions as well as AML/CFT concerns, including opacity of ownership of legal
entities, and health of local banks.
Sanctions relief so far …
The JCPOA resulted in important relief. The oil embargo was lifted. E.U. and other countries’ sanctions that
targeted Iran’s nuclear program ended. SWIFT reconnected Iranian banks to its payments system. Iranian banks
have entered into CBRs with small and medium non-U.S. banks (around 238, but half 2006 levels) reducing
financial transaction costs and improving the ease of cross-border trade. Access to foreign exchange reserves
improved with some US$30 billion in blocked or frozen assets and oil receipts released.
But other sanctions remain in place....
U.S. primary sanctions remain in place and apply to U.S. financial institutions and companies, including non-U.S.
branches (but not subsidiaries). U.S. dollar clearing restrictions have not been lifted and pose a significant
challenge for larger non-U.S. global banks to re-establish CBRs. This in turn restricts access to corporate trade
finance and limits access to reserves, foreign assets, and export earnings particularly from dollar-dominated oil
sales. On December 15, 2016, the Iran Sanctions (10 years) extension Act became law. Other non-nuclear
sanctions, including SDN list restrictions, which were broadened to cover new individuals and companies in
February 2017, remain in place (see SIP, Chapter 1).

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
4.
Economic growth rebounded in 2016/17 on the back of higher oil production but nonoil activity remained weak (Table 1, Figure 1). Boosted by the swift recovery in oil production and
exports, real GDP grew by 7.4 percent in the first half 2016/17, recovering from recession in 2015/16.
However, non-oil sector growth averaged just 0.9 percent reflecting continued difficulties in access
to finance and depressed consumption. Unemployment had risen to 12.7 percent by the end-Q2
(Table 2).

5.
Inflation declined to low and single digits (Figure 2). Inflation fell to a multi-year low of
6.8 percent y/y in June 2016, down from a peak of 45 percent in June 2013 reflecting favorable food
prices and prudent policies. Inflation has since hovered in the 9½ percent range on higher world
food prices and faster liquidity growth. M2 had risen by 28.3 percent y/y by end-December 2016
driven by CBI support to banks and the government drawing on its revolving facility.
6.
Iran’s external position strengthened (Tables 3–4, Figure 3). The current account surplus
reached a recent low of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015/16 owing to low oil prices and curtailment of oil
exports by sanctions. With the lifting of sanctions, higher oil exports and more favorable oil prices,
the current account surplus is expected to rise to 6 percent of GDP in 2016/17. Renewed foreign
investor inflows in the hydrocarbon, automobile and telecom industries are boosting FDI. The
authorities are improving trade opportunities, by clearing arrears to export credit guarantee
agencies and negotiating trade agreements with regional partners.
7.
The foreign exchange market experienced some volatility towards end-2016. Through
October 2016, the official exchange rate had depreciated by about 7 percent y/y from end-2015,
whereas the market rate remained broadly steady. Over the remainder of 2016, the market rate
depreciated sharply reflecting seasonal factors and the rise in sanctions-related uncertainty. It then
recovered in January 2017 and the spread between the official and the market rate narrowed to
15 percent. Preparations for exchange rate unification have continued. Over half of all import
categories have been shifted to the bureau market. Banks have been permitted to use non-oil
export proceeds to fund imports to aid the re-creation of an interbank FX market.
8.
Monetary and fiscal policy have strived to support the recovery (Tables 5–11). Interest
rate caps on one-year deposits were cut from 18 to 15 percent, and lending rates from 20 to
18 percent. Banks were instructed to allocate at least 10 percent of their loans to small and mediumsized enterprises and manufacturing. Statutory reserves requirements were selectively reduced from
13 to 10 percent based on banks’ asset quality and risk management. However, in the face of high
nonperforming loans (NPLs), real interest rates remain high. The non-oil fiscal deficit of the central
(general) government increased from 8.2 (11) percent of non-oil GDP in 2014/15 to
9.0 (11.5) percent in 2015/16 and is projected to rise to 10.6 (13.4) percent in 2016/17 as improved
tax collections prove insufficient to fully offset higher current spending and transfers to the Targeted
Subsidy Organization (TSO).1 The overall central (general) government fiscal deficit is estimated to
increase from 1.8 (2.9) percent of GDP in 2015/16 to 3.1 (3.2) percent of GDP by end-2016/17.
However, the 2017/18 central government budget submitted to parliament targets a zero balance
due to higher oil receipts.

The financial sector remains weak. NPLs are high (about 12 percent), but would be
significantly higher were it not for recent regulations permitting the rollover of overdue loans into
new loans contingent on a partial repayment. The implementation of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) in banks in 2016 shows that the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the
banking system has declined from 8.4 percent in March 2012 to 5.8 percent in March 2015. It also
revealed substantial capital needs in state-owned banks (16 percent of total assets) where the
average CAR is negative. Profitability remains constrained by the high cost of funds—some banks
are competing aggressively for deposits by offering rates above the mandated caps and the
interbank market rate remains at around 19 percent—and the lending rate cap.
10.
The authorities are starting to address financial system weakness. Most notably, the CBI
has restructured and brought most UFIs under its supervision, addressing an important source of
financial instability. The CBI has requested banks to

B. Outlook and Risks
11.
Growth is projected to stabilize at 4½ percent over the medium-term as the recovery
broadens. Real GDP growth is projected to reach 6.6 percent in 2016/17 reflecting the rebound in
oil production and exports (up 25 and 75 percent, respectively), and to ease to 3½ percent in
2017/18 as oil production remains at the OPEC target. Thereafter, higher FDI and a gradual
improvement in domestic credit conditions as financial reforms proceed drives investment, which
combined with improved economic efficiency from updated production capacity, lifts non-oil sector
growth. The current account is forecast to remain in surplus as higher exports offset the pick-up in
imports related to investment and pent-up domestic demand. Inflation is expected to temporarily
rise to 11.9 percent by end-2017/18 reflecting recent liquidity growth and pass-through from
exchange rate depreciation, but returns to single digits with prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
The pace of job creation lags that needed to absorb the large number of new entrants and
unemployment remains high.
12.
Risks are to the downside (see Risk Assessment Matrix). The renewed uncertainty
surrounding the JCPOA, and especially relations with the U.S., could deter investment and trade with
Iran and short-circuit the anticipated recovery. If the agreement is derailed, the economy could risk
recession. Likewise, any challenges in implementing the FATF action plan could hamper CBRs,
especially if counter-measures were re-imposed. Lower oil prices could increase pressure on export
and budget revenues, reducing fiscal space. Domestically, failure to garner support for the ambitious
reform program, especially banking sector reform, would see inflation rise, banking stress intensify,
and growth slow. The complex, intertwined, reform agenda also demands careful coordination and
sequencing.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10
percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize
jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

13.
The authorities concurred with staff’s assessment but stressed that with the envisaged
reforms growth could be much stronger. The reforms anticipated under the Sixth NDP are
expected to lift growth to 8 percent. The recent improvement in oil prices and unexploited potential
in hydrocarbons—Iran’s proven gas and oil reserves rank second and fourth in the world which
alongside the revised oil contract model isattracting new investors—will continue to spur growth
beyond 2017/18. The relatively diversified manufacturing and services sectors provide a good
spring-board to expand the non-oil sector. As FDI is critical to their growth strategy, the authorities
expressed concern that the inability to secure CBRs with large European banks is creating obstacles
to investment and renewed uncertainty could deter investment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A comprehensive and coordinated plan of action would focus in the next-year on (i) restructuring and
recapitalizing banks to safeguard financial stability and support growth, and (ii) defending low and
stable inflation by reducing liquidity growth while progressing to a market-based monetary policy
framework. Casting fiscal policy
in a medium-term framework
would over time create space
for reform costs and higher
public investment. Within the
structural reform agenda,
priority should be given in the
next year to reforms to laws
and regulations that facilitate
foreign investment to ease
domestic financing constraints.
Over the medium-term, labor market reforms would foster job creation.

A. Strengthening the Financial System to Support Growth
14.
The banking system is fragile. A legacy of government payment arrears, directed and
connected lending, and poor risk management practices have left banks’ balance sheets badly
impaired and capital positions weak (Figure 4). The authorities’ provisional estimates suggest that a
large share of bank assets are frozen in NPLs or non-earning real estate or public enterprise assets.
The fact that NPLs can only be written-off after 10 years and when they are 100 percent provisioned
encourages banks to rollover loans and helps explain the rapid pace of headline credit growth
despite high real interest rates and problems in access to finance (Section D).

1/ Public commercial banks are fully owned by the government. Specialized banks are also state -owned supporting specific
economic sectors (i.e. housing, agriculture, industry and mining, export promotion). Partly privatized banks are formerly
state-owned banks. While the government is committed to reduce its ownership to 20 percent over time, the share of the
government in these banks remains high at about 40 percent and the government maintains control over management.
Private banks have no direct government involvement.

15.
Banks’ reliance on CBI funding is growing. So far the banking system has been shielded
from systemic risks because of the banks’ funding model that is virtually independent from external
finance. State-owned, commercial and specialized banks, and partially privatized banks largely rely
on central bank funding to implement government credit directives. Private banks raise funds largely
from deposits or special purpose vehicles, and more recently from the new interbank market. Faced
with increased balance-sheet pressures, some banks have begun to compete aggressively for
deposits, pushing interest rates up for all banks despite caps, and keeping real interest rates high.
Interbank market rates remain elevated. Some banks are now reliant on uncollateralized overnight
liquidity support from the CBI. In this context, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the CBI to
contain overall liquidity growth to sustain low inflation.
16.
The mission recommended urgent action to restructure and recapitalize banks to
safeguard financial stability and bring down high real interest rates. In particular,


Putting distressed banks under administration or intensified supervision. This would prevent them
from competing excessively for deposits in the short-term while allowing an assessment of their
viability and determining an appropriate restructuring or resolution strategy.



An Asset Quality Review (AQR) of all banks and a forward-looking analysis of capital needs. This
would support the authorities’ efforts to push for realistic, time-bound recapitalization of viable
banks, and underpin the identification of nonviable institutions to be resolved.



Recapitalization of state-owned banks linked to measures to improve their long-term commercial
viability and orientation. Ultimately this would require the phasing out of government credit
directives and interest subsidies on specialized bank credit facilities to be financed by the
budget.



Stronger supervisory powers. The draft Banking and CBI bills grant the CBI the power to supervise
all deposit-taking institutions. The draft Resolution bill would enable the resolution of nonviable
banks and provides the Deposit Guarantee Fund the ability to repay insured deposits in a timely
manner. These draft laws significantly enhance the CBI’s supervisory powers and could be
further strengthened by stronger powers to intervene problem banks early and a broader range
of resolution options. A new corporate insolvency framework would allow insolvent corporates
to close and sell their assets. Quick passage of these bills, along with additional resources for
financial supervision, would allow the restructuring strategy to proceed. It would also enable a
transition to Basel capital standards, enhancing financial soundness and transparency.



Continued securitization of government arrears. A rigorous audit of arrears is proceeding. The
budget provided rials 480 trillion in new marketable government securities to settle arrears,
which has aided the nascent domestic debt market. With a further rials 3,500 trillion in
government liabilities to be cleared, the implications of new debt issuance for market interest
rates, as well as for the maturity profile of public debt and the government’s interest bill need to
be factored into the budget and coordinated with monetary policy. Steps to develop the

government bond market need to be expedited, including identifying state assets for the regular
issuance of Sharia compliant government securities.
17.
A stronger AML/CFT framework is essential to facilitate banks’ re-connection to the
global financial system and expand CBRs. It also enables better detection of proceeds from tax
crimes and corruption. Since 2015/16, the authorities have adopted a high level action plan with the
FATF and gained affiliation to the Eurasian AML/CFT group as an observer. Dedicated AML/CFT units
have been created in all banks. Cash courier and remittance laws, and the by-laws for the CFT law
have been drafted. Staff stresses the importance of fully implementing the FATF action plan,
enhancing the effectiveness of the framework by improving understanding of ML/TF risks,
improving identification of beneficial owners of accounts and legal entities,2 enhancing measures to
identify politically exposed persons, and moving to risk-based AML/CFT supervision.
18.
The authorities agreed on the need for swift action. They are working on a detailed road
map to implement banking reform, and have requested IMF technical assistance. The Banking and
CBI Bills should be approved by parliament by mid-2017. They underscored the need for broad
political consensus to tackle problem banks and alleviate banks from the burden of fiscal activities.
The authorities attach high priority to sustainably reducing high real interest rates, which have risen
as inflation moderated, through banking reform. They reiterated their strong commitment to
strengthen the AML/CFT framework which they see as essential for transparency and access to the
international financial system. Nonetheless, they stressed that their continued problems in
establishing CBRs with larger banks requires greater attention and international support.

B. Anchoring Low and Stable Inflation: Strengthening the Monetary Policy
Framework
19.
Iran’s monetary policy framework does not provide the CBI adequate tools to keep
inflation low and stable. In the presence of underdeveloped financial markets, weak transmission
mechanisms and ‘quasi-fiscal’ credit directives, it is difficult for the CBI to align liquidity growth with
the production potential of the economy. Injection and withdrawal of liquidity is controlled by
rationing. The CBI balance sheet is primarily driven by its loans to banks given the policy of credit
support to specific sectors, the government’s overdraft facility, and liquidity support to distressed
banks (Figure 5). In the near term, the government should sharply reduce its directed credit schemes
and adjust regulated prices to curb liquidity pressures and contain the risk of pass-through from
recent exchange rate deprecation. This would also free-up credit available for more productive firms.

Access to beneficial ownership information would allow correspondent banks to lower their compliance costs in
ensuring they do not conduct business with Iranian entities or persons on the sanctions list.

20.
The CBI requires greater independence and market-based instruments to sustain low
and stable inflation. The draft Central Bank Bill overhauls the monetary policy framework, making
low and stable inflation the CBI’s main objective. However, to bolster CBI independence to achieve
its new mandate, the bill should eliminate the positions for government representatives and
nonexperts on the central bank’s governing committees. A lender of last resort framework also
needs to be clearly defined—with the CBI’s liquidity facilities collateralized to minimize risks to its
balance sheet—and targeted to solvent banks. A target inflation range—the authorities’ objective is
to keep inflation below 10 percent—tools to manage liquidity such as central bank participation or
government paper, and a clear communication plan will all have to be developed to build the CBI’s
credibility to manage interest rates and control inflation (SIP, chapter 2).
21.
The mission recommends an early move to unify the exchange rate and shift to a
managed float given the need for flexibility to manage external shocks. Staff analysis suggests
the market rate is better aligned with fundamentals (Appendix I). The official rate subsidizes select
imports and does little to insulate inflation given pass-through from the depreciation in the market
rate. Unification would increase the value of oil proceeds in domestic currency terms and improve
the budget balance. It would also eliminate the economic distortions and potential rent-seeking that
arise under the dual rate system, promote competitiveness and non-oil exports, and afford the CBI
somewhat greater space to smooth pressures on the market rate. Stronger monetary and fiscal
policies would underpin credibility and support a stable exchange rate under the new regime. The
exact timing of unification has to be cognizant of FX market conditions and the extent of access to
international reserves.
22.
The authorities see the new central bank bill as key to sustaining low inflation
especially as they move to a unified exchange rate regime. Parliamentary committees are
working to build political consensus for greater operational independence for the CBI. They noted
that the success of the new system hinges on prudent fiscal policy. The securitization of
government arrears offered an opportunity to create monetary policy instruments. The authorities
saw the market rate as having overshot somewhat in the wake of seasonal factors and increased
uncertainty. They remain committed to the unification of the exchange rate. They continue to shift
goods to the bureau market, albeit at a slower pace due to recent FX volatility, and are encouraging
FX transactions to move to banks through tighter regulation of FX bureaus. However, because CBRs
constrain access to reserves, the CBI’s ability to intervene in the foreign exchange market is curtailed.
Against this backdrop, the authorities express their commitment to unify the exchange rate by endFebruary 2018 as access to reserves improves.

C. Fiscal Policy Reform to Promote Faster Inclusive Growth
23.
Fiscal policy has to adapt to the spending pressures arising from balance sheet repair
while finding space to support growth. Interest payments are set to rise from 0.9 percent of GDP
in 2016/17 to about 3 percent over the medium-term reflecting securitization of government
arrears. However, the bonds required for bank recapitalization—the amount and terms of which will
only be determined once an AQR is conducted—will add further pressure to the debt burden and
interest bill. Additional budgetary investment spending of about 1½ percent of GDP a year would
help upgrade infrastructure and support growth. Pressure on the social security system is also rising

despite the young population. At the same time, the overall level of the fiscal deficit and the fiscal
stance needs to be prudent to support low inflation and rebuild buffers.
24.
A medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) that targets a gradual adjustment in the nonoil fiscal deficit by creating space, primarily via domestic revenue mobilization, balances these
needs (SIP, chapter 3). Although public debt is set to rise above 40 percent of GDP as new debt is
issued to clear government liabilities, it remains sustainable and robust to shocks (Appendix II). With
ample, long-lasting oil resources, Iran has some space to target a gradual adjustment in the non-oil
fiscal deficit to the

including arrears clearance
and potential costs of bank recapitalization, additional measures of about 7¼ percent of non-oil
GDP should be identified over the next five years to contain the non-oil deficit in the range of
12 percent of non-oil GDP to support low inflation and underpin the credibility of the monetary
policy framework. After 2021/22 further measures would be needed to reduce the non-oil deficit to
the PIH norm to create savings for future generations. A comprehensive financing plan and
improved cash management would avoid arrears and recourse to CBI’s and banks’ balance sheets to
implement off-budget fiscal initiatives.
25.
The government should revisit its oil revenue management strategy, with the view of
funding banking sector reform and creating buffers. Currently, 65 percent of oil revenue goes to
the central government’s budget while one-fifth goes the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI)
that on-lends these funds to banks to fund private sector investment.3 Directing a greater
proportion of oil revenues to the budget could help fund the prospective additional interest burden
arising from bank recapitalization. Using a portion of NDFI assets (10 percent of GDP) to replenish
the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) would provide the budget a buffer to safeguard spending levels in
the event of a shock.

Expanding domestic revenues and improving the composition and efficiency of
spending would ensure the adjustment is growth-friendly and protects the poor (Figure 7). The
government aims to increase tax revenue from 7 to 10 percent of GDP. This will require a broader
tax base (Box 2) and improved administration. Raising the VAT rate—which is less distortive to
investment and savings than personal or corporate income taxes—can compensate for the revenue
lost from the corporate tax incentives and the cut in personal income tax rates approved in 2016/17.
Generous tax incentives and exemptions can be rationalized and steps taken to revised the income
tax code to safeguard against the risk of base erosion (SIP, Chapter 4). Re-organizing the Iran
National Tax Authority by taxpayer groups and creating within it a risk management unit would
bolster taxpayer compliance.

the poorest households—which has halved in real terms since 2011 and contributed to higher
poverty—and halve the poverty rate (measured at $5.5 per day, PPP adjusted) and improve equity.
28.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to prudent fiscal policy. Their ultimate
aim is to ensure that current government spending is fully funded by non-oil revenue and that oil
resources are used for investment or saved. Although they have not reinstated the OSF, in the wake
of low oil prices they have reduced the share of oil receipts going to the NDFI to allow the budget’s
share to rise. If the oil price were to rise above the budgeted amount of $55 per bbl., the additional
revenues would be saved. While the authorities have yet to formulate a MTFF, they aim to mobilize
domestic revenue through improved tax administration. Administrative difficulties in identifying rich
households has prevented their quick removal from the cash transfer system.

Multiplier estimates suggest higher investment spending of 1.5 percent of GDP per year would offset the negative
growth impact of the authorities’ plan to increase tax collections to 10 percent of GDP.

With the introduction of VAT in 2008, the

development of a modern tax system is underway.
Indirect taxes are growing but direct taxes still account for
almost half of total tax revenues, with corporate income
taxes (CIT) accounting for 36 percent. A number of
changes can bring the tax system in-line with international
practice and mobilize revenue:

VAT component and apply the VAT to excise-inclusive prices. At present, the 9 percent VAT rate is
supplemented by higher rates on cigarettes and tobacco (12 percent) and vehicle fuels (20 percent). The
latter mimics excises for consumers but when these goods are used as a production input their prices do not
include these taxes because they are refunded under the VAT, leading to significant revenue loss.


Increase and broaden excises. Excise rates are low by international standards. There is scope to

raise rates, shift to easier-to-administer specific rates, and introduce new excises, e.g., on beverages and
telecommunications. Introducing ad-valorem excises on motor vehicles would address environmental goals,
supplement revenue, and enhance tax progressivity.


Shift investment incentives from profit to cost-based measures. Profit-based investment tax

incentives—income exemptions, reduced rates, tax holidays—have proliferated under the CIT and are often
open-ended. Specific investment allowances—accelerated depreciation schemes and investment tax
deductions or credits—would lower the cost of capital for more investments, encouraging greater
investment with less revenue loss.


Continue moving closer to a global income tax system. The rationalization of personal income

tax rates for public and private sector wage income in 2015/16 was an important step forward. Nonetheless,
income taxes are mostly “schedular” with different income—wages, self-employed income, rents—taxed
under separate schedules. Moving closer to a global income tax system that combines taxpayers’ incomes
from all sources, and applying a single, progressive rate schedule would increase equity and limit incentives
for tax planning.

30.
Structural reforms can spur private sector growth, mitigate the effects of fiscal
adjustment, and provide opportunities to improve living standards durably. In particular:


Refocusing the role and resources of the state would facilitate private sector development. Higher
infrastructure investment, reducing the large role of the state in the economy, the removal of
government-imposed constraints such as excessive red tape, administered prices, and greater
commercial orientation of state-owned firms would help level the playing field for new and
smaller firms to enter markets, grow and create jobs.



Regulatory reforms can attract foreign investors to ease financing constraints as the banking
reform proceeds while bringing technical know-how and innovation. A registry of corporate
beneficial ownership would complement AML/CFT reforms, addressing concerns that have made
some investors and correspondent banks hesitant to enter or deal with Iran. Establishing an
independent anti-corruption agency, actively pursuing cases, and enhancing the system of
declaration of assets of high-level public officials in line with international standards would
bolster accountability, transparency, and improve the business climate.



Higher female participation and employment can boost growth (Box 3). Female labor force
participation has improved slightly and over 4 million women work outside the home. Over half
of university students are female where they comprise over 70 percent of science, and over half

Box 3. Unlocking Growth and Improving Female Labor Market Outcomes
Iran is working on improving women’s labor market outcomes…
Despite significant improvements in educational attainment and gender parity in education, Iran has
not achieved commensurate improvements in women’s labor market outcomes.

Female Unemployment rate

Sources: ILO (TRENDS database)

In a context of evolving social norms and greater need for two-earner households, the government has
sought to better understand women’s participation by measuring the value of domestic work in the
national accounts and fostering economic diversification and job creation in sectors where women
work. The Vice-Presidency for Women’s Affairs has taken action to increase employment opportunities,
in part through a review of gender quotas; ready women for promotion in the public sector via
training; enforce non-discrimination in hiring; and promote more affordable child-care near or at work.
As they address NPLs, they have provided a longer grace period on loans owed by women.
Higher economic growth is correlated with greater female labor force participation (FLFP)…
By enlarging talents available to employers, better female labor market outcomes enhance growth.
Recent studies estimate that bringing the female employment rate to male levels could raise GDP in
Japan by 9 percent, the United Arab Emirates by 12 percent, and Egypt by 34 percent. Under similar
assumptions, we estimate the GDP boost in Iran would be around 40 percent.
But often to realize this potential measures targeted at women are needed….
Even as Ireland’s economic development accelerated in the 1970s, FLFP remained around 30 percent.
Only the evolution of social norms and the removal of institutional barriers to women’s participation—
such as restrictions on married women’s employment, night work and pay discrimination—eventually
enabled firms to employ more workers, especially in traditionally female sectors such as textiles,
thereby supporting Ireland’s export-led growth strategy.
A recent World Bank report on Women, Business and the Law shows 65 economies made 94 reforms to
improve gender parity during 2013–15, and identified 23 gender-based legal restrictions in Iran. Fiscal
policy can be designed to avoid work disincentives for women for example by shifting from family to
individual income taxation; tax credits or other benefits for low-wage earners (e.g., Belgium, Finland);
family allowances that help parents reconcile work and family care; or pension reforms that address
retirement age gaps. Broader regulatory reforms that support flexible work, improve the quality and
quantity of child and elderly care, and ensure safe transport, can help.

of the medical student populations. The government can enhance women’s opportunities and
boost growth by hiring more women and ensuring non-discrimination in all job advertisements,
hiring, and pay. Active labor market policies that offer business skills, management and
entrepreneurship training, and affordable child-care can aid greater female participation.


Active labor market policies to tackle youth unemployment. Better coordination with the private
sector would better align the education and training system to the skills needs of employers.
Revisions to the labor code can address the rigidities in regulations—such as high job protection
and benefits to those who are employed for more than a year—that deter job creation and
longer-term work contracts. Consideration could be given to offering firms a temporary tax
credit (or reduction in payroll taxes) for new hires funded by new budgetary resources or
savings, pending a pension reform that tackles high social security contribution rates.

31.
Job creation is at the heart of the authorities’ growth strategy. The NDP bill in
parliament anticipates concrete steps—e.g., permitting the public sector companies to procure
services from the private sector—to improve the regulatory environment for private firms. The
authorities noted that discussions have started on the broad reform of the labor code anticipated
under the NDP to remove constraints to hiring and firing for permanent contracts. To improve the
match between labor supply and demand, they are seeking to improve the quality and relevance
of education and training through greater private sector involvement and the introduction of
entrepreneurship courses in the education curriculum. As in many countries in the region, social
norms and legal barriers have hampered female participation but economic necessity means that
more women are working.

E. Other Issues
32.
More timely and comprehensive data will support the modernization of the fiscal and
monetary frameworks and foreign investment. Data in most sectors is infrequent (Informational
Annex) and suffers shortcomings. The mission encourages the authorities to participate in the
e-GDDS by developing a national summary data page to disseminate key macroeconomic data, and
to develop a program to strengthen data quality, availability, and timeliness.
33.
The exchange rate regime gives rise to several multiple currency practices (MCPs) and
an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. A MCP
and exchange restriction arise from the establishment of an official exchange rate for use in some
exchange transactions, which differs by more than two percent from the rate used by foreign
exchange bureaus. Two other MCPs arise from the differences of more than two percent between
the current official and bureau market rates, and the preferential rates for certain imports for which
foreign exchange payment commitments were made through letters of credits or bank drafts prior
to March 21, 2002 and July 24, 2012.5

5

The MCP related to the pre-March 21, 2002 letters of credit are expected to be removed once the commitments
under these letters mature. The authorities are committed to eliminate the MCP related to letters of credits or banks
drafts prior to July 2012 by end-February 2018.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The economy is staging an impressive recovery after the lifting of nuclear sanctions in
2016. Oil production rebounded quicker than expected but the recovery in the non-oil sector is still
nascent. Staff commends the achievement under difficult conditions of single digit inflation and
stabilization of the foreign exchange market. Staff welcomes recent steps to strengthen the
AML/CFT framework, the introduction of IFRS reporting standards in banks, and audit and
securitization of government liabilities which will help unlock corporates’ and banks’ balance sheets
and facilitate greater investment.
35.
The challenge now is to create the conditions for sustained stability and growth.
Renewed uncertainty underscores the importance of advancing reforms to lessen Iran’s reliance on
oil, develop the private sector, and build buffers. Rapid and resolute implementation of the
authorities’ comprehensive reform plan would help meet these goals. Priority should be given to the
restructuring and recapitalization of banks to sustain financial stability and fund growth. This would
also alleviate liquidity pressures, help safeguard low and stable inflation, and facilitate the transition
to a new monetary policy framework and managed float. Fiscal policy needs to create space to fund
these reforms and support growth. Structural reforms that facilitate foreign investment such as
improvements in the transparency of corporate ownership would ease domestic financing
constraints as banking reform proceed. Reducing the role of the state and improving the business
climate would aid job creation.
36.
Banking reform is now urgent to sustain financial stability and reduce high lending
rates. Distressed banks require enhanced supervision. An AQR would identify viable banks that
warrant recapitalization and nonviable banks to be resolved. Recapitalization of state-owned banks
should be linked to measures that improve their commercial viability. The government should
continue the securitization of its arrears. Quick approval of the new banking and resolution bills
would give the CBI the supervisory powers to implement the reform and help it safeguard financial
soundness.
37.
Prudent fiscal policy and liquidity growth are critical to keep inflation well anchored
and permit exchange rate unification. The government should recapitalize public banks, wind
down its directed credit schemes, and reform regulated prices to reduce banks’ and public
enterprises’ need for CBI liquidity. Staff urges quick passage of the Central Bank bill to modernize
the monetary policy framework and provide greater operational independence to the CBI to pursue
low and stable inflation. Staff recommends an early move to unify the exchange rate and shift to a
managed float to have flexibility to manage external shocks. It also acknowledges the need for
expanded CBRs to enhance growth prospects and ensure better access to foreign reserves.
38.
Staff urge the authorities to move to a MTFF to accommodate reform needs and
underpin their commitment to prudent fiscal policy. A MTFF that takes advantage of the sizeable
oil resources and moderate debt burden would ensure a gradual adjustment to the additional fiscal
costs from banking system reform. Higher revenue collections, further fuel price adjustment, and

better targeting of cash transfers would create space to support growth and equity through higher
public investment spending and cash transfers for the poor. Replenishing the OSF would provide the
budget a buffer. The authorities should explore the scope to use oil revenues to fund bank
recapitalization.
39.
Fostering private non-oil sector development and job creation calls for comprehensive
legal and regulatory reform. Enhancing the AML/CFT framework will facilitate re-integration to the
global financial system and tackle proceeds of crimes including corruption and tax evasion.
Improved labor market regulations, with specific measures to facilitate youth and female
employment, would ensure more people have opportunities to work and make growth more
inclusive.
40.
Staff encourage the authorities to improve the quality, timeliness and availability of
data, including by participating in E-GDDS.
41.
Staff recommends Executive Board approval of the retention of the MCP and
exchange restriction arising from the greater than the two percent deviation between the
official and bureau exchange rates, since they are maintained for balance of payments
reasons, are non-discriminatory, and are temporary in light of the authorities’ commitment to
unify the exchange rate regime by end-February 2018. Staff also recommends Executive Board
approval of the retention of the two MCPs relating to the use of preferential exchange rates for
certain imports, as referred to in paragraph 33, through end-February 2018. These measures are not
maintained for balance of payments reasons, do not impede balance of payments adjustment, and
do not discriminate among members or harm the interests of other members.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment
Iran’s external position is characterized by low external debt, high reserves and a current account
surplus. The official exchange rate is moderately overvalued. The bureau rate is 15 percent more
depreciated than the official rate. The unification of the exchange rate is expected to result in the
exchange rate settling between the current official and market rates, which in turn, would likely make
the unified rate more closely in line with fundamentals.

F. Overview
1.
The current account position has remained in surplus, despite the sharp drop in oil
prices, due to the rapid rebound in oil exports, and strengthening non-oil exports (e.g., automobiles
and petrochemicals) following the lifting of sanctions (Table 1). The current account surplus is
expected to decline over the medium-term but remain in modest surplus, reflecting the increase in
imports to meet investment needs and consumer demand.1 The financial account is poised to
improve, reflecting large FDI commitments and Iran’s gradual reconnection to the global financial
system. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies are expected to preserve external stability by avoiding
excessive exchange rate fluctuations and containing real appreciation pressures from higher oil
exports and increasing private sector demand.
2.
External buffers are adequate but limited CBRs hamper reserve management. To
address the latter, Iran has reached agreements with some countries to convert its dollar reserves
and export earnings into other currencies and is increasingly denominating its oil sales contracts in
euros. The uncertain outlook for oil prices, the impact of remaining sanctions, and risk of snap-back
sanctions under the JCOPA pose risks to Iran’s external position.

Iran will import new aircrafts to replace its aged commercial fleet and is investing in the modernization of oil
refining, petrochemical and manufacturing production capacity,

Appendix Table 1. External Sector Vulnerabilities
Background. Current account surpluses shrunk from just over 6 percent of GDP in
2012/13 to 2.4 percent in 2015/16 due to the decline in oil exports and sanctions.
However, oil exports have now recovered to pre-sanctions levels and non-oil exports
Current account: Higher surplus grew by $21.6 billion in the first eight months of FY 2016/17. The main exported
driven by rebound in oil exports items apart from oil include gas condensates, liquefied gas and autos.
Assessment. The current account remains in surplus. Expanding non-oil exports will
be crucial to reduce Iran’s dependency on oil revenue, contain the impact of rising
imports, and build external buffers.
Background. Iran has a dual exchange rate system: an official rate for imports of
select priority goods, and a bureau, market-determined rate for all other
transactions. The CBI has shifted about half of goods categories and all services
from the official to bureau market, most recently moving imports of wheat and food
Real exchange rate: overvalued products to the bureau market.
Assessment. The real effective exchange rate calculated using the official rate is
overvalued. However, uncertainty around oil prices and sanctions complicate the
assessment. The government plans to unify the exchange rate and move to a
managed float which could eliminate the overvaluation.
Background. Iran’s economy was cut-off from global financial markets due to
international sanctions until January 2016. However, FDI flows are returning, mostly
in oil and gas sectors and automotives.
Capital and financial account:
insignificant

FX assets/reserves: large but
some problems in access

Assessment. The capital account is small. One major challenge hampering the
development of the capital account is the reconnection of Iranian banks to the
international financial system reflecting both the impact of remaining sanctions and
need to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and weak domestic banks.

Background. Iran’s foreign exchange assets/reserves stood at $128 billion at endMarch 16, equivalent to 19 months of imports and 40 percent of broad money. Post
JCPOA implementation, Iran has been able to access more of its reserves, but
challenges remain. Iran is increasingly settling its trade in euros (notably for oil) and
converting its reserves to currencies other than the US dollar.
Assessment. The level of gross foreign exchange assets is comfortable.

Foreign assets and liabilities
position: no detailed
information available

Background. Gross external debt is low, around 2 percent of GDP. Foreign assets of
the banking system, including the CBI, are equivalent to about 50 percent of GDP.
However, a non-negligible share of foreign assets are reported to be frozen or
encumbered even after sanctions relief.
Assessment. IIP data are not disseminated. In recent years, the compilation of data
has been very difficult owing to challenges in tracking foreign assets. (see
informational annex)

G. Exchange Rate Assessment
3.
The exchange rate assessment points to a moderate overvaluation in the official
exchange rate of about 5–7 percent. The bureau rate is 15 percent more depreciated than the
official rate. The unification of the exchange rate would be expected to result in the exchange rate
settling between the current official and market rates, which in turn, would likely make the unified
rate broadly in line with fundamentals.


Current account approach. The REER is moderately overvalued by 5.7 percent. The current
account balance (CA) in 2015 of 2.1 percent of GDP is below the norm of 2.9 percent of GDP.
The two main drivers of the CA norm in Iran are labor productivity and the fiscal position. A
widening fiscal deficit and comparatively low productivity has left the CA surplus weaker than
the norm. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies would contain inflation and aid competitiveness.
Reforms to improve the business climate and labor market would address Iran’s productivity
gap.



Real effective exchange rate approach. The REER is moderately overvalued by 7 percent. The
overvaluation is mostly driven by the positive real interest rate differential and decline in terms
of trade. Exchange rate unification and transition to a managed float would allow the economy
to better manage terms of trade shocks.

4.
Iran’s bureau or market exchange rate also suggests the official rate is overvalued. The
premium between the parallel rate and the official rate declined to about 14 percent over the course
of 2016, but widened to 20 percent towards to end-2016 amid dollar strength before falling to
15 percent in early 2017. The authorities have moved 53 percent of categories of goods imports
from the priority list of imports that are valued at the official exchange rate to the bureau market.

H. External Sustainability
5.
Iran’s external position suggests no significant misalignment, or sustainability risk.
External debt is low and forecast to remain stable at around 2 percent of GDP. Data on the
international investment position are not available reflecting shortcomings in compilation of private
sector external assets (see Statistical Annex).

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year. It increases rapidly in the projection period, as Iran is projected to
continue to securitize its debt with interest-bearing instrument.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. The large residual in 2015 corresponds
to the recognition of government arrears.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

The primary balance shock assumes a total primary balance lowered by 2.5 percent over the projection period, with interest rate increased by 0.25 percent. The real GDP growth shock
assumes growth lower by 1 percentage point in 2017 and 2018, while inflation and interest rates increase by 0.25 percent. The real effective exchange rate assumes a real depreciation of
100 percent, with a passthrough of 25 percent. The interest rate shock assumes a real interest higher by 2 percent. The combined shock takes the worse impact on each variables of the
shocks mentioned above.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR)
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the

B. Exchange System
The official exchange rate’s de jure classification is a managed float. De facto, however, it has
followed a crawl-like arrangement since March 2014, depreciating about one percent per month
against the U.S. dollar. The bureau market has displayed greater flexibility as it is largely marketdetermined. With effect from September 6, 2004, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Iran maintains
multiple currency practices and an exchange restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article
VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3:


A multiple currency practice and an exchange restriction, arises from the establishment of an
official exchange rate for use in some exchange transactions, which in practice differs by more
than two percent from the rate used by foreign exchange bureaus.



A multiple currency practice arises from the differences of more than 2 percent between the
current official and exchange bureaus rates and the preferential rates for certain imports for
which foreign exchange commitments were made through letters of credit opened prior to
March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple exchange rate system.



A multiple currency practice arises from the differences of more than two percent between the
current official and exchange bureaus rates and the preferential rates for certain imports for
which foreign exchange payment commitments were made through letters of credits or bank
drafts prior to July 24, 2012.

C. Last Article IV Consultation
Iran is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded
by the Executive Board on December 7, 2015, and was published on December 21, 2015:

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
The World Bank Group does not have a country program strategy in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The
last Interim Assistance Strategy covered FY2002-2005, and the last IBRD project closed in 2012. The
IFC has no exposure to the Islamic Republic of Iran. MIGA issued two guarantees in 2005, and no
guarantees have been provided since then. Iran is currently a member of the Bank in good standing
and is a donor to IDA16.
The Bank prepares a bi-annual economic monitoring note (Iran Economic Review) that analyzes
recent economic developments in Iran and provides a medium-term economic outlook as well as
special focus sections on two selected issues. The Bank has also recently initiated an analytical work
program on Iran that comprises several topics ranging from productivity to air pollution.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some data shortcomings noted below.
Data are reported with delays and also provided infrequently.
The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) disseminates key statistical aggregates in its quarterly Economic
Trends, also available at http://www.cbi.ir/default_en.aspx.
National Accounts
GDP data are broadly sound. Accessibility of the quarterly estimates could be improved and made
available with a consistent time lag. There is also scope for the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and the
Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) to advance their cooperation with a view to harmonizing their
respective national accounts compilation programs. The CBI’s GDP rebasing exercise is on track,
with the results expected to be available by the end of 2016/17 Iranian year. Communicating the
rebasing plans ahead to users is international best practice and would enhance the credibility of
the exercise.
Data on labor force and unemployment are published on the SCI website.
Price Statistics
A monthly consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PTI) are produced and
disseminated by the CBI. The indices used 2011 as the base year, are of good quality, and are
released in a timely manner.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
GFS cover only the central government; and are released without details on all the components
of expenditure, and on an irregular basis. The authorities do not have the capacity to compile
general government fiscal data due to shortcomings in the chart of accounts, inability to track
and record general government transactions. Efforts are being made to strengthen the Treasury
functions—a new debt management office was created and the authorities are transitioning over
the coming years to a treasury single account and planning a gradual move to accrual based
accounting—are ongoing, and are expected to enhance data quality and availability. The reporting
of GFS data for publication in the Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) was discontinued in
2010. The resumption of GFS data reporting for IFS publication is encouraged.
While central government data are compiled in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM), there is scope for improving the coverage of fiscal reporting on general
government by including the nonfinancial public corporations sector, as well as other public
agencies such as the National Development Fund of Iran, the Oil Stabilization Fund, and Targeted

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

Subsidy Organization. Improving the scope and coverage of GFS would safeguard against arrears
and allow better monitoring of liabilities, guarantees and fiscal risks.
The authorities plan to move from cash to accrual accounting in the context of broader reform of
their public financial management system, for which they have received Fund TA.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monthly monetary data on central bank and deposit money banks are reported to STA for
publication in the IFS, but not using the standardized report forms (SRFs). Reporting timeliness
needs to be improved. Compilation of monetary statistics for central bank and deposit money
banks diverges from international standards in the application of the residency criterion and in the
sectorization and classification of accounts. The authorities are undertaking improvements in these
areas, in line with the recommendations of past STA missions. The measure of broad money
employed by the CBI does not include deposits of public nonfinancial corporations, local
governments, or foreign-currency deposits of residents. The authorities do not compile and report
monetary data for other financial corporations.
Financial Sector
The CBI publishes quarterly information on the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans in
domestic and foreign currency in its Economic Trends. The NPL data are sourced from banks’ data
reported to the CBI. The authorities also share with Fund Staff several other financial soundness
indicators (FSIs). Iran does not participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
(CPIS) which collects data on cross border exposures. The availability of SRF-based MFS would also
support more robust financial sector analysis using the balance sheet approach.
External Sector Statistics
The CBI has advanced work in adapting its external sector statistics compilation program in the
line with the Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5), but has no short-term plans
for moving to the most recent methodological standard (BPM6) issued on 2009.
The CBI does not submit balance of payments data to the Fund for re-dissemination in the IFS.
However, based on the data provided to Fund staff for surveillance, the large size of the errors and
omissions in recent periods is an area of concern, and likely reflect gaps in the recording of
financial account entries. A key issue is the coverage of financial flows associated with export
proceeds of the petrochemical sector. These proceeds are likely held in deposits abroad for which
no information is available; and this results in unrecorded counter entries to the exports recorded
in the current account (goods). Steps should be taken to collect this information directly from the
companies. Inward direct investment (DI) statistics are compiled by the Organization for
Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI) whose work is focused on
investment approvals for the nonoil sector. The recording of actual investment inflows could be
improved; and the use of DI surveys should be explored to address possible gaps, including
reinvested earnings.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

Data on the international investment position (IIP) are compiled, but not disseminated. The
authorities lack of capacity to compile complete and accurate IIP data owing to difficulties in
tracking foreign assets under sanctions and the lack of information on corporate net foreign asset
holdings. In recent years, the compilation of data has been very difficult under sanctions owing to
difficulties in tracking foreign assets. Only data on public and publicly-guaranteed external debt
are disseminated, but classifications do not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt
Guide. Iran does not participate in the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS)
database. Reserve asset positions are available to Fund staff but are not publicly disseminated. The
data template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not compiled.
Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since 2012. Iran still needs to
improve the scope and timeliness of data
dissemination to meet the Enhanced-GDDS, and
is encouraged to develop and maintain a
national summary data page.

No data ROSC is available.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for the Islamic Republic of Iran
February 24, 2017
My Iranian authorities thank staff for the high-quality engagement and policy advice
under the 2016 Article IV consultation. They are also grateful for the Fund’s technical
assistance that has complemented their own efforts at economic reforms. They broadly
concur with staff analysis and policy recommendations, and look forward to continued
close dialogue and collaboration with the Fund in the period ahead.
Overview
Building on its hallmark achievement of signing and implementing the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which paved the way for the lifting of
international nuclear sanctions on January 16, 2016, President Rouhani’s administration
has made significant progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, improving fiscal
management, advancing growth-enhancing structural reforms, and promoting Iran’s
reintegration into the global economic and financial system. This has enhanced
confidence, as evidenced by increased private sector activity and the re-engagement of
foreign investors with their Iranian counterparts, which together with increased oil
production, has helped boost growth, strengthen the external and fiscal positions, and
lower inflation. Iran’s return to the oil market and its participation in the recent OPEC
agreement have had a stabilizing impact on the oil market.
My authorities believe that the lifting of sanctions and their ambitious reform agenda are
yet to produce their full beneficial impact on the Iranian economy and positive regional
and global spillover effects. Indeed, the economy is still some distance away from fully
tapping its huge investment and trade potential, given its vast hydrocarbon reserves,
relatively diversified non-oil sector, large domestic market, and young and well-educated
labor force. Regrettably, remaining US sanctions and related uncertainty have hindered
the return of global banks to the Iranian market and continue to hamper large-scale
investment and trade. My authorities remain fully committed to their international
obligations, including under the JCPOA and to FATF. They will persevere with their
reform agenda to make the economy more resilient to external shocks, while expecting
that the remaining constraints to Iran’s reintegration into the global economic and
financial system will be eliminated soon.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The economy has staged a remarkable turnaround from last year’s recession, aided by
a swift recovery in oil production and exports to pre-sanctions levels, and facilitated by
Iranian banks’ partial reintegration into the global financial system. Growth is estimated
to have rebounded to about 7 percent for the current Iranian year 2016/17 with oil
production back to close to full potential and recovery in non-oil activity. Average CPI

2
inflation dropped to single digit—the first such achievement in the past 25 years—
reflecting the authorities’ prudent monetary and fiscal policies. However, although
667,000 new jobs were created in 2015/16, the unemployment rate has continued to
hover around 11 percent and may have inched upwards in the current fiscal year, given
the large number of new entrants into the labor market due to demographic factors and
increased labor force participation.
Prudent fiscal policy over the past 5 years has kept the budget deficit low in spite of
challenging circumstances marked by the oil embargo and price decline. Non-oil deficit
of the central government to non-oil GDP in 2016/17 is estimated to widen from
9.0 percent of GDP to 10.6 percent, as improved tax and other non-oil revenue may not
fully offset higher interest payments and transfers to the Targeted Subsidy Organization
(TSO), which administers revenues from domestic fuel sales to finance cash transfers.
Public debt-to-GDP ratio, which increased sharply from 12 percent to 42 percent in
2015/16, mainly as a result of recognition of government arrears and their securitization,
is estimated to decline to 35 percent in 2016/17 and to 29 percent next year. However, it
could rise again above 40 percent of GDP after full recognition of remaining government
arrears and their securitization and issuance of securities for bank capitalization, but
would nonetheless remain moderate, sustainable, and robust to shocks, as indicated by
staff. The current account surplus is projected to increase to over 6 percent of GDP owing
to higher oil export volumes, more favorable oil prices, and continued strong growth in
non-oil exports. International reserves are comfortable at the equivalent of 20 months of
imports, 40 percent of broad money, and 15 times the total external debt, even though
access to reserves, while improving, remains somewhat constrained. The foreign
exchange market has been broadly stable and the spread between the official and the
market rates stands at about 15 percent.
My authorities are cognizant of the downside risks to the near- and medium-term outlook
and are determined to steadfastly pursue sound policies to preserve macroeconomic and
financial stability and promote inclusive growth. They will do the utmost to garner broad
public and political support for their ambitious reform agenda, which is outlined in the
draft Sixth Five Year Development Plan (6FYDP: 2017/18 – 2021/22) bill currently
under discussion in the parliament.
Against this background, my authorities remain committed to strengthening the
underlying fiscal position by reducing the non-oil fiscal deficit, anchoring low and stable
inflation, unifying the exchange rate, ensuring a solid banking sector, and advancing
structural reforms to foster private sector development, job creation, and high and
sustainable growth. Critical reforms in these areas will allow Iran to tap its huge potential
in proven oil and gas reserves (4th and 2nd largest in the world, respectively), further
develop its well-diversified manufacturing and services sectors, and attract private capital
inflows in the hydrocarbon, automobile, aviation, telecom, and tourism industries, among
others.

3
My authorities have cleared virtually all unintended arrears to export credit agencies, and
are diligently working on strengthening the AML/CFT framework. However, they remain
concerned that renewed uncertainty regarding US sanctions, lingering memories of large
fines imposed by the US on international banks that conduct business with Iran, and
continued US dollar clearing restrictions, could continue to hamper the re-establishment
of corresponding banking relations (CBRs) with large global banks, and potentially deter
investment and trade with Iran. Should CBRs be fully re-established, and U-Turn
mechanism for US dollar clearing reinstated, the envisaged reforms foreseen in the
6FYDP could help deliver significantly higher rates of growth over the medium term than
those projected by staff.
Fiscal Policy
Higher oil revenue will facilitate gradual fiscal consolidation and create space for
spending pressures associated with arrears securitization, bank restructuring and
recapitalization, and key infrastructure and social outlays. The 2017/18 budget submitted
to the parliament targets a zero balance for both the central government and the TSO. The
authorities remain focused on lowering the non-oil deficit, consistent with their ultimate
goal to fully fund current spending from non-oil revenue and use the oil resources for
investment or building fiscal buffers. The planned fiscal adjustment seeks to increase
non-oil tax collection to 10 percent of GDP and improve the composition and efficiency
of spending. On the revenue side, efforts will be directed at broadening the tax base,
gradually raising VAT rates, rationalizing personal and corporate income tax rates, and
strengthening tax and customs administration to bolster compliance. On the expenditure
side, the authorities will continue to lower the budgetary cost of fuel subsidies by
adjusting domestic fuel prices, in line with international price movements, and removing
high-income households from the cash transfer beneficiary list, which would make room
for raising the allocation to the poorest segments of the population and improving equity.
However, progress in this area will be faster once ongoing efforts at removing
administrative difficulties in identifying and means-testing these households are
completed.
My authorities agree on the need to cast the government’s budget in a medium-term fiscal
framework, better articulate fiscal objectives in the FYDPs, make the non-oil primary
balance the main fiscal anchor, strengthen the link between the FYDPs and the annual
budgets, and enhance coordination between key government entities in charge of budget
preparation and implementation. They are benefiting from the newly-established treasury
single account and phased introduction of accrual accounting. They are aware of the
potential financial sector contingencies, as highlighted in the report, and are working
toward allocating more resources for the prospective restructuring and recapitalization
of the banking sector. Moreover, the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) could
be used to finance priority projects in deprived areas, for which private sector funding is
usually unavailable, thereby alleviating investment spending pressures on the budget. The

4
share of oil revenue going to the NDFI could also be revisited in case budgetary oil
receipts fall short of expectations.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary policy is guided by the disinflation strategy aimed at maintaining inflation at
single digit levels. Inflation has been gradually reduced over the past three years as a
result of sound macroeconomic policies. However, a combination of factors may work in
the opposite direction, including in particular the recent pickup in monetary expansion
stemming from banks’ increased reliance on central bank (CBI) overdraft facility, the
government drawing on its revolving facility, selective reduction in statutory reserve
requirements from 13 to 10 percent, based on banks’ asset quality and risk management,
CBI’s injection of liquidity through the interbank market to reduce high interbank rates,
and the high pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to CPI inflation. While
inflation might temporarily rise above 10 percent by end 2017/18, the authorities are
confident that prudent policies will help contain overall liquidity growth and bring
inflation back to single digits.
The overhaul of the monetary policy framework, as envisaged under the draft CBI bill,
would help refocus CBI’s legal mandate on low and stable inflation and entrench
macroeconomic stability. The bill also strengthens governance of the CBI, and mandates
full repayment of all the funds the government receives from CBI by the end of the same
fiscal year. My authorities agree on the need to enhance CBI’s operational autonomy,
collateralize liquidity facilities, define a target inflation range, broaden market-based
liquidity management tools, and develop a clear communication policy. They appreciate
staff work on the reform of the monetary policy framework, and welcome their reflection
on the draft CBI and banking bills to ensure compliance with international best practices.
My authorities remain committed to unifying the exchange rate and returning to a
managed float regime, expected to take place by end February 2018, once relations with
foreign correspondent banks are normalized and full access to reserves restored. They
continue to shift priority goods imports to the bureau market rate, and to encourage
foreign exchange transactions to move to banks. These efforts, however, have not been
facilitated by the limited access to international reserves, which has curtailed CBI’s
ability to intervene in the foreign exchange market, as needed, to reduce the bureau
market rate premium over the official exchange rate. Exchange rate unification, would
help address the moderate overvaluation in the official exchange rate and make the
unified rate broadly in line with fundamentals.

5
Financial Sector
The banking system continues to grapple with a legacy of government payment arrears,
distortive credit policies, weak risk management, and inadequate supervision.
Compounded by external shocks, reflected in reduced CBRs and less efficient financial
services delivery, this has resulted in capital shortages, compressed liquidity, low
profitability, and deteriorated asset quality. Realizing the important challenges ahead, the
authorities are determined to safeguard financial stability by resolving NPLs, bolstering
capital and provisions, enhancing supervision, and strengthening the AML/CFT
framework. The audit of government arrears is underway and marketable government
securities are being issued to settle payment arrears; dividend payments have been
restricted to protect bank capital, and higher provisions have been mandated; unlicensed
financial institutions (UFIs) are brought under CBI supervision and problem UFIs have
been closed or merged with banks, and IFRS reporting standards have been implemented.
Moreover, the CFT law has been adopted, dedicated AML/CFT units have been created
in all banks, and the ongoing implementation of an action plan agreed with FATF has led
to the suspension of countermeasures for a period of twelve months.
The draft banking and resolution bills, which are being merged, aim at restructuring and
recapitalizing banks, enhancing the CBI’s supervisory powers, and enabling the
resolution of nonviable banks. While the bills to overhaul the banking system are being
finalized, the ongoing aggressive competition among banks for deposits has resulted in
sustained elevated real interest rates and has prompted CBI to formulate and announce,
under its existing legal mandate, a 10-point action plan to address the issue. The plan
includes active management of the interbank market, increased use of open market
operations for liquidity provision, classifying banks based on their supervisory data,
adjusting the statutory reserve requirements, improving risk management practices in
banks, regulating the UFIs, increasing banks’ capital, reducing NPLs, merging or
resolving insolvent banks and credit institutions, and improving bank oversight.
My authorities agree on the need to act decisively and expeditiously to strengthen
regulation and supervision within the existing powers. Accordingly, and in line with staff
recommendation, they intend to launch an asset quality review; revise regulations on
asset classification and provisioning, liquidity provision, reporting, and monitoring; and
enforce compliance with prudential regulations, while ensuring that CBI’s overdraft
facility is only used to build up banks’ liquidity buffers. In the same vein, the authorities
would initiate implementation of the roadmap to Basel II/III.
Structural Reforms
The structural reforms agenda—envisioned under the 6FYDP—targets higher sustainable
growth and stronger pace of job creation. This hinges upon greater economic
diversification and private sector development by boosting infrastructure investment,

6
increasing commercial orientation of state-owned firms, streamlining regulations to
improve the business climate, and enhancing the functioning of the labor market. The
6FYDP, consistent with the 20-year Vision Document, also highlights the need to address
challenges ahead in water resource management, environment protection, and pension
reform. Gradual reconnection to the global economic and financial system should
facilitate FDI inflows to high-productivity sectors and companies and ease domestic
financing constraints. The authorities attach high priority to creating employment
opportunities for a growing number of university graduates who enter the job market over
the next five years, and have taken steps to better align the education and training system
with skill needs of employers, including introduction of entrepreneurship courses in the
education curriculum. They have also taken note of staff estimation of much higher
growth dividend of greater female labor force participation in Iran, which could be
facilitated by targeted active labor market policies and expanded affordable in-work
childcare.
Conclusion
The performance of the Iranian economy has strengthened, underpinned by sound
economic policies and reforms, and supported by successful implementation of the
JCPOA and improved terms of trade. My Iranian authorities are determined to pursue
their reform strategy under the 6FYDP and create a more resilient economy in a more
open environment of increased trade and investment relationship with their partners,
which will be beneficial for all. They highly value the Fund’s contribution to their efforts
through policy advice and technical assistance and are grateful to management and the
Executive Directors for their support.
