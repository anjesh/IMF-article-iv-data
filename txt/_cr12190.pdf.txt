UNITED KINGDOM
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 2, 2012

KEY POINTS
Recovery has stalled. Post-crisis repair and rebalancing of the UK economy is likely to
be more prolonged than initially envisaged. Confidence is weak and uncertainty is high.
Looking ahead, the economy is expected to grow modestly, but with current policy
settings the pace will be insufficient to absorb significant slack in the economy, raising
the risk of a permanent loss of productive capacity.
Demand support is needed. More expansionary demand policies would close the
output gap faster and reduce the risk of hysteresis. In particular:


Additional monetary stimulus via quantitative easing and possibly cutting the
policy rate is required.



Credit easing measures announced in June to lower borrowing costs through
provision of bank funding, as recommended in staff’s May 2012 concluding
statement, are welcome and may need to be expanded.



Budget neutral reallocations should be undertaken to make room to increase
government spending on items with higher multipliers (e.g., public investment).



The planned pace of structural fiscal tightening will need to slow if the recovery
fails to take off even after additional monetary stimulus and strong credit easing
measures. The UK has the fiscal space to make such adjustments.

Further steps are needed to fortify financial sector stability. Such stability is critical
to anchor a strong and durable recovery in the UK and is also of global systemic
importance as highlighted in spillover analysis. To this end, policies should aim to:


Strengthen bank balance sheets by building capital rather than reducing assets.



Address “too big to fail” issues, including by legislating reforms proposed by the
Vickers Commission, resisting pressure to reduce their effectiveness.



Intensify supervision and broaden its authority over financial holding companies.



Broaden the macroprudential toolkit to help restrain future property bubbles.

THE FOCUS OF THE CONSULTATION
1.
The global economy is struggling to regain its footing amid renewed financial strains.
Even relative to this global softness, the UK’s economic recovery has been sluggish. Economic
activity is projected to gain some momentum, but the pace of expansion in the UK is expected to
be weak relative to the scale of underutilized resources. As a result, the output gap is projected
to remain sizeable for an extended period, raising the risk that sustained cyclical weakness will
reduce the economy’s productive capacity.
2.
Against this background, the consultation focused on policies to support a strong and
durable recovery and reduce adverse spillovers to the rest of the world. The report thus
addresses the following questions:


What explains the sluggish recovery?



How should current macroeconomic policies be adapted to provide additional demand
support?



How can financial sector policies reduce vulnerabilities, support a balanced recovery, and
limit negative spillovers to the rest of the world?



How should policies respond in case of negative shocks?

RECOVERY HAS STALLED
A. Large Imbalances Have Produced Headwinds for Growth
3.
Leading up to the financial crisis, economic growth in the UK was brisk, led by
consumption and fueled by declining national saving and rising leverage.1 With the household
share of national income falling sharply, households reduced their saving and borrowed more to
sustain consumption growth and a housing bubble. Public finances entered the crisis with little
policy space and deteriorated sharply when the crisis hit. Much of this deterioration in the fiscal
position was structural, reflecting permanent revenue losses and a sharp drop in potential GDP
growth during the crisis.
4.
Sustainable recovery requires addressing the factors underpinning pre-crisis imbalances,
notably leverage and debt, and a rebalancing of demand. In particular, there needs to be a handoff from public to private sector-led demand, notably greater investment and net exports.
However, this rebalancing will not be frictionless and so must be paced to minimize disruptions
to growth. To support such growth and prevent another buildup of imbalances and stability risks,
financial sector repair and reform is also needed. As discussed next, progress on these fronts has
been mixed.

B. Growth Has Stagnated and the Output Gap Remains Large
5.
The big picture on growth is one of stagnation since late-2010 (Figures 1 and 2). After
turning negative in the last quarter of 2010, growth recovered modestly to 0.7 percent in 2011
before declining again by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2012, in line with renewed economic
weakness in advanced Europe. This broad stagnation has left output per capita a staggering 14
percent below its pre-crisis trend and 6 percent below its pre-crisis level.2
6.
Weak growth has kept unemployment high at 8.2 percent (Figure 3), with youth
unemployment (21.9 percent) particularly worrisome. Relative to growth, however, labor markets
have been surprisingly resilient, with fewer employment losses than in the aftermath of previous
major UK recessions. This stark divergence between growth and employment has left labor
productivity well below its pre-crisis trend.

7.
The reasons for this poor labor productivity performance are much debated.3 The debate
is fundamentally about the size of the output gap, with at least three points of view:


“Supply pessimists” contend that the drop in productivity is mainly permanent, implying a
small output gap. They argue that (i) the pre-crisis productivity level and trend reflect an
unsustainable credit boom and (ii) historical evidence of past financial crises points to large
and persistent output losses, in part due to tight post-crisis credit conditions that limit
investment and the reallocation of capital to more productive activities. As further evidence
of limited supply capacity, pessimists cite elevated inflation (exceeding 5 percent in late
2011), the relatively restrained increase in unemployment, and the limited spare capacity
reported by businesses (Figure 4).

2

Data is current at least through June 25, 2012; if important, subsequent data updates may be discussed in an
accompanying staff supplement.

See Martin and Rowthorn (2012) for a discussion of this debate from the “optimist” view. For further views, see



“Supply optimists” contend that such a large “technology reversal” from pre-crisis levels is
implausible and that the pessimists’ points do not hold up to scrutiny: the financial crisis
story cannot explain the much stronger productivity growth in other countries experiencing
financial crises, such as the US and Spain; high inflation over the past two years can be
completely explained by transitory shocks, such as indirect tax hikes and commodity price
shocks (paragraph 22); and business surveys of capacity are notoriously unreliable. Stories
of structural shifts from high to low productivity sectors can explain at most a small part of
the shortfall when quantified, as the productivity drop is broad-based across sectors.
Optimists argue that restrained unemployment and low productivity can instead be
explained by labor hoarding, as weak real wage growth points to significant slack in labor
markets. This implies that the output gap is large and that, with more demand, labor
hoarding would unwind and productivity would rebound toward its previous trend.



“Statistics skeptics” note that both labor market resilience and PMI readings during the last
18 months suggest possible underestimation of growth in official statistics, which are
subject to large ex post revisions. Such revisions would shrink differences with the pre-crisis
GDP trend. However, such revisions are very unlikely to be big enough to explain a majority
of this gap.

8.
All analysts nevertheless agree that the output gap is negative and the debate is about
the magnitude. Given the uncertainty regarding the accuracy of specific methodologies, staff
bases its output gap estimates on a broad range of indicators—including two filter models, a
production function model, and a model based on Okun’s Law—and finds a large output gap of
about -4 percent in 2012, which persists at this level into 2013. The independent Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR) relies mostly on the limited spare capacity reported by businesses to
arrive at the official output gap estimate of -2.7 percent of GDP in 2012.

C. Internal Rebalancing Has Not Fully Materialized
9.
The tepid recovery reflects weak and inadequate rebalancing of domestic demand.
Specifically, it has been one-sided. On the side of the public sector, large and frontloaded fiscal
adjustment has, as expected, been an important headwind. Consolidation amounting to a
cumulative 4¾ percent of potential GDP in FY10/11 and FY11/12 is estimated to have subtracted
roughly 2½ percentage points from growth during these two years. But against this, underlying
private domestic demand (i.e., demand before the effects of consolidation) has been
insufficiently strong to keep total domestic demand growth from turning negative on average
since 2010 (Figures 1 and 2).
Private consumption has declined sharply
10.
Real private consumption declined at a 1 percent annual rate over the last 18 months.
This can be attributed largely to ongoing household balance sheet repair. The shock to
households’ balance sheets from the fall in house prices during the crisis, as well as more
subdued expectations for house price appreciation going forward, has contributed to a sharp
increase in the household saving rate to about 7½ percent (Figure 5), as households seek to

reduce their high level of indebtedness. Debt-to-income ratios have fallen from their pre-crisis
peaks, although they remain high both from a historical and cross-country perspective (Figure 5).
11.
In addition, private consumption has been held back by weak household incomes and
low consumer confidence. Real household income declined by 1.2 percent in 2011, as higher
global commodity prices and a 2½ percentage point VAT increase drove up inflation and
reduced households’ spending power. Household finances were further squeezed as growth in
nominal wages remained low amid high unemployment. At the same time, consumer confidence
fell to levels not seen since the Lehman crisis due to high commodity prices, concerns about job
prospects, and heightened turmoil in the euro zone.
Private investment has fared better, but has not been sufficiently robust to power recovery
12.
Real private fixed investment grew at an average annual rate of 3 percent over the last 18
months. Although this better performance relative to consumption is consistent with rebalancing
objectives, private investment has been insufficiently strong to recover from its 24 percent
collapse during 2008-09 or to offset contraction of other elements of domestic demand during
the recovery. In explaining this reluctance to unleash investment, respondents to industrial
surveys point to uncertainty about future demand as the overarching factor. Indeed, the
escalation of euro area turmoil in the latter half of 2011 led to an accompanying reduction in
investment intentions by firms (Figure 1).
Financial sector conditions have affected private demand
13.
Notwithstanding an accommodative monetary policy stance, credit conditions remain
tight due to an incomplete process of financial repair (Box 1) and high risk premia in the wake of
the crisis, which have been exacerbated by escalating stress in the euro area. Tight credit
conditions are in turn constraining private

last two years in line with escalating euro
area tensions, such that 5-year CDS spreads for some major UK banks are now near record
highs and exceed their Lehman-crisis peaks (Figure 6). These higher funding costs have in
turn squeezed net interest margins on loans and reduced banks’ incentive to lend.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



Partly reflecting these factors, broad
money (M4) and real credit growth to
the nonfinancial private sector have
been negative for the last two years.
SMEs, which account for more than 50
percent of private-sector employment,
have been particularly constrained. Bank
of England (BoE) credit surveys confirm
that credit availability and lending
conditions remain much tighter than
pre-crisis levels (Figure 7).

14.
This said, demand factors may have
also contributed to weak credit growth. Banks
report a considerable decline in the demand
for loans (Figure 7). Household loan demand
started to recover in early 2009, but has fallen
again since 2010. The contraction in corporate
loan demand possibly reflects a substitution
away from bank borrowing and toward a
greater reliance on debt markets. Indeed,
capital markets have provided an alternative
source of funding for larger companies, with
bond issuance more than offsetting the decline
in lending over the last two years.

Reduction of intra-financial assets. Most of the contraction in UK banks’ balance sheets since
2008 has concentrated on derivatives positions and intra-financial system lending, thereby
reducing interconnectedness and the fragility of the financial system. The scope for further
reduction of intra-financial activity may be limited, as this activity also provides funding and
supports the real economy.

Funding conditions improved following special policy
measures. UK banks’ CDS spreads came down from their peak
levels in late 2011 as the ECB provided LTROs and the Fed
expanded its US$ swap facilities with the ECB, BoE, and other
national central banks. Staff analysis suggests that these
policies had positive spillovers to UK banks, some of which
participated directly in the LTROs.
After a brief respite, financial market stress has reintensified. Renewed euro area turmoil in May-June
prompted the average CDS spread for UK banks to spike back
near record levels, tracking core euro area banks. Following
BoE announcements in mid-June of steps to ease bank
funding strains (paragraph 34-35), UK bank CDS spreads
eased somewhat, including relative to core euro area banks,
but remain high (Figure 6).
Progress in strengthening banks’ balance sheets and
funding profiles slowed over the last year.

Stress in UK banks’ funding and equity markets intensified
in the second half of 2011 as euro area stress intensified.
UK bank equity prices fell, and CDS spreads for some major
UK banks rose sharply above their previous peaks reached
during the Lehman crisis. Nonetheless, UK banks’ CDS spreads
remained below those of many core euro area banks. In turn,
interbank funding and US$ basis swap spreads widened,
though significantly less than in the euro area (Figure 6). This
reflected to some extent the limited reduction in US money
market fund (MMF) exposures to UK banks relative to those in
France and other euro area economies.

Last year’s European Banking Authority (EBA) stress tests
and capital adequacy exercise did not identify any capital shortfall for UK-owned banks. The exercise
confirmed that UK banks’ direct exposures to vulnerable sovereigns are limited, but exposures to the private
sector in these countries and indirect exposures through other euro area banking systems are more
substantial.



Liquidity and funding profiles are gradually improving. Loan-to-deposit ratios have continued to trend
down as banks were successful in expanding their deposit bases (Figure 8). Reliance on market wholesale
funding increased slightly as banks refinanced away from central bank and government facilities (SLS/CGS).
This was partly offset by the disposal of non-core assets, which reduced the need for wholesale funding.
Funding needs this year appear manageable, with banks ahead of schedule in their funding plans.



The restructuring of the government-supported banks is ahead of schedule. The reduction of non-core
assets has enabled these banks to improve its funding mix as well as capital positions.



Asset quality is broadly stable. The system-wide NPL ratio was essentially unchanged in 2011 at a
manageable 4 percent. However, impairments remain substantial for some banks and segments, especially
non-UK exposures. Rapid reductions in non-core assets, which represent the majority of credit losses so far,
imply that credit losses should slow down.

But forbearance adds to uncertainty. An FSA review in June 2011 concluded that about a third of
commercial real estate loans and 5-8 percent of residential mortgages are subject to some form of
forbearance. These forborne loans are more highly provisioned for and hence the FSA concluded that such
forbearance was unlikely to be of systemic importance. Nonetheless, the prevalence of forbearance increases
the uncertainty regarding the exact state of banks’ balance sheets. The FSA is now extending the review to
analyze (i) differences in forbearance across banks and (ii) some loan types not covered by the initial review.



Profitability has weakened. System-wide profitability declined slightly in 2011, and the two governmentsupported banks reported losses. Profitability has been affected by still-high impairments (mainly on non-UK
exposures), non-core disposal losses, one-off factors (e.g., charges for mis-sold payment protection
insurance), and higher wholesale funding costs as strains in Europe intensified.

D. Progress Has Been Made in Rebalancing Toward External Demand
16.
Net exports have contributed much more to growth during this cycle than during the
previous two recoveries and account for essentially all of the growth since 2010 (Figures 1, 2, 9).
Fiscal consolidation and private-sector deleveraging have been factors behind this external
adjustment, as they have suppressed growth of domestic demand below that of foreign demand.
Another significant factor has been the depreciation of the sterling exchange rate, which declined
by about 25 percent in real effective terms (CPI-based) at the onset of the crisis and has since
appreciated only modestly. However, the depreciation of the unit labor cost (ULC)-based real
effective exchange rate has been more muted due to weak productivity growth.

The external position is modestly weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable
policy settings
17.
Staff estimates the cyclically-adjusted current account balance to be about 1-2 percent of
GDP below its equilibrium value and sterling to be overvalued by 5-10 percent.4 This reflects
several considerations:


Moving to a more sustainable fiscal position is expected to increase the cyclically-adjusted
current account balance by 1-2 percent of GDP, from -2 percent of GDP in 2011 to around
-½ percent of GDP in the steady state. Similarly, a cyclically-adjusted current account of
roughly -½ percent of GDP is needed to stabilize the UK’s net international investment
position (IIP), which was -13 percent of GDP at end-2011.

4

The cyclically-adjusted current account is defined as the current account balance adjusted for temporary effects
of terms of trade and the difference between the output gap and that of trading partners.

account could adjust to more sustainable
levels without as much real depreciation. However, such a productivity burst is uncertain.



Balancing this is an upside risk that the degree of overvaluation is larger: the UK’s small net
IIP position masks large gross liabilities (over 600 percent of GDP), reflecting its status as a
major financial center. Several other major financial centers (e.g., Singapore and
Switzerland) have large positive IIPs, which may in part reflect precautionary saving against
these large gross liabilities and capital flows. If the UK’s equilibrium IIP were also to be
higher than its current level, this would suggest more overvaluation. One factor that
perhaps mitigates the need for such precautionary balances is the current structure of the
UK’s IIP: its external assets have a larger foreign-currency component relative to its external
liabilities, such that sterling depreciation acts as a powerful “automatic stabilizer” of the IIP.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Recovery is expected to gain modest traction in the second half of this year
18.
Quarterly growth will be choppy in 2012, as
extra holidays depress growth in Q2 and the
Olympics boost it in Q3. However, staff and
consensus forecasts expect underlying growth to
accelerate to roughly a 1½ percent annual rate over
the next 12 months under a scenario in which
actions are taken to ease euro area tensions and
substantially avoid US fiscal cliff effects. With
government expenditure contracting, such an
acceleration is expected to be driven by private
demand:

Private consumption. Household real disposable income growth should improve as the
effects of past consumption tax hikes and oil price shocks fade. However, the soft housing
market and the still high level of household debt are likely to keep the acceleration in
consumption restrained. Despite a fall in house prices at the onset of the crisis and a broadly
flat market over the last two years, the house price-to-income ratio remains roughly 30
percent above its historical average (Figure 10). Although the above-average ratio can be
partially explained by the trend decline in real interest rates over the past two decades and
by supply constraints due to tight planning restrictions, historical experience suggests that
such elevated ratios do not persist. As such, staff projects house prices to decline relative to
income by roughly 10-15 percent over the medium term, with consequent adverse effects on
consumption via wealth effects (see 2011 UK Selected Issues Paper).



Net exports. As the euro area accounts for roughly half of the UK’s overall trade, export
growth in the first half of 2012 is expected to be weak given the weak outlook for the region.
But exports should strengthen toward the end of the year in line with a modest pick-up in
growth in both the euro area and the US. Over the medium term, net exports are expected to
continue to register a positive contribution to growth. Central to this outlook is the
assumption of low real effective exchange rates, as the relative demand for nontradables
remains low in light of the ongoing fiscal consolidation and private-sector deleveraging.

But the large output gap will narrow only gradually, raising the risk of hysteresis
19.
In staff’s central scenario—which is
based on an unchanged monetary stance and
current fiscal plans (paragraphs 26 and 40)—
growth is projected to accelerate to only
around 2½ percent in the medium term, given
continued correction of fiscal imbalances and
other headwinds (Tables 2 and 3). As a result,
the output gap is projected to remain large
for an extended period and not close until
2018. This would further establish this
recovery episode as the weakest on record.

20.
The large and persistent output gap
raises the risk of hysteresis effects, where factors arising from a cyclical downturn depress
potential GDP permanently. These factors could include skill erosion from persistently high longterm unemployment, scrapping of idle capital, and inadequate investment eroding the capital
stock and hindering the development of new technologies. Indeed, staff’s central scenario
assumes that hysteresis effects will lower potential GDP growth by about a third of a percentage
point annually on average over the medium term, with other lingering effects of the crisis (e.g.,
restrained global demand for financial services) taking off another fifth of a percentage point.6
The magnitude of hysteresis effects are uncertain, but cross-country experience with persistent
large output gaps suggests that hysteresis effects in this range are plausible (Annex 1).

6

Absent these effects, potential growth would be about 2¼ percent—roughly the historical average, adjusted for
labor force changes. Hysteresis effects are projected to gradually decline in line with the output gap.

The authorities’ latest official
projections assume somewhat higher nearterm growth than staff’s projections, but this
may partly reflect that these official
projections are more dated and do not
incorporate the latest data, which have been
downbeat. The OBR’s medium-term growth
projections are also higher than staff’s, as the
OBR assumes a more rapid return to historical
potential growth rates and less lingering
effects from hysteresis and the crisis (Table 3).
Both the authorities and staff project a similar

Inflation is currently elevated, but is expected to fall below the 2 percent target in the
medium term under current policies
22.
A series of indirect tax hikes and commodity price shocks have kept inflation above
target since January 2010 (Figure 11). With these effects starting to ease, inflation is now falling,
reaching 2.8 percent in May 2012 after peaking at 5.2 percent in late 2011. Further disinflation is
expected going forward, as the large output gap exerts disinflationary pressure and as the effects
of past shocks continue to fall out of the headline rate. Staff expects inflation to eventually fall to
around 1.7 percent—modestly below the target—by end-2013. Core inflation, which is currently
running close to 2 percent, testifies to a lack of strong underlying inflationary pressure.
Additional evidence includes anemic nominal wage growth of 2 percent and broadly stable
inflation expectations.

Larger-than-expected headwinds. Another risk to the central scenario is that the adverse
impact of public and private sector deleveraging may be larger than expected and the
anticipated rebalancing of demand may not materialize, for instance, because house prices
may need to fall more than expected to return to equilibrium. This would produce a longerthan-expected period of negative output gaps. A slowdown of global growth and softer
demand from the UK’s main trading partners (the euro zone and the US) would also impede
the UK’s recovery and rebalancing. Alternatively, the output gap may be smaller than

discussed in the section on Financial Sector Policies), further worsening the global outlook.

Greece



Against this backdrop, a more supportive macroeconomic policy stance is needed
24.
The UK economy has ample spare capacity and demand is weak. Thus, given the outlook
for growth and inflation, additional macroeconomic easing is needed to close the output gap
faster, reduce risks of hysteresis, and insure against the predominance of downside risks. Policy
options in this regard come with risks, including uncertainty concerning their effectiveness.
However, these risks must be weighed against the risk of weak demand that leads to persistently
slow growth and high unemployment, which in turn could become entrenched in the decisions
of consumers and investors.
25.
A more supportive macroeconomic policy stance is hence essential. The policy options to
achieve such a stance are discussed in the following sections.

MONETARY AND CREDIT EASING POLICIES
A. Monetary Policy
Bold action has been taken to ease monetary policy, but credit conditions remain tight
26.
Following the onset of the crisis, the BoE cut its key policy rate (the Bank Rate paid on
central bank reserves) to a historic low of 0.5 percent. Additional stimulus was provided by largescale asset purchases, with initial purchases amounting to £200 billion conducted between March
2009 and January 2010 (QE1). Faced with a weakening economic outlook and the prospect of
inflation undershooting the target in the medium term, the BoE resumed QE last October. The
purchase announcements of October 2011 and February 2012 (QE2) bring the total stock of
purchased assets—which consist almost entirely of government bonds—to £325 billion (21 percent
of GDP). Despite this monetary easing, monetary and credit conditions remain tight due to elevated
risk aversion and rising bank funding costs (paragraph 13).
Further monetary stimulus is required
27.
Anemic wage growth and well-contained inflation expectations provide scope for further
monetary stimulus to close the output gap faster and avoid inflation undershooting in the medium
term. That said, uncertainty about inflation dynamics and the strength of disinflationary pressure
coming from the output gap imply risks that inflation could take longer-than-expected to return to
target, with convergence being further delayed by additional monetary stimulus. Nonetheless, the
cost of such a delay would likely be low relative to the benefits of more rapidly closing the large
output gap and reducing unemployment. Monetary easing would thus be consistent with the
Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) mandate “to set interest rates so that inflation can be brought
back to target within a reasonable time period without creating undue instability in the economy.”
Monetary stimulus will also assist balance sheet repair. Indeed, a low interest rate-growth rate
differential is the only way to simultaneously achieve both rapid household and corporate
deleveraging and renewed borrowing to fund consumption and investment.
One option for easing is more “plain-vanilla” QE, which remains at least somewhat
stimulative
28.
Estimates by staff, the Bank for
International Settlements, and the BoE suggest
that QE1 was effective in reducing yields by 50-100
basis points. The BoE further estimates that QE1
boosted GDP by 1½-2 percent, an impact that is
equivalent to a policy rate cut of 150-300 basis
points. For QE2, relatively muted market reactions
to announcements have raised concerns that QE
may be becoming less effective. However,

nonbank sector (the main holder of government

percent) for a long time. These expectations make the
chosen level of this lower bound more important. Specifically, with yields now roughly flat at the
policy rate out to 4-year maturities, a rate cut may reduce yields nearly one-for-one much further
out into the curve than usual. Effects on yields of 5 years or below are especially important, as about
90 percent of lending to the private sector is linked to this range (60 percent is at variable rates). In
contrast, the flattening yield curve has reduced the scope for QE to compress term premia further.
30.

Such increased benefits of a rate cut should be weighed carefully against possible costs:



In explaining its past decisions not to cut the policy rate further, the MPC has cited concerns
that a rate cut may reduce activity in money markets. However, policy rates of ¼ percent or
less prevail in the US and Japan and have not produced adverse side effects of a sufficient
magnitude to prod a policy reversal.

7

Even if the initial sellers of bonds shift into assets other than deposits, the cash will continue being passed along
until it is eventually deposited in the banks, assuming no change in the transactional demand for cash.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM



The MPC has also expressed concern that some financial institutions may have difficulties
cutting deposit rates by enough to offset lower interest on mortgages tied to the policy rate.
Lower financial sector profits could in turn adversely affect financial stability. However,
average sight and time deposit rates of 0.21 percent and 1.34 percent, respectively, would
seem to provide scope to lower deposit rates in response to a policy rate cut. Banks could
also increase charges for services. Complementary credit easing measures (see below) would
further support interest margins.

B. Credit Easing and Bank Funding Policies
Carefully designed credit easing measures could further boost demand
31.
UK government borrowing costs have fallen to record-low levels while credit conditions for
many parts of the private sector remain tight. In this context, several considerations suggest a strong
case for supplementing traditional monetary easing—which works mainly on the risk-free rate—with
credit easing measures that lower risk premia and more directly reduce private-sector borrowing
costs (Box 3).
The government took some steps in this direction earlier this year
32.
In Spring 2012, the government started a National Loan Guarantee Scheme that provides
£20 billion in government guarantees on wholesale bank funding over two years. The cost of the
guarantee is set to save each participating bank 1 percentage point on its funding costs, which
banks must pass along by reducing interest rates on an identical amount of SME loans by 1
percentage point. However, gross SME lending by participating banks significantly exceeds the size
of the scheme. The scheme may thus result mainly in lower interest rates for SME loans that would
have occurred anyway, with little rate reduction for the marginal borrower. Consequently, the impact
on SME borrowing and investment may be limited.
During the May mission, staff suggested new credit easing measures
33.

The concluding statement recommended two types of credit easing:



Longer-term bank funding facilities. BoE liquidity facilities currently provide term funding of a
year or less. Longer-term funding (2-3 years) against a wide range of collateral, including SME
loans, (with appropriate haircuts) would enhance incentives to lend by trimming funding costs
and boosting demand for assets eligible as collateral. To prevent banks from becoming addicted
to this support, such facilities would need to be complemented by regulatory policies to ensure
that banks continue bolstering buffers and that intervened banks complete their restructuring
strategies.



Purchases of private-sector assets aimed at easing credit conditions and boosting demand.
For example, purchases of covered bonds, as undertaken by the ECB, could help ease tight credit
conditions in the mortgage market and spur new covered bond issuance. This in turn would
support residential investment and house prices, which have significant effects on consumption
via wealth effects. Although the relatively moderate amount of private-sector bonds in the UK

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

places some limits on the scope for such measures, this market size also implies that relatively
moderate purchases could have large effects on bond yields and demand for underlying
collateral. In contrast to direct provision of bank funding, purchases of bonds on secondary
markets also do not require active participation by banks and hence will not be hindered by
stigma concerns. Because the objective of such operations would be to ease broad credit
conditions and not to favor specific borrowers, purchases within an asset class would need to be
based on nondiscretionary rules. These could include allocation according to market share or as
a function of behaviors that have positive externalities in the current environment, such as how
much a bank increases equity or net lending to the nonfinancial private sector. The government
may need to authorize such purchases and indemnify the BoE from any losses, as the BoE views
the assumption of credit risk as a government decision.8
The authorities announced steps along these lines in June
34.
The first new measure is a “funding for lending” program. The details are yet to be
announced, but the intent of the program—designed by the BoE in consultation with the Treasury—
will be to provide funding to banks for an extended period of several years (against collateral, with
appropriate haircuts) at below the current elevated market rates and linked to each bank’s
performance in sustaining or expanding its lending to the UK nonfinancial sector. The authorities
plan to announce the details of the program in the coming weeks.
35.
In addition, the BoE activated its Extended Collateral Term Repo Facility (ECTR), announced
in December 2011. The BoE will offer, via competitive auction, at least £5 billion of 6-month sterling
liquidity, at least once a month until further notice. Borrowing can be backed by a wide range of
collateral (the same set that is eligible for use in the discount window), including portfolios of
household and SME loans. The ECTR uses a uniform price format, so that all successful bidders pay
the lowest accepted clearing rate, subject to a minimum of 25 basis points over the policy rate. This
differentiates the ECTR from the discount window, which charges higher fixed spreads over the
policy rate. The first ECTR auction, conducted on June 20, provided banks with £5bn in sterling
liquidity, at a fee of the policy rate plus 25 basis points.
36.
These new measures are welcome steps that could help ease credit conditions and boost
demand. However, further information on the specifics of the funding for lending program is
needed to make a more thorough evaluation. Similarly, it is difficult at this stage to quantify the
likely impact of these new measures, including because it is unclear to what degree banks will access
them. Consequently, effects of these measures are not included in staff’s central scenario at this
point. Depending on the details and performance of these programs, other measures, such as
purchases of private-sector assets on secondary markets, may be needed. More generally, measures
to ease credit conditions may require some “learning-by-doing” in their implementation, with
adjustments based on results, given the lack of extensive experience with such measures.

8

The government has already authorized the BoE to purchase up to £10 billion of private-sector assets, of which it
has only used £350 million.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

Box 3. Credit Easing: Key Considerations
Credit easing essentially entails central bank or government purchases of private-sector assets that have
some degree of credit or equity risk. The idea is to lower risk premia—defined as spreads of private-sector
borrowing rates over the government borrowing rate—and thereby stimulate demand and ease credit conditions.
For example, the world’s major central banks have in the last few years purchased commercial paper, mortgagebacked securities, corporate bonds, and even equities. Such purchases are typically funded by public sector debt
(government securities or central bank reserves). Government guarantees of private-sector funding in exchange
for a fee and lending to banks against private-sector collateral are other forms of credit easing. Some label credit
easing a monetary operation whereas others consider it to be fiscal policy.
Complementing traditional monetary easing with various forms of credit easing could be useful in the UK
for at least two reasons:

 Shrinking scope to cut risk-free rates further. Risk-free rates (i.e., government borrowing rates) have dropped
dramatically during the crisis to very low levels (the 10-year yield is now 1.6 percent). At the same time, risk
premia have risen substantially and now constitute the largest part of most private-sector borrowing rates.
Thus, while there is still scope to reduce risk-free rates a bit further, efforts to reduce risk premia may have
more ability to achieve a major easing of credit conditions.

 Policy diversification. The magnitude of QE’s stimulative effect is somewhat uncertain, given the limited

experience with its application. Diversification of efforts to ease credit conditions could thus be of value.

One concern with credit easing is that it exposes the government to credit risk, which could prove costly.
Such operations should be profit-making in expectation, as expected returns on risky assets should be higher than
the government’s (very low) borrowing rate. But such operations may entail net expected costs in risk-adjusted
terms if markets are correctly pricing risks and if large purchases by the government causes it to buy at a discount.
However, such operations may not incur net costs to the government, even on a risk-adjusted basis, if
either of the following apply:

 Markets are not pricing risk properly. The current high levels of risk aversion could be excessive (i.e.,

insufficient “animal spirits”), just as there was insufficient risk aversion before the crisis. In this case, leaning
against excessive risk aversion by raising demand for risky assets should not be costly in expectation.

 Multiple equilibria. Markets may be pricing credit risk correctly for a scenario in which demand remains

inadequate for an extended period. But markets may be overpricing credit risk for a scenario in which
demand is bolstered through a battery of measures (QE, rate cut, credit easing, balanced budget
reallocation). Individual market players cannot arbitrage away such multiple equilibria, as no single player is
big enough to push the economy from the bad scenario to the good one. But the government has this
ability. So if it increases its exposure to credit risk while markets are still pricing for a scenario of inadequate
demand—and in so doing pushes the economy to the scenario of higher demand and fewer credit losses—
then such operations may be profitable for the government in expectation, even in risk-adjusted terms.

Undertaking credit risk is not necessarily less risky than standard QE. Standard QE reduces the average
maturity of consolidated public sector debt (BoE + government), as it replaces long-term government debt with
overnight debt (central bank reserves that pay interest). QE thus raises the public sector’s exposure to interest rate
risk. Higher interest rate risk could increase the overall riskiness of the public sector balance sheet by more or less
than the undertaking of credit risk, depending on the covariance of these risks with other risks facing the public
sector. Some scenarios in which undertaking credit risk will be beneficial (e.g., more rapid-than-expected closing of
the output gap leading to higher near-term growth and interest rates) are those in which interest rate risk will be
costly, and vice-versa. Consequently, one type of risk could potentially hedge the other. In this regard, the BoE is
notable in that its balance sheet is currently exposed to significantly less credit risk than those of the Federal
Reserve or European Central Bank.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Using the government's balance sheet to promote growth should emphasize value for money
37.
The government has also announced that it is considering expanding government
guarantees (for a fee) to fund large, privately operated infrastructure projects. Boosting
infrastructure spending would support growth, given its high multiplier and ability to increase
productive capacity. However, it is important that the choice of projects and the modalities of their
operation (public versus private) and financing (e.g., issuing public debt versus guarantees) be based
on efforts to use public funds as efficiently as possible. Such decisions should not be affected by
artificial attempts to limit government gross debt or near-term expenditure by transforming costs
into contingent liabilities that might be realized only later.

FISCAL POLICY
A. Fiscal Consolidation Has Been Strong and is Now Slowing
The authorities embarked on a frontloaded fiscal consolidation plan in 2010
38.
Loose fiscal policy before the financial crisis, damage to potential GDP as a result of the
crisis, and fiscal stimulus deployed to ameliorate the crisis all took a major toll on the UK’s fiscal
position.9 The overall deficit rose to a massive 11 percent of GDP in FY09/10—a historic record. With
debt rising sharply and much of the deficit estimated to be structural, the newly elected coalition
government in mid-2010 committed to two self-imposed “fiscal mandates” to:
i) balance the structural current budget by the end of a rolling 5-year window and
ii) put the net debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path in FY15/16.
The government announced a detailed and frontloaded 5-year consolidation plan that aimed to
meet both of these mandates a year early. Since then, deficit reduction has been rapid and strong,
with the deficit falling to 8¼ percent of GDP in FY11/12, which ended on April 5, 2012. Structural
adjustment over the last 2 years has equaled about 4¾ percent of GDP (text table below).
Fiscal adjustment has restrained growth
39.
Quantifying how much fiscal consolidation has restrained growth requires assumptions
about fiscal multipliers. The size of these is quite uncertain. However, some studies find belowaverage multipliers for the UK relative to other major advanced economies, which likely reflects the
UK’s relative openness, floating exchange rate, monetary independence, and labor market flexibility.

9

Evidence suggests that asset price bubbles may affect structural fiscal balances in the UK, although such
adjustments to the structural balance would be less than ½ percent of GDP at the moment (Annex 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

Taking this into account, staff assumes an average multiplier during the consolidation of about 0.5
after incorporating the boost to demand from automatic stabilizers and the monetary policy
reaction. This estimate is roughly in line with the OBR’s estimates and implies that consolidation has
so far reduced GDP by a cumulative 2½ percent.

partly reflects the authorities’ decision in November 2011 not to undertake additional discretionary
tightening over the next 3 years in response to the OBR’s upward revisions to the structural deficit,
owing to substantial downward revisions to potential GDP and near-term potential growth. To keep
fiscal plans consistent with meeting the mandates, the government instead chose to (i) use up all
previous buffers, such that both mandates are now met just in time and with little margin, and (ii)
announce further, unspecified consolidation in 2015-17. This accommodation of higher structural
deficits in the near term was appropriate given the weak outlook. Under staff’s weaker medium-term
growth projections, the net debt target is expected to be met one year late (Table 3). If future OBR
revisions to projected growth produce a similar result, such a delay should be accommodated rather
than prevent the operation of automatic stabilizers.

B. Budget-Neutral Reallocations Can Further Support Growth
Modest changes in the composition of consolidation to make it more “growth friendly” have
been adopted
41.
Changes announced over the last year to help support demand include spending cuts in
items with low multipliers (e.g., public employee wages) to fund increased spending on items with
high multipliers (e.g., infrastructure spending). In an effort to boost supply, the government also cut
the top income tax rate (from 50 to 45 percent) and the corporate tax rate (by 1 percentage point,
to 22 percent by FY14/15) while raising taxes on sales of expensive homes and rationalizing income
tax allowances, among other items. However, the scale of these adjustments has been modest—the
fiscal effect of each individual measure is 0.1 percent of GDP or less. Consequently, the
macroeconomic impact of such measures is likely to be modest.
Further steps are needed
42.
Deeper budget-neutral reallocations from low-multiplier items to high-multiplier items and
further structural reform could further support recovery. Low-multiplier candidates for generating
fiscal space include:


property tax reform aimed at shifting more of the base from transactions to current property
values, which is less distortive and as recommend by the Mirrlees Review, in a net revenuegenerating manner;



further restraining growth of public employee compensation, with a focus on positions
where public-private sector pay premia are the largest; and



better targeting of transfers to those most in need.

Fiscal space generated by such measures could be used to increase infrastructure spending, which
has a higher multiplier and can increase productive capacity. Revenue-neutral tax reform to
introduce an allowance for new corporate equity would also be helpful, as this would reduce the tax
code’s bias in favor of debt over equity finance. This in turn would encourage corporate and
financial sector deleveraging through equity accumulation rather than contractionary asset
reduction.

monetary independence. Though such simple
relationships are only suggestive, they indicate that a moderate increase in the UK’s debt-to-GDP
ratio may have small effects on UK sovereign risk premia (though a slower pace of fiscal tightening
may increase yields through expectations of higher near-term growth and tighter monetary policy).
This conclusion is further supported by the absence of a market response to the easing of the pace
of structural adjustment in the 2011 Autumn Statement. Bond yields in the US and UK during the
Great Recession have also correlated positively with equity price movements, indicating that bond
yields have been driven more by growth expectations than fears of a sovereign crisis.

Gains from delaying consolidation depend on the degree to which multipliers are asymmetric
over the cycle
44.
Alternative fiscal scenarios have been prepared to assess potential gains from delaying fiscal
consolidation to support the economy and reduce hysteresis effects now (Annex 3). Two categories
of simulations are conducted.


The first set assumes that multipliers are symmetric across the business cycle. These simulations
show that the path of fiscal consolidation has essentially no effect on cumulative GDP because
delaying consolidation simply trades off higher growth and less hysteresis today for equivalent
amounts of lower growth and more hysteresis tomorrow. This is true even if multipliers and
hysteresis effects are large, as the powerfulness of these effects during the stimulus phase has
an offsetting reverse effect during the inevitable consolidation phase.10



The second set assumes that multipliers are asymmetric across the business cycle. Substantial
GDP gains can be generated under these assumptions if the asymmetry is relatively large.

10

This result assumes that multipliers and hysteresis effects are not so large as to cause fiscal stimulus to
permanently lower the debt-to-GDP ratio (Annex 3).

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

45.
The degree to which multipliers will be significantly smaller several years from now, such
that substantial gains can be achieved by delaying consolidation, is uncertain. For example, the
Spring 2012 Fiscal Monitor finds a weak relationship between the output gap and multipliers in the
UK. Other studies across a range of countries find stronger evidence for asymmetry. Of note,
Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012) find that multipliers may be better correlated with growth
rates than the level of the output gap. Such findings suggest that scope to exploit asymmetries may
be significantly higher in a downside scenario in which growth does not improve than in an upside
scenario in which robust monetary and credit easing helps close the output gap faster than
envisaged in the central scenario.
Fiscal consolidation plans should thus be reconsidered if growth fails to take off even after
further monetary and credit easing
46.
If growth does not take off and unemployment fails to recede even after substantial further
monetary stimulus and strong credit easing measures have been given time to work, the policy
response should include a further slowing of fiscal consolidation. This is because the benefits of
delayed consolidation may increase during periods of weak growth due to larger multipliers, as
noted above. The absence of growth even after additional monetary and credit easing measures
would also indicate that the ability of monetary policy to mitigate the contractionary effects of fiscal
consolidation is more constrained than currently assumed, implying higher and more asymmetric
multipliers. Weak effects from monetary and credit easing may occur, for example, if heightened
uncertainty, including concern about tail risks, deters the private sector from borrowing, even in
response to significantly cheaper and more easily available credit.
47.
In particular, fiscal adjustment for FY13/14 would need to be scaled back if growth does not
build momentum by early 2013. Current plans envisage structural adjustment accelerating from ½
percent of GDP in FY12/13 to nearly 1½ percent of GDP in FY13/14. Such an acceleration may be
difficult for the economy to handle if it remains very weak. The planned pace of fiscal tightening
may need to ease before FY13/14 if the outlook deteriorates sharply before then.
48.
Fiscal easing measures in such a scenario should focus on higher infrastructure spending
and temporary tax cuts that are targeted (e.g., to lower-income households) so as to boost their
multipliers, as these measures are more credibly temporary than increases in current spending.
Slower fiscal tightening should be accompanied by deeper entitlement reform, including legislating
accelerated increases in the state pension age, to help safeguard confidence in fiscal sustainability.

FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES
A. Strengthening Bank Balance Sheets
Financial sector policies need to balance stability and cyclical considerations
49.
The rebuilding of banks’ capital and liquidity buffers over the last few years has been
valuable to maintain stability in the face of recent market stress and heightened spillover risks from
the euro area. Continued financial sector healing—with a focus on building capital rather than
contracting lending—is also critical to provide credit to the economy and anchor a strong and
durable recovery. As this healing progresses, banks’ capital and liquidity requirements should aim to
ensure resilience against a highly uncertain environment, while at the same time minimizing the
adverse effects on credit expansion and economic growth.
The balance of risks calls for greater capital levels and some moderation of liquidity
requirements
50.
As noted by the Interim Financial Policy Committee (FPC), the overall outlook for financial
stability remains fragile, and the level of capital across the banking sector is not yet at levels that
would ensure resilience in the face of prospective risks. To support the recovery, the focus should be
on building capital rather than reducing assets and credit. Specifically, the Interim FPC and FSA
should continue to encourage banks to raise external capital “as early as feasible,” while linking the
approval of dividend and remuneration to the outcome of credible stress tests. In this context, the
Interim FPC should also clarify its expectations about the transition path to Basel III capital ratios, as
an accelerated pace could exacerbate deleveraging and have adverse cyclical implications.
51.
Since the introduction of the new liquidity regime in 2010, liquidity requirements in the UK
have been more stringent than in other jurisdictions, and perhaps in excess of Basel III requirements
(not fully concluded). This has proved effective in strengthening banks’ liquidity and funding
positions, as discussed in Box 1, but may have constrained credit availability, particularly as market
stress related to the euro area crisis intensified. Going forward, the Interim FPC should evaluate
liquidity requirements with a view to converge to the phase-in schedule agreed internationally, while
taking into account cyclical considerations and the availability of liquidity insurance from the BoE. At
the same time, banks should be encouraged to continue to improve their funding profiles by
expanding their deposit bases and lengthening the term of their wholesale funding. Given UK banks’
vulnerabilities to funding shocks, the BoE should stand ready to provide liquidity through a range of
facilities if strains from the euro area crisis intensify. In this regard, banks’ prepositioning of collateral
facilitates potential access to these liquidity operations.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

B. Strengthening the Framework for Financial Sector Stability
The financial regulatory structure is being revamped
52.
A Financial Services Bill to provide a permanent legal basis for the new framework is
currently before parliament and is expected to come into force in early 2013. It will create the
statutory FPC in charge of macroprudential policy and a new Prudential Regulation Authority
(PRA)—a subsidiary of the BoE—responsible for prudential regulation of banks, insurance
companies, and large investment firms. The result should be greater integration of micro- and
macro-prudential supervision to better safeguard financial stability. A separate agency, the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA), will be responsible for the conduct and regulation of secondary markets,
investment funds, and small investment firms, as well as consumer protection issues across all
institutions. Successful navigation of the transition, combined with the new model of intensified
supervision, will require skillful management and a serious commitment of resources.
53.
Progress has been made in implementing most recommendations of the 2011 IMF Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update (Annex 4). However, many initiatives are closely tied to
the transition to the new structure and will need to be assessed when the work is finalized. In this
connection, the framework for coordination between the new agencies is already set out; the
mandate for the PRA is clarified, but concern remains about the clarity of the prudential mandate of
the FCA. Furthermore, there is concern that both the PRA and the FCA will have insufficient highquality resources to undertake the considerable tasks given to them. As recommended in the FSAP,
greater authority of the PRA over financial holding companies than currently envisaged in the draft
Financial Services Bill will be essential for effective supervision of large financial groups.
A broader macroprudential toolkit is desirable
54.
The Interim FPC has appropriately requested directive powers to adjust the countercyclical
capital buffer, sectoral capital requirements, and the leverage ratio. It also considered that it should
have a time-varying liquidity tool, but that this should wait for international standards on liquidity
before such powers are taken forward. The FPC may, however, need additional powers to address
future asset price bubbles that could threaten financial stability and undermine economic prospects.
In particular, the FPC should be empowered with the ability to limit loan-to-value and loan-toincome ratios, as higher capital requirements alone may be insufficient to restrain property bubbles.
This will be especially relevant if most banks are comfortably above minimum capital requirements
during the boom, such that higher risk weights on property loans may have little effect on banks’
lending behavior. Macroprudential tools will need to be complemented by intensified supervision to
be effective.
International coordination and further progress in addressing too-big-to-fail are crucial for
UK and global financial stability

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

55.
Spillover analysis highlights the potential for large shocks to be transmitted through the UK
financial system (Annex 5). In this connection, international collaboration will be necessary to further
bolster the stability of the financial system, and the UK authorities should continue to exercise
leadership in these matters.


On the supervisory front, the authorities view cross-border supervisory cooperation as a
priority, as exchange of key information on a timely basis and coordination of supervisory
actions are critical to containing risks to UK and global financial stability. This is particularly
important for branches of large global banks operating in the UK and for large UK banks
operating in major financial centers. Continued efforts in this direction from both the
authorities and their global counterparts are encouraged.



On the regulatory front, a broad range of EU-wide financial legislation is currently under
development, which will affect the UK’s regulatory regime. Capital adequacy rules under the
Capital Requirements Directive (CRDIV), for example, are now being finalized. The recent
compromise draft, which provides greater flexibility at the national level by allowing
countries to impose stricter prudential requirements, balances the need of the single
rulebook with financial stability concerns of national authorities. However, the draft falls
short of Basel III minima in some key areas (e.g., definition of core tier one capital). Further,
liquidity and leverage rules are still to be determined.

56.
In light of large spillover effects and to reduce the risk to taxpayers, it is also crucial that toobig-to-fail issues are addressed expeditiously. In this connection, progress made in developing a
more flexible resolution framework and recovery and resolution plans for major institutions is
welcome. The government’s preliminary response to the recommendations of the Independent
Commission on Banking (ICB, or “Vickers Commission”) has been set out in a White Paper. The
White Paper takes on board the thrust of the ICB proposals for additional loss-absorbing capacity
and ringfencing of retail operations, but softens some aspects to balance stability and cyclical
considerations, while maintaining the competitiveness of the UK banking sector. Notably, the White
Paper


permits simple derivative products to be provided directly to third parties from within the
ringfence, while the ICB had proposed that inclusion of such products be more strictly
limited, and



adopts for all banks a leverage ratio of 3 percent in line with Basel III proposals, instead of
4 percent for large ringfenced banks as proposed by the ICB.

On the whole, the government’s plan will help limit the frequency and severity of banking crises and
strengthen the resilience of the system. A push by the UK authorities at the European level to allow
the leverage ratio to increase above the Basel III minimum, alongside weighted capital ratios, would
strengthen the package. Similarly, the Financial Services Bill should grant the FPC the power to
tighten the leverage ratio as needed. Ultimately, neither ringfencing nor other measures to address
too-big-to-fail should create complacency about the accumulation of risks outside of the ringfence.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
57.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s overall assessment of economic developments.
Like staff, the OBR projects the output gap to remain wide for the coming years, though they project
the size and duration of this deviation to be somewhat less than in staff’s central scenario (Table 3;
paragraph 21). More generally, the authorities highlighted the complexity of assessing the true state
of the economy and degree of slack, not least because labor market indicators are somewhat better
than growth outcomes and inflation has declined more slowly than expected. They also noted the
significant uncertainty regarding the degree of hysteresis effects, citing little evidence so far of a rise
in the NAIRU. However, they remained focused on pursuing policies that can support growth while
maintaining fiscal and monetary stability. They agreed that all policy options come with risks,
including uncertainty concerning their effectiveness, and that there could be some merit in policy
diversification.
Monetary and Credit Easing Policies
58.
With headline inflation still above the target and ongoing uncertainty about the
disinflationary power of the output gap, the majority of the MPC did not yet see further easing as
warranted at this time. However, this decision was finely balanced for many MPC members. If the
balance tilts toward easing, there was agreement that quantitative easing can continue to support
demand by lowering long-term interest rates and improving banks’ liquidity position. Although
there was agreement that the flattening yield curve might make a cut in the policy rate more
stimulative than it would be otherwise, several MPC members stressed that this might be
outweighed by possible adverse effects on the availability of bank credit (as a result of a squeeze in
banks’ and building societies’ margins) and on the functioning of money markets.
59.
On credit easing, the authorities are examining further ways to use the credibility of the
government’s balance sheet to ease credit conditions and support the economy, notably through
the use of guarantees. In this regard, they noted staff’s suggestion to complement standard QE with
purchases of private-sector assets (possibly with the BoE acting as the government’s agent) or
provision of longer-term bank funding (against collateral) to more directly reduce private-sector
borrowing costs, but highlighted that all policies must be delivered within European Commission
State Aid constraints. They also noted that scope to purchase private-sector bonds is somewhat
constrained by the moderate size of these markets in the UK (excluding unsecured bank bonds). The
BoE also underscored that it would not embark on large-scale purchases of private-sector assets on
its own accord because it views the assumption of credit risk as a decision to be made by the
government.
60.
After the May Article IV mission and as discussed earlier (paragraph 34), the Governor of the
BoE announced that a program is being developed to tackle high funding costs directly and improve
credit conditions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

Fiscal Policy
61.
The authorities emphasized that significant progress had been made in strengthening public
finances, with the cyclically-adjusted primary deficit cut in half since 2009. They also stressed that
the slower pace of fiscal consolidation in FY12/13 was occurring as a result of the flexibility provided
by the government’s fiscal framework, which allows automatic stabilizers to operate, rather than any
discretionary fiscal action. They highlighted the significant risks that discretionary changes to fiscal
plans to slow the pace of tightening could undermine the implementation and credibility of their
fiscal strategy and be punished by markets. They recognized the time lags and logistical
impediments of the policy options raised by staff. They are also of the view that supporting UK
financial stability—which has large global spillovers—is a significant constraint on the UK’s fiscal
space, particularly considering tensions in the euro zone. If downside risks materialize, further
monetary and credit easing were identified as the first ports of call for discretionary response, with
the fiscal framework allowing for automatic stabilizers to operate freely while ensuring plans were
set to restore public finances to a sustainable path.
62.
The authorities agreed that budget-neutral reallocations can be used to provide demand
stimulus and pointed to policies announced in the 2011 Autumn Statement. They are also exploring
options to use the credibility of the government’s balance sheet to provide targeted support to the
economy, in particular for the provision of credit, housing, and infrastructure.
Financial Sector Policies
63.
In seeking to balance financial stability and cyclical considerations, the authorities, notably
the Interim FPC, have recommended that banks take the opportunity to raise capital levels by
limiting distributions of dividends and bonuses while maintaining credit supply and are relatively
dovish on liquidity requirements, which is consistent with staff’s position. On the issues of the FPC’s
toolkit, the government is considering carefully the recommendations made by the Interim FPC and
will consult on proposals as soon as possible.
64.
The authorities agreed with the Fund recommendation that ensuring the adequacy of highquality supervisory resources will be a key to success in the transition to the new institutional
structure for the conduct of supervision. They also agreed in principle to give consideration to
whether greater authority over financial holding companies than currently envisaged in the draft
Financial Services Bill is necessary, and stressed that this matter needs to be tackled in the context of
the emerging international crisis management framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
65.
Current policies aim to assist economic rebalancing. Substantial progress has been made
toward achieving a more sustainable budgetary position and reducing fiscal risks. Bold monetary
stimulus has helped support the economy. This macroeconomic policy mix assists in rebalancing the
economy toward investment and net exports. In the financial sector, policies have encouraged the
buildup of buffers, the oversight framework is being strengthened, and work is underway to
enhance the capacity to deal with systemically important financial institutions. These policies have
been broadly consistent with the Fund’s past surveillance advice.
66.
But the recovery has stalled, and unemployment is still too high. Activity is expected to gain
modest momentum going forward, but additional macroeconomic easing is needed to close the
output gap faster, reduce the risks of hysteresis, and insure against the predominance of downside
risks.
67.
As a first step, further monetary stimulus is required. Monetary stimulus can be provided via
further QE and cutting the policy rate. Evidence suggests that QE can continue to support demand
by lowering long-term interest rates and improving banks’ liquidity. The MPC should reassess the
efficacy of cutting the policy rate, taking into account the recent sharp flattening of the yield curve,
as well as possible effects on money markets and financial stability.
68.
Recently announced efforts to lower private-sector borrowing costs through broader
provision of bank funding are welcome, as elevated funding costs have limited the quantity and
tenor of lending to the private sector, while government borrowing costs have fallen to record lows.
Depending on the details and performance of these new programs, further credit easing measures
may be needed, including purchases of private-sector assets on secondary markets. In general,
credit easing measures will need to be complemented by regulatory policies to ensure that banks do
not become dependent on such facilities.
69.
Deeper budget-neutral reallocations could also support recovery. Such reallocations within
the current overall fiscal stance could include greater investment spending funded by property tax
reform or spending cuts on items with low multipliers. Automatic stabilizers should continue to
operate freely. It will also be important to shield the poorest from the impact of consolidation.
70.
Scaling back fiscal tightening plans should be the main policy lever if growth does not build
momentum by early-2013 even after further monetary stimulus and strong credit easing measures.
To preserve credibility, any adjustment to the path of consolidation should be in the context of a
multi-year plan and ideally accompanied by deeper entitlement reform, such as legislating
accelerated increases in the pension age. Temporary easing measures in such a scenario should
focus on infrastructure spending and targeted tax cuts, as they may be more credibly temporary.
71.
It is important to continue with efforts aimed at bolstering financial stability. Such stability
will anchor a strong and durable recovery and reduce the risk to taxpayers, as well as limit spillovers

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

from shocks that are transmitted through the UK financial system. Policies should promote
continued strengthening of the financial sector by balancing stability and growth considerations. In
this context, policies should focus on strengthening bank balance sheets by building capital rather
than reducing assets. Supervisors should thus continue to encourage banks to focus on improving
capital buffers by raising external capital and limiting the payout of bonuses and dividends.
Evaluation of liquidity requirements should take into account cyclical considerations and the
availability of liquidity insurance from the BoE.
72.
It is crucial that “too big to fail” issues are addressed. The progress made in developing a
more flexible resolution framework and “living wills” for major institutions is welcome. Reforms
proposed by the ICB should be legislated, resisting pressure to reduce their effectiveness.
73.
A broader macroprudential toolkit for the FPC is desirable. In particular, the power to limit
loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios is essential, as higher capital requirements alone are likely
to be insufficient to restrain property bubbles.
74.
Intensifying supervision and broadening authority over financial holding companies is a
priority. Adequacy of high-quality supervisory resources will be a key to the success of the transition
to the new institutional structure for the conduct of supervision, together with the new supervisory
models designed to intensify supervision. In addition, greater authority over financial holding
companies than currently envisaged in the draft Financial Services Bill will be essential for the future
Prudential Regulatory Authority. The emerging international crisis management framework provides
an opportunity to revisit this issue. International collaboration will be necessary to further bolster the
stability of the financial system, and the UK authorities should continue to exercise leadership in
these matters.
75.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

Annex 1. Estimating Hysteresis Effects1
The current deep and prolonged period of negative output gaps in the UK raises concern of permanent
losses of production capacity. This annex seeks to quantify such effects by looking at the impact of
previous episodes of persistent and large output gaps on steady-state unemployment and on potential
output. We find that each 1 percentage point widening of the cumulative output gap during such
periods is associated with an increase in the NAIRU of about 0.14 percentage points. This equates to a
0.1 percent fall in potential output. This effect is linear with respect to the cumulative output gap and
falls with labor market flexibility. Hysteresis effects from unemployment may thus be modest once the
UK’s flexible labor markets are taken into account. However, other channels may be important, as each
1 percentage point widening of the cumulative output gap correlates to a 0.2 percent drop in potential
output relative to its pre-slump trend. This is likely to be an upper bound on such effects, given possible
upward biases.

A. Introduction
Four years after the start of the financial crisis, the level of output in the UK remains below its precrisis peak. Measured against a pre-crisis trend, the gap is even more substantial. Based on staff
estimates, the output gap in the UK has averaged -2¾ percent per year over the last four years. The
unemployment rate has not increased by as much as would have been expected given the depth of
the downturn, but youth unemployment has reached record highs.
This prolonged period of slack in the economy raises concern that the supply capacity of the
economy could be eroded. Increased incidence of long-term unemployment, for example, could
lead to the long-term unemployed experiencing skill erosion and becoming detached from the
labor market. Insider-outsider models of unemployment can also generate hysteresis, as an adverse
shock reduces the number of insiders employed; when demand returns during the recovery, insiders
may then bargain for higher wages rather than allowing employment to expand, resulting in
permanently higher structural employment (Blanchard and Summers, 1986). Idle machinery may also
have to be scrapped during slumps, as the gloomy projections of demand by businesses become
entrenched in their business investment decisions.
This annex attempts to quantify the size of potential hysteresis effects. To do so, we examine the
impact of prolonged periods of large output gaps (PLOG episodes) in advanced economies on
estimates of the “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment” (NAIRU) and on potential output
in general. We focus on PLOG episodes for their particular relevance in the current juncture, as they
capture drawn-out periods of sluggish demand.

B. Data
We use quarterly OECD data on GDP, unemployment, the output gap, and the NAIRU for 17
advanced economies.2 The data span 1970:Q1 to 2011:Q4. Broadly speaking, the OECD’s output gap
estimates are based on a production function approach, while its NAIRU estimates are based on
Phillips curve equations.3
Using the OECD estimates of the output gap, we follow Meier (2010) and define a PLOG episode as
one that consists of at least eight consecutive quarters of negative output gaps exceeding 1.5
percent in absolute terms. This definition captures both the persistence and depth of the episodes
that we are interested in. In particular, the current UK experience would be classified as a PLOG
based on this definition.

C. Stylized Facts of PLOGs and the NAIRU
The criteria for defining PLOG episodes identify 28 separate PLOG episodes. All countries in our
sample—with the exception of Australia—experience at least one PLOG episode during the period
under study. Some countries, such as Japan, experienced 3 episodes over the past 4 decades. The
average episode lasts for 12.4 quarters and features an average annual output gap of -3.1 percent.

Figure A1.1 shows the quarterly path of the
output gap around PLOG episodes. The
horizontal axis starts from 2 years prior to the
PLOG episode and ends 6 years after the start
of the episode. The run-up to PLOG episodes
typically features large, positive output gaps.
A year into the PLOG episode, however, the
output gap reaches a trough value of -4
percent on average. Three and one-half years
later, the output gap closes again.

The unemployment rate increases on average
by about 3½ percentage points during PLOG episodes (Figure A1.2). The peak unemployment is
reached about two years into the episode. The average estimated NAIRU increases more gradually
over the event window, ending up about 1.1 percentage points higher (Figure A1.3).

Figure A1.2. Behavior of Unemployment Rate around
PLOGs (Percentage points)

One straightforward measure of unemployment-related hysteresis effects is the change in the
NAIRU across a PLOG episode. The increase in NAIRU across these episodes, however, can be
distorted by abnormal levels of activity before and after PLOG episodes. For example, as shown in
Figure A1.4, the run-up to PLOG episodes typically features a period of strong growth and large
positive output gaps. In these periods, the estimated NAIRU may be biased downward, as some
variables used in the estimation procedure may be procyclical. The lower NAIRU will then
exaggerate any changes in the NAIRU that we measure across PLOG episodes. On the other hand,
the slow adjustment of the NAIRU, as shown in Figure A1.3, indicates that we may underestimate the
change in NAIRU across PLOG episodes if we do not consider periods sufficiently far away from the
PLOG episode.
In order to reduce these biases, we exclude a window around PLOG episodes and consider changes
across periods before and after PLOG episodes. This scheme is depicted graphically in Figure A1.4.
Before and after each PLOG episode, we exclude Y years of data to avoid the biases described
above. The changes in the NAIRU across PLOG episodes is than computed as the difference between
the NAIRU averaged over X years before and after the episode. In what follows, we will use a value
of 2 years for Y and 3 years for X.4

Based on the methodology described above, we find that the NAIRU increases by 1.1 percentage
points after a PLOG. This increase in the NAIRU reaffirms the findings in Ball (2009) that the NAIRU
increases during periods of significant disinflation, which is the case for PLOGs, as shown in Meier

(2010). There is substantial variation around the average change, as shown in Figure A1.5. The two
UK episodes (GBR (1) and GBR (2)) lie on opposite sides of the range of NAIRU changes. In the first
episode, which occurred during the early 1980s, the NAIRU increased by close to 4 percentage
points, indicating significant hysteresis effects. However, the PLOG episode in the early 1990s
actually saw a sizeable decline in the NAIRU of about 2 percentage points. For the majority of
episodes, however, the NAIRU recorded an increase during a PLOG episode. The covariates of the
changes in NAIRU are discussed in the next section.

D. Cross-sectional Analysis of NAIRU Changes
We found in the last section that, on average, the NAIRU increases by 1.1 percentage points, with a
large variation across different episodes. The large variation could be due to either country-specific
factors, such as labor market regulations and institutions, or features of the PLOG itself, such as the
extent of the fall in the output gap during these episodes. In this section, we examine how changes
in the NAIRU during PLOG episodes covary with these variables.

Size of the PLOG
The increase in the NAIRU is positively correlated with the cumulative annual output gap during a
PLOG (Figure A1.6; output gaps during PLOGs are negative, but we refer to them here and in the
following figures in terms of their absolute values to ease the exposition). The slope of the
regression line suggests that an increase in the output gap of 1 percent (on an annual basis) is
associated with an increase in the NAIRU of 0.13 percentage points. The coefficient is significant at
the 1 percent level. One might question whether the statistical significance of the result depends on
the inclusion of Finland, which is an outlier episode in terms of the size of the output gap
experienced (in Figure A1.6, it is the right-most point). Figure A1.7 shows the fitted line for the
scatterplot with the Finnish episode dropped. The coefficient remains statistically significant at the 5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

percent level. The coefficient in this case implies that a 1 percent higher output gap is associated
with a 0.15 percentage point increase in the NAIRU.

We can translate the estimated change in NAIRU into changes in potential output using a standard
production function. Assuming a Cobb-Douglas functional form, we can write potential output, Y*,
as



Y *  A* K * 1  u * LF *




1

(1)

where A*, K*, and LF* refer to the potential level of productivity, capital stock, and the labor force. u*
refers to the NAIRU, and  is the capital share. Differentiating the logarithmic value of equation (1)
gives us the percentage change in potential output for a small change in the NAIRU.

 ln Y *
1

*
u
1  u*
Based on this approach, a 1 percent higher output gap during a PLOG episode is estimated to
reduce potential output by 0.1 percent. This estimate is based on a capital share of 0.3, the historical
average for the UK, and a steady-state NAIRU of 6.3 percent, the OECD estimate for the UK in 2008.

Nonlinearity
The regression model above restricts itself to only consider linear effects of the size of the output
gap on changes in the NAIRU. However, nonlinear effects may be important. To a certain extent, the
analytical approach in this note implicitly acknowledges the nonlinearity of hysteresis effects in that
we are only considering PLOG episodes, which are periods of large output gaps by construction.
Still, it is worth examining if, even within this set of episodes, there is evidence of nonlinear effects.
We test for nonlinearity by including squared terms of the output gap in the regression equation.
The coefficient on these terms turns out to be insignificant (p-value: 0.54), thus providing evidence
against the presence of nonlinear effects of the output gap on the NAIRU.
58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Labor market institutions
Apart from features of the PLOG episodes, country-specific factors could also help explain
differences in NAIRU changes. One such factor is institutional differences across countries that
govern labor market flexibility. These might be important if, for example, more flexible labor markets
are less subject to insider-outsider behavior and have fewer real rigidities that cause skill erosion
(from an extended period of high unemployment) to increase to the NAIRU.
To assess this theory, we examine how changes in the NAIRU are associated with the OECD’s index
of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL)—a measure of the tightness of regulations governing
hiring and firing practices. The EPL strictness index is produced annually and goes back to the mid1980s for most countries. It is a summary indicator based on 14 weighted components, such as
dismissal procedures for regular contracts, group layoffs, and use of temporary contracts. The EPL is
scaled from 0-6. A higher number reflects more highly regulated labor markets.
The number of PLOG episodes for which we have EPL data is limited. Of the 28 PLOG episodes, only
15 have EPL data. Within this group, the average level of the EPL index is 2.1. The index for the UK’s
1990 PLOG episode is 0.6, indicating a relatively flexible labor market, owing to reforms in the 1980s.
Based on available data, we find that changes in the NAIRU are higher for countries that have a
higher EPL (Figure A1.8). Table A1.1 shows the regression results of a model that includes an
interaction term between the cumulative size of the output gap and the EPL index. The interaction
term is highly significant. Evaluated at the average EPL level, the impact of a larger output gap on
the NAIRU is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. Lower levels of the EPL, however, result in
a lower impact of the output gap n the NAIRU. The fitted value for the UK’s current EPL index, for
example, implies that a 1 percent output gap leads to an increase in the NAIRU of only 0.01
percentage points, which is statistically insignificant.

E. Looking at Potential Output
The analysis in the preceding section takes a conventional, but limited, view of hysteresis effects.
Although the impact of slumps on the steady-state unemployment rate has been the focus of much
of the literature on hysteresis, there are other channels through which hysteresis effects can
manifest. One such channel is a fall in labor force participation, as workers who have been
unemployed for long spells may become discouraged and drop out of the labor market, especially if
they are middle-aged. Apart from hysteresis effects that operate through the labor market, lower
levels of business investment during prolonged periods of large output gaps can also have
permanent effects on the economy’s potential. The low level of business investment implies that, as
older capital equipment is scrapped, limited new capacity is installed to replace it.
Finding specific data to account for some of the additional hysteresis channels, however, is difficult.
Instead, we take a broader approach and look at the behavior of potential output across PLOG
episodes. As any hysteretic effects would eventually lead to lower potential output (relative to its
pre-PLOG trend), this strategy should, in theory, encompass all of the various channels of hysteresis.
We thus examine how far potential output is
from its pre-crisis trend several years after
PLOG episodes. Figure A1.9 provides a stylistic
representation of this methodology. As before,
we exclude a window before and after the
PLOG episode. A pre-PLOG trend growth line is
estimated for the five years prior to the start of
the window. The distance between potential
output and its trend line for up to five years
following the PLOG episode (controlling for the
size of the fall) serves as a measure of hysteresis
effects.

We should view this approach as setting an
upper bound on the extent of hysteresis for the following reason: although PLOG episodes are
arguably largely driven by negative demand shocks, there could also be coincident supply shocks
that reduce potential output and which standard methods of estimating the output gap might pick
up as periods of output gaps. Thus, attributing all of the decline in potential output during
measured PLOGs to demand shocks that result in hysteresis effects clearly is an upper bound for
such effects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Using this methodology, we find an upper
bound for hysteresis effects on the order of
0.2 percent for every 1 percent of output gap
(on an annual basis). Figure A1.10 shows the
average effect following the 2-year window.

cumulative annual output gap during PLOG
Years over which average gap is computed
episodes. The effects appear to be linear and
smaller in economies with more flexible labor markets. With the UK’s relatively flexible labor market,
hysteresis effects from unemployment may be modest. However, hysteresis can operate through a
number of other channels. Changes in estimated potential GDP during PLOGs might better capture
all hysteresis effects. Such changes suggest that the upper bound of hysteresis effects might be
around an 0.2 percent decline in potential GDP for every 1 percentage point increase in the
cumulative annual output gap. Given this upper bound, the UK’s relatively flexible labor market, and
estimates in other studies (DeLong and Summers, 2012), IMF staff use a hysteresis coefficient of
around 0.1 in its current projections. However, there is much uncertainty in both directions about
this number. Given the usual methodological difficulties with making strong causal inferences from
macroeconomic data, the results in this annex should be viewed as suggestive and not conclusive.

Annex 2. The Structural Fiscal Balance and Asset Prices in the
UK1
This annex examines the impact of asset prices on the fiscal balance, with a view to estimating more
carefully the structural fiscal position of the UK. The study finds that deviations in equity prices from
their equilibrium can have a significant bearing on the fiscal balance. Deviations in house prices from
their equilibrium appear to have a more limited effect on the aggregate fiscal balance, although they
may affect some individual revenue components, such as stamp duty.

A. Introduction
The cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance (CAFB) has been a workhorse tool to measure the
underlying fiscal stance in the UK. The cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance is derived by adjusting the
fiscal balance for its cyclical variations and is often regarded as a measure of the structural fiscal
balance (SFB). The latter is defined as the fiscal balance that is consistent with the long-run
equilibrium of macroeconomic factors that determine the fiscal balance. Indeed, staff currently uses
the concepts of CAFB and the SFB interchangeably in the UK. Staff estimates of the CAFB are derived
by applying a “ready reckoner” formula that is used by UK Treasury to staff’s own estimate of the
output gap (Box A2.1).
This annex is aimed at improving our understanding of the UK’s SFB, notably by examining
the role and effects of asset prices. This issue is of significant relevance in the current
conjuncture—given the large fiscal deficits that the UK is currently faced with, it would be useful to
understand how much of the deficit is structural. In this context, given the UK’s preeminent role as a
global financial center, there is a compelling case for assessing the impact of asset price changes on
the SFB, especially since the country has over the years experienced large swings in equity and
residential house prices. Existing studies have found mixed results concerning the effects of asset
price valuations on the underlying fiscal position.
The analysis focuses on the effects of the output gap and asset prices on revenue.2 The
relationship of the expenditure-to-GDP ratio to the output gap and asset prices is not newly
examined, as both past studies by UK Treasury staff and the procedures for determining the main
expenditure items suggest that the ratio is unlikely to have much of an automatic response to
business or asset prices cycles beyond the denominator effect and the modest effects on social

The analysis follows an approach that is similar to the one used by the UK Treasury (Farrington and others, 2008).
One key difference is that the tax revenue regression includes both the output gap and asset price gaps as
explanatory variables, while Farrington and others (2008) look at the effect of asset price gaps on the variation of tax
revenue that is not explained by the output gap. The former approach appropriately takes into account possible
correlations between explanatory variables while the latter approach does not.

security and debt interest payments that are included in the “ready-reckoner”.3 Instead, the analysis
focuses on how the output gap and temporary deviations of asset prices from their long-run values
(as measured by standard valuation metrics) affects both aggregate revenue and individual revenue
items.
Box A2.1. Ready Reckoner for Calculating the CAFB
The UK Treasury uses a ready reckoner formula to derive
the CAFB.
The formula is based on (i) regressions of expenditure-toGDP and tax revenue-to-GDP ratios on the output gap and
(ii) results of supplemental regression analyses (Farrington
and others, 2008).
Based on estimated regression coefficients, the cyclicallyadjusted expenditure-to-GDP ratio and the cyclicallyadjusted tax revenue-to-GDP ratio are calculated as

Cyclically-adjusted expenditure (t) = expenditure (t) + 0.4 * output gap (t) + 0.1 * output gap (t-1)
and
Cyclically-adjusted revenue (t) = revenue (t) - 0.1 * output gap (t) - 0.1 * output gap (t-1)
respectively. The expenditure coefficients mainly reflect denominator effects (i.e., the expenditure-to-GDP
ratio goes up when GDP goes down), as well as results of supplementary regressions for cyclical social
security payments and debt interest payments. The revenue coefficients reflect mild procyclicality of the
revenue-to-GDP ratio.
Combined, these two formulae results in the following ready reckoner formula for the CAFB as a percent of
GDP:
Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance (t) = fiscal balance (t) - 0.5 * output gap (t) - 0.2 * output gap (t-1)
Staff calculation of the CAFB uses the same ready reckoner formula, but is based on staff’s own estimates of
the output gap.

B. Structural Revenue
The effects of the economic cycles and asset price valuations on tax revenue and social
contributions can be estimated by regressing revenue-to-GDP ratios on the output gap and
deviations of asset prices from their fundamental values. Asset price valuations are included

because they might have non-negligible effects on public finances in the UK, particularly since
equities and housing constitute a large part of households’ net wealth. Changes in net wealth owing
to changes in asset prices could thus affect tax revenues, notably those levied on consumption and
asset transactions.
The definition of asset price gaps is key to estimating the model. Existing studies largely define
deviations of asset prices (in most cases normalized by some economic variables) from their longterm sample averages as “asset price gaps” and use them in regressions. An alternative approach,
used here, is to construct a measure of deviations of asset prices from their “fundamental” values.4
The following measures of asset price gaps are used in the regressions:


The equity price gap is calculated as the deviation of the Shiller Price Earnings Ratio (PER)
for a UK equity price index from its average over the sample period 1981-2011, normalized
by the latter. The Shiller PER is calculated as a ratio of the real equity price index to the tenyear trailing average of real earnings.



The house price gap is calculated as the deviation of the price-to-rent ratio from the priceto-user cost of residential home ownership ratio. The price-to-rent ratio measures the price
of real estate as an asset relative to its returns revealed as market rent. Residential home
owners enjoy a flow of housing service from their house but also need to incur costs
associated with ownership. The price-to-user cost of residential home ownership ratio
measures house prices relative to the user costs. When the expected cost of owning a house
is equal to the cost of renting, the housing market can be considered in equilibrium, and the
house price gap measures the difference between the two.

Such regressions should also control for changes in tax parameters if possible. One way to do
this is to derive a “constant tax regime” series for revenue that corrects for the impact of tax
measures on revenue collection. However, deriving such a series is not straightforward. An
alternative approach is to include statutory tax rates, whenever time series data are available, as
explanatory variables in the regression. This is the approach used in this annex.5 In particular, the
following four measures of statutory tax rates are included: a simple average of personal income tax
rates; the main corporation tax rate; the capital gains tax rate for individuals (a simple average of
statutory income tax rates for 1988-2008, as income tax rates were applied to capital gains in these
years); and the standard VAT rate.

Aggregate Revenue
Regression results suggest that both output
and equity price gaps have significant
effects on total revenue. Table A2.1 shows
the results of regressing the ratio of total tax
revenue and social contributions-to-GDP on
the output gap, asset price gaps, and key tax
rates, using annual data for 1981-2011.6
Several findings are of note:


The coefficient on the output gap
(0.27) is statistically significant and
similar to the ready-reckoner
coefficient of 0.20 (adding together
the contemporaneous and lagged
effects in the ready-reckoner). The
results thus broadly support continued
use of the ready-reckoner’s
adjustment for the output gap.



The equity price gap also has a statistically significant effect. The magnitude is such that a 50
percent equity price overvaluation would temporarily boost revenue by 0.9 percent of GDP.



The house price gap does not have a statistically significant effect. This could reflect the
limited number of observations. However, the point estimate for the coefficient also implies
modest effects, with a 50 percent overvaluation temporarily boosting revenue by 0.4 percent
of GDP.

5

Tax rates might not capture all of the effects of discretionary changes in tax policy. For example, changes in tax
allowances are discretionary policy changes and affect tax revenue.
6

A regression was also run with lags of the output and asset prices gaps, as these may have some delayed effects on
revenue; the results were broadly similar to those in Table A2.1.

The results suggest that large equity price gaps had a substantial impact on the fiscal balance
in the past. The left panel of Figure A2.2 shows estimated structural adjustments to revenue using
the coefficients in Table A2.1. The results imply that the fiscal balance was artificially boosted by the
large positive equity price gap in the late ’90s and the mid ’00s (Figure A2.1). On the other hand, the
early ’80s saw a drag to tax revenue from the large negative equity price gap.

10-year average of earnings may fall substantially
once the pre-crisis period falls out of the averaging window. In other words, there may be some
question about whether the current level of the Shiller P/E remains a reliable indicator of a negative

period of pre-crisis earnings that will not repeat.

Individual Revenue Items
Regression results for individual revenue items indicate some channels through which output
and asset price gaps operate. Results for individual items are shown in Table A2.2.7 Most
explanatory variables are not statistically significant. This may reflect an increased amount of noise
in the data as revenue becomes more disaggregated. Nonetheless, a few results are of note:


The output gap appears to have its largest effects on the revenue-to-GDP ratio through the
corporation tax, which is quite procyclical.



Equity prices may affect revenue in part by boosting consumption (and therefore VAT
revenue) through wealth effects



As one would expect, house and equity prices have non-negligible effects on stamp duties,
which are transaction taxes on the value of various asset sales. This result gives some
support for adjusting revenue for house price gaps even though the coefficient was not
statistically significant in the aggregate revenue regression.



The individual revenue items also yield some difficult-to-explain results, such as a negative
coefficient of the equity price gap on social contribution revenue. However, in an estimation
of more than 20 coefficients, one or two odd results are to be expected even if explanatory
and dependent variables are unrelated.

C. Conclusions
The analysis in this annex suggests that the effects of asset price gaps—especially equity price
gaps—on fiscal balances in the UK warrant closer monitoring going forward. The analysis finds
that equity price gaps have significant effects on revenue.8 House price gaps may have additional
(but smaller) effects, especially on stamp duties. At the moment, offsetting effects from estimated
house price overvaluation and equity price undervaluation (Figure A2.1) imply that the net effect of
asset price gaps on the fiscal balance may be modest (less than 0.3 percent of GDP; Figure A2.2).
Uncertainty regarding the magnitude of asset price gaps also warrants some caution in their use.
Given these considerations, the continued use of the ready-reckoner in staff’s estimates of the
structural balance seems broadly appropriate for now. However, if asset price gaps appear to widen,
it may eventually become necessary to incorporate them more explicitly into estimates of fiscal
structural balances.

7

The tax revenue classification follows the 1993 SNA. Trends are included for VAT and Other Nonoil Taxes, as these
are apparent in the data,
8

The key results continue to hold in some robustness checks. Specifically, the signs, sizes, and statistical significance
of the coefficients remain largely unchanged even when the equity price gap is replaced by deviations of the PER
from its long-term average and when the house price gap is replaced by deviations of the price-to-rent ratio or
price-to-income ratio from their long-term averages.

Annex 3. Alternative Fiscal Scenarios: Effects of Delaying
Consolidation in the Presence of Hysteresis1
This annex assesses possible gains from delaying fiscal consolidation in the presence of hysteresis by
simulating an alternative fiscal scenario that involves near-term fiscal easing, followed by additional
consolidation in the medium term (relative to a baseline based on current fiscal plans) to return debt
and deficit ratios back to baseline levels by 2025. The scenarios find no gains (in terms of cumulative
GDP) from delaying consolidation if multipliers are constant across time, even if hysteresis effects are
substantial. Gains from delaying consolidation can be achieved if multipliers are asymmetric across the
cycle. However, gains can also be negative, especially if multipliers vary with growth, growth is
expected to be stable in the absence of consolidation, and delaying consolidation makes the
adjustment path more uneven. If multipliers vary with growth, gains from delaying consolidation will
rise significantly if growth turns decisively negative.

A. An Alternative Fiscal Scenario
Staff has simulated an alternative fiscal scenario to better assess the potential impact of
delaying consolidation in the UK. Some analysts suggest that delaying consolidation could
increase the present discounted value of GDP by reducing adverse hysteresis effects now. To better
assess such effects, this annex simulates how GDP between now and 2025 would be affected by an
alternative scenario of delayed consolidation.
This alternative scenario assumes the following:


New fiscal stimulus is undertaken in FY12/13, such that the cyclically-adjusted primary
balance (CAPB) deteriorates by 1 percent of GDP relative to the previous year. This level of
the CAPB is then maintained in FY13/14. As a result, cumulative fiscal stimulus of about 4¼
percent of GDP is provided in these two years relative to the baseline in which the
government maintains its current consolidation plans.



Enough fiscal consolidation then occurs, starting in FY14/15, to gradually return both the
debt and deficit back to baseline levels by 2025.

Restoring the debt-to-GDP ratio to the baseline level by 2025 is a key element of this analysis
that differentiates it from related work by DeLong and Summers (2012). They instead assess
the merit of fiscal stimulus by only requiring the government to pay growth-adjusted interest rates
on the debt issued to finance the stimulus, thus allowing for a permanently higher debt-to-GDP

by the same authors.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ratio. Given that permanently higher debt ratios may entail some costs,2 a more equivalent
comparison of scenarios may be one in which debt in both cases converges to the same level.
Another difference with DeLong and Summers is that this analysis allows for some gradual closing of
the output gap even in the absence of stimulus.
Both the baseline and alternative scenario incorporate substantial hysteresis effects.
Specifically, both scenarios assume that each 1 percent output gap reduces potential GDP by 0.1
percent annually (Annex 1). This is the same central hysteresis parameter used by DeLong and
Summers (2012). However, there is substantial uncertainty concerning the magnitude of such effects.
Other macroeconomic dynamics are broadly consistent with staff’s central scenario. The
baseline is calibrated to closely mimic staff’s current central scenario. In the alternative scenario,
growth deviates from the baseline in line with changes to the fiscal stance and with multiplier
assumptions; fiscal balances then respond to growth in line with automatic stabilizer assumptions
used by HM Treasury and staff. In the absence of shocks, the output gap is assumed to close by half
each year. For example, if, in a certain year, potential growth is 1.7 percent, the output gap is -2
percent, and there is a headwind from fiscal consolidation of 0.4 percent, growth would be 2.3
percent (1.7 + 2*.5 - .4 = 2.3).

B. Results
Symmetric multipliers
A key finding of these simulations is that delaying consolidation yields essentially no
permanent gains if multipliers and hysteresis effects are symmetric over the business cycle.
Alternative 1 in Figure A3.1 shows the delayed consolidation scenario in the case in which multipliers
are constant at 0.8. In this case, there is no benefit to delaying consolidation: potential GDP in 2025
and cumulative discounted GDP during 2011-25 are no better than in the baseline.
This finding goes against the view that hysteresis effects and substantial multipliers alone
justify fiscal stimulus. The intuition behind the result in Alternative 1 is that, although hysteresis
effects are unfortunate, they cannot be avoided if structural fiscal adjustment is required to stabilize
debt and if multipliers and hysteresis effects are symmetric over the business cycle. This is because
the powerfulness of large hysteresis effects and multipliers during the stimulus phase go fully into
reverse during the unavoidable consolidation phase (excluding the unlikely event that stimulus
permanently lowers the debt-to-GDP ratio, such that fiscal adjustment is never needed). This is a key
aspect of the analysis that is not incorporated into DeLong and Summers, as they do not require
consolidation to return debt-to-GDP to its baseline level.

2

DeLong and Summers include the distortionary costs of taxation from paying the growth-adjusted interest on the
higher debt. However, there may be a number of other costs to permanently higher debt levels (higher risk premia,
lower capital stock, debt overhang effects, etc.)

Asymmetric multipliers
Permanent gains from delaying consolidation can be generated in some cases if hysteresis
effects are significant and multipliers are asymmetric over the business cycle. Alternative 2 in
Figure A3.1 shows the case in which the multiplier rises linearly from 0.15 when the output gap is +3
percent to 1.2 when the output gap is -4 percent (Figure A3.2).3 In this case, cumulative discounted
GDP during 2011-25 under delayed consolidation is 0.25 percent higher than under the baseline.4

However, gains from delayed consolidation may be more difficult to capture if multipliers
vary more closely with growth than with the output gap. Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2012)
find some empirical support for the view that multipliers more closely vary with growth than with
the output gap. Given this, Alternative 3 in Figure A3.1 shows the effects of delayed consolidation
under the case in which multipliers vary with growth, rising linearly from zero when growth is +5
percent to 1.5 when growth is -1 percent. In this case, the gains from delaying consolidation are
actually negative (-0.25 percent of cumulative discounted GDP during 2011-25). This result reflects
two factors:


3

Growth is projected to be moderately positive over the next few years in the baseline and
accelerate only modestly over the medium term. With multipliers varying with growth,
broadly constant growth over the medium term implies broadly constant multipliers in the
baseline and hence limited scope for gains from delaying consolidation.

In all three alternatives, the multipliers are calibrated so that they are 0.8 on average during the projection period.

4

Asymmetry of hysteresis effects across the cycle would further increase gains from delaying consolidation. However,
it is unclear that the adverse effects of downturns on potential GDP do not have opposite positive effects during
booms. For example, Clark and Summers (1982) find evidence of positive hysteresis during World War II, as more
employment of women led to sustained increases in their labor force participation rates. Annex 1 also finds little
evidence of nonlinear hysteresis effects.



Moreover, with the baseline consolidation already slightly backloaded going forward, further
delay in consolidation makes the consolidation path even more uneven (i.e., adjustment
during the consolidation phase of the alternative scenarios is steeper than at any point
under the baseline). This steeper path of adjustment in the alternative scenarios results in
larger fiscal headwinds and therefore lower growth during the consolidation phase of
Alternative 3 than under the baseline. This low growth in turn increases fiscal multipliers,
further depressing growth and further raising multipliers in the consolidation phase of
Alternative 3. A key implication of this result is that, if the growth path is constant in the
absence of fiscal consolidation and if multipliers vary with growth, then GDP losses are
minimized by a constant rate of adjustment, even if hysteresis is significant.

However, if multipliers vary with growth, the case for delayed consolidation would strengthen
considerably in a downturn, as multipliers would spike. Under such a scenario, simulations
suggest that permanent gains from fiscal stimulus could exceed 1 percent of potential GDP.
Sensitivity tests
Sensitivity tests examine how the results are affected by alternative assumptions regarding
the magnitude of hysteresis and the persistence of output gaps. These results are shown in
Figure A3.3. In each graph, the assumption in the simulations in Figure A3.1 is the central point (0.1
for hysteresis effects and 0.5 for output gap persistence). Effects of increasing and decreasing each
variable are shown. The results suggest several points:


Essentially no gains occur under symmetric multipliers (Alternative 1), even under large
hysteresis effects or highly persistent output gaps.



Larger hysteresis effects and slow “natural” closing of output gaps (i.e., slow price and wage
adjustment to return the economy to full employment) amplify potential gains of delaying
consolidation when multipliers are significantly asymmetric and vary with the output gap
(Alternative 2).



Conversely, large hysteresis effects and persistent output gaps magnify the losses in the case
where multipliers vary with growth (Alternative 3). It should be emphasized that this result
partly relates to the specific scenario studied (the baseline scenario), in which growth is
positive and relatively stable.

Comparing gains with costs
Against possible gains from consolidation, one must weigh various costs to delayed
consolidation that are not modeled in the scenarios. During the phase in which delayed
consolidation entails temporarily higher debt and deficits, costs could include higher risk premia and
crowding out effects on capital accumulation. However, these effects may not be large in the UK at
the moment, at least if changes to the debt path are moderate. Other risks include reduced buffers
to deal with unexpected adverse shocks and political economy risks that delayed consolidation may
never be delivered. These risks could be substantial, but are hard to quantify.
The degree to which multipliers are currently asymmetric in the UK is uncertain. The Spring
2012 Fiscal Monitor found little multiplier asymmetry in the UK across the output gap. Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2012) also find that both positive multipliers and multiplier asymmetry vanishes as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT UNITED KINGDOM

debt approaches 100 percent of GDP—a debt level the UK is quickly approaching. However, it is also
unclear to what degree econometric studies across a range of periods can be applied to the UK’s
current circumstances, especially the unusual ones of today in which short-term policy rates are near
the lower bound. In particular, a key factor affecting asymmetry is the degree to which monetary
policy can offset fiscal decisions. There are good reasons to think that, if not artificially limited to a
small number of instruments, that UK monetary policy can still be quite effective (section on
Monetary and Credit Easing Policies in main text), implying relatively low and symmetric fiscal
multipliers once the monetary policy reaction is taken into account. However, if strong and broadbased monetary and credit easing do not improve growth, this may indicate more asymmetry of
fiscal multipliers related to the zero lower bound (or elevated levels of uncertainty and risk aversion)
than currently assumed, which could in turn strengthen the case for slowing fiscal tightening plans.
To preserve credibility, reconsidering the path of consolidation should be in the context of a multiyear plan focused on further reducing the UK's large structural fiscal deficit when the economy is
stronger and taking into account considerations such as risks to sovereign borrowing costs, as
discussed above.

Annex 4. FSAP Update: Status of Main Recommendations1
The authorities have made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2011 FSAP
Update, which emphasized the need to intensify supervision and provide it with sufficient
resources. Specifically, the new regulatory architecture announced in late 2010 is now taking shape,
with operational separation of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) into the Prudential Regulation
Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) already underway. The transition to the new
structure and the revision of the supervisory program are major undertakings, and many of the FSAP
recommendations will be addressed when this work is finalized. The successful implementation of the
recommendations will require significant staff resources for both new authorities. Other priorities
include granting the PRA broader authority over financial holding companies and increasing the
supervisory focus on small investment firms.

High

High

Immediate

Near term

The reorganization of the regulatory architecture remains a work
in progress. Substantial progress has been made in laying out the
mandates of the two new agencies. The PRA will be a subsidiary
of the BoE. According to the Financial Services Bill the PRA, the
new agency will be responsible for prudential supervision of
commercial banks, building societies, and insurance companies,
as well as investment firms deemed systemically important. The
PRA will have two objectives: promoting the safety and
soundness of regulated firms; and policyholder protection. This
clarity of mandate would address concerns set out in the FSAP.
The FCA will be responsible for prudential regulation of around
25,000 firms not prudentially regulated by the PRA, including
several thousand investment firms (fund managers, brokerage
firms, and dealers). The Financial Services Bill sets out the FCA’s
single strategic objective of protecting and enhancing confidence
in the UK’s financial system and indicates three operational
objectives: (i) securing an appropriate degree of protection for
consumers; (ii) promoting efficiency and choice in the market of
financial services; and (iii) protecting and enhancing the integrity
of the UK financial system. However, these objectives are not
explicitly linked to financial stability. In discussion surrounding
the FCA and in the FSA literature, the FCA is discussed primarily
as having a consumer protection function, with a market integrity
function less emphasized. The FCA chair does participate in the
Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and clearly the FCA has
prudential responsibilities. However, the concerns expressed in
the FSAP—namely the lack of priority around financial stability
responsibilities—are not yet fully addressed.
A draft Financial Services Bill currently before Parliament contains
provisions (section 192) that improve on the current restrictions
on the regulator's powers over holding companies. However,
these powers are limited to the “power of direction,” which can
be used when specific conditions are met, as set out in the draft
Bill, and do not extend to full and necessary authority over a
holding company. Both the BoE and FSA expressed concern that

the Bill does not give the PRA sufficient power. HMT has
indicated that the issue will be revisited in the context of future
work at the European level (conglomerates directive, etc.).
There are no plans to increase personnel resources for the
PRA/FCA from the present FSA level. Both agencies are under
pressure not to expand budgets and, as a consequence, will not
allocate greater resources to the new structure over those already
allocated under the FSA. Given the significant challenges facing
both agencies, the concern regarding sufficiency of resources
remains. There will be an upcoming statement on PRA
recruitment and strategy.
The draft Financial Services Bill focuses on coordination between
agencies and government, in normal times and during a crisis.
The draft Bill requires the PRA and FCA to enter into a
memorandum of understanding (MoU) setting out a high-level
framework for how the two regulators will work together within
the new regulatory system. A draft MoU has been produced by
the BoE and FSA. The FSA has put in place an “internal twin peaks
model” as of April 2012, in which the future FCA and future PRA
are separated within the FSA. This is allowing the two new
agencies to begin working separately, while coordinating through
this framework.
The two authorities will coordinate activities in some areas and
cooperate in others. The MoU requires each regulator to appoint
a senior executive responsible for the coordination; these
appointees will meet quarterly to review the effectiveness and
efficiency of coordination and cooperation. For the first year, this
will be the respective CEOs.
The Boards of each regulator will review the effectiveness of the
MoU on an annual basis. Each agency’s annual report must
contain an account of their cooperation.
The MoU between the PRA and FCA is a good first step toward
forging a cooperative arrangement between the two agencies.
The real operational effect of arrangements will not be known
until the agencies legally and physically separate and fully
embrace their new mandates and operations.
The Financial Services Bill also creates an additional framework
for financial stability and crisis coordination. Under the Bill, the
PRA will have the authority to veto decisions of the FCA where
there is a financial stability issue at stake. Both the PRA and FCA
will be represented at the FPC.
In a crisis situation, the BoE is subject to additional reporting to
HMT. When certain criteria are met (an institution of systemic
importance in distress and likely need for an outlay of public
funds), the Bill gives HMT the ability to direct some of the BoE’s
operations. It is unclear what the impact would be on the PRA, as
it appears that HMT’s powers in these cases would be limited to
liquidity operations and resolution authority of the BoE rather
than the supervisory operations of the PRA, the BoE subsidiary.
The Financial Services Bill is still a draft bill and subject to change.
Further, it will take time and experience to understand its impact.
The Bill aims to clarify responsibilities, but seems to impose a
rather complex set of checks and balances that may be difficult in
practice.

The future PRA is currently developing a high-level supervisory
model that it feels will broadly address these points. The
supervisory model designates firms Category 1-4, according to
their size, level of complexity, and the impact their failure would
have on the system. The supervisory assessment framework for
the largest banks (Category 1) would be systematic, proactive,
and multi-year, which should lead to a more continuous regime
of onsite assurance that is intended to be more judgment-based
and forward-looking than the current regime. The PRA has
indicated it is committed to much more senior management
involvement in direct supervision and interactions with
institutions.

1/

The supervisory assessment framework sets out how supervisors
would be expected to construct a multi-year plan to assess the
different areas of risk across individual firms/groups. This will
include testing of credit and market risk as necessary. However, at
this stage it is too early to assert exactly how frequent and “deep”
the PRA will be able to go in each of the risk areas outlined in the
new supervisory model. This is dependent on further detailed
design of the framework and associated resource allocations,
which are works in progress.
Supervisions staff and specialist staff were formerly separated in
the FSA model, and this raised concerns in the FSAP. In the new
model, specialists and supervisors are better integrated.
Also, the supervisory assessment framework aims to better link
capital and liquidity assessments to the overall assessment of a
bank. The different elements of capital analysis will be brought
together under one overall approach. Note that, while the PRA
will not replicate any internal models, the outputs of the more
important models will be subject to regular review and supported
by Hypothetical Portfolio Exercises.
Interaction with banks at the Board level will be more frequent
and led by the Director (or above). It will focus on the key
messages and ensure the firm understands the PRA’s concerns
and is fully engaged with addressing them.

to a firm’s viability and ensure that firms take appropriate
remedial action to reduce the probability of failure. It will also flag
actions that the authorities will need to take in advance to
prepare for the failure and resolution of a firm, in coordination
with the SRU and FSCS as resolution authority and operator of
the deposit guarantee scheme, respectively. To highlight
regulatory forbearance, where actions expected in a particular
stage had not been taken, supervisors would report to PRA senior
management.
The PIF is expected to have five clearly demarcated stages. The
judgment on where to place a firm within a particular stage will
be based on an assessment of the firm’s viability in both current
and future states of the world. There will not be a mechanical
reliance on backward-looking indicators.
The assessment of where a firm sits in the PIF will be undertaken
as part of the ongoing supervisory process and will reflect,
among other things, a firm’s expected financial strength in
stressed circumstances. It will be revisited in response to specific
concerns arising in the external environment in which a firm
operates — for example, in response to a sectoral risk identified
by the FPC.
If the PRA judges risks to a firm’s viability to be low, the firm will
be in Stage 1 of the PIF. This implies a normal level of supervisory
monitoring and actions. As a firm moves through each stage of
the PIF, the intensity of supervisory monitoring and the
intrusiveness of supervisory actions will increase, and contingency
planning by the SRU and the FSCS will be stepped up.

The redesignation of firms under the new model (Categories 1-5)
means that the number of insurers subject to more intensive
supervision (Category 1 and 2) is likely to be greater than the
number of insurers covered in the current program. Once the PRA
supervisory model is in place, it may address the FSAP’s concerns
that insurers just below the current CPP(I) threshold are
insufficiently supervised.
The PRA supervisory design has not yet reached this level of
detail.

The launch documents suggest that the FCA mandate includes a
clear responsibility for market integrity and transparency, as well
as consumer protection. As noted above, concern remains that
the FCA mandate does not contain sufficient emphasis on
prudential responsibilities.

Medium
term

The FCA is still designing its supervisory model. From early
discussion it appears that because of the large number of firms
and its resource constraints, the FCA will not expand its “bottom
up” analysis of small firms. It will expand its thematic reviews and
is revising its data reporting. However, there will still be a very
large range of firms with low contact.
The FSA is undertaking a review of liquidity standards at CCPs
and has instituted a liquidity stress testing program and monthly
liquidity reporting. Rather than requiring committed credit lines
from banks (which may be counterproductive in a distressed
situation) they have elected to require CCPs to hold additional
highly liquid collateral. This is in keeping with recent changes to
CPSS/IOSCO standards. The FSA (with input from the BoE) is
currently conducting more detailed examinations of the CCPs’
liquidity risk management. The supervision of CCPs will pass to
the BoE at the end of the transition.
Contingency planning is still ongoing. The authorities are actively
involved in the EU and FSB work on these issues. CCPs are
developing loss allocation rules that would be used when the CCP
faces a loss greater than its standard default protections. Some
CCPs have already introduced loss allocation rules for certain
services. The FSA expects European-level legislation on resolution
of CCPs to be adopted, and CPSS/IOSCO is currently working on
the issues.
The BoE indicates it is ready to offer sterling concentration
facilities to systemic CCPs and is currently reviewing the policy
framework governing provision of services to CCPs more
generally.
The BoE will become the sole overseer of payment and
settlement activities under the new regulatory architecture. The
BoE has developed indicators to monitor concentration of banks’
payment and settlement activities. The BoE shares data on tiering
with the FSA. CHAPS Co has introduced rules and criteria that
give it power to preclude indirect relationships that present
unacceptable systemic risk and will undertake its assessment
against the criteria by September. EUI has begun analyzing data
on tiering and will make recommendations to mitigate the risks.
Both CHAPS Co and EUI are in discussing membership with
several major banks.
This assessment has not yet been undertaken. The BoE will
conduct such assessments under its own risk framework.

Annex 5. Spillovers: Financial Contagion Through G-SIBs1
The key takeaways from last year’s Spillover
Report were that spillovers emanating from the
UK are almost entirely financial and that UK
financial stability is a global public good,
requiring the highest quality supervision and
regulation. Given the centrality and size of the
UK banking sector, this annex assesses the role
of its global systemically important banks (GSIBs) as sources and propagators of shocks. The
analysis identifies two UK G-SIBs as having great
capacity to generate spillovers. UK banks are
also found to be very vulnerable to funding
shocks. Therefore, an intensification of the euro
area crisis, which affects bank funding, is likely
to have large amplifying effects via UK G-SIBs.

UK G-SIBs have grown in size and importance over the last decade and are highly interconnected
with the rest of the global financial system. Therefore, spillovers from European shocks transmitted
through UK G-SIBs could potentially be very large.
Banks with high spillover potential
To infer interconnectedness among G-SIBS and gauge the scope for financial contagion, two sets of
metrics are constructed using banks’ balance sheet and market price data for a sample of 32 SIBs.2
These include: (i) directional correlations of market prices, measuring an institution’s contribution to
the variance of other institutions’ equity returns or its contribution to systemic risk (both in normal
times and during high stress episodes), and (ii) banks’ balance sheet indicators of
interconnectedness, based on the size of securities holdings and wholesale funding liabilities, and of
vulnerability to a number of risk factors (Figure A5.1). The analysis identifies two UK G-SIBs, along
with four euro area and four US G-SIBs, as having high potential to generate spillovers. These UK
institutions are also among the most susceptible to spillovers from others, but are more likely to be
affected mainly during times of market stress, including dislocations in funding markets or a
generalized sell-off in broader asset markets.

Report: Background Paper.

The sample includes 27 G-SIBs and 5 European SIBs that are considered likely to contribute to spillovers within
Europe.

Deleveraging due to funding and sovereign stress
To examine the channels of transmission of adverse shocks to European G-SIBs and evaluate their
impact within and outside Europe, contagion effects of sovereign and funding shocks are simulated.
A freeze of wholesale funding markets would hit UK banks particularly hard, exacerbating UK banks’
deleveraging both in the UK and oustide. In contrast, a sovereign shock would affect the UK
indirectly through stress and deleveraging of foreign banks.


Sovereign shock. This scenario assumes a permanent decline in sovereign bond prices in Italy
and Spain equal to the difference between prices in December 2011 and March 2012. Several GSIBs in the euro area core plus banks in the periphery incur large losses. Deleveraging is largest
in the peripehery, followed by Germany and the UK. The impact outside of Europe is, however,
relatively modest (for more details see forthcoming 2012 Spillover Report: Background Paper).

Deleveraging Impact of Sovereign Stress



Funding shock. The shock comprises a sharp increase in LIBOR-OIS spreads, calibrated to the
Lehman stress episode, and a reduction in the value of derivatives market funding. Bank
losses are largest in France, Germany, and the UK. The ensuing deleveraging exceeds 10
percent of GDP in these countries as well as in emerging Europe. Deleveraging outside
Europe is more modest, but still large in the US, Japan, Australia, and several emerging
market economies.

Annex 6. Fiscal Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under staff’s central macroeconomic scenario and the government’s fiscal plans (Table A6.1):


The general government primary deficit is expected to continue improving to a surplus of
2¼ percent of GDP by FY17/18. As a result, the debt ratio will be on a downward path after
FY15/16.



General government gross debt is projected to reach a peak of about 96 percent of GDP
before declining to 92½ percent of GDP by FY17/18.

Alternative scenarios and bound tests highlight the uncertainties surrounding the projected
debt path (Figure A6.1). Different policy paths or growth scenarios would significantly affect debt
outcomes:


Debt would increase continuously in the absence of fiscal consolidation. In a scenario with a
constant primary balance (in percent of GDP) over FY12/13-17/18, debt would increase to
115 percent of GDP by FY17/18 and be on a firm upward path.



Medium-term debt dynamics are not highly sensitive to interest rate shocks given the long
average maturity (14 years) of UK government debt.



If medium-term growth rates are persistently lower than anticipated, stabilizing the debt
ratio would require further adjustment. Assuming expenditure plans remain unchanged, the
debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 105 percent of GDP by FY17/18 should growth be 1.3
percentage points (½ a standard deviation) lower each year than in the central scenario.

UNITED KINGDOM
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
July 10, 2012

CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Reza Moghadam and David Marston

This supplement provides an update on notable developments that occurred after the
staff report was finalized. Key policy steps are in line with recommendations in the staff
appraisal.
Financial Stability Report and Financial Policy Committee meeting
1.
The Bank of England (BoE) published its semi-annual Financial Stability
Report (FSR) on June 29. The report’s analysis is broadly consistent with the assessment
of financial sector conditions in the staff report. Specifically, the FSR notes that efforts
by UK banks over the last few years to strengthen their capital and funding resilience
have helped insulate them from economic weakness and intensified euro area stress
during the last few months. Nonetheless, these forces have caused the outlook for
financial stability to deteriorate since end-2011, with both funding costs and risks of
severe downside scenarios on the rise. The FSR and latest credit survey also find that
credit growth remains weak and that credit supply has tightened further in recent
months in the face of these pressures.
2.
Against this background and consistent with staff recommendations
(paragraphs 49–51 of the staff report), the Interim Financial Policy Committee (FPC)
recommended that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) should


make clearer to banks that liquidity buffers should be used in times of stress to
avoid excessive credit contraction;1



review banks’ liquidity guidelines to account for the availability of BoE liquidity
insurance;



continue its existing practice of encouraging banks to bolster capital buffers via
methods that do not curtail lending to the real economy (the minutes of the FPC

1

Many banks are currently maintaining levels of liquidity in excess of regulatory minima, reflecting in
part conservative risk management.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION UNITED KINGDOM

meeting are explicit that banks should not be “constrained by regulatory capital
requirements from expanding lending”); such methods include equity issuance,
debt-for-equity swaps, and restraint of dividends and remuneration; the FPC
expected that part of additional capital should be used to increase capital ratios to
insure against heightened risks and reduce funding costs and that part could be
used to expand lending; and


the FPC also clarified that such higher capital levels above the official Basel III
transition path were a temporary response to heightened risks and that banks
could revert to the original transition path once such risks materialize or dissipate.

easing was necessary to keep inflation
from undershooting the target in the medium term, given “continuing tight credit
conditions and fiscal consolidation,” as well as “increased drag from the heightened
tensions within the euro area.” Staff welcomes this easing, as called for in the staff report
(paragraphs 27–28). The forthcoming Funding for Lending program should help further
support the outlook. It will be difficult to assess the adequacy of the total package of
measures until the Funding for Lending program goes into effect. The announcement of
additional QE was anticipated by markets, and hence their reaction was muted.

GDP and fiscal data releases
4.
Recent data releases include revisions to historical GDP data and fiscal
outturns for FY11/12. The main changes arising from these releases are that


the 2008–09 recession is now moderately more shallow than previously estimated,
with the peak-to-trough decline falling from 7 percent to 6¼ percent and



the overall fiscal deficit for FY11/12 is now estimated at 8.4 percent of GDP, slightly
higher than staff’s previous estimate of 8.2 percent of GDP (staff report Table 3)
due to modest deviations on both revenue and expenditure.

These data revisions do not significantly alter staff’s projections, analysis, or views in
the staff report.

Attempted manipulation of LIBOR and EURIBOR
5.
Following an investigation, UK and US regulators recently fined Barclays for
attempting to manipulate LIBOR and EURIBOR interest rates and for false reporting.2
The investigation concluded that Barclays misconduct included


making submissions which formed part of the LIBOR and EURIBOR setting process
that took into account requests from Barclays’ interest rate derivatives traders;
these traders were motivated by profit and sought to benefit Barclays’ trading
positions;



seeking to influence the EURIBOR submissions of other banks contributing to the
rate setting process; and



reducing its LIBOR submissions during the financial turmoil of 2007-09 as a result
of senior management’s concerns over negative media comment.

Barclays’ top executives have resigned, reportedly at the behest of regulators. Media
reports indicate that around 20 other banks, including major US and European banks,
are under investigation for similar practices. The collaboration of US and UK regulators
in the investigation is welcome, and further international cooperation along these lines
is encouraged.
6.
The findings of the investigation are disturbing and may have spillovers.3
With an enormous volume of derivatives and loans linked to benchmarks such as LIBOR
and EURIBOR, it is essential that their determination be accurate to ensure faith in their
integrity. Otherwise, use of such benchmarks, which facilitate automatic adjustment of
contracts to changing conditions, will be lessened and their usefulness degraded. In the
near term, such revelations could add to deleveraging pressures, as uncertainty about
potential losses from forthcoming regulatory penalties and potential lawsuits may
increase bank borrowing costs. Another risk is that uncertainty about key benchmarks
could increase some spreads and volatility in related contracts. Such pressures may in
turn have unwelcome adverse effects on credit conditions, both in the UK and abroad,
especially given the relatively rapid diffusion of shocks originating on the UK’s
platform, as discussed in the 2012 Spillover Report. Hence it is appropriate that reforms
to ensure the integrity of interest rate determination are being contemplated.

That said, a complete assessment of the implications should await the
conclusion of ongoing investigations and the release of all facts. In this connection,

Futures Trading Commission.

Concerns about possible downward biases in LIBOR submissions due to reputational considerations
during periods of acute market stress are not entirely new. Such concerns were raised, for example, in
Box 2.2 of the October 2008 Global Financial Stability Report.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION UNITED KINGDOM

Chancellor Osborne has announced an inquiry to examine whether the setting of LIBOR
should become a regulated activity and whether actual trade data could be used to set
the benchmark, as advocated by Governor King for some time. This inquiry should be
completed by September so that proposals can be incorporated into the final Financial
Services Bill.4 There is also a parliamentary investigation into the attempted
manipulation; this investigation will feed into legislation to implement reforms
proposed by the Independent Commission on Banking.5

Statement by the Staff Representative on the United Kingdom
July 16, 2012

This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/12/168) and staff supplement were issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
The Bank of England and UK Treasury announced details of the Funding for Lending Scheme
(FLS) on July 13, 2012.1 The FLS is designed to reduce funding costs for banks and building
societies so that they can make loans cheaper and more easily available. Access to the scheme will be
directly linked to how much each bank and building society lends to the real economy. Those that
increase lending will be able to borrow more in the scheme and do so at a much lower cost than those
that scale back their loans.
Terms of the Scheme: Under the scheme, from August 1 (and for 18 months thereafter), UK banks
will be able to swap up to 5 percent of their existing stock of loans to the non-financial sector as at
end-June 2012 (amounting to around £80bn) for T-bills. In addition, banks will also be able to swap
unlimited amounts for new lending.


The funding will be provided against a wide range of collateral, with haircuts applied on the
same terms as the BoE’s existing Sterling Monetary Framework. The swap will be for a fixed
term of four years, and the fee will depend on banks’ lending behavior during a reference
period of end-June 2012 through the end of 2013.



For banks maintaining or expanding their lending over that period, the fee will be 0.25
percent per year on the amount borrowed. For banks whose lending declines, the fee will
increase linearly up to a maximum fee of 1.5 percent of the amount borrowed. With banks
being able to use T-bills to borrow money at rates close to the expected path of the policy rate
(now at 0.5 percent), the total cost of obtaining cash under the scheme will vary between 0.75
and 2 percent.



The BoE will publish participants’ outstanding drawings under the scheme on a quarterly
basis.

The FLS could be more successful in boosting bank lending than previous measures. An
important innovation of this scheme is that the pricing is designed to encourage an expansion of net
lending, consistent with staff advice during the consultation discussions. Importantly, if banks
maintain or expand their lending, the lower fee of 0.25 percent will apply to all of the funding they
obtain through the scheme and not just on the incremental funding they receive to engage in new
lending. Therefore, banks will have a strong incentive to maintain or increase market lending, or else
suffer the penalty of an increase in their overall funding costs. Moreover, the FLS loans are for a
period of four years, longer than the terms of the other facilities available, including the ECTR, which
provides 6-month funding. Although it is unclear what final effect the FLS will have on demand and
growth, it should help keep funding costs low for the target market.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
the United Kingdom
On July 16, 2012 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom.1
Background
The UK’s economic recovery has been sluggish, as the needed hand-off from public to
private demand-led growth has not fully materialized. Economic activity is projected to
gain modest momentum going forward, but the pace of expansion is expected to be
weak relative to the scale of underutilized resources. As a result, the output gap is
projected to remain sizeable for an extended period, keeping unemployment (currently
over 8 percent) elevated and raising the risk that sustained cyclical weakness reduces
the economy’s productive capacity. Inflation has been on a downward trend since
peaking in September 2011 and is expected to decline below the 2 percent target over
the medium term, as the large output gap exerts disinflationary pressure. Risks to this
central scenario are large and predominantly to the downside, including from further
setbacks to the euro area crisis and larger-than-expected headwinds from public and
private sector deleveraging.
Current polices aim to assist economic rebalancing and financial sector healing.
Substantial progress has been made toward achieving a more sustainable budgetary
position and reducing fiscal risks, with structural fiscal adjustment of about 4¾ percent
of GDP over the last two years. The pace of consolidation is expected to ease to

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings

½ percent of GDP in FY2012/13, reflecting the authorities’ decision not to undertake
additional discretionary tightening in the short term in response to substantial downward
revisions to potential GDP. Under current fiscal plans, the pace of consolidation is
expected to accelerate next year to around 1½ percent of GDP.
Bold monetary stimulus has been provided to help counteract the weak economy and
rising risks of undershooting the inflation target. Specifically, the Bank of England
resumed its purchases of government bonds (quantitative easing) in late 2011, with
additional purchases announced in February and July 2012. Despite this monetary
easing, credit conditions remain tight due to elevated risk aversion, an incomplete
process of financial repair, and rising bank funding costs associated with intensified
stress in the euro area. More recently, the authorities announced credit easing
measures to more directly lower private-sector borrowing costs, including through
broader provision of bank funding and liquidity.
The financial regulatory structure is also being revamped. A Financial Services Bill to
provide a permanent legal basis for the new regulatory framework is expected to come
into force in early 2013, and a White Paper on Banking Reform has been published with
proposals for additional loss absorbency capacity and ringfencing of retail operations.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts aimed at economic rebalancing,
including bold monetary stimulus, financial sector policies to build buffers and
strengthen oversight, and major progress toward a more sustainable fiscal position.
However, they cautioned that a stalling recovery, high unemployment, and uncertain
external conditions continue to present significant challenges.
Directors welcomed recent announcements to implement additional monetary stimulus
via further quantitative easing, and most Directors believed that further easing may be
needed, including consideration of a cut in the policy rate. However, a number of
Directors cautioned that scope to provide more stimulus through rate cuts and standard
quantitative easing may be limited, given that interest rates on government debt are
already very low. Noting that elevated bank funding costs have limited lending to the
private sector, Directors welcomed recent measures aimed at lowering private-sector
borrowing costs through broader provision of bank funding against collateral. They
considered that, depending on the use and performance of these new programs, further
credit easing measures may be needed. Directors underscored that such measures
should be complemented with regulatory policies to ensure that banks do not become
dependent on such facilities.
Directors considered that deeper budget-neutral reallocations could also support
recovery, including greater investment spending funded by property tax reform or
spending cuts on items with low multipliers. They emphasized that automatic stabilizers

3

should continue to operate freely, and underscored the need for shielding the poorest
from the impact of consolidation.
Looking ahead, Directors commended the authorities for their strong commitment to
achieve fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Many Directors supported the
authorities’ prudent approach toward further fiscal easing, emphasizing the importance
of not undermining fiscal sustainability and hard-won credibility, and noting the potential
negative feedback loops between public finances and the financial sector. Many
Directors also noted the difficulty of setting a specific timetable for potential future fiscal
policy actions in the current uncertain environment. However, a number of other
Directors considered that fiscal consolidation should not be accelerated as planned if
growth does not build momentum even after further monetary and credit easing
measures, noting that persistent weak growth that hinders achievement of fiscal targets
might also pose risks to credibility. These Directors noted that any adjustment to the
path of consolidation should be in the context of a multi-year plan and ideally
accompanied by deeper long-run entitlement reform to help preserve credibility.
Directors stressed the importance of continuing with efforts to bolster financial stability to
anchor a strong and durable recovery, reduce the risk to taxpayers, and limit spillovers
from shocks that are transmitted through the UK’s financial system. They emphasized
that policies should focus on strengthening bank balance sheets by building capital
rather than reducing assets to balance stability and growth considerations. Directors
also welcomed the review of banks’ liquidity guidelines to account for the availability of
Bank of England liquidity insurance.
Directors emphasized the need to address expeditiously the issue of “too big to fail.”
They welcomed the progress in developing a more flexible resolution framework, “living
wills” for major institutions, and reform proposals by the Independent Commission on
Banking. Directors also agreed that a broader macroprudential toolkit for the Financial
Policy Committee is desirable, including powers to limit loan-to-value and
loan-to-income ratios.
Directors supported efforts to intensify supervision and stressed that provision of
adequate resources will be key to achieving this objective. They also considered that
greater authority over financial holding companies than currently envisaged in the draft
Financial Services Bill will be essential for the future Prudential Regulatory Authority.
They emphasized that international collaboration on key regulatory and supervisory
issues will further support financial stability, and they encouraged the authorities to
continue their vital and constructive role in this regard.

Statement by Alex Gibbs, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
July 16, 2012
I thank staff for a very good and detailed report which reflects a productive mission. My
authorities agree with much of the analysis and advice. However, they caution against setting
a timetable for potential future fiscal policy actions. The uncertainty of the policy
environment, the risks attached to discretionary fiscal easing and the need to calibrate any
response to the circumstances – as stressed in the 2011 staff report – means any such
timetable is unlikely to prove a useful guide to policy.
Economic Outlook
The UK is estimated to have contracted by 0.3 per cent in each of the last two quarters,
meaning that growth over the past 18 months has been broadly flat. This largely reflects the
impact of external factors, including the earlier rise in commodity price-driven inflation that
hit real incomes and the ongoing euro-area debt crisis, which continues to undermine
confidence and investment. Despite these difficult conditions, in the three months to April
unemployment fell by 51,000 to 8.2 per cent and 166,000 new jobs were created.
Growth is expected to remain uneven and choppy through the rest of 2012 as public holidays
and the Olympic Games have an impact on output, but the central case is still for a gradual
recovery. In March the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast
subdued but positive growth of 0.8 per cent for 2012, 2.0 per cent in 2013 and then 2.7 per
cent in 2014 as the recovery gains traction. A rebalancing from consumption and government
expenditure to net exports and investment was still expected.
CPI inflation fell to 2.8 per cent in May from the peak of 5.2 per cent in September 2011 as
the effects of the earlier rise in energy prices and VAT fell away, making space for monetary
policy action. Against the background of continuing tight credit conditions, fiscal
consolidation and increased drag from the heightened tensions within the euro area, the MPC
judged that, without additional monetary stimulus, inflation was more likely than not to
undershoot the 2 per cent target in the medium term.
My authorities agree with staff that the exceptional economic environment warrants a
supportive macroeconomic policy stance. A number of steps have already been taken to
achieve this, consistent with the Government’s well-established economic strategy based on:
fiscal consolidation; monetary activism; financial sector reform; and growth-friendly
microeconomic reform.
Fiscal Policy
The UK Government has made a strong commitment to fiscal consolidation. It set out a clear
and credible plan to put the public finances back on a sustainable path and created the
independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to monitor it. Despite difficult

2
conditions, fiscal consolidation, which staff have judged to be essential, remains on track.
The deficit in the cyclically adjusted primary balance has been halved over the last two years
(from -7.0 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 to -3.4 per cent of GDP in 2011-12) and by the end of
2011-12 almost 40 per cent of the annual consolidation planned for the 2010 Spending
Review period has been achieved.
The Government reacted to the structural deterioration in the OBR’s forecasts in the Autumn
Statement of October 2011. Although the Government continued to implement their detailed
consolidation plans, the flexibility built into the fiscal framework allowed for the pace of
structural adjustment to slow in the near term, letting the automatic stabilizers operate freely.
At the same time, to restore the public finances to a sustainable path the period of planned
consolidation was extended by a further two years (2015-16 and 2016-17). My authorities
welcome the staff view that this approach has been appropriate.
Consolidation plans are still focused on expenditure-based measures, consistent with IMF
advice. Around 80 per cent of the total consolidation in 2016-17 will be delivered by lower
spending. Further steps have also been taken to improve the composition of consolidation. In
the Autumn Statement, savings from current spending (generated over the Spending Review
2010 period), including from public sector pay restraint, were used to create room for one-off
increases in high-quality, growth-enhancing capital spending. These changes complement the
progress made with the UK’s Growth Review, including the Plan for Growth and National
Infrastructure Plan. This programme of over 250 reforms and infrastructure investments
includes plans to: cut the main rate of corporation tax by six per cent; save businesses over
£3 billion through deregulation; invest over £1billion in road infrastructure; and create
450,000 apprenticeships. A further implementation update will be published later this year.
Staff have highlighted the potential for further budget-neutral reallocations from low- to
high-multiplier items and further structural reforms. They also raise the case for discretionary
fiscal easing in the event that the recovery fails to take off. The Government is already
looking to see if further support for growth can be provided using the credibility of its
balance sheet to boost credit for business, housing and infrastructure. As noted above,
consideration of any further policy response would need to take account of the specific
circumstances at the time and the scope to use other policy levers. The potential benefits of a
fiscal response would need to be weighed against the risks of losing fiscal credibility,
including the potential for negative feedback loops between weak public finances and the
UK’s large and systemically important financial sector. In an environment of ongoing
financial market stress, this risk would be particularly relevant.
Fiscal credibility is hard won and easily lost. The costs of losing fiscal credibility would be
damaging for both the UK, but also for the wider global economy given the potential for
financial spillovers. As staff highlight in their spillover analysis, UK financial stability is a
global public good.

3

Monetary Policy
Having judged risks to have shifted to the downside and, in the absence of additional
monetary stimulus, that inflation was more likely than not to undershoot the target in the
medium term, the MPC recently voted to increase the size of its programme of asset
purchases by £50 billion to a total of £375 billion. The MPC continues to view asset
purchases as an effective tool for lowering interest rates, supporting asset prices and therefore
nominal demand.
Staff have raised the question of whether the Bank could purchase private sector assets. The
MPC continues to see limited scope for this given the relatively small size of the UK market
and as a rule would seek to avoid becoming the market maker of last resort in situations
where it was not completely necessary.
Although the MPC voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5 per cent, it has recently considered the
merits of further reductions. Given the potential to squeeze some lenders’ interest margins
and their ability to lend, as well as the risks of impairing the functioning of money markets,
the MPC judged that further reductions could be counterproductive and would not have any
advantages over further asset purchases. However, this position will be kept under review.
Credit Easing and Bank Liquidity Funding Schemes
As euro area concerns have intensified, the UK authorities have focused on developing
targeted policy responses to counter the tightening of financial conditions and the increase in
bank funding costs. In the spring, the Government launched the National Loans Guarantee
Scheme to boost lending to small and medium sized businesses. This credit easing scheme
aims to provide £20 billion of government guarantees over two years to enable banks to
attract funding at more favourable rates so that the benefits can be passed on to SMEs.
More recently, the Government and the Bank of England have launched two new schemes in
response to a continued lack of credit availability for businesses and households: the
Extended Collateral Term Repo Facility (ECTR) to address market-wide shortages of shortterm sterling liquidity; and the “Funding for lending’ (FLS) scheme to allow high-street
banks to temporarily swap illiquid assets for more liquid ones in return for sustained or
increased lending to the real economy. The ECTR is already up and running and the details
of the funding for lending scheme are being finalised. These schemes respond directly to
recommendations made during the Article IV mission and have been welcomed by staff.
Financial Sector
As staff note, UK banks have made valuable progress in rebuilding capital and liquidity
buffers in recent years and this has ensured that they remain relatively resilient in the face of
ongoing, elevated financial market stress. However, more still needs to be done to ensure that

4
they are in the best possible shape to weather the current, and any future, financial storms. It
is vital that they are able to absorb potential losses and maintain lending to the real economy.
To this end, the interim Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has recently recommended that
the Financial Services Authority (FSA) encourage UK banks to build capital buffers without
exacerbating market fragility or reducing lending to the real economy. The FPC has also
recommended that the FSA makes it clearer to banks that they are free to use their regulatory
liquid asset buffers in the event of a liquidity stress. It also recommended the FSA to review
its liquidity guidance, taking into account that additional liquidity insurance is more readily
available from the Bank of England. These recommendations are consistent with staff advice.
Broader reform of regulatory and supervisory structures is continuing against the challenging
background of ongoing financial market stress and the international and European reform
agenda. As staff note, progress has been made in implementing most of the related FSAP
recommendations. The Financial Services Bill was introduced in January 2012 and is
expected to come into force in early 2013. The move towards the new model is now well
underway, with the FSA trial running the new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) structures within the existing system. This is already
facilitating an intensification of supervision and a focus on the 'safety' of the system – both
key FSAP recommendations.
The FSAP raised concerns about the lack of clarity with the mandates of these new
institutions. My authorities believe that the legislation addresses these concerns. The PRA
will have the general objective of promoting the safety and soundness of regulated firms,
complemented by an additional objective of policyholder protection which will only apply
when regulating insurers. The FCA will have an overarching objective to make markets
function well, but this will include an explicit responsibility to protect and enhance the
soundness, stability and resilience of the financial system. In addition, the FPC will be given
a secondary objective to support the Government’s economic policy, consistent with the aim
of balancing economic growth with financial stability.
The Government has pushed ahead with efforts to address the risks associated with
systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). A recent White Paper sets out detailed
plans to implement the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking,
including: proposals for retail deposits to be ring-fenced from international wholesale and
investment banking; and an additional 3 per cent of equity in addition to the Basel III
minimum standards for the largest UK ring-fenced banks. The paper also supports the Basel
proposal for a binding 3 per cent minimum leverage ratio for all banks and as staff suggest,
the UK will continue to press for this in EU discussions. My authorities welcome the staff
conclusion that these plans will help limit the frequency and severity of banking crises and
strengthen the resilience of the UK financial system.

5
Improving the disclosure of financial sector data to enhance market discipline continues to be
a priority for my authorities. The PRA intends to publish some regulatory returns and this
will be developed in earnest with the implementation of harmonized reporting under CRDIV
in the EU. The FPC has recognised the potential role of disclosure in fostering financial
stability and outlined when it will intervene on specific disclosure and transparency issues.
Most recently, it recommended that UK banks work with the FSA and the British Bankers’
Association to ensure greater consistency and comparability of existing Basel II Pillar 3
(Market Discipline) disclosures, beginning with the accounts for the current year.
Domestic financial sector reform needs to be complemented by a stronger EU and
international regulatory and supervisory framework. I welcome staff’s call for international
collaboration and continued UK leadership and can confirm that the UK remains fully
committed to the global reform agenda, including the full and faithful implementation of the
agreed Basel III standards.
