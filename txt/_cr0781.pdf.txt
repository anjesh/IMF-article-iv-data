Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2006 Consultation with the Republic of Croatia
Approved by Poul Thomsen and Anthony Boote
January 19, 2007

Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation took place in Zagreb from October 26 to
November 8, 2006. The staff team comprised Messrs. Feldman (head), Gueorguiev, and Moore
(all EUR), and Mmes. Ilyina (PDR) and Mitra (MCM), assisted by Mr. Vamvakidis (Resident
Representative). The mission met with Prime Minister Sanader; Deputy Prime Minister Polančec;
Finance Minister Šuker; Health Minister Ljubičić; Economy Minister Vukelić; Croatian National
Bank (CNB) Governor Rohatinski; other senior officials; and representatives of political parties,
social partners, think tanks, and the private sector.
The current minority government of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), supported by six
other parties, was formed in early 2004. The next parliamentary elections are due in late 2007.
In October 2005, Croatia started accession negotiations with the European Union (EU). The first,
“screening” phase of the accession process was completed in October 2006. The European
Commission has assessed Croatia as a functioning market economy that should be able to cope
with the competitive pressures within the Union in the medium term provided it continues its
reforms.
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Appendix I) and subscribes to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data are broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though
some improvements would be desirable (Appendix II).
The mission participated in a joint press conference with the Prime Minister and held a separate
press conference on the published concluding statement. The authorities intend to publish this
staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Croatia has experienced solid growth and low inflation in recent years. Policies
in 2004–06, supported by a Stand-By Arrangement, sought to mitigate vulnerabilities
through significant fiscal adjustment and a series of prudential measures by the CNB.
Notwithstanding that the financial sector is healthy and much progress has been made in
improving supervision, rapid credit growth and the possibly widespread exposure of
households to currency risk remain vulnerabilities. Compounding these vulnerabilities, the
current account deficit widened to about an estimated 8 percent of GDP in 2006, and the
external debt ratio to 84 percent.
Besides the outlook, the consultation focused on the interrelated issues of raising economic
growth and addressing vulnerabilities. Without further fiscal consolidation and faster and
deeper structural reforms, Croatia cannot expect to significantly raise potential growth and
accelerate income convergence to western European levels. Total factor productivity growth
has been low. And export growth has been significantly below the average for Croatia’s peer
countries, which have been more successful in attracting greenfield FDI.
•
Outlook. Staff projects medium-term growth around potential, now estimated just
below 4½ percent, with strong private consumption and investment supporting a temporarily
higher pace in 2006-07. The current account deficit is projected to remain large at about
8 percent of GDP in 2007, with gross external debt staying well above 80 percent of GDP.
•
Fiscal policy. To enhance growth and lessen vulnerabilities, staff urged a reduction in
the size of government and further, expenditure-led, fiscal consolidation. The authorities
agreed with staff’s recommendation to lower the fiscal deficit to 1½ percent of GDP by 2009.
Staff are concerned, however, about potentially serious risks to fiscal policy implementation
in 2007: although the 2007 deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP is achievable, spending is too
high and further spending pressures must be resisted.
•
Monetary policy. Staff and the authorities agreed the tightly managed float remained
appropriate in light of the successful track record on inflation and the high level of
euroization. Given this, addressing vulnerabilities and strengthening competitiveness mostly
depends on fiscal and structural policies. Careful monitoring of rapid credit growth is
required: if credit growth does not slow, tighter prudential measures—which would be
preferable to credit controls—would need to be considered.
•
Structural reform. The business environment and associated bureaucratic obstacles
are a significant constraint on economic growth. Staff stressed the importance of improving
the business climate and attracting strategic investors. Accelerating the public enterprise
reform agenda, which has been plagued by delays, has also become increasingly urgent.
While the authorities have had the same reform agenda for some time, implementation has
been slow and represents a key uncertainty going forward.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
In recent years, Croatia has experienced solid growth and low inflation, but an
already large current account deficit has started to widen again (Figures 1 and 2;
Tables 1 and 2). GDP growth averaged around 4¾ percent in 2001–06. Contributions to
growth from private consumption and investment have accelerated in recent years, and have
been associated with rapidly expanding domestic credit and imports. The contribution of net
exports to growth recently turned negative, with domestic demand pressures and higher
international energy prices causing the current account deficit to widen in 2005–06.
Meanwhile, headline inflation has been contained to 2–4 percent (with core inflation even
lower) by a combination of a broadly stable exchange rate, moderate wage growth, and
limited pass-through from international to domestic energy prices. The unemployment rate
remains high, despite recent declines that reflected both employment growth and declining
labor-market participation (Figure 3).
2.
Although external competitiveness appears adequate, export performance has
lacked the dynamism of top performers. Exchange rate-based indicators of external
competitiveness do not appear particularly worrisome. The growth of goods exports has in
fact improved over the past couple of years and market share is well above its level at the
start of this decade, while receipts from tourism have expanded robustly and overall growth
has not been thwarted by external competitiveness problems (Figure 4, Box 1). Still, exports
to the euro area1 remain below potential and export growth significantly below the average in
Croatia’s peer countries, which have been more successful in attracting greenfield foreign
direct investment (Figures 5 and 6). Survey measures of competitiveness underscore
structural weaknesses in the business environment, as discussed below.
3.
Policies in 2004–06, supported by a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA), sought to mitigate external vulnerabilities by lowering Croatia’s current account
deficit and stabilizing the external debt-to-GDP ratio. Given the focus of monetary policy
on exchange rate stability, the authorities largely relied on fiscal (and quasi-fiscal)
adjustment, accompanied by CNB measures to safeguard financial sector stability and
discourage external debt accumulation by banks. Box 2 highlights Croatia’s response to past
Fund policy recommendations.
4.
The government substantially reduced the fiscal deficit during 2004–06. The
deficit reduction—from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated 2.8 percent in 2006—
reflected continued pension reform, wage moderation, and investment cuts, with automatic
revenue stabilizers playing only a moderate role (Table 3). In addition, the state-owned
Development Bank (HBOR) scaled back its (quasi-fiscal) activity.

1

These exports account for about 80 percent of the total.

6
Box 1. How Competitive is Croatia’s Tourism Sector?
The tourism sector in Croatia is one of the most important in the economy. Receipts from
tourism account for nearly 20 percent of GDP. Likely reflecting the beauty of the Croatian
coast, the sector has grown exceptionally strongly since 1999 (when tourism was affected by
regional instability): annual foreign tourist arrivals have nearly doubled, as has Croatia’s market
share in the Mediterranean/Black Sea region (Figure 7).
Tourism competitiveness indicators appear favorable. The indicators below assess
competitiveness according to both price and quality of services (latest data are 2004). Croatia
scores at or above average along all dimensions. The closest regional comparator in terms of
price competitiveness is Turkey, though Croatia scores better in terms of quality of
environment, technology, and human resources. Land ownership issues, however, have been a
major disincentive to investment in the coastal areas where tourism has greatest potential.

While bank restructuring and privatization have strengthened the financial
sector, strong credit expansion and foreign exchange-induced credit risk have raised
concerns that prompted a prudential policy response by the CNB. Large foreign banks
own over 90 percent of the system, which is well developed by regional standards (Figure 8).
Financial soundness indicators show adequate capitalization and asset quality (Table 4). But
intense competition among banks and easy access to credit from foreign parents has
contributed to a vigorous credit expansion that gained momentum over 2005–06 (Table 5).
The pace of the ongoing credit expansion increases the potential for asset quality to
deteriorate in the event of a downturn.2 Most households seem exposed to currency risk:
2

An accompanying selected issues paper examines the sensitivity of bank provisioning to macroeconomic
conditions and rapid credit growth. In a similar vein to a CNB study, it suggests that banks increase their loanloss reserves to provide a buffer against potential loan losses in the event of a downturn, to avoid a potentially
significant hit on capital.

7

Box 2. Croatia: Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Policy implementation has been in the context of the recent SBA (Appendix III), which expired in
November 2006 and effectively covered the entire period since the previous Article IV
consultation in August 2004.
Fiscal Policy: In line with Fund recommendations, the government implemented considerable
fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment in the context of a new medium-term fiscal framework.
Financial Sector: The CNB has used the marginal reserve requirement to counter banks’ foreign
borrowing, and eschewed direct bank credit ceilings, whose abolition Directors welcomed at the
previous consultation. The authorities have implemented most recommendations from the 2002
FSAP and are addressing the remainder.
Structural reforms: Implementation on reinvigorating structural reform efforts and accelerating
privatization has been mixed: restructuring of state-owned enterprises and key privatizations have
been delayed, though the recent sale of shares in the oil company (INA) was a major step forward;
but the authorities have made more progress in other areas than envisaged in 2004, notably in
pensions and health.

75 percent of long-term bank loans to households are linked to foreign currencies (mainly
euro, though recent loans have been largely Swiss-franc); and, even though households’
foreign-currency deposits are sizeable in the aggregate, borrowers and savers may only partly
overlap. Concerned about safeguarding financial stability, the CNB responded with a series
of measures to slow the bank-related portion of capital inflows: a progressive increase in its
marginal reserve requirement (MRR) on banks’ foreign borrowing, broadening its base, and
issuing various prudential measures and guidelines (discussed in ¶21 and 22 of the policy
section).
6.
Despite countervailing policy efforts, external vulnerabilities remain significant.
The increase in the external debt-to-GDP ratio has been arrested, Croatia’s market access is
strong, and, in the context of strong capital inflows and a tightly managed float, reserves have
increased (Figures 9 and 10; Table 6). However, gross external debt (above 80 percent of
GDP at end-2006) and the current account deficit (estimated at 8 percent of GDP in 2006)
remain high, in circumstances in which privatization receipts are expected to drop sharply
after 2007 and sizable new FDI is not assured.3 Large external financing needs—to finance
the current account deficit and roll over maturing debt—imply vulnerability to shocks and
contagion. Indeed, the CNB has publicly warned of the risk of debt-service and rollover

Staff estimates that a current account deficit of around 7¼ percent of GDP would, with FDI of about
4½ percent of GDP, stabilize external debt (Appendix IV).

8
difficulties should the still-positive investor sentiment toward emerging markets sour.4 High
debt also reduces the flexibility—already limited by euroization—of monetary and exchange
rate policy, putting considerable responsibility on fiscal policy for demand management.
7.
The large role of the state, slow progress in key structural reforms, and lessthan-satisfactory conditions for doing business have constrained economic
performance. The state’s presence in many aspects of economic activity remains significant
and is reflected in one of the biggest governments in the region (Figure 11), high state aid
(text chart), and a large public sector share of output (about 40 percent of GDP, high relative
to Croatia’s peers; Figure 12). While recent progress in some transition indicators has been
significant, privatization and reform of state-owned enterprises has lagged (¶26) because of
legal disputes, resistance of vested interests, onerous investment and employment conditions,
and a legal framework favoring insiders—a bias that the pending draft privatization law
could worsen. In addition, survey evidence—corroborated consistently by the mission’s
discussions with public and private sector representatives—shows that the conditions for
doing business are hampered by the heavy administrative burden and difficulties enforcing
property rights (Figure 13; text table), with many problems at the local level.

Another accompanying selected issues paper, using the balance sheet approach, analyzes how the
vulnerabilities of main economic sectors to foreign exchange, interest rate, and liquidity (debt rollover) shocks
have increased between 2000 and 2005 as external debt rose by over 20 percentage points of GDP.

9
II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Growth is projected to remain around its medium-term potential, but with
strong private consumption and investment supporting a temporarily higher pace in
2006–07.
•
The staff scenario (Table 7) projects an acceleration in private consumption in
2006–07, partly reflecting the large but one-time “pensioners’ debt” payments (1 percent of
GDP in each of 2006 and 2007, described in Country Report No. 06/346). Investment
growth—after the rapid pace in preceding years—is projected to moderate from 2007, though
investment remains high as a share of GDP. Projected exports rise slowly as a share of GDP,
broadly in line with the growth in trading-partner demand. On this basis, staff projects real
GDP growth lifting to 4.6 percent in 2006 and 4.7 percent in 2007, returning to 4½ percent
afterwards—with inflation around 3 percent. But the commodity price outlook and the
strength of domestic demand imply a wider current account deficit in 2006 and 2007, about 8
percent of GDP in each year. For the medium term, taking into account the constraints to
growth posed by the business environment, staff estimates potential growth for Croatia just
below 4½ percent (Box 3).
•
The authorities have a similar view of the growth outlook for 2007, but somewhat
higher growth approaching 5 percent for the medium term, reflecting a more optimistic
investment and export outlook. They agreed that the 2006 current account deficit would
remain high (data for the four quarters to 2006Q3 already showed a deficit of 8.1 percent of
GDP) and may even widen a bit next year. Further ahead, the authorities’ Strategic
Development Framework envisages a pickup in real GDP growth to over 7 percent annually
by 2010–13—assuming sharply higher FDI and full implementation of reforms to improve
the business environment.
•
Upside risks to both short-term growth and the current account deficit arise from a
potentially stronger-than-expected stimulus from rapid credit growth to private consumption
and investment. Downside risks to growth—which could, however, widen the current
account deficit—include the potential for a renewed increase in oil prices, lower-thanexpected trading partner growth, and/or a deterioration in investor sentiment toward
emerging markets.
9.
The main risk from a medium-term perspective is that strong capital inflows
might fuel consumption and real estate speculation rather than augment the economy’s
productive capacity. This would clearly aggravate external vulnerabilities. In an
environment combining a number of underlying difficulties—including heavy state presence
in the economy, a still-high public sector deficit (including the pensioners’ debt repayments),
lackluster goods exports, and extensive euroization—heavy capital inflows could seriously
strain the macroeconomic framework. This risk would be heightened by the absence of

10

Box 3. Total Factor Productivity and Potential Growth
Recent economic growth has relied on capital accumulation, with only a limited
contribution from growth in total factor productivity (TFP) and less from employment.
The growth decomposition below applies a Cobb-Douglas production function based on
Hodrick-Prescott-filtered labor supply (which has reflected the declining activity rate) and
productivity. The modest growth in TFP is a concern, and reflects the unfinished structural
reform agenda.
These estimates imply potential growth of just below 4½ percent in the medium term. An
accompanying selected issues paper provides details of these estimates1—and corroborates them
using other methodologies. Recommended structural reforms could boost TFP and result in
significantly higher GDP growth.

As described in the selected issues paper, alternative capital stock data from the statistical

III. POLICY ISSUES
10.
The consultation focused on issues related to raising potential growth and
addressing vulnerabilities, which are core objectives of the authorities’ economic
strategy. Their medium-term fiscal framework envisages further fiscal consolidation, with
the aim of reducing external vulnerability and public debt.5 In addition, their broad-ranging
5

Program (PEP; end-year).

11
Strategic Development Framework stresses the importance of completing the “unfinished
transition” and the benefits of providing market incentives to encourage all value-adding
activity, rather than picking particular sectors for development. For its part, staff prepared
four accompanying selected issues papers on the interwoven topics of raising economic
growth and reducing vulnerabilities.
A. Fiscal Policy
11.
The core fiscal policy issues were reducing the size of the government,
undertaking further fiscal consolidation, and enhancing the flexibility of fiscal policy.
Progress on these interrelated fronts is important for several reasons: first, the opportunity to
boost economic growth by reducing the burden of the large state; second, the need to address
a large current account deficit and ensure a sustainable debt path; and third, with monetary
policy constrained, the benefits of enhancing fiscal flexibility to cope with shocks.
12.
The authorities have been planning further medium-term fiscal consolidation—
albeit on a moderate scale. The July 2006 EFPG and December 2006 PEP target a fiscal
deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2007, gradually declining to 2.4 percent of GDP by 2009
(text table). The planned adjustment is based on ongoing structural reforms (in the areas of
pensions, health, and subsidy reduction) and on a continuation of the expenditure restraint
practiced since 2004.

negative surprises. With the
authorities aspiring to join the EU as soon as possible and enter ERM-2 fairly quickly, a
strong fiscal adjustment would also add to the credibility of these aspirations and to the goal
of early euro adoption, while helping to create room for an increase in expenditure to absorb

12
structural funds and pay Croatia’s contribution to the EU budget once in the EU. The
authorities were receptive to these arguments, and the Prime Minister publicly spoke in favor
of the more ambitious deficit target of 1½ percent of GDP in 2009, though underlying
policies would need to be elaborated.6 The authorities also noted that higher public spending
because of EU-related expenditures makes fiscal adjustment all the more challenging,
requiring more adjustment elsewhere for a given deficit target.
14.
Staff also emphasized that successful implementation of the medium-term fiscal
framework beyond 2007 would require structural measures to reduce expenditures
permanently. With Croatia’s expenditure-to-GDP ratio well above peers (Figure 11), there
is scope for significant savings, which would enable both tax cuts (including cuts in
contributions) to boost growth and lower fiscal deficits.
•
The authorities envisage public sector reforms, but underlying specifics are yet to be
worked out. Staff noted that the wage bill is very large by regional standards and emphasized
the importance, in undertaking civil service reform, of allowing more flexibility and sharper
performance-based differentiation of individual wages, while keeping the overall
compensation cost on a steeper-than-envisaged declining path by reducing the high public
sector employment (the authorities assume increases in employment). Additional mediumterm savings could come from implementing the existing medium-term subsidy-reduction
plan, especially in the railways; and from the forthcoming shipyard restructuring. However,
staff would encourage the authorities to be even more ambitious than planned on subsidy
cuts, including in agriculture.
•
Since the more ambitious deficit targets recommended by staff would imply a sharper
reduction in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio than envisaged in the medium-term fiscal
framework, staff also urged the authorities to widen the reform agenda beyond existing plans,
in particular in social benefit spending.7 The authorities noted that high benefit spending,
especially for veterans, was necessary owing to the legacy of the 1990s wars. Staff
acknowledged this legacy, but argued that this made better benefit targeting all the more
important. High priority, in staff’s view, should be to target welfare, family, and health
benefits taking into account the income (and assets) of recipients, and consolidating the
numerous welfare benefits (which could also help address disincentives to labor-market
participation, which, as shown in Figure 3, has declined significantly).

6

The 2006 PEP also sees deeper fiscal consolidation as a realistic option, based on better revenue collection,
stricter expenditure control, and further progress in expenditure-reducing structural reforms.
7

Adapting the Fund’s Global Fiscal Model to Croatia, a selected issues paper shows that more ambitious
expenditure reforms would provide room for significant tax cuts, in turn stimulating investment, employment,
growth, and consumption.

13
15.
The 2007 budget targets a general government deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP.
Thus, the overall balance would be little changed from 2006 and would worsen on a
structural basis, according to staff estimates. The authorities felt that adhering to this target
was appropriate considering the fiscal adjustment already implemented over the past three
years and the expenditure demands they faced in the politically charged pre-election
environment. In addition, financing options—for both the budget and the current account—
would seem to afford some flexibility in the timing of fiscal adjustment, notwithstanding the
deterioration in the current account.
16.
While staff recognized that achieving the 2007 deficit target would be an
accomplishment in the politically charged atmosphere before elections, it expressed
concerns about potentially serious risks to fiscal policy implementation in 2007.
●
Spending pressures were mounting. Ahead of the mission, the government approved
increases in child and maternity benefits and free school textbooks, adding 0.3 percent of
GDP to expenditure. During the mission, demands to boost wages, and the pensions of post1999 retirees—either through a reversal of pension reform parameters, or through “offbudget” accounting schemes—were evident and represented sizeable fiscal risks.8
●
In addition, fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities, not showing up in the headline deficit,
were planned that would add to aggregate demand pressures at a time of a widening current
account deficit. These included the scheduled “pensioners’ debt payments (1.1 percent of
GDP), HBOR’s plans, after the recent consolidations, to raise its deficit from an expected
0.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to 0.6 percent in 2007, and potentially large borrowing by
shipyards using government guarantees (up to 1.6 percent of GDP).
●
Against this background, and before the budget was prepared, staff recommended
adhering to the expenditure-to-GDP ratio envisaged in the July 2006 EFPG. This would
avoid a ratcheting up of spending that could be difficult to unwind in later years, and,
according to staff estimates, result in a fiscal deficit well below the targeted 2.8 percent of
GDP owing to expected revenue overperformance.
●
In the event, the budget includes revenues and expenditures as shares of GDP that are
0.7 percentage point higher than the July 2006 EFPG plan for 2007. This reflects, in part, the
inclusion in the central government accounts of small budget users previously outside the
government (a welcome result of the single treasury account) and higher EU grants (with
8

To address the unsustainability of the pay-as-you-go pension system, a 1999 reform reduced the generosity of
the benefit formula. For this, and other reasons, post-1999 retirees have lower pensions than the pre-1999
retirees. One option under consideration would pay the post-1999 retirees “off-budget” (using the current
accounting methodology), via a transfer of shares to an extrabudgetary fund. The accrual-based GFS 2001 or
ESA 95 methodologies would treat either the share transfer or the fund payments as on-budget general
government expenditure.

14
expenditure counterparts) than in the earlier plan. However, the budget also includes higher
spending on subsidies to farmers, goods and services, and investment. The revenue estimates
are realistic in staff’s view, but would leave little room for overperformance.
●
Spending pressures have since persisted, which would raise the deficit above
2.8 percent of GDP if not offset by cuts elsewhere. The authorities agreed with the public
sector trade unions to a 6 percent wage increase (instead of the 5 percent assumed in the
budget) and to paying bonuses to teachers in addition to the granted wage increase, straining
the budget wage bill. Moreover, the national airline will receive additional unbudgeted
subsidies.
17.
The discussions explored ways to enhance fiscal flexibility. In the health sector, the
authorities plan to shift financing gradually to a per-diagnosis basis in hospitals to remove
perverse incentives to keep patients in hospitals, and to strengthen control over sick leave
spending. Staff supported these plans, which would lessen rigidities in a large area of nondiscretionary expenditure, and encouraged the authorities to start preparing the next stage of
the health reform. Staff also recommended raising gradually the general contingency to about
1 percent of central government expenditure (from about 0.3 percent in the past), and that the
authorities prepare contingent fiscal policy measures in case the deficit needs to be reduced at
short notice.
18.
The authorities recognized the need for transparency and safeguards to avoid
problems from contingent liabilities. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) was determined to
keep to a minimum the amount of guarantees extended to the shipyards ahead of adoption of
a restructuring plan for the troubled sector, as most such guarantees will likely be called. To
prevent other unexpected government expenditure, staff urged the MoF to scrutinize
carefully any proposals for public-private partnerships (PPPs) to ensure adequate risk sharing
is in place. Although the MoF was confident that sufficient controls were in place to avoid
additional government expenditures on account of existing PPPs, it requested FAD technical
assistance as an additional precaution, and in light of plans for new PPPs.
B. Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector
19.
The CNB continues to target broad stability in the kuna-euro exchange rate as
the predominant operating objective of monetary policy, although it has avoided a
formal commitment to a particular level or band. The CNB has operated pragmatically,
allowing moderate exchange rate fluctuations to accommodate seasonal market pressures.
The authorities and staff agreed that the emphasis on exchange rate stability has clear
advantages in light of extensive euroization—about 80 percent of bank loans and time
deposits are foreign-currency denominated or indexed—as well as an import-to-GDP ratio of
over 50 percent, and strong trade links with the euro area. Crucially, the tightly managed
float has delivered consistently low inflation, fulfilling the CNB’s primary objective.

15
20.
Staff supported the present monetary framework, while stressing the
implications for other policies. The limited exchange rate flexibility was conducive to
unhedged borrowing in foreign currencies with potentially negative implications for financial
stability, requiring more vigilance in bank supervision and tighter bank regulations than
otherwise to address the attendant risks. The constraints on monetary policy also put
considerable onus on fiscal policy, and underscore the importance of structural reforms.
Indeed, given the high level of euroization, the adverse impact of a weaker exchange rate on
balance sheets would likely offset any short-term gain in competitiveness. Thus,
strengthening competitiveness would require wage moderation and faster and deeper
structural reforms. These points were not new to CNB officials and in line with their
thinking.
21.
The CNB remained concerned about high credit growth, having responded with
a series of prudential measures over the past year. The measures include: first, raising the
MRR to 55 percent effective early 2006, and closing MRR loopholes to prevent banks
borrowing abroad via local nonbank intermediaries; second, increasing risk weights on
unhedged foreign-currency denominated and indexed loans; third, introducing quarterly
reporting requirements for such loans; fourth, issuing new guidelines to banks on managing
household and currency-induced credit risk, including a 75 percent loan-to-value ratio for
mortgage loans and—when the new credit bureau begins operations shortly—higher risk
weights for loans not checked against the credit bureau; and finally, phased in over October
2006–March 2007, a broadening of the base of the foreign-exchange liquidity requirement to
cover instruments indexed or denominated in foreign currency. The MRR measure in
particular has targeted the build-up in banks’ external debt that has funded much of the credit
expansion.
22.
While clearer information on banks’ lending plans for 2007 is pending, emerging
evidence suggests the CNB’s measures may have started to have an impact. During the
mission’s discussions, banks appeared to be changing behavior by scaling back foreign
borrowing plans, instead financing their activities through retained earnings and intensifying
efforts to attract domestic deposits. Staff therefore recommended the CNB adopt a wait-andsee approach, but consider further prudential measures (e.g., tightening loan eligibility
requirements) if rapid credit growth went unabated. As in the past, staff argued against credit
controls, which would likely be ineffective and push credit outside domestic banks. In late
2006, banks’ foreign borrowing increased again, but reportedly to comply with the
broadening of the foreign-exchange liquidity requirement. The ongoing adjustment to the
broadened requirement complicates a near-term assessment of whether the CNB measures
are having their desired effect.
23.
Major progress has been made in improving nonbank financial sector
supervision. The unified nonbank supervisor (HANFA) began operations in January 2006
and was cooperating increasingly closely with the CNB, concluding a memorandum of
understanding in September 2006. The new leasing act, which parliament approved in

16
December 2006, clarifies HANFA’s oversight of leasing companies and prevents these
companies from extending new non-leasing credits. The authorities saw the legislation
closing gaps both in supervisory coverage and in the CNB’s reserve requirements. Other
legislation is planned to gradually raise the limits on foreign investment and broaden the
scope of equity investment by pension funds; the tight existing limits have channeled strong
institutional demand for equity assets into a still-thin local capital market, contributing to the
recent sharp increase in local stock prices.
24.
The authorities have implemented most recommendations of the original 2002
FSAP, and are addressing remaining concerns (Table 8). Nevertheless, in light of the
potential rise in financial sector vulnerabilities, they saw merits to an FSAP update. It could
take place later in 2007, complementing an upcoming European Commission/World Bank
joint review of the financial sector.
C. Structural Issues
25.
A broad range of public and private sector representatives viewed the business
environment and bureaucratic obstacles as the main constraint on economic growth.9
The main impediments to doing business were the administrative burden, notably at the local
level; high, numerous, and nontransparent local fees; and property-related legal uncertainties,
specifically land ownership issues and enforcement of property rights. Important steps have
already been taken at the central government level to simplify procedures, for example the
“one-stop shop” to establish a business; “entrepreneurial zones” with good infrastructure and
land free of ownership uncertainty; and the initiation of a “regulatory guillotine” to eliminate
unnecessary regulations. The government was also trying to estimate the total tax burden on
companies, including the numerous (and nontransparent) local government fees, with a view
to eliminating uncertainty in this area. Various sources saw complex local government
regulations as conductive to corruption. Central government authorities had little power to
intervene at the local level but noted the importance of the fight against corruption both in its
own right and as part of the EU accession process. Despite recent efforts to clear a judicial
backlog, bankruptcy and contract enforcement procedures remain very slow. Survey
evidence also suggests that, despite some relaxation in 2003, strict employment protection
legislation remains a disincentive to new job creation.
26.
The authorities voiced their determination to move forward with their longstanding reform agenda for remaining state-owned enterprises. The privatization process
and plans to restructure loss-making sectors—notably shipyards and steel—have been
plagued by delays.

9

Staff reaches the same conclusion in the selected issues paper on potential growth.

17
•
The two largest transactions envisaged in the 2004 program were the sale of shares in
INA (the national oil company) and HT (the telecom company) by end-2005. In the event,
the government launched an initial public offering for INA shares in late 2006; and approved
the model for an initial public offering for HT, now planned for 2007.
•
Privatization of smaller companies in the portfolio of the Croatian Privatization Fund
(HFP) also fell behind schedule—the 2004 program envisaged the sale of all of HFP’s
holdings by end-June 2005—partly because a series of ownership disputes. Complicated
tender procedures have also slowed transactions. On the basis of a new privatization law (see
below), the authorities now intend to complete the sale of most remaining shares in the HFP
portfolio—excluding shipyards—by end-2007.
•
Some officials saw the shipyards as the greatest near-term fiscal risk, because large
losses in the sector might need to be covered by the state via government guarantees. A
national restructuring plan to make the sector commercially viable—originally envisaged for
end-2005—has yet to be finalized. But the need to comply with EU state aid rules has made
its finalization increasingly urgent. The shipyards faced difficulties in the summer of 2006
when banks refused to lend to them even with government guarantees, because of concerns
that the guarantees would contravene the State Aid Law (harmonized with EU state aid rules)
without the restructuring plan in place. The government arranged a six-month reprieve with a
“one-time, last-time” rescue package consistent with EU rules and now intends to finalize the
long-awaited restructuring plan before the rescue package expires in March 2007.
•
The authorities expected to complete the privatizations of the two large steel
companies by end-2006. Turning to remaining state-owned financial institutions, the
authorities’ previous intention was to privatize the insurance company (CO) following a
merger with the Postal Bank (HPB). However, it now appears these institutions will share
capital but remain distinct legal entities, complicating the privatization plans.
27.
Staff expressed strong reservations on aspects of the draft privatization law still
under discussion with social partners. The draft law contains some welcome provisions to
simplify privatization procedures without loss of transparency. However, it would also allow
new privatization models including employee-management buyouts under an employee stock
ownership program (ESOP). The government considered the ESOP essential for securing
consensus for privatization and proposed an ESOP stake of up to 25 percent in enterprises
being privatized, at a large discount.10 Social partners have argued for even higher ESOP
stakes. Staff was concerned that an ESOP component as large as proposed would risk
deterring potential strategic investors and entrench insider control of enterprises, thereby
worsening corporate governance problems and limiting the possibility for new investment.

10

Subsequently, this has been restricted to profitable enterprises.

18
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Croatia’s macroeconomic performance has been broadly favorable and policies
have improved in recent years. Growth has been solid and inflation contained. The
authorities, since 2004, have put the fiscal deficit on a downward path, improved
transparency and budgeting processes, including by bringing a medium-term perspective to
fiscal policy, curtailed quasi-fiscal activities, and brought the pension and health care systems
closer to sustainability. Financial supervision both for banks and nonbanks has been
strengthened. Looking ahead, progress in the EU accession process has boosted investment
prospects and, absent negative shocks and policy slippages, growth over the medium term
should remain solid with inflation in check.
29.
Still, to boost potential growth and to continue addressing Croatia’s stillsignificant vulnerabilities, the reform process must be stepped up. If Croatia fails to carry
out further and significant fiscal consolidation and faster and deeper structural reforms, it
cannot expect to significantly increase overall productivity and potential growth, reduce
vulnerabilities associated with the high levels of the current account deficit and external debt,
and speed up income convergence to western European levels.
30.
This means ongoing fiscal consolidation that is more ambitious than in the
authorities’ medium-term plans. Achieving the more ambitious fiscal targets recommended
by staff—in particular an expenditure-led reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2 percent of GDP
in 2008 and 1½ percent of GDP by 2009—is important to address a large current account
deficit, ensure a sustainable debt path, and boost economic growth by reducing the burden of
the large government. Even then, fiscal consolidation would need to continue, with a view to
positioning Croatia to make the most of the opportunities provided by EU accession and
minimizing vulnerabilities in the run-up to euro adoption.
31.
While there have been indications of support from the authorities for more
ambitious fiscal targets, resisting spending pressures now is key. Though a smaller deficit
target would have been preferable, the immediate task is to avoid additional unbudgeted
spending and ensure that the 2007 fiscal deficit is no larger than the authorities’ target of
2.8 percent of GDP. In this context, “off-budget” proposals to address spending demands
would be counterproductive, even if the headline deficit is now unaffected, by adding to
aggregate demand at a time when it is important to reduce the current account deficit, and by
diminishing fiscal transparency. These proposals could also widen the budget deficit on an
ESA 95 basis, which Croatia plans to adopt soon. Demands to reverse the parametric pension
benefit reform, if met, would have especially damaging long-term consequences.
Accommodating other spending pressures could also have serious medium-term implications
on the fiscal accounts and vulnerability, and on the credibility of Croatia’s strategy of
joining the EU as soon as possible and adopting the euro at the earliest opportunity.

19
32.
To be successful, the medium-term adjustment effort must focus on permanently
reducing expenditure. It is therefore important to get an early start to the technical
preparations for public expenditure reforms. Even if actions are unlikely before the 2007
elections, these preparations should begin before then. Key areas of focus are civil service
reform, better targeting of welfare, family, and health benefits, greater subsidy cuts, and
further progress in implementing health reform. In addition, HBOR’s activities need to be
consistent with fiscal policy goals, preferably by consolidating its activities within the
general government. The planned expansion of its lending and external borrowing would go
against government efforts to reduce public spending and foreign debt.
33.
The monetary policy framework remains suitable for Croatia, but needs support
from other policies. In particular, tightly managing the exchange rate is appropriate given
the high degree of euroization, the openness of the economy, and external competitiveness
that is adequate. But the constraints on monetary policy mean there are no quick fixes to
maintain and improve Croatia’s competitiveness. This underscores the importance of
structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness so Croatia can catch up with the top
performers in central and eastern Europe in terms of export growth. At the same time, fiscal
policy must address macroeconomic imbalances.
34.
The authorities recognize the structural measures needed to boost potential
growth, but strong and timely actions are required on several fronts and difficult
decisions therefore lie ahead. Perhaps the most difficult are for shipyards, for which
restructuring is necessary and overdue, likely involving cuts in capacity and employment.
More broadly, attracting strategic investors across different sectors of the economy is
essential, and privatization of remaining state-owned enterprises will be most successful with
new investment and know-how from outside investors with sufficient ownership stakes to
ensure good corporate governance and restructuring. Thus, the authorities should avoid
privatization tenders with overly restrictive employment and investment conditions that risk
deterring such investors. Until the privatization process can be accelerated, unrestructured
loss-making state-owned enterprises will continue to demand public resources that could be
used elsewhere more productively.
35.
The importance of significantly improving the business climate cannot be
emphasized enough. Indeed, the authorities’ strategy for growth rightly stresses the
importance of a business-friendly environment that safeguards market competition and
promotes private sector investment, letting entrepreneurs rather than government assess
which projects are most likely to be profitable. Notwithstanding recent progress, this,
however, still requires improvements in several areas, including reducing the administrative
burden, legal uncertainties, and corruption, which should help attract a much-needed increase
in greenfield FDI in coming years, as a critical ingredient for boosting exports and growth
while lessening vulnerabilities.

20
36.
Although the financial sector is healthy and much progress has been made in
improving its supervision, vulnerabilities remain. The CNB has been playing a critical
role in address vulnerabilities through its efforts to strengthen prudential regulation and
supervision. In addition, the banking system remains profitable and well capitalized. The
establishment and development of the independent nonbank supervisor HANFA over the past
year is also welcome, as is its increasingly close cooperation with the CNB and other
legislative changes to ensure comprehensive and seamless supervision of the financial sector.
However, the recent decline in the nonperforming loans ratio may reflect rapid credit growth
more than any significant improvement in asset quality. Moreover, the pace of credit growth
remains a concern, especially since the ratios of household debt and bank assets to GDP are
already high by regional standards. Careful monitoring is therefore required and, if credit
growth goes unabated, tighter prudential measures would be need to be considered and would
be preferable to distortionary administrative measures that could be readily circumvented. In
light of the potential for vulnerabilities to arise more generally, the authorities are encouraged
to formally request an FSAP update.
37.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Croatia will be on the
12-month cycle.

Gradual real exchange rate appreciation partly reflects a Balassa-Samuelson effect of 0.6–0.8 percent a
year. Cost and exchange rate-based competitiveness indicators vis-à-vis Croatia's closest competitors
appear adequate, with unit labor cost (ULC) essentially flat in 2000–05. Still, in 2006 market share
continued to ease modestly, while ULC picked up, and real appreciation pressures firmed somewhat.

related to structural reforms tended to have higher TFP growth (in Doyle, P., G Jiang, and L. Kuijs, Real

1/ In 2003, excludes debit entry of US$327.8 in the item “investment income” in the current account, and an offsetting credit entry in the item “FDI-reinvested earnings”
of the capital account related to the “distribution” and “reinvestment” of paper income from the revaluation of a patent by a Croatian company (see IMF Country Report
No. 03/358, Appendix IV).
2/ Errors and omissions are explicitly projected to reflect persistent unrecorded capital outflows.
3/ In 2005, the central bank revised the methodology for estimating external debt. The inclusion of hybrid and subordinated instruments, repos, late interest and interest
accruals has caused an upward revision of the historical series.

1/ Assets include gross loans, interbank loans, investment portfolio of banks, total interest income, total off-balance sheet claims.
2/ Liquid assets are on a net basis. They include deposits at banks and at the central bank, short-term government and central bank paper,
and overnight loans extended; less required reserve funds, central bank loans received, and overnight loans received. The sharp decline in
liquidity in 2005 coincides with the start of reverse repo operations by the CNB that gave banks market-based access to liquidity when needed.
3/ Commercial banks only. End-year FSIs, based on audited annual financial statements, can differ slightly from quarterly data.
4/ Includes kuna-denominated instruments linked to foreign currencies.
5/ Based on unconsolidated audited financial statements following IAS; not in line with the IMF FSI Compilation Guide.

Recommendations

Implementation
General

Explore the scope for exploiting synergy among nonbank
supervisory bodies.

Unified nonbank supervisor, HANFA,
established in 2006.

Make coordination more effective among the regulatory
bodies.

MoU signed between CNB and HANFA in
September 2006.

Pay greater attention to the monitoring of foreign exchangeinduced credit risk.

Supervisory guidelines recently adopted; risk
weights on unhedged foreign-exchange loans
increased.

Improve forecast accuracy of the government’s cash flows and
make coordination between the MoF and the CNB more
effective to enhance liquidity management of the CNB.

There is some but limited exchange of
information between the CNB and the MoF on
such forecasts.

Foster the development of a liquid and efficient interbank
market.

Interbank market still illiquid. The CNB started
open market operations for short-term liquidity
smoothing purposes through weekly reverse
repo operations. The bigger banks rely more
on these reverse repos than the interbank
market as the latter cannot meet the volume
of their requirements.

Develop the domestic long-term government securities market,
possibly in parallel with the introduction of the second pillar
pension reform.

One long-term kuna bond was issued at end2005.

Consider disclosing State Agency for Deposit Insurance and
Bank Rehabilitation (DAB's) externally audited financial
statements to the public.

Yet to be done.

Banking Supervision
Conduct supervision on consolidated accounts.

Consolidated supervision introduced in mid2003.

The calculation of the minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR)
should be based on not only credit risk, as is done currently
and is above the Basel recommendation and set at 10 percent
for all banks, but also on market and related risks.

Additional risks included in CAR calculation as
of January 2004; banks growing by more than
20 percent per year to form additional general
reserves.

Give supervisory staff explicit immunity from legal prosecution
for performing duties in good faith.

Addressed in the new banking law.

In the future, as country risk gains prominence, give it
appropriate attention.

CNB has assessed this risk to be negligible
since Croatian banks are not very active
abroad.

Improve supervisory cooperation: Due to the lack of legal
backup, agreements with foreign supervisory agencies have
not yet been established, and in practice, coordination with
other domestic supervisors appears to take place only on an
ad hoc basis.

MoUs with Bosnia & Herzegovina, Austria,
Italy, and Hungary and with HANFA signed
and published on the web.

Payments Systems

Introduce a fully collateralized intra-day liquidity facility for
Croatian Large Value System (HSVP), and suitable Delivery
versus Payment (DVP) for securities in real time.

Full collateralization not implemented; a
suitable form of DVP not resolved between
the CNB and the securities depository (SDA).

Strengthen back-up facilities, including secondary site
arrangements, of both the HSVP and the National Clearing
System (NKS) .

Secondary site arrangements implemented
for the NKS but not for the HSVP.

Improve governance of the NKS.

Implemented.

Improve CNB's organizational structure by clearly separating
oversight responsibilities from operational ones.

Responsibilities separated.

Publish a broader range of statistics on the payment system.

Implemented.

Transparency of Monetary and Financial Policies
Monetary policy
Regularly publish CNB’s views on macroeconomic outlook.

Implemented.

Publish CNB's monetary policy framework.

Partially done; the CNB website releases
summaries of discussions on monetary policy
instruments.

Issue explanatory press releases in conjunction with monetary
policy decisions.

Implemented.

Post schedule of Board meetings on the website.

Yet to be done.

Disclose internal operating procedures of the Internal Audit.

Yet to be done.

Financial policy
Clearly state the main objective(s) of banking supervision in
the Annual Report or a separate publication.

Yet to be done.

Publish the CNB's own assessment of banking sector
performance and developments.

Implemented.

Provide aggregate information on emergency liquidity
assistance, within confidentiality limits.

Yet to be done.

Publish the CNB's internal governance procedures and
Internal Audit Department procedures.

This will be put in place after the manuals and
procedures are updated for Basel II.

Payments system oversight
CNB should collect and publish data on the payments system
on a regular basis.

Implemented.

Accounting and Auditing
Close the “compliance gap” between practices and legislation;
substantial changes in the dissemination of audited financial
statements of companies are needed.

According to the new Accounting Act, various
financial sector supervisory authorities are
authorized to have their own regulations to
determine the form and contents of financial
reports, thus minimizing the “compliance gap.”

Safeguards Assessment:
An updated safeguards assessment of the CNB with respect to the recent
augmentation of the Stand-By Arrangement was finalized in August 2006. The
assessment determined that the CNB continues to maintain an effective system of
internal controls and that nearly all areas of the safeguards framework meet the

outstanding. The charges shown below are net charges and assessments by the SDR Department.

44
policy’s requirements, though the internal audit mechanism could be strengthened
further.
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian
dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna
on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and
demand in the interbank market, with the significant participation of the CNB. The
authorities’ exchange rate policy regarding the Croatian kuna is classified as
“managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate” and the float
has been tightly managed. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and
SDRs. On December 30, 2006, the official exchange rate was kuna 5.578401 per
U.S. dollar (middle rate).

IX.

Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

X.

Article IV Consultation and Recent Use of Fund Resources:
The previous Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on
August 4, 2004 (IMF Country Reports Nos. 04/251, 04/252 and 04/253). Executive
Directors commended Croatia’s strong economic performance but expressed
concern over the persistently wide current account deficit and external debt-toGDP ratio, which had over time increased Croatia’s external vulnerability
significantly. With the approval of the Stand-By Arrangement on August 4, 2004,
Croatia was automatically placed on the 24-month consultation cycle, subject to
the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 12794-(02/76),
adopted July 15, 2002).
On August 4, 2004, Executive Directors approved a 20-month Stand-By
Arrangement for an amount equivalent to SDR 97.00 million (26.6 percent of
quota). The authorities treated the arrangement as precautionary. The policy
program underlying the arrangement aimed at containing the current account
deficit and stabilizing external debt, mainly through fiscal adjustment. Directors
completed the first and second reviews under this Arrangement on
September 14, 2005 and March 29, 2006, respectively. In completing the second
review, Directors also augmented the arrangement by SDR 2 million and extended
it until November 15, 2006. The third and final review was completed on a lapseof-time basis on September 29, 2006.

45
On April 2, 2004, a previous 14-month Stand-By Arrangement for an amount
equivalent to SDR 105.88 million (29 percent of quota) expired. The authorities
treated the arrangement as precautionary. The first and second reviews were
completed on August 2, 2003 and November 12, 2003, respectively. Directors
commended the generally satisfactory observance of quantitative performance
criteria in the first nine months of 2003. However, they were concerned about the
deterioration of the external position. Because of the slippages in fiscal policy in
late 2003 caused mainly by a pre-election spending spree, the new government
decided to let the current SBA expire without completing the third and final review
but started negotiations for a new precautionary SBA.
XI.

FSAP:
An FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation
on August 5, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in April 2001 and
September 2001. The FSSA was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/180).

APPENDIX II. CROATIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though some
improvements would be desirable. While remedial action has been taken to improve data
coverage and reliability in most cases, progress in some instances has been impeded by
insufficient resources and issues regarding coordination among government agencies. Croatia
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996 and its
metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A. National Accounts
2.
The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices
and at constant (1997) prices for the main categories of expenditure and main industry
groupings. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between
expenditure-based and value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of
coordination between the CBS and CNB in reconciling tourism receipts estimates; (ii)
incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the self employed (farmers, trade and
crafts); (iii) inadequate data for measuring changes in inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage
of the informal sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data for the seasonally volatile agricultural
sector. Other shortcomings include: (i) inadequate conversion of government finance
statistics from a cash to an accrual basis; (ii) inadequate price deflators; and (iii) the late
publication of annual data, which show large differences with quarterly data.
B. Prices
3.
The CBS produces the monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a 2001 Household Budget Survey. In between
rebasing, the weights are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are
collected at different time periods in the month for different product groups but in all cases
between the 13th and the 21st day of each month. The indices are released around the 15th day
of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine Croatian towns, but the
weights are based on a sample of households in the whole country. A harmonized index of
consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat methodology, but is not
released for the time being to avoid confusion. A core CPI is also calculated based on a
methodology developed by the CNB. The CBS also releases a monthly producer price index
(PPI), usually on the 8th day of the following month. The weights of the PPI are based on
the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and are updated every five years; an update is due in
2007.

48
C. Wages and Employment
4.
Croatia produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and employment
by sector. Earnings data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are based on
monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each industrial
category. They do not cover a significant part of the working population, including persons
employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, farmers, and military and police workers.
5.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A
preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first
time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is
now being conducted on a regular basis with semi-annual results released after a delay of
about four months. The difference between the survey-based unemployment rate and that
based on the registered unemployed has recently been reduced.
D. Government Finance Statistics
6.
Government finance statistics (GFS), produced on a monthly basis with a lag of 30
days, are available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance or provided
directly to the Fund. Revenue data are reliable and available on request on a next-day basis
for most major categories for both the central budget and the budgetary funds. Expenditure
data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic and functional)
for the central budget and the budgetary funds. The data on central government financing in
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) reports, the monetary survey, and the balance of payments are
not reconciled, with substantial discrepancies partly due to different methodologies and
definitions of government used by the Ministry of Finance and the CNB. Following the
recommendations of the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force, comprising staff from the
MoF, CNB, and CBS was formed to reconcile central government financing data produced
by these institutions; after a slow start, meetings are now being held more regularly.
7.
The detailed data on domestic public bonds published in the Monthly Statistical
Review of the MoF are now augmented by a central government debt table in the CNB
Monthly Bulletin, which also reports stocks of central government guaranteed debt. The MoF
prepared a database with government guarantees in July 2003, which has been used to
monitor developments in the stock and flows of guarantees.
8.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are
only available on a quarterly basis and with a lag of 30 days. Local government data are
partial as they include the operations of the 53 largest municipalities. Annual cash data for
the central and local governments up to 2004 are published in the 2005 GFS Yearbook. In the
IFS only annual cash data to 2002 are published.

49
E. Monetary Data
9.
Compilation of monetary statistics published by the CNB is consistent with the
recommendations of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 (MFSM)
with only a few deviations. These deviations are (i) only central bank’s foreign-currency
denominated assets, liabilities, and central government deposits in kuna incorporate interest
accrued in the outstanding amount of the underlying financial asset or liability, but otherwise
accrued amounts are classified in other assets and liabilities; (ii) loss and other specific
provisions are classified in capital accounts rather than in other liabilities; (iii) financial
derivatives are included in other items net rather than classified by economic sector of
counterparty; and (iv) operating banks’ positions with the (non-operating) banks in
bankruptcy are classified as positions with nonfinancial enterprises rather than as positions
with other financial corporations. However, these deviations have been fully addressed in the
compilation of Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) (see below).
10.
Data on the monetary survey, including separate records for deposit money banks and
the balance sheet of the CNB, are published monthly with four- and two-week lags,
respectively. Key data, such as currency in circulation, reserve deposits, and international
reserves of the CNB are available with a one-day lag. The CNB is planning to extend its
statistical framework to balance sheet information of investment funds and insurance
companies. In March 2002, the CNB started collecting financial information (balance sheets
and investment structure) from investment and pension funds; the data are not yet published,
but used for internal purposes. However, the CNB’s Bulletin (no. 83) informed the public on
the other financial corporations’ development in the financial system and presented selected
aggregate data (e.g., net assets of investment and pension funds). According to the CNB, the
inclusion of other financial corporations in monetary statistics depends on the harmonization
process of the monetary statistics with the statistical reporting requirements of the European
Central Bank. In November 2006, the CNB reported monetary data in the format of SRFs for
December 2001 to the present. These data accord with the concepts and definitions in MFSM.
F. External Sector Statistics
11.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) and published by the CNB. Data
are generally available with a lag of two months and are subject to substantial revisions in
subsequent releases; trade data are available with a lag of one month and data on
international reserves are available the next day on request. Travel survey methodologies
were modified in 2002, 2004, and again in 2005, while the method for estimating the cost of
insurance and freight was modified in early 2004. The most recent modification of tourism
revenue contributed to an upward revision of the current account deficit for 2004 equivalent
to 0.7 percent of GDP. Net errors and omissions have ranged from 2½ to 4½ percent of GDP
since 2003, and are negative. The coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are
reasonably complete and accurate.

50
12.
A large part of external debt was contracted prior to the dissolution of the former
SFRY and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and London Club creditors in 1995
and 1998, respectively. The CNB compiles external debt data according to the requirements
of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users, 2003, and began disseminating
external debt data in the second quarter of 2003. The inclusion of hybrid and subordinated
debt instruments, repos, late interest, and interest accruals and arrears has caused an upward
adjustment in the external debt series compared to previously released data. Quarterly data on
the international investment position are available on the CNB website up to Q2 2006.

APPENDIX III. CROATIA: PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2004–06 STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT
The recent SBA, which expired in November 2006, effectively covered the entire period
since the previous Article IV consultation in August 2004. The main goal of the program was
to reduce external vulnerabilities by narrowing the domestic savings-investment gap and
stabilizing the external debt-to-GDP ratio. The main policy to achieve this goal was fiscal
consolidation; monetary policy continued to focus on maintaining exchange rate stability.
Macroeconomic policy implementation was good, while structural reforms moved ahead but
with delays in key areas.
●
The government implemented a fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment of 2.6 percentage
points of GDP in 2004–05 in the context of a new medium-term fiscal framework—a key
reform (structural performance criterion). The government targeted an additional
1.2 percentage points of fiscal and quasi-fiscal adjustment in 2006. It also improved fiscal
management and transparency by reducing contingent liabilities by 2 percentage points of
GDP in 2004–05, bringing all state aid to the railways on budget, and including the largest
extrabudgetary funds in the single treasury account.
●
In the financial sector, the CNB sought to deter banks’ foreign borrowing by
introducing a marginal reserve requirement (MRR), which has been successively increased
and its base broadened. To address foreign-currency-related credit risk, the CNB raised the
risk weight of loans in foreign currencies to unhedged borrowers. A new unified supervisory
authority for nonbank financial institutions started operating in 2006.
●
The structural reform agenda was broadened beyond that envisaged in the original
program, notably in pensions and health. The restructuring of the railway company and the
first stage of the health reform are underway. However, the restructuring and privatization
plan for the state-owned shipyards (large loss-makers) was repeatedly delayed.
●
Privatization was delayed by property disputes and resistance of vested interests.
Two large deals outstanding from 2005—the sale of share packages in the telecom (HT) and
the oil company (INA)—fell schedule because of ownership disputes over certain company
assets (HT) and a late start (INA). In September 2006, the authorities approved the
privatization models featuring initial public offerings (IPOs) for both deals. The IPO for INA
was launched in November 2006. The timing of the HT transaction remains uncertain but the
authorities now expect it to take place in 2007. After some delay, the authorities also issued
tenders for two steel companies and one aluminum plant.
•
Notwithstanding good macroeconomic policy performance, strong private borrowing
for portfolio purposes lifted the external debt-to-GDP ratio above program projections. The
original program sought to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at 76¾ percent in 2004; debt is

53
now projected to have reached 84 percent of GDP at end-2006. However, its pace of
accumulation slowed sharply in 2005–06.

APPENDIX IV. CROATIA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
I. Fiscal Sustainability
1.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt would gradually decline toward 38 percent
of GDP by 2012 from its peak at 44 percent in 2005, driven primarily by continued fiscal
consolidation and assisted by expected sizable privatization receipts in 2006 and 2007
(excluding the amounts earmarked for the “pensioners’ debt” repayments). Stress-testing
suggests that most foreseeable shocks leave public debt either declining or unchanged (Table
11, Figure 14). The one notable exception is scenario A1 (keeping key variables at their
historical averages), under which the debt ratio increases by 18 percentage points of GDP
between 2005 and 2012. This is because the historical primary deficit does not yet fully
account for the recent significant fiscal consolidation—a trend projected to continue in the
medium term—while the historical growth rate is unduly affected by a recession in 1999.
Assuming no policy change beyond 2006 (scenario A2), the debt ratio would stay roughly
constant over the forecast horizon, as it also would in the case of a large and sustained drop
in economic activity (scenario B2), a policy-induced widening of the primary deficit
(scenario B3), or a combined slowdown in growth with the concomitant rise in the primary
deficit plus an interest rate hike (scenario B4). Under the two one-time shocks (scenarios B5
and B6), the debt ratio resumes a downward trend following the initial shock. The inclusion
of the stock of state guarantees and arrears (about 10 percent of GDP) in the above analysis
would not materially change the described responses to shocks.
II. External Sustainability
2.
External debt rose quickly in recent years in Croatia—by over 20 percentage points of
GDP (in euro terms) between 2002 and 2005. The buildup was facilitated by good access to
international capital markets. But efforts at fiscal consolidation, a shift by the public sector
towards domestic financing, and measures by the central bank to discourage bank external
borrowing contributed to much smaller increases in 2005–06. In the baseline projection—
which incorporates a deterioration of external current account balance relative to GDP in
2006–07 followed by a gradual improvement in the outer years and continued restraint by the
public sector towards foreign borrowing—the debt-to-GDP ratio continues to hover between
84 and 85 percent in 2006–09 and then gradually declines to about 80–81 percent by 2012
(Table 12). Alternative scenarios demonstrate the sensitivity of external debt to several
factors, highlighting the need for vigilance in economic management to forestall an
unsustainable situation (Figure 15). In the scenario keeping key variables at their historical
averages, the external debt ratio rises slightly. In scenarios with lower growth or a worsening
of the current account, the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to around 88–89 percent. The small effect
of the interest rate shock partly reflects the low historical standard deviation of interest rates;
doubling the size of the interest rate shock would push the debt/GDP ratio above 86 percent.
A large real depreciation scenario has adverse effects, with the debt-to-GDP ratio possibly
averaging over 115 percent between 2007 and 2012.

APPENDIX V. CROATIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
The World Bank is assisting Croatia in its structural and institutional reforms, within
the context of the EU integration process. The Bank’s Board discussed the second Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Croatia on December 21, 2004. The main strategic objective
of the Croatian government, supported by the CAS, is successful integration into the EU.
2.
The proposed four-year base case lending volume is about US$1 billion, with an
additional US$0.5 billion under the high case. The proposed four-year low-case lending
volume is US$300 million. Three triggers will determine whether Croatia will enter and
sustain the base case: (a) satisfactory macroeconomic framework and fiscal consolidation;
(b) implementing policies and improving governance for more competitive business
environment; and (c) improving targeting, sustainability, quality and efficiency of social
services.
3.
The backbone of World Bank assistance to Croatia (up to US$550 million or
37 percent) is a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans (PALs). The other 63 percent is
split between investment loans and sector wide approach (SWAp) type of loans
supplementing the PALs. The investment loans address institutional capacity problems; work
in concert with the PALs in mitigating the effects reforms may have on vulnerable groups;
and assist Croatia in addressing significant environmental challenges of the accession
process. SWAps will address sector reforms related to the process of EU integration for the
infrastructure and energy sectors, and Croatia’s competitiveness through the reform of the
education and health sectors.
4.
The Bank Board approved the first out of three PALs in September 2005. PAL 1
amounts to EUR 150 million. The PAL has three major components: (i) strengthening
governance through public administration reform and strengthening of public expenditure
management; (ii) improving the investment climate through judicial reform, privatization,
continued reduction of barriers to entry of new firms, and continued reduction of state
subsidies; and (iii) strengthening financial sustainability of sectoral spending through health
reform, social benefits streamlining, railways restructuring, and improvement of the fiscal
and social sustainability of the pension system. The pre-appraisal mission for PAL 2 was
conducted in November and December 2005. The appraisal mission and negotiations are
scheduled for January 2007, which could allow the proposed PAL 2 to be presented to the
Board in March 2007.
5.
The current amount of committed funds to Croatia stands at US$1.7 billion for
34 IBRD and GEF projects. Currently, the Bank’s active portfolio in Croatia comprises
14 IBRD and three GEF projects. Thus far in FY06, four IBRD investment loans have been
approved: Science and Technology (EUR 31 million), PAL 1 (EUR 150 million), Education
SWAp (EUR 67.8 million), and Agricultural Acquis Cohesion (EUR 25.5 million).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 16, 2007
1.
This statement reports on recent developments and adds to the information contained
in the Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation. It does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
On data, real GDP increased by 4.7 percent (year-on-year) in the third quarter of 2006
and year-average inflation was 3.2 percent for 2006, both consistent with the macroeconomic
projections presented in the Staff Report. In addition, December foreign trade data and
November fiscal data were broadly in line with the projections. Bank credit to households
and enterprises increased by 23 percent in the year to December 2006, while external debt
reached 86 percent of GDP at end-2006, somewhat higher than projected in the Staff Report.
3.
In response to developments in credit and external debt, the Croatian National Bank
(CNB) implemented at the start of 2007 an administrative measure to slow credit growth by
banks. Banks with credit growth exceeding a ceiling of 12 percent in 2007, calculated on a
cumulative monthly basis, will be required to purchase low-yielding (0.75 percent on current
policies), 360-day CNB bills in an amount equal to 50 percent of the credit extended above
the ceiling. As discussed in the Staff Report, staff had expressed a preference for tighter
prudential measures if rapid credit growth went unabated.
4.
The government has introduced to parliament legislation to extend “pensioners’ debt”
repayments (described in IMF Country Report No. 06/128) to an additional 44,000
beneficiaries, who receive special and family pensions. The authorities estimate the amount
necessary to cover the payments to these additional beneficiaries at around 0.5 percent of
GDP, on top of planned pensioners’ debt payments of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2007. The
authorities treat pensioners’ debt payments as outside the budget, pending a Eurostat
decision. In any case, the planned additional payments would add to aggregate demand
pressures in a situation of a high current account deficit and rising external debt.
5.
The Staff Report noted (¶26) the government’s intention to finalize by March 2007 its
long-awaited restructuring plan for the shipyards, to comply with European Union state aid
rules. On February 1, the government forwarded its draft plan to the European Commission.
Staff has not seen details of the plan.

Statement by Yuriy G. Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director for Republic of Croatia
and Charalambos Christofides, Advisor to Executive Director
February 16, 2007

Introduction
The authorities welcome the thorough staff analysis and mostly agree with the staff’s
recommendations. This is the first Article IV consultation to take place following the
successful conclusion of the Stand-By Arrangement last November, and it provides a good
opportunity to focus on economic issues from a longer-term and analytical perspective rather
than from a program perspective. The authorities value their close cooperation with the Fund,
and consider that the consultation process has worked well and has focused on topics of
importance to the Croatian economy.
The authorities strongly emphasize maintaining the good macroeconomic
performance of recent years and further invigorating structural reform. The prospect of EU
accession continues to act as an important anchor, providing one impetus for further progress
in these areas. The negotiations with the EU have been gaining momentum after the process
of screening of Croatian legislation by the European Commission was finalized. A key
objective is to keep macroeconomic stability and to maintain progress on per-capita incomes
and hence promote convergence with the EU, by continuing to attract FDI and developing
key growth sectors while restructuring lagging ones.
Economic performance and outlook
From a longer-term perspective, the Croatian economy continued to exhibit solid
growth, averaging 4 ¾ percent over the past five years, propelled by private consumption and
investment. Unemployment has continued to decline to levels not seen for many years, while
inflation has remained well contained despite rising energy and commodity costs. Savings
have been healthy, aided by improving government savings, which helped maintain a rising
investment share in the economy. FDI has correspondingly also been strong.
The current account deficit has widened although, as the staff points out,
competitiveness was adequate and wage growth moderate. Goods exports have grown,
gaining rather than losing market share relative to that of a few years ago. Tourism has also
been strong, with Croatia viewed as an attractive destination possessing great natural beauty.
Imports have, however, also been rising, partly driven by higher energy prices and partly by
rapid credit growth in response to the availability of cheap foreign loans.
Looking forward, prospects for growth remain good, with perhaps a temporary
acceleration in domestic demand as the spending effect of the settlement of the “pensioners
debt” works itself through. Over the medium term, potential growth is likely to continue to
improve somewhat, reaching perhaps 5 percent, given continuing strong investment, but also

2
assuming that restructuring takes place and that reform results in an improving business
environment. Following EU accession, FDI could rise and the convergence process could
accelerate even further, allowing for an additional pickup in potential growth.
Monetary policy and external vulnerability
The Croatian National Bank (CNB) continued to achieve low inflation, maintaining
its strong track record in this regard during 2006. Core inflation declined from 3.0 percent in
December, 2005 to 2.3 percent in December, 2006, while headline inflation, aided by
declining oil and food prices, fell more strongly—dropping to 2.0 percent from 3.6 percent
over the same period. The CNB kept its focus on mitigating vulnerabilities by maintaining
exchange rate stability while standing ready to take steps to address the risks associated with
bank foreign borrowing and rapid credit growth. This readiness was already expressed to the
Board on a number of occasions, including in our Buff statement of March 23, 2006 and in
the Annex to the government’s Letter of Intent for the 3rd Review of the Stand-By
Arrangement in October, 2006.
It should be said at the outset that external vulnerability remains manageable, with
higher external debt on the one hand counterbalanced by higher gross official reserves, strong
market access, and a healthy financial sector (which is in any event 90 percent foreign
owned) on the other. However, the CNB remained concerned with the possible
macroeconomic implications of persistently high and increasing credit growth and a rising
current account deficit in an environment of already high—in relation to neighbors—external
debt-to-GDP and credit ratios. Another consideration was that fiscal policy for 2007 is
already set from the legislative point of view. Finally, the CNB observed that the set of
measures (that is, all such measures falling within the CNB’s competence, well-described in
paragraph 21 of the Staff Report) taken in an attempt to arrest high credit growth and already
implemented during 2006 were not sufficient enough to achieve the expected result.
Indeed, credit growth accelerated in the last month of 2006, reaching 22.9 percent in
December 2006 (y/y), driven by increased foreign borrowing by commercial banks. During
just the last quarter of 2006, banks increased their external debt by almost 11 percent (an
additional €1.3 bn), with the bulk of it used to fuel new credits; according to CNB estimates,
banks needed only some €150 million of additional borrowing to comply with the broadening
of the foreign-exchange liquidity requirement mandated to occur by year-end. This in turn
caused the total external debt-to-GDP ratio to increase to 86.1 percent at end-2006 from 82.5
percent at end-2005, and the current account deficit to deteriorate further to 8.1 percent of
GDP in 2006.
In view of the above considerations, CNB responded with enacting a temporary credit
control measure in December, 2006, described in the Staff Statement. The prudential
measures already taken, while possibly still having a lagged effect, and while no doubt
helping to maintain the quality of new credits, do not necessarily curb credit growth. Further,

3
the CNB has no doubt that an important step to improving the external balance is to slow
down credit growth. That being said, the CNB is fully aware of the partial effectiveness of
the credit control measure, i.e., that it cannot entirely solve the underlying problem of
increasing external imbalances, but it considers that the measure adds to the overall efforts,
and that it serves as an important signaling function.
Fiscal policy
The authorities have implemented a successful policy of fiscal consolidation over the
past few years, in agreement also with staff in the context of the successfully completed
Stand-By Arrangement. The overall general government deficit has declined from 6.2
percent of GDP in 2003, to roughly 3 percent by 2006 as estimated on a preliminary basis.
Even during 2006, a better-than-expected revenue performance was mostly absorbed into a
better-than-programmed fiscal balance, with the expenditure side continuing to experience
contraction as a ratio to GDP. A supplementary budget was implemented to help achieve this
result. A series of measures contributed to this outturn, including pension reform, wage
moderation, and investment cuts. The changes in the pension formula (already enacted),
should continue to produce fiscal benefits through the medium term. The staff’s calculations
indicate only a moderate role for automatic stabilizers. In the context also of the Stand-By
Arrangement, the deficits of the Development Bank were scaled down.
The authorities plan further medium-term fiscal consolidation, taking account of the
impact of necessary structural reforms, projected growth, development requirements as
expressed in the Strategic Development Framework , and Croatia’s aspirations for EU
accession and eventual ERM-2 entry.
The planned improvements do consider that there will be continuing success in
structural reforms. These include not only the pension reform already mentioned, but also a
plan to continue reducing subsidies gradually, and significant reforms in the health sector
(these were described in more detail in our last Buff statement as they formed an important
part of the Stand-By Arrangement). Finally, the staff’s debt-sustainability analysis shows
contained and further declining levels of the public debt-to-GDP ratio, while the bound tests
generally show that the public debt ratio is robust to a number of possible shocks.
Structural reform and the financial sector
A number of reforms were already mentioned when considering the government’s
medium-term fiscal plan. Other notable areas include plans for shipbuilding, steel, and
railways restructuring, as well as privatization. On privatization, the government is
considering a plan to cancel part of the debt of 200 enterprises on a case-by-case basis and
only in the context of their privatization to improve their balance sheets and make them more
attractive privatization candidates. It will also exempt potential investors from a requirement
to buy all outstanding shares. A block of 15 percent of shares in the national oil company
(INA) has already been sold to private investors (both foreign and domestic). The sale was

4
very successful, and the share price (the company was jointly listed with the London Stock
Exchange) has shown a strong tendency to rise. A tender for an advisor to the sale of 49
percent of the telecom company has already been launched. Additional ideas and a possible
amendment to the Privatization Act are also being considered, all with a view to
strengthening privatization (i.e., shortening the time needed for the privatization process, and
making the procedures less complicated and more efficient).
On the financial sector, the independent non-bank supervisor (HANFA) has been
operating now for about one year. It has done a number of audits of transactions involving
brokerages. The leasing law was approved by parliament in December, 2006, which is a
welcome development. Finally, the authorities expect an updated FSAP exercise to be
conducted in a coordinated manner with the European Commission’s “Peer Review” exercise
later in the year.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Croatia
On February 16, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Croatia.1
Background
Croatia has experienced solid growth and low inflation in recent years, with GDP growth
averaging around 4¾ percent in 2001–06 and headline inflation contained to 2–4 percent. But
domestic demand pressures and higher international energy prices caused the current account
deficit to widen in 2005–06.
Although external competitiveness appears adequate, export growth has been significantly
below the average in Croatia’s peer countries, which have been more successful in attracting
greenfield foreign direct investment. Survey measures of competitiveness underscore structural
weaknesses in the business environment.
Policies in 2004–06, supported by a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement, sought to mitigate
external vulnerabilities by lowering Croatia’s current account deficit and stabilizing the external
debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities largely relied on fiscal adjustment, accompanied by
measures by the Croatian National Bank (CNB) to safeguard financial sector stability and
discourage external debt accumulation by banks. Reform of pension indexation, wage

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
moderation, and investment cuts contributed to a reduction in the fiscal deficit from 6.1 percent
of GDP in 2003 to an estimated 2.8 percent in 2006. However, despite these countervailing
policy efforts, gross external debt and the current account deficit remain high.
While bank restructuring and privatization have strengthened the financial sector, strong credit
expansion and foreign exchange-induced credit risk have raised concerns. Large foreign banks
own over 90 percent of the system, which is well developed by regional standards. Financial
soundness indicators show adequate capitalization and asset quality. But intense competition
among banks and easy access to credit from foreign parents has contributed to a vigorous
credit expansion that gained momentum over 2005–06. The pace of the ongoing credit
expansion increases the potential for asset quality to deteriorate in the event of a downturn.
Moreover, most households also seem exposed to currency risk: the bulk of long-term bank
loans to households are linked to foreign currencies; and, even though households’ foreigncurrency deposits are sizeable in the aggregate, borrowers and savers may only partly overlap.
Concerned about safeguarding financial stability, the CNB responded with a series of measures
to slow the bank-related portion of capital inflows: a progressive increase in its marginal reserve
requirement on banks’ foreign borrowing, broadening its base, and issuing various prudential
measures and guidelines.
The large role of the state, slow progress in key structural reforms, and less-than-satisfactory
conditions for doing business have constrained economic performance. While recent progress
in some transition indicators has been significant, privatization and reform of state-owned
enterprises has lagged because of legal disputes, resistance of vested interests, onerous
investment and employment conditions, and a legal framework favoring insiders—a bias that
the pending draft privatization law could worsen. In addition, conditions for doing business are
hampered by the heavy administrative burden and difficulties enforcing property rights, with
many problems at the local level.
The consultation focused on the interrelated issues of how to raise economic growth in Croatia
and addressing vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Croatia’s recent economic growth has been solid and inflation contained, and its progress with
the EU accession process has boosted investment prospects. However, the high external debtto-GDP ratio, the increase in short-term external debt, and the widening current account deficit
are sources of concern. Directors welcomed the improvements in policies in recent years, but
noted that continued efforts will be needed to address significant external vulnerabilities. They
stressed the importance of faster and deeper structural reforms if Croatia is to boost potential
growth. Progress in these areas should be high on the agenda of the next government.
To address external vulnerabilities and reduce the burden of the large government on economic
growth, Directors recommended more ambitious fiscal consolidation than the authorities’
medium-term plans currently envisage. In this connection, it will be essential to resist spending
pressures in the run-up to elections in late 2007—including through off-budget proposals to

3
address spending demands—and to ensure a fiscal deficit in 2007 no larger than the budget
target. Measures are also needed to reduce public expenditure permanently, with a view to
providing room for cutting taxes, including social security contributions, in order to boost growth
while lowering the budget deficit. Action on the fiscal front will also help narrow the large current
account deficit and ensure a sustainable debt path. With Croatia’s expenditure-to-GDP ratio well
above that of peers, Directors saw considerable scope for savings, and encouraged the next
government to make significant progress in this area.
Directors agreed that the present monetary framework remains appropriate for Croatia. Given
the high degree of euroization, the openness of the economy, and adequate external
competitiveness, they supported the tightly managed exchange rate. At the same time, noting
the constraints this places on monetary policy, Directors emphasized the importance of other
supporting policies, including structural reforms, to strengthen competitiveness; fiscal
consolidation, to redress macroeconomic imbalances; and strong financial sector supervision, to
address possible balance-sheet currency and maturity mismatches.
Directors welcomed the progress achieved by the authorities in improving financial sector
supervision and regulation. They commended the Croatian National Bank’s efforts over the past
few years to strengthen the prudential regulation of banks—which remain profitable and well
capitalized—as well as the recent establishment and development of the independent nonbank
supervisor. Directors shared the authorities’ concerns about the prudential and macroeconomic
risks of the ongoing rapid growth in bank credit. They commended the Croatian National Bank
for standing ready to address risks associated with bank foreign borrowing and rapid credit
growth. They nevertheless expressed reservations about the recent reintroduction of direct
credit controls, whose impact, including undesirable side-effects, will need to be monitored
closely. Directors encouraged the authorities to consider tighter prudential measures that would
also raise credit quality and reduce vulnerabilities.
Directors called for significant improvements in the business environment. Reducing the
administrative burden, legal uncertainties, and corruption will be critical in the coming years for
attracting a much-needed increase in greenfield foreign direct investment required to boost
exports and economic growth while lessening vulnerabilities. Noting the slow pace of recent
structural reforms, Directors stressed the urgency of restructuring the loss-making shipyards,
reforming the remaining public enterprises, and removing impediments to privatization.
