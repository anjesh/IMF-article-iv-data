LIBERIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Liberia
Approved by Menachem Katz and Matthew Fisher
April 4, 2005
•

A staff team held the discussions for the Article IV consultation with the Liberian
authorities in Accra during February 16-26, 2005. The Liberian delegation included
Finance Minister Kamara, Central Bank Governor Greene, and other senior officials.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. Schwidrowski (head), Mr. Honda, Ms. Schumacher (all
AFR), Mr. Mitchell (PDR), and Mr. Tharkur (FIN). The team worked closely with the
World Bank and parallel technical assistance missions from MFD and FAD.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded in March 2003. In the event, a
protracted lack of cooperation on policies and arrears clearance led to the suspension
of Liberia’s voting and related rights in the Fund.1

•

In the context of reviews of Liberia’s overdue obligations, two reports were submitted
to the Executive Board in March and October 2004 on postconflict economic
conditions and the economic program for 2004/05.2

•

Liberia maintains an exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on payments for
current and capital transfers. The authorities have not indicated any immediate plans
to accept the obligations of Article VIII.

•

The quality of data hampers effective surveillance. Efforts are under way to rebuild a
core statistical database.

•

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Following a sharp conflict-related economic contraction in 2003, activity is
rebounding, largely as a result of donor-related activities. The recovery is
expected to be maintained in 2005 as reconstruction continues and rural activities
resume (following an improved security situation).

•

Liberia faces daunting reconstruction challenges. The authorities agree that deep
reforms are needed to achieve sustainable growth. Particular attention is required to
strengthen economic governance and reestablish a transparent budget process.

•

New governance problems have emerged that need to be addressed promptly.
The authorities are working toward their resolution.

•

After initial success in implementing a balanced budget, financial management
has weakened. A domestically funded cash deficit was rolled back quickly, but large
arrears have emerged more recently.

•

The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) has strengthened its financial position and
developed a framework for monetary operations and bank restructuring. The
CBL has also resumed efforts to rebuild some key economic statistics. The licensing
of new banks is a concern in the current fragile financial environment.

•

The authorities recognize the need for corrective action to strengthen
governance and fiscal management. They are encouraged to develop expeditiously
specific measures in these areas.

•

A concrete action plan is also required to support the authorities’ wish for
enhanced support from the Fund (in terms of policy advice and technical
assistance) during the period leading up to elections and a new government
(end-2005). Such a plan would also help establish a track record for a staff-monitored
program (and possible beginning of deescalating the Fund’s remedial measures
against Liberia).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on Liberia’s medium-term
economic outlook and policies that would enable the country to move from the current
precarious postconflict situation to sustained and high-quality growth; recent economic
developments and the outlook for 2005; and a review of economic policies being
implemented and planned for the remainder of the National Transitional Government of
Liberia’s (NTGL) term (end-2005).
2.
Liberia’s relations with the Fund had been deteriorating until the NTGL took
office (October 2003).1 During the 2002 Article IV consultations and review of Liberia’s
overdue financial obligations to the Fund (March 2003), the Executive Board stressed a
number of factors that highlighted the deterioration of policies and the lack of response to
Fund advice, which, in the event, led to the suspension of Liberia’s voting and related rights
in the Fund. Specifically, Directors expressed concern about weak revenue performance, the
lack of fiscal transparency and accountability, and poor expenditure controls, which had
resulted in large arrears and a lack of social services. Substantial governance issues needed to
be addressed, and Directors called for full financial audits of maritime, timber and petroleum
operations. Critical structural reforms, particularly in the petroleum and rice sectors, were
also required.
3.
Since the NTGL took office, cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments
has strengthened, but the momentum of reforms has recently slackened. 2 During the
October 2004 review of Liberia’s overdue obligations, Directors commended the authorities
for the successful implementation of the basic economic program for the first half of 2004
and steps taken to strengthen the budget process, governance, and the operating framework
for the CBL. However, they stressed that the recent slippages in the budget and the financial
management of the CBL represented a setback to the authorities’ reform agenda.3 Directors
urged the authorities to undertake corrective measures and to ensure the full and timely
implementation of understandings reached with the staff. Directors expressed willingness to
consider the initiation of de-escalating the Fund’s remedial measures against Liberia once
1

Liberia has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since 1984. A declaration of noncooperation was issued in 1986, and the country’s voting and related rights were suspended
in March 2003 because of a protracted lack of cooperation. At end-February 2005, Liberia’s
arrears to the Fund amounted to SDR 511 million, or 716 percent of quota. Liberia’s
forthcoming annual obligations are estimated at about SDR 8 million.

3

The authorities have made monthly token payments of US$50,000 since January 2004.

Fiscal deficits emerged around mid-2004, equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP, and the
planned increases of the CBL’s operating expenses for 2005 would have led to a deficit of
US$2 million, compared with official reserves of US$4 million (December 2004).

-5-

steps to reverse recent policy slippages were implemented, and understandings on an SMP
for 2005 were reached.
II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Background
4.
Political and economic developments in 2003-04 were marked by an intensification of internal hostilities, followed by the introduction of a power-sharing transitional government and the resumption of external assistance. Fighting that extended to
Monrovia in mid-2003 led to widespread destruction and looting, including of government
facilities. About one-third of the population is still estimated to be internally displaced.
5.
The NTGL’s mandate is to prepare the country for elections in October 2005
and to rebuild some capacity for economic management. Government positions were
assigned to the warring factions based on a power-sharing formula. The United Nations
Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has deployed 15,000 peacekeepers, with a view to
reestablishing security throughout the country. About 105,000 combatants were demobilized
by end-October 2004, but only about 25,000 weapons were collected.
6.
UN economic sanctions, also covering timber exports since mid-2003, were
extended for one year at end-2004. Proceeds from timber exports had been found to finance
the internal conflict. Despite the end of hostilities, the UN Security Council decided to keep
the sanctions in place, owing to little progress in conducting an independent concessions
review; establishing transparency in revenue collection; and exercising effective oversight
over the sector.
7.
Donor disbursements have been slow, partly reflecting low confidence in
Liberian institutions. Although a large part of the US$520 million pledged in early 2004
has been set aside (including into escrow accounts), actual disbursements are believed to be
significantly lower.4
8.
Poverty, already pervasive prior to the last round of hostilities, remains
extensive, particularly as rural activities have not yet fully resumed. The most recent
household survey, conducted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in
August 2000, indicated that 76 percent of the population was living on less than US$1 a day.5
In 2002, about one-third of the population suffered from tuberculosis, and about one-fourth
of infants died before reaching the age of 5. External partners have begun to analyze the
causes of Liberia’s deep-seated poverty and associated internal conflicts (Box 1).

Data on disbursements, informally collected by UNDP, are incomplete and often
misclassified.

Box 1. Liberia—A Postconflict Social Assessment1
A deep-rooted crisis of rural communities and institutions lies at the heart of Liberia’s intermittent civil
wars and hampers effective reintegration of ex-combatants and the attainment of sustainable peace. For
decades, rural communities have been dominated by powerful patrons who offer protection and grant rights
(including access to land) on a personal basis. Large numbers of young men have been forced to work for these
patrons to gain access to land and gather the financial resources traditionally required to marry (dowries). In
response, increasing numbers joined warring factions, and, since demobilization, are reluctant to return to their
communities.
The government needs to work with external partners to address the causes of this crisis. A reform of
marriage law (2003) has already prohibited practices such as dowries and compulsory labor by wives. Further
fundamental steps are needed to provide access to land to demobilized combatants and to extend the rule of law.
Immediate steps include the provision of land grants, promotion of small-scale farming, and vocational training.
Community-driven development is designed to help transform Liberia’s rural communities. However,
such activities need to avoid reestablishing vested interests. Therefore, the effective involvement of
marginalized groups, and extension of justice and rights, will be essential. The community-based approach will
need to be closely coordinated with reforms at the national level.

B. Recent Economic Developments
9.
Economic developments in 2003-04 closely mirrored political events. Real GDP in
2003 is estimated to have dropped by 31 percent, reflecting a steep decline in the second half
of the year on account of the hostilities and the imposition of the UN ban on timber exports
(Table 1). Activity rebounded in 2004, driven by external support, reconstruction, and a
strong recovery in rubber production.6 Overall, economic activity in 2004 is estimated to
have returned to about 70 percent of the prewar level.

6

GDP is estimated to have declined by 50 percent in the second half of 2003, compared to
the first half of the year. The economy recovered by about 35 percent in the first half of 2004,
compared to the second half of 2003 and a further 25 percent in the second half of 2004,
vis-à-vis the first half. These estimates are based on available indicators of economic activity,
such as revenue collections and donor imports.

Price and exchange rate
volatility subsided with the end of
hostilities. Prices, particularly of
food items, have stabilized as supply
constraints have eased; the
exchange rate has returned to
preconflict levels, reflecting a return
of private capital, donor inflows,
and an increase in the demand for
local currency. Official reserves
have increased modestly from low

11.
External developments were characterized by a widening of the trade deficit that
was largely financed by external assistance (Table 2). Exports collapsed in 2003 but
stabilized in 2004, largely on account of rubber. Imports driven by externally funded
humanitarian aid and strong remittances increased significantly.
12.
Fiscal revenue collapsed during the internal conflict but has recovered markedly
since the NTGL took office, reflecting steps to boost revenue but also the early
centralization of revenue collections at the Ministry of Finance and of government
accounts at the CBL (Table 3). Following implementation of a balanced cash-based budget
through about mid-2004, a domestically funded fiscal deficit, equivalent to about 1 percent of
GDP, emerged in the latter part of the year. While that deficit was quickly rolled back, there
was a large buildup of arrears through end-2004 (see below). Until the NTGL took office,
spending was mainly geared toward military outlays, resulting in the accumulation of sizable
wage arrears. Expenditure has since shifted to rehabilitating government offices, and to
paying regular public sector wages, and, more recently, to restarting some education and
health services.
13.
For 2005, the economic recovery is expected to strengthen, underpinned by
continued donor activities and the UN peacekeeping mission. Real GDP is projected to
expand by 8.5 percent led by agriculture (mainly rubber), domestic manufacturing, and
services. With higher imports and increased production, domestic prices are expected to
moderate further. The trade deficit is projected to narrow on a further moderate increase of
exports and decline of donor-funded imports for humanitarian assistance.
III. DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES
14.
The discussions took place against the background of an improving, albeit
fragile, security situation and economic recovery. The main challenge to sustained peace
is the large number of demobilized fighters who have not yet been integrated.
15.
The NTGL’s reform course has slowed, reflecting uneven support by the former
warring factions. Civil society has become increasingly disgruntled by the slow progress in
reestablishing basic infrastructure and services, and by perceptions of inadequate responses
to fiscal transparency and governance issues.
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Policies
16.
Aware of Liberia’s daunting reconstruction challenges, the authorities stressed
the need for deep reforms to achieve sustainable growth. They noted that Liberia’s
abundant natural resources and vibrant (though at present largely informal) private sector
were key sources of growth that need to be used to create job opportunities and overcome
pervasive poverty.
17.
The staff suggested that, as in other postconflict countries, the recovery could
take place in two phases: the first driven by international support for humanitarian
assistance and reestablishment of the most basic services and infrastructure, and the second

-9-

where external support shifts to broader-based recovery efforts (possibly also in the form of
direct budgetary assistance) and measures to reactivate the private sector as the engine of
growth.
18.
The authorities concurred that early reestablishment of confidence in Liberia’s
key economic institutions would be crucial to securing sustained external support and
attracting private investment. Therefore, these institutions—including the budget, revenuegenerating agencies, the CBL, and the financial system–need to be rebuilt as a matter of
priority. Such action should be complemented by the strengthening of the judicial system and
the introduction of modern legislation regulating commercial transactions to establish a
framework for private sector activity.
19.
The staff indicated that the main fiscal challenges are to strengthen revenue
collections and improve expenditure controls so as to channel growing resources to
poverty-reducing activities. In light of significant external and domestic financing
constraints, the authorities agreed that the budget would have to remain balanced for some
time.
20.
Regarding the financial sector, the authorities concurred that the main tasks
ahead were to strengthen the CBL and the banking system. Moreover, additional
instruments will be needed to make monetary policy more effective.
21.
The authorities pointed at Liberia’s large external debt overhang as a key
obstacle to medium-term sustainability. The staff replied that the establishment of a strong
track record of reforms and prudent policies would be key to resolving the debt burden.
22.
To illustrate the positive effects of early and decisive reforms, the staff presented
two medium-term scenarios. 7 The optimistic scenario assumes prudent macroeconomic and
strong reform policies, which would help lay an early basis for significant private investment
and sustainable growth and could lead to an average growth rate of about 10 percent,
resulting in an increase of GDP per capita from US$116 in 2004 to US$170 in 2009. A
slower-growth scenario is premised on a slower pace of reform and lower donor support.
Annual real GDP would grow by about 4 percent, insufficient to create significant new
employment opportunities and raise living standards. The staff noted that this scenario would
likely materialize if the current uneven pace of reforms persisted.

B. Governance Issues
23.
The authorities stressed that strengthening economic governance was
indispensable for medium-term recovery, in light of pervasive mismanagement under
previous governments which had also undermined the conduct of fiscal and central
bank operations. Agreeing with this position, the staff stressed the need for short-term
actions to strengthen financial management (see below) and address concrete governance
issues that have become subject to public debate.
24.
A committee has recently been established to follow up on corruption allegations
against members of the transitional government and civil servants. Members include
legal experts and representatives of political parties and civil society. The staff welcomed this
initiative and encouraged the authorities to make the committee fully operational as soon as
feasible.
25.
The authorities indicated that two cases of serious concern regarding
transparency and accountability were being investigated. These are the modalities of
large sales of iron ore and the alleged disappearance during 2004 of a large number of blank
import and export permits.8 In addition, an audit of travel expenses was at a final stage. The
authorities envisaged that reports on all three cases could become available soon. The staff
advised them to publish their results, including decisions on any corrective actions.
8

700,000 tons of iron ore were sold at US$10 a ton, compared with reported international
prices of about US$40 a ton, resulting in a potential revenue loss of about US$20 million.

- 11 -

26.
The authorities reiterated their desire to design a detailed agenda for
strengthening governance based on audits of the CBL and the main revenue-generating
agencies. However, they regretted partly security-related delays in finalizing these audits,
which were conducted with support from the European Union (EU). The staff expressed its
willingness to assist in preparing an action plan of corrective measures, in conjunction with
other external partners, once the audits become available.
27.
The authorities are working with external partners toward fulfilling the
conditions for a lifting of UN sanctions on timber exports. The independent review of
concessions has started and is expected to be finalized in time for the next sanctions review
(June 2005); studies on how to improve the sector’s financial systems were conducted; and
human resource needs are being assessed to reestablish effective oversight of the sector.
28.
There was consensus that a simplification of the structure of forestry taxation
could help to enhance transparency. The staff presented a proposal for a streamlined
system based on ease of administration in the short term by focusing collections on two
instruments, an area rental fee and taxes on timber exports (Box 2).9 Over the medium term,
the export tax should be replaced with a tax on production. The authorities accepted this
proposal and are working with the staff and the World Bank to implement it.
29.
Reforms in the petroleum sector continue, with external assistance. The World
Bank is providing technical support to complete all steps to move to competitive bidding for
petroleum product imports.
C. Fiscal Issues
30.
In light of the crucial importance of reestablishing a functioning and transparent
budget process, the discussions focused on the recent weakening of financial management and recommendations to strengthen fiscal policies in the short term. Additional
steps are needed to achieve the budgeted revenue targets. Although the cash deficit that
emerged around mid-2004 was eliminated, sizable arrears accumulated through end-2004,
requiring a substantial strengthening of expenditure controls to ensure that a balanced cashbased budget can be implemented during 2004/05, as intended.
31.
On the revenue side, the authorities reported that they were addressing the
problems that had led to shortfalls in some areas. They were dealing with delays in
implementing the amended contract with an external agent for preshipment inspections
(BIVAC), which caused shortfalls in customs collections. A petroleum importer’s practice to
offset petroleum taxes due against the repayment of a loan granted to the previous government has been discontinued. Income tax collections have been stronger than expected as a
result of enforced withholding.

Box 2. Simplifying Liberia’s Timber Tax Structure
Enhanced accountability and transparency of timber revenue is one key condition for the lifting of UN
sanctions. While the establishment of a modern financial system to channel these resources will partly satisfy
this demand, a simplification of the tax structure could also enhance transparency.
Liberia’s timber tax structure has become excessively complex and lends itself to misappropriations of
public funds. Initially, Liberia relied almost exclusively on stumpage fees. Subsequently, the system grew to
include an area tax, a variety of production-based fees, export taxes, and other fees and charges. Some were
earmarked for certain purposes, such as reforestation, but the related activities were not funded by the respective
taxes. As the basis for these taxes varies widely (per log, volume, tree species, at the export stage, based on the
concession area), only a sophisticated system with well-developed controls (that currently does not exist) would
be able to ensure their accurate assessment and collection.
Given the lack of effective controls, and in line with the experience of other Sub-Saharan countries, the
authorities have accepted a proposal to radically simplify the current tax structure. In the short term, the
taxes will be reduced to two, an area tax and an export tax on the f.o.b. value of timber. Both taxes have the
advantage of easy administration—the area tax would be collected based on the area of each concession, which
is a known factor. Preshipment inspections of timber exports are already included in the government’s contract
with the external agent BIVAC, thereby minimizing the short-term needs to rely on local tax agents.
Looking forward, the authorities should replace export taxes by production taxes once they have the
capacity to collect them. Also, they should introduce, as soon as feasible, a system to ensure competitive
allocation of new concessions.

32.
The staff urged the authorities to take all remaining steps to make the arrangement with BIVAC fully operational. It noted that preshipment inspections on a large part of
imports, including rice and petroleum products, had not yet started. Overall, the staff pointed
to favorable economic developments, including the surge in demand for petroleum products,
which should boost the revenue base and allow the budgetary revenue target to be met or
exceeded. The authorities concurred with this view.
33.
The staff expressed concern about certain measures taken or under consideration that threaten to undermine the revenue base. These include generous import duty
exemptions for a large international investment project (the concession of which is under
review); temporary exemptions of duties on cement imports; and proposed changes to the
investment code that contemplate wide-ranging exemptions for new international investment
projects.
34.
The authorities argued that such exemptions were needed to signal the return of
stability to prospective investors. They cited supply difficulties as the reason for the
temporary suspension of taxes on cement imports.
35.
The staff explained that international experience had shown that foreign
investment was influenced more by long-term considerations of a country’s stability
and social peace, as well as availability and reliability of infrastructure and a skilled
and healthy labor force. For these conditions to take hold again, the authorities must

- 13 -

mobilize higher budgetary revenue and channel it efficiently to basic infrastructure, health
and education expenses. Therefore, the staff urged the authorities to eliminate existing tax
concessions and not to introduce new ones.
36.
On the expenditure side, the staff found that the cash-management committee,
set up to avoid the recurrence of a cash deficit, was not operating as intended. Significant expenditures were still made without the committee’s prior authorization, and
transactions in local currency were not monitored. The authorities agreed to redouble efforts
in this area.
37.
In view of the emergence of about US$12 million in arrears by end-2004, the
staff expressed serious concerns about the effectiveness of commitment controls. It asked
the authorities to ascertain how the regularization of arrears would affect the implementation
of the approved budget in the remainder of the fiscal year. Furthermore, the staff urged the
authorities to put simple commitment control mechanisms in place and to make full use of
earlier technical assistance recommendations. The authorities agreed with the need to
strengthen controls in this area.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Issues
38.
The Liberian economy remains highly dollarized, limiting the scope for
monetary and exchange rate policies. Also, there are only a few instruments for monetary
operations; reserve requirements were only recently complemented by foreign exchange
auctions, also to ensure a transparent allocation of foreign exchange. The CBL succeeded in
accommodating the increased demand for local currency while avoiding pressures on the
exchange rate and accumulating modest foreign reserves. The staff agreed with the CBL that
it should continue to accommodate the expected rebound in demand for local currency, in
line with the economy’s recovery, while paying attention to exchange rate movements as an
indicator of supply and demand conditions for local currency.
39.
The CBL has developed a monetary policy framework, anticipating that
sustained strong demand for local currency would gradually broaden the scope for
monetary policies. Such policies would be geared toward price and exchange rate stability.
In the short term, the CBL plans to set up a liquidity-monitoring system and introduce a
credit facility for banks to cushion short term liquidity shortfalls. In line with market
developments, in the medium term, the CBL plans to establish a liquidity forecasting system,
introduce repurchase agreements, and develop an interbank foreign exchange market. In the
long term, it will attempt to develop money and securities markets.
40.
The staff welcomed the CBL’s efforts to clarify its policy goals and set the
agenda for future work. It advised the CBL to closely link the implementation of its
framework to economic conditions and to improvements in the health of the banking sector.
Specifically, the staff cautioned against a premature use of central bank lines of credit and
stressed that the issuance of securities should not be used to finance new fiscal deficits.

- 14 -

41.
The potential costs and benefits of full dollarization were also discussed. Some
members of the Liberian delegation noted that full dollarization could help reestablish fiscal
discipline and attract foreign investors. Others favored dollarization as an effective way to
ensure stable prices and wages. The CBL was concerned that dollarization would preclude
more active monetary policies. The staff advised against moving to full dollarization in view
of Liberia’s vulnerability to external shocks and the high cost of dollarization for the
financial system (Box 3).10 Investors are unlikely to consider an internationally accepted
currency as an important argument for investing in Liberia, compared with, for example
political and social stability, a healthy and productive workforce, and a functioning
infrastructure.
42.
The CBL was generally satisfied with the foreign exchange auctions that had
been introduced in mid-2004. However, the CBL noted that a need to allocate sizable
amounts of foreign currency to the auctions made it difficult to raise international reserves.
The authorities accepted the staff’s suggestions to reduce the amounts being offered in such
auctions to facilitate a buildup of reserves. More generally, the staff advised that the purchase
amounts for the CBL (equivalent to an injection of liquidity in local currency) should be
determined by the increase in demand for Liberian dollars. It also noted that the auction does
not give rise to an exchange restriction or multiple currency practice, given that banks and
exchange houses buy and sell foreign exchange among themselves, and that the auction
establishes a single rate, which is also used by the government for its transactions.
43.
The banking system remains fragile and undercapitalized. However, banks’
liquidity position has remained strong. The CBL has recently adopted a restructuring and
resolution policy, and an examination team has already begun assessing the financial
conditions of one of the three operating banks. In addition, the CBL ordered all banks to
suspend new lending to delinquent borrowers. In welcoming these steps, the staff encouraged
the authorities to make full use of the flexibility granted by the new regulations to finalize the
restructuring exercise swiftly.

Box 3. Liberia—A Case For Dollarization?
Dollarization represents a trade-off between potential gains and losses. Supporters argue that the
imposition of such a rigid framework on policy decisions would ensure fiscal discipline and reduce policy
and exchange rate risks. Interest rates, as a result, would decline, and investment, exports, and GDP would all
rise. This does not come, however, without a price. Dollarization makes the provision of liquidity costly
(because of the loss of seigniorage); exposes the system to high output volatility in response to real shocks
(because of the loss of monetary and exchange rate policy); and limits credit expansion by banks (because of
the loss of the lender of last resort). In the case of Liberia, while the costs of dollarization are tangible, the
potential gains are not to be taken for granted.
The loss of seigniorage is costly for the Liberian economy. The initial cost of replacing the stock of
domestic currency is estimated at about US$36 million (equivalent to 8 percent of GDP). In addition, Liberia
would have to give up real goods and services to accommodate future increases in money demand. For
example, to support a modest annual rate of growth of 3-4 percent, an annual current account surplus of
about US$7 million would be required to provide liquidity to the system.
The Liberian economy depends on a few commodity exports, making it highly vulnerable to external
shocks. From about 1950 to the mid-1970s, the country benefited from favorable world demand and prices
for iron ore and rubber, resulting in fiscal and current account surpluses that made it easy to maintain full
dollarization (as introduced after World War II). However, the oil crises and global recession of the 1970s
and 1980s quickly eroded these surpluses and, following a period of increasing recourse to foreign financing,
led to the introduction of a local currency alongside the U.S. dollar.
Banks in a dollarized economy need stronger liquidity and equity positions. First, higher output
volatility creates higher client default risk. Second, the lack of a lender of last resort forces banks to hold
sizable liquid assets and equity. If Liberia were to adopt full dollarization, banks should first be strengthened
significantly, well above the 8 percent risk-adjusted capital ratio proposed by the Basel Committee. In any
case, the lack of a lender of last resort would limit credit expansion and increase lending rates, which would
reduce the contribution of financial intermediation to Liberia’s recovery.
Empirical evidence suggests that the choice of an exchange rate regime is not important for fiscal
discipline. Fiscal deficits are largely associated with macroeconomic fundamentals and governments’
implementation capacity. As noted, Liberia’s full dollarization in the past did not prevent the government
from funding fiscal deficits through external loans and sizable arrears.

44.
The CBL recently licensed two new banks. In its view, more stringent capital
requirements and due diligence regarding the owners and managers of the new institutions
provided sufficient assurances as to their soundness. They also stressed that some new
institutions may be needed because of the fragility of the current banking system. The staff
cautioned against licensing additional new banks in the current difficult economic environment and urged the CBL to continuously carry out due diligence on the recently licensed
banks.

E. Donor Issues and Technical Assistance
46.
The staff shared the authorities’ concerns about the slow pace of disbursements,
but noted that donors cited a low level of trust in Liberian financial management
practices as a main cause for delays (Box 4). As a remedial step, the staff encouraged the
authorities to address governance issues immediately and to improve transparency in overall
financial management.
47.
On technical assistance, the authorities had defined priorities for the core areas
of economic management and stated that technical assistance provided by the Fund and
other external partners was, overall, well coordinated. The United States provides
assistance in budget preparation, banking supervision, and forestry management. The EU
intends to focus technical assistance on economic governance, based on its above-mentioned
audits. The Fund and the World Bank are closely coordinated in their work on expenditure
management. The Fund has taken the lead in tax and customs administration and financial
sector issues, while the World Bank focuses on procurement, forestry and public enterprise
reform, and community-driven development.
F. Public Debt
48.
The authorities have made substantial progress in taking stock of domestic and
external public debt. They have contacted creditors to obtain loan agreements and statements on their external debt obligations as such information was largely lost during the
conflict. Based on preliminary data at end-2004, the stock of public debt amounted to
US$4.1 billion (841 percent of GDP), with US$3.8 billion owed to external creditors, and the
remaining US$0.4 billion to domestic creditors (including suppliers, commercial banks, the
CBL, and civil servants). Some of the debt included in the inventory has not yet been verified
and cross-claims have not been cleared.

- 17 -

Box 4. Donor Assistance to Liberia
The postconflict donor assistance for Liberia is characterized by the following features:
•

Actual disbursements (US$189 million in 2004) are low, in comparison to the pledged amount of
US$520 million.

•

Relative to GDP, external assistance is one of the largest of recent postconflict countries.

•

There is, however, less assistance for budgetary operations than in other postconflict countries.

49.
Liberia’s external debt (as a ratio of exports of goods and services) is estimated
at an unsustainable 2,722 percent at end-2004, well above the threshold of 150 percent
under the HIPC Initiative. The staff indicated that the HIPC Initiative had been extended to
end-2006 and that an assessment of indebtedness using end-December 2004 data would be
one criterion of eligibility. It urged the authorities to expedite their stock-taking of external
debt.
50.
The authorities have been working on a domestic arrears settlement strategy,
with external technical advice. Under the strategy, payments for small claims would be
prioritized and a substantial reduction of the face value of the remaining claims would be
sought. The staff agreed on the need to prioritize payments for small claims, but advised that
the strategy should contribute to achieving overall sustainability. The authorities concurred
with the staff that no payment would be made until the strategy is finalized.

- 18 -

G. Trade Regime and Competitiveness
51.
The lack of reliable economic data precludes an analysis of Liberia’s external
competitiveness. This said, the largely destroyed infrastructure and lack of basic services are
widely believed to hamper commercial and export activities.
52.
Liberia has a relatively open trade regime, and rates for import and export taxes
currently in effect are modest.11 Tax and custom revenues from trade transactions are
expected to be phased out in line with a broadening of the domestic revenue base. The
authorities indicated their willingness to harmonize Liberia’s trade regime with ECOWAS’s
once basic economic conditions have improved.
H. Relations with the Fund
53.
Since the NTGL took office in October 2003, overall cooperation with the Fund
on policies and payments has strengthened. However, the emergence of financial
management and governance issues requires the authorities to redouble their efforts to return
to a solid reform path.
54.
Against this background, the authorities agreed that the conditions for entering
into a staff-monitored program (SMP) were not yet in place. However, the staff
expressed its willingness to assist the authorities in strengthening weak areas, with a view to
establishing the track record that could lead to an SMP.
55.
The adequacy of token payments to the Fund was also reviewed. The staff noted
the recovery of official reserves and the potential to further strengthen budgetary revenue
collections, and encouraged the authorities to increase their monthly token payments. The
authorities indicated that they would consider an increase in the context of the 2005/06
budget.
I. Data Issues
56.
Despite some progress, serious data deficiencies continue to hamper the
assessment of the economic impact of policies and donor activities, as well as
surveillance. The authorities acknowledged the need to prepare national income statistics
and to improve on the outdated basket used to measure the consumer price index. They have
approached donors to conduct surveys of household income and expenditure, as well as
living standards. The staff welcomed improvements in the quality of monetary statistics (also
reflecting Fund technical assistance), but regretted that the reliability of fiscal information
had deteriorated, attributable in part to the existence of different sources of expenditure data

11

goods and 4 percent on precious metals.

- 19 -

and lack of reconciliation of revenue and expenditure information with associated financing
flows. The authorities recognized the need to strengthen the reliability of key fiscal data.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
57.
Improved security has created the basis for some economic recovery. The local
economy is benefiting from donor-related and reconstruction activities; prices and the
exchange rate have stabilized.
58.
There are, however, significant risks that could disrupt the consolidation of
peace and economic revival. A large number of demobilized ex-combatants needs to be
reintegrated into economic life. Moreover, the lack of cohesion within the power-sharing
government continues to hinder the implementation of sound policies and reforms. In this
regard, slow progress in rehabilitating basic infrastructure and services is disappointing.
59.
Liberia faces daunting medium-term challenges to rebuild its economy and
reduce pervasive poverty. Decisive reforms need to begin as soon as possible to put the
country firmly on the road to recovery. Such reforms should focus on the rebuilding of the
budget process and other key economic institution, and a gradual broadening of the scope for
monetary policy. Throughout, priority should be given to strengthening governance, also
with a view to maintaining external financial and technical support.
60.
Against this background, the recent slackening of the NTGL’s pace of reform
implementation is of concern, and serious governance issues have emerged. These
include the circumstances surrounding sales of iron ore and the alleged disappearance of a
large number of import and export permits. The staff urges the authorities to act swiftly to
clarify these issues and to publish their findings and intended actions so as to provide
assurances of their commitment to full accountability. The NTGL should also act decisively
in fulfilling the requirements for a lifting of UN sanctions. External partners have stepped up
their efforts to devise a coordinated action plan to this end.
61.
The recent weakening of financial management is regrettable, following initial
success in implementing a prudent balanced budget. While the swift rollback of a
domestically financed deficit is welcome, the emergence of large arrears is a considerable
concern. The authorities need to redouble efforts to strengthen expenditure controls,
including through the full use of technical assistance recommendations. Similarly, they have
scope to bolster revenue collections through full implementation of long-standing
recommendations, particularly in the areas of customs.
62.
The staff welcomes the steps undertaken to strengthen the CBL’s financial
position and to develop a framework for monetary operations and bank restructuring.
The authorities should use caution in granting new licenses for banks, taking into account the
current economic uncertainties and the fragility of the banking system.

- 20 -

63.
There is a need to build on first encouraging steps to reconstruct a core
statistical database, also to allow effective surveillance. The authorities are advised to seek
further technical assistance from external partners in this area.
64.
The authorities’ intentions to strengthen the identified areas require concrete
action plans. Such plans are also needed before they can obtain enhanced support from the
Fund in terms of policy advice and technical assistance in the period leading to a new
government (end-2005), and to build a track record that could lead to a staff-monitored
program and start of de-escalating the Fund’s remedial measures against Liberia.
65.
It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX I

Assessing Debt Sustainability
A debt sustainability analysis based on the low-income external debt template
illustrates that Liberia’s external debt is significantly higher than the indicative thresholds
established under the HIPC Initiative. Based on preliminary data at end-2004, Liberia’s net
present value of external debt as a ratio of GDP and exports of goods and services is
estimated at 754 percent and 2722 percent, respectively.7 The slower-growth (baseline)
scenario assumes modest improvements in the current account together with real output
growth and a marginal depreciation of the real exchange rate following the recovery in the
economy and the lifting of the UN sanctions on timber.8 Under these circumstances, the
ratios are projected to decline to 582 percent and 1640 percent, respectively, in 2013. The
debt-service ratio of 62 percent at end 2004, primarily reflecting interest arrears and penalties
on the outstanding debt, is also expected to decline over the long-term.
The simulation of long-term sustainability under historical trends (scenario A1)
shows an improvement over time on account of more favorable export performance and
higher economic growth. This suggests that the debt path under the slower-growth scenario is
relatively pessimistic when the key macroeconomic parameters utilized in the sensitivity
analysis are based on historical averages.9 The debt situation is still untenable in the scenario
based on higher economic and export growth (A2), despite the larger decline in the stock and
flow indicators relative to the baseline projections.
A one time shock to economic growth (B1), a 30 percent depreciation of the Liberian
dollar (B6), and export growth (B2) provide the worst scenarios among the bound tests that
represent instability in the macroeconomic environment and downturns in the global
economy. These tests would set off debt dynamics that would persist over the medium term
so that by 2013 the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratios are 197 and 347 percentage points higher
under B1 and B6, while the debt-to-export ratio is 223 percentage points higher than the
baseline under B2.
The assessment illustrates the unsustainability of Liberia’s external public debt
situation. To address its external debt problem, Liberia will need to make a strong
commitment to pursue sound macroeconomic and structural policies but will also require
substantial support, including extensive debt relief, from the international community.
7

Most of the records on external debt were lost during the years of conflict. The data used
for end-December 2004 reflect statements provided by multilateral creditors that are yet to be
reconciled. Data on bilateral and commercial external debt have not been updated in many
years and reflect estimates by the authorities and staff.
8

The baseline scenario assumes continued accumulation of arrears and no access to new
borrowing because of the protracted arrears situation.
9

Complete historical data for the DSA exercise are available for the period 1999 to 2002.
Production of timber, the main export, peaked during the period at levels that were
considered by some in the industry as unsustainable. Data for 2003, the year of the latest
conflict, were omitted because they distorted the averages and standard deviations calibrated
for the stress tests.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt-creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the authorities maker a stronger commitment to reform efforts, the UN sanctions are lifted earlier, the international community providesd more support in
the form of infrastructural development, and there is higher private sector investment, including FDI, for growth
3/ Export values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX III

Liberia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of March 1, 2005)
The World Bank suspended disbursements to Liberia in December 1986, as a result of
mounting arrears and Liberia’s loans were placed in non-accrual status in June 1987. To that
date, disbursements had totaled US$141.3 million from 22 loans and US$91.5 million from
17 IDA credits; only US$ 43.6 million owing on these disbursements has been repaid. By
March 1, 2005, Liberia’s arrears to the World Bank had mounted to US$449.5 million,
reflecting further interest charges. Liberia has an outstanding obligation of US$2.2 million to
the World Bank, since June 30, 2003, to fulfill the Maintenance of Value (MOV) clause in
the Bank's Articles of Agreement.
Following Comprehensive Peace Agreement in August 2003 and the installation of the
National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) in October 2003, the Bank co-hosted
with the UN and US the International Reconstruction Conference for Liberia in February
2004. In March 2004, the Executive Directors of the Bank discussed the Liberia Country Reengagement Note and approved the additional activities therein described. Use of the Bank’s
newly created LICUS Implementation Trust Fund was approved for Liberia in April 2004 to
fund four activities, totaling US$4.0 million, in the areas of community empowerment,
including a rapid social assessment; public procurement and financial management; forestry
sector management; and coordination and implementation of the Results-Focused Transition
Framework (RFTF). Close coordination and consultation among the NTGL, Bank, IMF, UN
group, bilateral donors, local and international NGOs, and civil society characterizes the
working environment in Liberia. Mechanisms have been developed to foster this approach
through the high-level RFTF Implementation and Monitoring Committee (RIMCO) and its
nine working-level sector cluster working groups. The Bank is a vice-chair of RIMCO and
co-chairs the Working Committee on Economic Policy and Development Strategy
A second, US$25.0 million grant from Bank IBRD surplus, was endorsed by the Executive
Directors of the Bank in August 2004 and approved by the Bank’s Board of Governors in
October 2004. This grant, the TFLIB, will extend funding of the above activities and fund
additional activities in the area of infrastructure, including transportation, sanitation, power,
water, and telecommunications. The first subgrant from this source of funding, the Technical
Assistance Component for Infrastructure Rehabilitation (US$5.0 million), was approved in
December 2004, and the second subgrant, Community Empowerment (US$6.0 million), was
approved in February 2005. Other subgrants are being prepared.
Since July 1, 2004 the Bank has a Senior Country Officer in Monrovia to better coordinate
the Bank’s activities in Liberia.

APPENDIX IV

Liberia: Statistical Issues
1.
There are substantial weaknesses in Liberia's economic and financial statistics,
largely because the civil war caused widespread destruction of databases and the loss of
administrative and institutional capacity for the systematic compilation of statistics. STA
missions visited Monrovia in 2003 and 2004 and assisted the authorities in rebuilding some
capacity to compile statistics in the areas of national accounts, monetary and fiscal statistics
and balance of payments. The government has passed new legislation in July 2004 creating
the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services as a semiautonomous agency.
This agency, expected to be operational in FY 2005/06, will have the lead role for national
coordination and reestablishment of economic and social statistics.
2.
The CBL is now regularly reporting monetary, banking, and exchange rate statistics
for publication to International Financial Statistics (IFS), but their quality and timeliness
needs to be improved.
3.
The CBL publishes data on money and banking, prices and output, fiscal operations
and debt, interest and exchange rates, and foreign trade in its statistical bulletin, Liberia
Financial Statistics, on a bimonthly basis with a lag of about six months. It also publishes the
quarterly Financial and Economic Bulletin, covering the previous four quarters, with a lag of
about six months. A survey conducted in June 2004 updated the two subgroups of rent and
personal care and health services in the Monrovia consumer price index.
Real sector
4.
Annual estimates of production by sector are prepared by the National Accounts Unit
of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA). The Fund staff has estimated
total GDP by sectoral origin for the period from 1997-2004 with the assistance of the MPEA.
There is currently no estimate for GDP by expenditure. A household survey is required as a
base for more reliable data.
Prices
5.
The Price Unit of the MPEA began producing a consumer price index in late 1998,
with May 1998 as the starting date and reference period. However, the weights are based on
an expenditure survey of 100 Monrovia households conducted in 1963-64. The database of a
price survey conducted in 1988-89 with the assistance of the German governmental organization GTZ was lost during the civil war. Targeted sampling frequencies vary from
bimonthly for food items to biannual for rents and personal care and services, with actual
collections often delayed. Monthly data have not been reported to the Fund in advance of
publication, which generally involves a lag of about six months.
Government finance statistics
6.
The authorities have begun to provide information on fiscal accounts to the staff on
an regular basis but they have not reported data for publication in the Government Financial
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) since 1988, nor have they provided data for the IFS for several

- 36 -

APPENDIX IV

years. The authorities are encouraged to resume regular reporting of government finance
statistics to STA. The Ministry of Finance provides monthly disaggregated data on
government revenue, and current and capital expenditure. There is, however, considerable
scope for improvement in the quality and consistency of government finance statistics. Data
on domestic arrears and on financing items are unreliable.
Monetary statistics
7.
The August 2004 money and banking statistics mission reviewed in detail the
methodology for the collection of monetary data, established procedures for their regular
compilation, and suggested changes in CBL’s accounting records and commercial banks’
reports to improve overall data quality. In cooperation with the authorities, and based on
available information, the mission compiled monetary data for the period June 2002–
June 2004. The CBL has made progress in compiling monetary aggregates according to
international standards, and reporting of data by commercial banks has improved.
8.
While progress has been made in moving toward international standards, substantial
weaknesses persist. Important steps to strengthen the CBL’s accounting system remain to be
taken, including proper accounting for foreign reserves and the appropriate segregation of
required reserves by currency denomination and classification of other assets and liabilities.
In addition, while the reporting of preliminary statistics by commercial banks has improved,
the response by banks to requests for explanations and follow-up to noted inconsistencies
continues to be weak.
9.
The money and banking data reported monthly to IFS are usually submitted by e-mail
or fax with a two-month lag; the latest return includes data up to December 2004.
Balance of payments and external debt
10.
Official balance of payments statistics have not been reported since the 1988
Article IV consultation; however, the Fund staff has prepared provisional balance of
payments statistics in cooperation with the CBL, the Ministry of Commerce (MoC), MPEA,
and the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The CBL is responsible for compiling the balance of
payments in coordination with other agencies. Some progress has been made in compiling
certain current and financial account components—mainly to trade and related services,
government expenditures, and remittances on the current account and to nonresident deposits
on the financial account—but primary source data areas lacking and errors in distinguishing
between components in services, income and transfers underscore the need for technical
assistance for capacity building. A stronger effort must be made to resolve and reconcile the
significant discrepancies that exist in the trade data reported by the various agencies. The
CBL has completed a census of foreign direct investment enterprises in preparation for an
investment survey following the recommendations made by the STA mission in July 2004.
11.
Significant gaps exist in the records of external public debt, particularly that related to
bilateral and commercial creditors. A task force comprising technicians and professionals
seconded from the CBL, MoF, MPEA, General Auditing Office (GAO) and the Bureau of
the Budget (BOB) is currently making progress in obtaining loan agreements and financial
statements from external creditors to update the external debt database maintained by the
MoF.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Liberia
On April 20, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Liberia.1
Background
Political and economic developments in 2003-04 were marked by an intensification of internal
hostilities, followed by the introduction of the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL)
and the resumption of external assistance. Real GDP rebounded in 2004, following a steep decline
in the second half of 2003 on account of the hostilities and the imposition of the UN ban on timber
exports. Prices, particularly of food items, have stabilized as supply constraints eased, and the
exchange rate has returned to preconflict levels, reflecting a return of private capital, donor inflows,
and an increase in the demand for local currency. Official reserves increased modestly from low
levels.
Following initial success in implementing a balanced cash-based budget, fiscal management has
weakened. Although a domestically funded fiscal deficit during mid-2004 was quickly rolled back,
there was a large buildup of arrears through end-2004. Despite the introduction of a cashmanagement committee to avoid the recurrence of a cash deficit, significant expenditures were still
made without its authorization. Following effective early steps to boost revenues, collections
slowed in the second half of 2004, largely reflecting delays in extending preshipment inspections to
all imports and exports.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2The money supply expanded significantly in 2004. Following a massive decline in commercial bank
deposits through mid-2003, deposits increased by about 50 percent during 2004, reflecting donor
activities and the inflow of remittances for reconstruction. The Central Bank of Liberia gradually
moved toward financial soundness, reflecting its efforts to reduce its operational outlays, with a
view to eliminating its cash deficit by early 2006. The banking sector, however, weakened further
as a consequence of the last internal conflict.
External developments in 2004 were driven by increased donor activities and stagnating exports.
Imports, primarily humanitarian assistance and petroleum, increased considerably, while exports
stabilized at a low level, largely due to the UN sanction on timber exports, despite the doubling of
rubber exports in 2004. The overall balance of payments deficit continued to be financed by an
accumulation of external arrears. Based on preliminary data at end-2004, Liberia’s external debt
amounted to US$3.8 billion and reached an unsustainable 2,722 percent as a ratio of exports of
goods and services on a net present value (NPV) basis.
A number of governance issues emerged in late 2004, challenging the authorities’ commitment to
establish transparency and accountability. A committee is being put in place to address these
issues, including the circumstances surrounding sales of iron ore and the alleged disappearance of
a large number of import and export permits.
For 2005, the economic recovery is expected to strengthen, underpinned by continued consolidation of the security situation and reconstruction activities. Real GDP is projected to grow by
8.5 percent, led by agriculture, domestic manufacturing, and services. With higher imports and
increased production, domestic prices are expected to moderate further. The trade deficit is
projected to narrow on a further moderate increase of exports and decline of donor-funded imports
for humanitarian assistance.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvements in Liberia’s security situation and the initial
progress made in implementing important reforms. The resulting pick-up in donor-related and
reconstruction activities has led to a rebound of economic activity, stabilization of prices and the
exchange rate, and a modest increase in official reserves. However, Directors noted that the
macroeconomic position is still fragile, activity is still below the pre-war level, poverty is
widespread, and the public debt is large and unsustainable.
Directors emphasized that Liberia faces daunting challenges in its quest to rebuild the economy
and reduce poverty. A prerequisite will be the achievement of lasting peace and political stability.
In this regard, Directors observed that a large number of ex-combatants still needs to be integrated
into economic life, and that the lack of cohesion within the power-sharing government continues to
hinder the implementation of sound policies and reforms. Directors stressed that Liberia urgently
requires external assistance and private investment, and that the flow of such assistance will
depend on decisive actions to strengthen institutions, reduce corruption, and improve governance.
Against this background, Directors regretted the recent weakening of government fiscal
management. While they commended the swift roll-back of the domestically financed budget
deficit, they expressed concern at the emergence of large arrears to finance unplanned spending.
They stressed that expenditure controls need to be strengthened, and underscored the importance
of a well-functioning cash management system. Directors also called for a redoubling of efforts to

-3bolster revenue collection, and, in this regard, encouraged the authorities to strengthen tax and
customs administration and reduce tax concessions. They urged the authorities to make full use of
Fund staff advice in these areas.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the transparency and accountability of government
operations. They welcomed the establishment of an anti-corruption commission, and encouraged
the authorities to make the commission fully operational as quickly as possible. Investigations into
the circumstances surrounding sales of iron ore and the alleged disappearance of a large number
of import and export permits should be conducted swiftly, and the outcomes of the investigations
made publicly available. Decisive actions are also required to fulfill the requirements for a lifting of
UN sanctions.
Directors welcomed the steps being taken by the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) to strengthen its
financial position and the framework for monetary operations, and to develop the inter-bank foreign
exchange market. They commended the CBL’s decisive actions to reduce its operational outlays,
with a view to eliminating its deficit by early 2006. Most Directors had doubts whether a move to
full dollarization would be advisable, in part because it would preclude more active monetary
policies, while a few others felt that dollarization should not be ruled out given its potential for
achieving price stability. Directors encouraged the authorities to push ahead with plans for
restructuring banks and strengthening bank supervision. They advised to use caution in granting
new licenses for commercial banks in the current economic environment.
Directors welcomed the progress in stock-taking of domestic and external debt. They urged the
authorities to expedite the process, with a view to developing a strategy for achieving debt
sustainability.
Directors noted that, despite some progress made in rebuilding basic statistics, the limited
availability and quality of key economic data continues to hamper effective surveillance. In
particular, they stressed the need to strengthen fiscal data in order to allow for a more accurate
assessment of budgetary developments.
Directors called on the authorities to formulate a concrete action plan to address the identified
weaknesses in economic management and governance. Such a plan would facilitate further
support by the staff in terms of policy advice and technical assistance in the period leading to the
establishment of a new government at end-2005. This plan could also help Liberia establish a track
record for a staff-monitored program, which could lead to a de-escalation of the Fund’s remedial
measures against Liberia. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to consider increasing
payments to the Fund in the context of the 2005/06 budget, if possible.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Peter J. Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Liberia
and Yasmin Patel, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 20, 2005

1.
The Liberian authorities are in broad agreement with the analysis in the staff report on
Article IV consultation, which highlights the major macroeconomic challenges facing
Liberia, and provides a clear insight as to the remedial actions required in the period ahead in
order to put the country on a strong and sustainable growth path. It is however important that
Liberia’s recent economic and financial performance be assessed against the backdrop of the
political and social environment of a country emerging from a protracted conflict situation,
scarcity of human capital, the need to rebuild institutional framework, and the fact that
Liberia is among the poorest and highly indebted countries in the world. Therefore, the
country has a multiplicity of daunting tasks to address simultaneously. First and foremost, it
has to maintain the stable political environment created by the cessation of internal
hostilities, which is a fundamental ingredient for sustained improvement in the country’s
economic landscape; it has to lay the foundations to foster economic growth; and it has to
deal with the conditions of widespread poverty afflicting the large majority of its population.
Moreover, there is the need to attend to the pressing social and humanitarian needs of the
one-third of the population displaced during the conflicts. The demobilization of a large
contingent of ex-combatants and the planned elections in October 2005 will hopefully mark
important turning points in Liberia, after several years of intermittent wars that inflicted high
human and material costs, and establish a much firmer basis for economic development and
reconstruction in an environment of political stability. Critical in this regard is to deal with
the deep-rooted causes of these conflicts, through a community-driven development aimed at
transforming the rural communities.
Recent economic developments
2.
The National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL), within a short period of
assumption of office, has been implementing economic measures in order to address the
basic macroeconomic imbalances and a good measure of success has been achieved. Hence,
in 2004, economic activity recovered strongly compared to the steep decline of 31 percent in
the previous year due to the conflict and the UN ban on timber exports. Aided by a strong
revival of rubber production and reconstruction activities supported by external financial
assistance, real GDP growth is estimated to have reached 2.4 percent. Inflation has
decelerated to 7.8 percent as food prices stabilized, and increased demand for local currency
and donor inflows helped to reduce the exchange rate volatility. Progress has been made in
the implementation of a cash-based budget, reflecting strong recovery in fiscal revenue,
while the end of hostilities has allowed expenditures to be redirected towards rehabilitation
activities, ensuring regular wage payments to civil servants, and priority social sectors such
as health and education.
3.
To improve the short-term prospects for economic recovery, the authorities are fully
aware of the importance of establishing financial stability, strengthening institutions,
including financial, legal and regulatory, which are essential for attracting private sector

-2resources towards domestic productive investment. In this context, the authorities intend to
continue to implement strong macroeconomic and reform policies, as allowed by the
available human and financial resources. They are hopeful that these policies will provide
the basis for continued external financial and technical support from donors and help to
regularize Liberia’s relations with the international financial community and bilateral
creditors.
Economic Policies for 2005
4.
The main objectives of the economic policy for 2005 are to increase output growth by
8.5 percent mainly because of projected improved performance in agriculture and service
sectors, lower inflation to 5 percent, and stronger fiscal policies.
Fiscal Policy
5.
The Government fully recognizes that a strengthened fiscal position is critical to
financial stability. To that effect, the main objective of fiscal policy is to ensure a balanced
cash-based budget for 2005 and beyond, to foster fiscal discipline while addressing social
and humanitarian needs. The projected improvement in government finances will be
underpinned by a combination of revenue and expenditure measures.
6.
On the revenue side, the measures are oriented towards boosting revenue collections
through improved tax administration and control and actions to gradually reduce tax
exemptions. The authorities are also keen to streamline the structure of forestry taxation to
enhance transparency and collection efficiency from this important revenue source. As a
result of these steps, revenue is expected to increase to 17.7 percent of GDP in 2005, from
13.9 percent in 2004.
7.
The government is equally committed to improve control over expenditures. In this
regard, it intends to take the necessary measures to reinforce commitment controls and
prevent spending decisions taken outside the control of the Cash-Management Committee
(CMC) and avoid re-emergence of domestic arrears.
Monetary Policy
8.
The high degree of dollarization, which has precluded more active monetary policies,
remains a matter of major concern to the monetary authorities. They are, however, confident
that as sustained strong demand for local currency would gradually allow a broader scope for
monetary policy, it will be geared towards ensuring price and exchange rate stability and
progressively restore the Liberian dollar as a medium of transactions. In the meantime, the
CBL has made successful use of indirect instrument of monetary policy to improve its
responsiveness to growing demands for local currency and pressures on exchange rate. In
addition, the planned establishment of liquidity forecasting system will enable the CBL to
better monitor market developments. Moreover, to facilitate build up of international
reserves position, the CBL intends to reduce the amounts of foreign currency being offered
for sale in auctions. The authorities also attach great importance to further strengthen the

-3banking sector, which remains fragile and undercapitalized. As an initial step to improve the
soundness of the system, a bank restructuring and resolution policy has already been adopted
and is already being implemented.
Governance Issues
9.
The authorities are fully aware of the need to strengthen economic governance, which
they regard as an important ingredient for medium-term recovery. Decisive measures are
already being taken to address the existing cases that have become subject of public debate,
reflecting the authorities’ commitment to zero tolerance for corruption. In this regard,
priority attention has been given to accountability and transparency in the public sector. An
Anti-Corruption Task Force has been established to investigate corruption allegations against
public officials and civil servants. Moreover, a team of auditors from ECOWAS has been
invited to conduct forensic audits of ministries and agencies, including the legislature. The
team is presently in Monrovia. The government also expects to receive the findings of audits
of revenue-generating agencies sponsored by the EU. It is worth noting that the issue of
corruption has also taken center stage in the national legislature affecting the Speaker and
other members of the Assembly. More recently, the Chairman of the NTGL has also
suspended senior officials of the National Social Security and Welfare Corporation for
charges of mismanagement.
External Debt
10.
Liberia’s medium and long term external sustainability depends not only on its own
prudent policy efforts towards recovery but also on the collaborative efforts of the
international financial community to provide adequate debt relief in order to help reduce the
excessive heavy external debt overhang. As it has often been proved for countries such as
Liberia, sustained implementation of strong reform agenda without adequate level of timely
external financial assistance runs the risk of jeopardizing the country’s capacity to service,
even at a minimum level, its external debt obligations.
Overdue Financial Obligations
11.
Liberia’s monthly payments to the Fund, reflects the authorities’ strong commitment
to improve cooperation with the BWIs, despite the country’s extremely difficult political,
social, and economic situation. In light of this and the progress being made, albeit slow, on
the reform front, we encourage the Board to support staff’s recommendation that no remedial
measures be taken against the country at this time, as the authorities continue to work with
the Fund and the international community for a timely solution to the problem.
Concluding Remarks
12.
In the context of a war torn economy struggling to achieve recovery, the authorities
are particularly concerned about high levels of poverty prevailing in the country. They
acknowledge that a long period of conflict has contributed considerably to the deterioration
of social infrastructure, thus making the country one of the most vulnerable in terms of

-4human development indicators. In view of this situation, the authorities believe that the most
effective policy to reduce poverty is to provide more and better social services to the poor
and invest in human capital and social infrastructure.
13.
The authorities have made serious efforts to achieve modest economic recovery.
However, as already mentioned above, the process of reforming a post-conflict economy
takes long and the tasks confronting the authorities are daunting, while capacity is limited.
The authorities are taking several measures to consolidate peace and stabilize the economy
and need continuous strong and broad-based support from the international community to
restructure the economy and promote economic growth and poverty reduction.
14.
The authorities are, however, aware that much remains to be done. One of the major
challenges is to solidify the reform process as a means of strengthening the foundation on
which the successor government can launch a long-term development agenda for sustained
growth on poverty reduction. In the view of the authorities, enhanced partnership with the
Fund is indispensable to a more propitious economic future for Liberia. This underlies the
sense of urgency they attach to reaching agreement on a staff monitored program. The
authorities also highly value continued technical assistance from the Fund as an integral part
of the efforts to build capacity for improved economic management. Going forward, the
authorities are asking for the continuous support of the Fund.
15.
The Liberian authorities wish to express their gratitude to the Board and Fund
Management for the constructive dialogue and policy advice extended to the NTGL, during
these difficult times.
