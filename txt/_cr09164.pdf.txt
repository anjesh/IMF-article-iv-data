Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Switzerland
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Martin Mühleisen
May 1, 2009
Executive Summary
•

Focus. The report focuses on the impact of the global crisis, measures to manage the
associated risks and vulnerabilities, and macro-financial linkages and spillovers.

•

Context. Switzerland benefited from its strong macroeconomic, fiscal and external
fundamentals going into the crisis. However, the large financial sector was affected at an
early stage, and now the impact of the crisis on the real economy is being felt as well.

•

Outlook. Staff expects a significant economic decline in 2009. Along with a sharp
contraction in exports, investments are now being postponed. Consumption has held up
well so far, but as unemployment rises household spending will lose momentum.
Growth is expected to pick up in the course of 2010. Headline inflation is projected to
be negative in 2009 and into 2010.

•

Monetary and exchange rate policy. The Swiss National Bank has appropriately
loosened monetary policy, bringing the policy rates almost to zero. Quantitative easing
has been implemented with purchases of private sector paper and unsterilized foreign
exchange intervention aimed at limiting undue appreciation of the Swiss franc.

•

Fiscal policy. The impact of the crisis and two fiscal stimulus packages will result in a
deficit, after years of surpluses. Further fiscal stimulus would be appropriate, but should
not put at risk the sustainability of public finances at a time of significant contingent
liabilities.

•

Financial sector policies. Faced with severe financial sector pressures last autumn, the
authorities responded with timely and broad stabilization measures, aimed at capital,
assets, and liquidity. As the global downturn continues, risks remain in both banking
and insurance/pensions, and additional support measures may be needed.

I. THE CONTEXT1
1.
Switzerland is affected by the global crisis through three important channels.
First, the decline in asset prices impacts the large Swiss banks and insurance companies
directly through their balance sheets—the stock effect. Second, the turmoil will have longerlasting implications for financial industry earnings—the flow effect. Third, the open Swiss
economy will be affected by the crisis through the sharp downturn in growth prospects in key
trading partners—the trade effect. As a result, after years of strong economic performance,
the Swiss economy is now expected to shrink by 3 percent in 2009, before picking up again
in the second half of 2010.
2.
The authorities’ response to the financial turmoil in 2008 was comprehensive;
the key issue looking forward will be whether more might be needed. The authorities
pushed for an early recapitalization of UBS, extended deposit insurance, negotiated new
capital requirements and liquidity buffers for the large banks, and stepped up supervision.
The SNB has been an active supplier of liquidity to the market, while the monetary policy
stance has been relaxed aggressively. In addition, there has been a fiscal expansion.
However, more may yet be needed if the turmoil continues; determining the optimal policy
mix to address both possible further economic weakening and continuing financial sector
vulnerabilities will be the key challenge for the authorities looking ahead.
3.
Strong macro-financial linkages will drive policy choices. Maintaining financial
stability will be essential for ensuring macroeconomic stability and a return to growth in
Switzerland—while also having positive spillovers to international financial stability.
However, despite sound fundamentals, the limited size of the Swiss economy places a
constraint on what the government can responsibly do to support the large financial sector.
This puts a premium on tight regulation and effective supervision, and on coordination and
cooperation between home and host country authorities. Potential problems will need to be
addressed at an early stage, before large-scale rescue packages with major fiscal implications
become unavoidable.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK

4.
Switzerland’s economic performance in recent years has been strong. Real GDP
growth averaged 3 percent from 2004 to 2007—significantly above potential (about
2 percent) and the euro-area average (2.3 percent)—while inflation remained muted
(1 percent). Exports and financial service flows rose rapidly in line with a favorable external
environment, allowing the 2006 current account surplus to peak at 14.5 percent of GDP.
Investment was supported by strong corporate profitability and capacity utilization—at
87 percent—was well above its long-term average. Unemployment fell under 2½ percent,

even as cross border working and immigration flows increased labor supply. A fiscal rule
resulted in budgetary surpluses in 2006–07 of some 2 percent of GDP.

5.
The financial sector crisis, however, has hit Switzerland hard. While UBS has
been affected the most, both large banks have reported write-downs and losses, and
underwent multiple capital injections, mostly via preference shares and convertible bonds.
Job cuts have so far been mostly outside of Switzerland but are now also affecting domestic
operations. In 2008, total revenues at the two big banks fell by 81 percent, while net new
money flows into assets under management (AUM) dropped. Some institutions have suffered
rating downgrades. Reflecting these losses, and the turmoil in global markets, the Swiss
equity index fell by about 40 percent over last year. Investment and bank financial service
income in the balance of payments—a key source of external income—declined by over
80 percent in 2008.
6.
The economy entered a recession in the second half of 2008. Although the
economy expanded by 1.6 percent in 2008, real GDP contracted by 0.2 percent in the second
half of the year. Growth in exports slowed, falling from 9½ percent in 2007 to under
2½ percent in 2008, with a marked fall in the fourth quarter, as world trade collapsed. From
the supply side, financial intermediation value added declined by about 7½ percent.
Investment spending contracted since the second quarter, as firms scaled back plans given the
deteriorating outlook. However, with labor markets robust, private consumption grew by a
still healthy 1.7 percent, a rate not much lower than in 2007.

There was agreement that the slowdown will deepen (Figure 1). At the time of the
mission, staff expected Swiss GDP to contract by 2.3 percent in 2009, and hover around zero
in 2010. Given a further deterioration in the indicators, the growth forecast has declined to

The precise impact of the financial crisis on potential output growth remains
uncertain. The authorities noted that potential output growth would be constrained over the
next few years, but it was too early to quantify this. Given the financial sector’s weight in
value added and the importance of financial intermediation to growth, estimates of potential
growth should decline. However, the permanence of recent labor migration and productivity
gains—which could bolster the economy’s resilience—were unknown. The authorities noted
that under purely statistical methodologies potential growth would fall below 1.5 percent and
that uncertainty surrounding potential output spilled over into uncertainty regarding outputgap/inflation dynamics.

Switzerland has a relatively high “vulnerability to deflation” indicator and low inflation persistence given
inflation shocks (IMF Staff Position Note, “Gauging Risks for Deflation”, January 2009).

III. MACRO-FINANCIAL LINKAGES AND RISKS
10.
Risks to the outlook are sizeable, on the downside, and depend on developments
in global demand and financial markets.
•

The baseline outlook incorporates a contraction in Switzerland similar to the one
experienced by the euro zone. Swiss real sector activity is correlated with euro area
growth. The euro area is facing the prospect of a sizable and extended downturn
which will spill over into Swiss export activity (63 percent of Swiss exports are to the
European countries). However, as an open economy with a large financial sector, the
probabilities of a larger contraction are non-trivial. Possible mitigating factors include
the diversification of the Swiss economy, aggressive monetary policy relaxation, and
the absence of a housing boom.

•

Swiss fortunes are aligned with the health of the global financial system (Box 1).
A fall in equity prices is associated with declines in financial service exports, and real
growth. Returns on equity for the two large banks have been good predictors of the
future direction of the economy. There is a risk to the outlook in case the problems at
the two large banks continue—which will show up in a further reduction in
investment income and financial service flows, and a deeper, more protracted
recession. The financial crisis is affecting other parts of the Swiss financial system
(e.g., insurance companies and pension funds) as well.

Lower market capitalization tends to be reflected
in lower Swiss growth.

Box 1. Macro-Financial Linkages and Spillovers
The financial sector accounts for a large share of economic activity. In 2008, financial
intermediation accounted for about 9 percent of GDP (12 percent including insurance and pensions) and
5½ percent of employment. In terms of growth rates, financial intermediation directly contributed about
1 percentage point (pp) to Swiss real GDP growth (annually) between 2004 and 2007.
As the financial sector deleverages and shrinks, the amount of assets available to generate value
added (VA) will decline. Growth in banking sector assets and financial sector VA is highly correlated
(0.75). In 2008, the banking systems’ total assets fell by 10.4 percent, while financial sector VA fell by
7.2 percent. Given the financial sector’s overall weight in VA, the drop in banking assets placed direct
downward pressure on growth of about 1.4 pp. At the same time, negative shocks to financial
intermediation will also spill over onto the rest of the economy placing added indirect downward
pressure on growth. A VAR regression using quarterly data for 1980-2008 suggests that a 1 percent
contraction in the value added of financial intermediation reduces real GDP over the next 4-6 quarters
by about ½ pp. Thus a 7.2 percent decline in financial intermediation could result in a 3.5 pp decline in
real GDP growth (which encompasses both effects) within a year. This reduction in growth is in line
with the staff’s projected swing in Swiss growth rates (from +1.6 to -3.0 percent). Other real sector
shocks (e.g., trade), which are not included here, are also expected to hit the economy.
Growth in financial sector assets underpins
growth in financial sector value added.

In addition to growth effects, financial sector balance sheet shocks also imply sizable contingent
fiscal liabilities. The April 2009 GFSR indicated that Switzerland’s financial system is systemically
vulnerable to shocks emanating from other international financial centers.

11

11.
Increased equity market volatility has resulted in safe haven flows and upward
pressure on the Swiss franc. The Swiss franc plays a traditional role as a safe haven—
appreciating in times of heightened uncertainty. With the decline in equity prices and return
of risk aversion, real and nominal exchange rates became quite volatile. The franc
appreciated by 8 percent against the euro in the span of a few months, reaching less than SFr
1.45 per euro at the end of October 2008, due in part to the unwinding of carry-trades. A
marked reduction of interest rates pushed the rate above SFr 1.57 per euro by midDecember—which was reversed by early March as the rate declined to 1.47 leading up to the
SNB policy meeting. There has been a clear link between exchange rate appreciation and
economic growth in recent years.

There is little evidence of a domestic credit crunch. Private sector financing costs
are rising and lending conditions are becoming stricter in trading partner economies
(Figure 3). However, the SNB’s survey of 20 major Swiss banks indicated that the vast
majority had not tightened lending conditions. Given that the majority of Swiss private sector
credit is in mortgages, the absence of a housing bubble, and a resurgent Pfandbrief (covered
mortgage bond) market which has supported credit supply, Switzerland is expected to avoid a
sharp contraction in domestic credit. The decline in domestic private sector credit growth
(down 6 percentage points from its 2007 peak to 3.8 percent year-on-year in February) has
stabilized. However, private household demand for credit, both mortgage and non-mortgage
related, has slowed.

IV. ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL STABILITY
13.
Switzerland remains a competitive economy but export market shares have
declined. Switzerland's exports have expanded rapidly along with the cyclical up-tick in
world trade. In many capital-intensive and luxury good areas, Swiss exporters were well
placed to increase gross volumes as the world economy boomed. However, Switzerland's
goods exports have lost market share in their major markets in recent years. Exports declined
by 8 percent in real terms in 2008Q4 and by 14 percent in the first two months of 2009.
While pharmaceuticals and chemicals—which make up about 1/3 of total exports—have
remained relatively stable, demand for raw and semi-finished materials, and luxury goods has
fallen sharply. At the same time, growth in labor productivity (GDP over hours worked)
averaged about one percent from 2002–07, slightly under its historical norm of about 1.3
percent. Over the same period, average euro area and U.S. labor productivity rose by 1.1 and
1.8 percent, respectively.

The Swiss franc has appreciated since the
start of the crisis.

CGER finds the exchange rate to be broadly in equilibrium, but a stronger-thanexpected deterioration in the financial sector could imply overvaluation pressures going
forward. The equilibrium exchange rate approach in the current reference period suggests an
overvaluation of about 1 percent, while the two current account based approaches

15
(macrobalance and external stability) imply an undervaluation of about 1 and 9 percent,
respectively (based on Fall 2008 CGER). On net, the average of the three methodologies
suggests that the franc is broadly in equilibrium. Given sizable downside risks to the Swiss
financial center and potential growth, a sharp decline in export market shares, as well as large
contingent liabilities, a more pessimistic scenario may suggest that the exchange rate is on
the strong side.
V. FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
A. The Authorities’ Response to the Crisis
16.
The authorities have moved proactively to reduce the impact of the crisis on the
economy and to stabilize the financial system. In hindsight (and in common with other
countries), the authorities did not act forcefully enough to mitigate the buildup of risks to
financial stability in the run-up to the crisis. However, since the start of the turmoil they have
reacted swiftly. The SNB has actively cooperated with other central banks to ensure liquidity
in the international interbank market. They pushed for recapitalization of the two large banks
at an early stage and, when the crisis worsened in October 2008, introduced a plan to relieve
pressures on UBS from bad assets without weakening its capital adequacy. They enhanced
deposit insurance arrangements. Swiss regulators have also taken a lead in developing tighter
financial sector regulation to help prevent crises in the future. The various measures have
been coordinated to maximize the impact on fragile market confidence.
Interbank Liquidity

16
Financial Sector Stabilization Package
18.
The stabilization initiative for UBS comprised both asset purchases and
recapitalization (Appendix I). The main measures were the transfer of $39 billion
(equivalent to 8½ percent of GDP) of distressed assets to an SNB-sponsored special purpose
vehicle and a capital injection of SFr 6 billion from the Swiss Confederation into UBS. Funds
for the capital injection came from budgetary surpluses and did not require additional
borrowing. The government’s stake is in the form of mandatory convertible notes, which it
hopes to sell before conversion. Credit Suisse did not participate in the asset purchasing plan
but instead undertook a SFr 10 billion capital increase, placed with major global investors.
19.
The government made clear its readiness for further action if needed—and if
private sector solutions proved insufficient. At the same time as it announced the
arrangements for UBS, the government indicated that it (and the SNB) would take further
steps, if necessary, to safeguard financial stability. In particular, it would guarantee, as
needed, new medium-term bank borrowings of Swiss banks in the capital market. No
guarantees have so far been given. Further losses, including on banking book risks (which
have not been addressed by the stabilization measures to date) may yet create a need for new
intervention, including capital injections accompanied by shareholder dilution. However, the
authorities would look for private sector solutions first. In this regard, the mission welcomed
efforts to channel funds from the small banks, increasingly favored by depositors, to the
larger banks through the covered bond market.
Financial Safety Net
20.
Switzerland has a developed bank resolution and insolvency framework. The
Swiss government reformed the law applying to insolvency of banks and securities dealers in
line with the April 2008 FSF recommendations. The regulatory authority has extensive
intervention powers and is itself the authority for initiating and overseeing insolvency
proceedings. Until recently, the only need to use these arrangements was in respect of
unauthorized firms, but in 2008 they were applied successfully to the small Swiss subsidiary
of a foreign bank.
21.
The authorities have moved to strengthen deposit insurance, while initiating a
fundamental review of the arrangements (Box 2). The pre-crisis deposit insurance system
factually could only protect smaller depositors at the small and medium-sized banks.
Coverage was limited, overall covered payouts capped, financing ex post, and there could be
delays in larger payouts. These arrangements risked being insufficient to maintain depositor
confidence in case of problems. While coverage has now been extended, the mission noted
that the system remains unfunded and still cannot fully cover large banks’ deposits. The
Federal Council has initiated a fundamental review of the system, due for completion later
this year. The mission welcomed the review, noting the importance for countries with large
banking systems of containing the contingent liabilities for government that can be created

17
by deposit insurance. In this context, the mission noted that a blanket guarantee for deposits,
as given last year by governments in some major economies, would not have been credible in
Switzerland, where deposits are about six times GDP.
Box 2. Deposit Insurance
On December 20, 2008, protected coverage was raised to SFr 100,000 per depositor from
SFr 30,000 per depositor previously. In addition, the overall cap on the system-wide liabilities
of the deposit insurance system was raised to SFr 6 billion from SFr 4 billion. The move
followed increases in deposit insurance in other financial centers (a blanket guarantee for
household deposits in Germany and Ireland in October 2008, and increases in limits in the U.S.
and the U.K. in December 2008). The coverage of the insurance system is broad, comparable to
that in the U.S. and the U.K., but the limit per depositor is less than that temporarily imposed in
the U.S.

Regulation and Supervision
22.
The authorities have moved swiftly to enhance financial sector oversight and
strengthen regulation (Appendix II, Box 3). Supervisors intensified their oversight of
major banks early in the crisis and have been extending this approach to insurance companies
as they began to suffer from the economic downturn. Extensive regulatory reforms are being
introduced, to take effect, where appropriate, when the crisis is over (to avoid reinforcing the
downturn) but giving a clear signal now that regulation will be much more demanding in the
future. The authorities noted that they will continue to balance participation in international
regulatory work (e.g., FSF, Basel Committee) with a readiness to implement measures that
they think appropriate to the Swiss financial sector. Similarly, they have been taking a
stronger lead in international cooperation on the supervision of major groups, responding to

18
some limitations of previous arrangements with foreign supervisors that have been
highlighted during the crisis.
Box 3. Key Elements of Regulatory Reform in Switzerland
Capital adequacy
•
Basel II requirements to be strengthened in line with the Basel Committee’s evolving
standards;
•
Increased capital buffers (under Pillar 2) above the Basel II minimum requirements for
the two major banks, including a cyclical adjustment (by 2013);
•
The introduction of a minimum leverage ratio, including a cyclical adjustment (by 2013);
•
A redefinition of eligible capital.
Stress-testing
•
FINMA is developing a “building block approach” to supplement the existing top down
stress tests conducted by the SNB. Results will inform management discussions and can
be input in capital adequacy decisions.
Liquidity
•
New requirements are planned for the two large banks in 2009 and will be extended as
appropriate to other banks.
Remuneration
•
FINMA will issue guidance on remuneration practices.
Note: See Appendix II for details.

23.
The reform of capital requirements for the big banks is an important step with
innovative elements. In addition to increased capital under Basel II, for the large banks
FINMA has introduced a minimum leverage ratio (core tier 1 capital as a percentage of assets
excluding domestic lending) and provisions to vary the actual minimum required of banks to
reflect economic conditions. The two banks have until 2013 to comply, with a longer
deadline possible. By applying Basel II and leverage ratios together, with higher
requirements in “good times”, FINMA expects to address both the procyclicality of existing
risk-based requirements and incentives created by leverage ratios for banks to increase risk
assets and off-balance sheet business. The authorities noted that by defining “good times” by
reference to profit cycles of individual banks, they have ensured that adjustments will be
automatic and independent of judgmental estimates of the economic cycle.
24.
FINMA is also reforming its requirements in relation to stress-testing, bank
liquidity, and remuneration. In addition to the focus on capital, the reforms are addressing
other weaknesses in regulation, in some cases extending work that was started before the
financial crisis. For the stress test and liquidity requirements for banks, FINMA will apply
the new approach initially to the major banks only, reflecting the significance of the
shortcomings in these areas. But they will also be applied to other banks in due course,

19
depending on experience with the major banks. The authorities emphasized that planned
FINMA guidance on remuneration, helpful in the context of controlling investment banking
risks, will apply to all regulated entities.
25.
Overall, the reforms address key issues for the large Swiss banks but should be
kept under review. In particular, the reforms tackle pressing needs for improved liquidity
standards and higher capital for investment banking. They respond well to the international
reform agenda. The program needs to be kept under review in the light of further
international work, for example on developing a macroprudential focus to regulation. While
welcoming the new capital framework, the mission suggested that the exclusion of domestic
lending from the leverage ratio calculation, while necessary in current economic
circumstances, should be reconsidered in the future. The authorities noted they would do so,
particularly if a minimum leverage ratio were introduced by the Basel Committee.
26.
Insurance regulation is also now being tested by the crisis. While overall
insurance sector exposure to US subprime and related risks is limited, regulators are having
to respond to strains imposed by wider market falls, on life companies in particular. Major
reforms since the sector’s problems in 2001–03 have strengthened balance sheets and helped
equip FINMA to manage the crisis. But the full benefits of the reforms, including those of the
Swiss Solvency Test and the Swiss Quality Assessment, will be felt over coming years. In
the meantime, the authorities have resorted to intensive monitoring of existing solvency
standards and “tied assets” (those backing reserves). They are responding to solvency and
liquidity pressures and have stepped up cooperation with foreign supervisors of major
groups.
27.
The new integrated regulator FINMA is well-placed to strengthen supervision.
The Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), the Swiss Federal Banking Commission
(SFBC) and the Anti-Money Laundering Control Authority were merged on January 1, 2009
under a long-planned reform. The creation of FINMA has enhanced the capacity of
regulators to implement changes resulting from the crisis and strengthened their hands in the
supervision of the major banking and insurance groups. FINMA had a somewhat challenging
start and a debate about its governance and staffing model was reopened. The authorities
emphasized their commitment to strengthening governance as necessary.
28.
Additional resources will help to ensure the effectiveness of the new
organization. FINMA is a public law body, accountable to the Federal government but
enjoying institutional and financial independence. In particular, it has appropriate flexibility
to recruit staff with required skills. FINMA has 315 full-time staff at present (April 2009)
and a budget in 2009 equivalent to $88 million. The authorities noted that FINMA will
increase total resources to 355 full-time staff, while emphasizing the need for the appropriate
level of skills and experience. The mission welcomed the planned strengthening of staffing

20
and noted that FINMA currently has somewhat light resources compared with those of other
integrated regulators.5

emerging market exposure had been only

30.
The deleveraging process has been slow among the large banks (Figure 4).
Although the Swiss banking sector remains well-capitalized on a risk-weighted basis (Tier 1
capital ratio and capital adequacy ratio), low “permanence of capital” (in the form of tangible
common equity) and still high balance sheet leverage have dented confidence in the ability of
large Swiss banks to absorb further valuation losses. Despite a significant amount of noncore
asset sales, basic leverage ratios have even reverted back to levels last seen in early 2008.
Estimates could be higher depending if securities holdings were marked-to-market and how
negative deferred tax liabilities are applied in the calculation of Tier I ratios.

5

Based on the supervisory budgets of integrated financial sector supervisors in similar industrial countries, and
using the size of assets under supervision and the degree of concentration of the sector as comparator metrics,
the supervisory budget for Switzerland could be expected to fall within a range of $70-190 million. This
tentative calculation abstracts from differences in responsibilities and operating procedures among supervisors.

31.
Funding pressures for the large banks require close monitoring. The funding
market for bank-issued debt instruments remains depressed as banks strive to bolster their
balance sheets and shore up their capital basis in anticipation of higher leverage ratios. Given
that demand for bank term debt has largely disappeared, markets may demand some form of
government guarantee—a contingency the authorities would consider, as announced in the
October package of stabilization measures—to secure short-term financing of the two large
banks. At the same time, the shift of deposits from the large to the smaller banks within the
system, has added to liquidity concerns. At the time of the mission, the large banks felt that
they had sufficient sources of short-term funding.

Insurance and Pension Funds
33.

The insurance sector has suffered from the downturn in markets:

•

Most life companies reduced equity risk following the 2001–03 market falls but
retained other significant market risk through corporate bonds and alternative
investments that were not either matched by liabilities or fully hedged. Rising credit
spreads, higher liquidity premiums, lower interest rates and increased market

The authorities noted that bank information remains confidential and that to implement the exchange of
information in individual cases on request, Switzerland will renegotiate double taxation agreements bilaterally

While non-life insurance is less affected, the reinsurance sector faces particular
challenges. Non-life business globally is relatively unaffected by the crisis. However,
a major reinsurance group is exposed to deteriorating credit conditions through some
credit default swap contracts and other structured finance exposure acquired under a
strategy to diversify from core business.

34.
Further market weakness could create serious stress at life insurance companies
in particular, with implications also for pension funds. The authorities noted that life
insurers’ liquidity is not now under pressure, giving them time to take strengthening
measures, while solvency ratios still exceed the minimum at major firms. For most
companies, the key pressures may arise from weaknesses in the business model exposed by
the crisis (particularly the high capital drain and risk management challenges in guaranteed
business). However, more severe pressures, even liquidity strains, are not impossible should
there be a further market downturn. Given the high proportion of pension funds underwritten
by insurers, there would be adverse impacts on the pensions sector were life insurance
policyholder benefits to be put at risk.
35.

values. A growing number of Pillar II pension

36.
The authorities are monitoring the
impact of the crisis on these sectors and their wider implications. The guarantees
provided by the insurance and pension sectors are insulating Swiss policyholders and pension
fund members from some of the direct wealth losses experienced in some other countries.
But their capacity to absorb shocks is clearly limited. In this context, there is a particular
need for pension fund supervisors (based in the cantons, but coordinated by a new
confederation level body) to balance the needs both to restore funding ratios promptly and to
avoid exacerbating the downturn through strong measures.

VI. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES
37.
The SNB has used monetary policy to good effect in a difficult environment
(Figure 5).
•

The SNB kept the monetary stance unchanged in the first three quarters of 2008,
offsetting higher risk premiums through lower repo rates. Infusions of SFr liquidity in
interbank markets, use of longer-term repos, foreign exchange swaps, and new
refinancing facilities lowered risk premiums and helped to ease appreciation pressures
on the currency. Monetary and financial conditions continued to tighten nonetheless.

With the economic slowdown worsening, inflationary expectations rapidly falling and
the currency appreciating, the SNB moved forcefully, relaxing the monetary policy
stance by 225 basis points over a period of about two months at the end of 2008. With
1-week repo rates at 5 bps since September, the SNB had effectively moved to a zero
interest rate policy at a relatively early stage. Longer-term rates, however, remained
elevated.

At the time of the discussions, the SNB saw rapid Swiss franc appreciation as the
main risk to the economy. Despite a widening of interest rate differentials as the SNB cut

haven flows. Currency volatility had also

period of time had worked during the last
episode of deflationary risks in 2003. However, the SNB emphasized verbal intervention
alone might prove insufficient in the current environment of risk aversion.
39.
However, options to counter an unwanted tightening of monetary and financial
conditions are limited. It was acknowledged that deflation risks, while increased, are still
limited, credit is still available, and that the full effect of the already considerable monetary
easing has yet to be realized. The authorities agreed that quantitative easing measures may
not be overly effective, and entail increased risk to the SNB balance sheet. However, they
emphasized the need to employ them, both to affect expectations and avoid the worse-case
scenario of a deflationary spiral. With banks hoarding liquidity, a further sharp increase in
the monetary base may not generate a subsequent rise in credit. Most short-term Swiss
interest rates were already near zero. Direct bond purchases could be undertaken to lower
longer-term interest rates, but Swiss debt markets are quite shallow, and an intervention
could prove disruptive. In this context, direct foreign exchange intervention was seen by the
SNB as the most effective monetary policy option.

At the mid-March meeting after the Article IV mission, the SNB announced
measures—including currency intervention—to force a relaxation in monetary and
financial conditions.8 The SNB noted that a sharp deterioration in the economic situation
since last December and heightened deflationary risks over the next three years required
decisive action. With the SNB forecasting -0.5 percent inflation for 2009 and zero inflation in
the period 2010–11, the Libor target range was reduced by ¼ percentage point to between
zero and 75 basis points. Moreover, the SNB will target the lower part of the band, as
opposed to the usual middle point, a de facto easing of 25 basis points. Given unstable risk
premiums that are hampering the transmission of monetary policy, the SNB decided to
directly purchase private sector Swiss franc bonds. In order to counter an inappropriate
tightening of monetary conditions, the SNB also announced it would buy euros on foreign
exchange markets. This was the first foreign exchange intervention since 1995.9
VII. PUBLIC FINANCES

The fiscal position has improved significantly over the past four years
(Figure 6). The economic upswing and the consolidation since the introduction of the federal

The SNB has a mandate to ensure price stability, while taking economic developments into account. This
objective encompasses the prevention of both deflation and inflation.

The Swiss franc depreciated by about 4 percent against the euro (to SFr 1.54) on the day of the SNB
announcement. Chairman Roth stated that the intervention did not represent a reversal of the SNB’s traditional
monetary policy strategy.

of debt at end-2008 remained about 30–35 percentage points of GDP below that of the Euro
area average and Germany, and 20 percentage points below the U.S., as also reflected in
relatively low financing costs. At end-2008, the public sector had a net international asset
position of 21 percent of GDP, and 25 percent of GDP in the short-term.

B. Fiscal Projections and Policy
43.
Planned stimulus measures—and full use of automatic stabilizers—will result in
a general government deficit in 2009. The federal government’s plan to cancel some
deferred corporate tax liabilities, to bring forward investment spending (which triggers
cantonal cofinancing expenditures) as well as additional cantonal discretionary measures,
will result in a fiscal stimulus of about 0.8 percent of GDP. Accelerated public investment
plans account for about three-quarters

(about half) in tax cuts and rebates.
Apart from unemployment insurance, the impact of automatic stabilizers would be relatively
limited given the moderate size of government, and there was agreement that they should be
allowed to play fully at all levels. Although the direct impact of crisis-related financial sector
losses is limited, automatic stabilizers and planned fiscal stimulus measures will lead to a
significant deterioration in government balances. Deficits are now expected for federal as
well as cantonal, municipal, and social security budgets. At the general government level, a
deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP is expected.
44.
The authorities will consider an additional stimulus for the 2010 budget. At
¾ percent of GDP, current measures are smaller than those envisaged in other European
countries. The mission argued that additional fiscal stimulus when part of a coordinated
approach, could help dampen a negative confidence spiral. A package similar in size to the
2009 one would bring the average stimulus closer to the European average. The stimulus
could target one-off payments to low-income households with high multipliers and be
followed by more sustained, but slower, public investment. The authorities were open to a
further stimulus but noted that there are limits to the effectiveness of fiscal expansion given
Switzerland’s open economy. New initiatives would require further coordination with
cantonal governments—they undertake two-thirds of public investment and are the main
distributors of social assistance—and would take time to implement. The measures would
require use of the escape clause under the debt brake rule, which has just been extended to
include extraordinary expenditures from 2010. Moreover, it was noted that personal and
corporate income tax reforms are expected to widen structural deficits starting in 2011.
45.
Comprehensive reforms of entitlement programs, especially in pension and
disability insurance, will be required to ensure long-term sustainability. The Long-Term
Sustainability Report estimated that a permanent fiscal consolidation of 1½ to 2 percent of
GDP would be required to stabilize the stock of debt at its 2003 level. The Assessment of the
Tasks of Government identifies areas which could yield further expenditure savings in the

31
short- to medium-term. These are being
implemented beginning with the 2010
budget, but initial amounts are small. With
the approval of a temporary VAT increase
to finance deficits in disability insurance
(subject to approval in a September
referendum), parliament has requested a
proposal for a comprehensive reform of
the disability insurance system by end2010. Parliamentary approval is pending
for an increase in women’s retirement age
from 2014, after which more fundamental
pension reform will be considered.

Without corrective measures, long-term
demographic pressures will push up debt.

VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
The global crisis will result in a significant decline in growth. Strong trade and
financial linkages underpinned above-average growth during the global upswing. These same
linkages, however, expose Switzerland to the negative shocks that are now weighing heavily
on global activity. Indeed, the economy entered a recession in the second half of 2008, as the
financial crisis intensified and world trade fell sharply. Looking ahead, there are signs that
the decline will accelerate—creating additional domestic and international risks given
Switzerland’s large international financial center—before positive growth is expected to
return in the course of 2010.
47.
The size of the Swiss financial sector and its importance to the global economy
call for a clear focus on ensuring financial stability. Safeguarding stability is essential for
a return to growth and will also contribute to restoring international financial stability.
However, the size of the Swiss economy and limited public sector resources constrain the
authorities’ ability to support the financial sector without incurring unsustainable liabilities.
At the same time, the scope for market-based support mechanisms, such as industry-funded
deposit insurance schemes, is constrained by the high degree of concentration in the banking
sector. All this calls for strong, effective regulation and supervision, with a particular focus
on close monitoring of vulnerabilities, early identification of and response to risks, and
contingency planning to deal with possible stresses.
48.
The authorities have taken a proactive approach in reducing the impact of the
crisis on the economy—but more may be needed. They have relaxed the policy mix,
injected liquidity, and introduced measures to address risks to the stability of the banking
system. The creation of the bank stabilization fund, enhancements to deposit insurance, new
capital adequacy targets, and initiatives to channel funds to banks in need of liquidity have
bolstered confidence in the financial system. However, uncertainty about future economic

32
and financial sector developments remains, and further policy action—including capital
injections and government guarantees—may be required if the turmoil continues.
49.
Banks and other parts of the diverse Swiss financial sector will remain under
increasing stress. The two large banks continue to be highly leveraged despite a marked
shedding of assets, continue to hold some amount of distressed assets, and the system as a
whole is significantly exposed to creditors in emerging market countries. At the same time,
earnings streams will remain under pressure as credit demand falters and revenues from
private banking and wealth management business lines slow. Therefore, funding of banks
continues to require close monitoring. Life insurance companies and pension funds
operations are affected by lower asset prices. While many smaller and medium-sized banks
have benefited from cash outflows from larger banks, strong liquidity at these firms also
creates some risk of less prudent lending practices.
50.
The authorities are further developing the regulatory framework. Last year they
introduced an innovative reform of capital regulation for the large banks—applying both higher
risk-based capital adequacy requirements that adjust to downturns in bank performance and a
minimum leverage ratio—while acknowledging the need to avoid enhancing the current
downturn by tightening capital and other rules too early. More stringent liquidity regulations to
be introduced this year for the large banks respond to some weaknesses in international bank
liquidity standards highlighted by the crisis. Switzerland has a developed bank resolution
framework, but the recently extended deposit insurance regime should be put on a sounder
footing to ensure adequate protection of depositors in case of failure, regardless of the size of
bank. This requires, amongst other measures, the introduction of ex ante funding. The
authorities are addressing these issues and will bring forward plans later in the year.
51.
The establishment of a new integrated supervisor (FINMA) provides a good
opportunity to strengthen financial supervision. An independent and well-resourced
supervisory authority capable of responding effectively to the lessons of the financial crisis is
essential to maintaining financial stability. FINMA should continue its progress in enhancing
skills and resources, integrating sectoral regulatory approaches, and strengthening its forwardlooking systemic surveillance. It needs to develop a strong supervisory style, in close
cooperation with the SNB and foreign regulators. Continued intensive oversight of the large
banks, including their foreign operations, is essential. With stresses spreading to other parts of
the financial sector, there is also a need for close supervisory focus on the large (re)insurance
sector and on medium-sized and small banks. With respect to the supervision of the smaller
banks, this may require further development of the dual approach (with auditors) with increased
on-site examination by FINMA staff and close attention to potential weaknesses in work
delegated to auditors. In addition, there is a need to continue strengthening pension fund
supervision (by cantons) in line with earlier recommendations.
52.
An additional temporary fiscal stimulus—that does not undermine long-term
fiscal sustainability—is recommended. A low stock of debt and previous surpluses

33
provided space for the announced discretionary spending measures of about ¾ percent of
GDP in 2009. Full use of automatic stabilizers, and flexible application of debt brake rules,
should also help to limit any procyclical tightening impulses. Looking ahead, the
deteriorating outlook calls for some further stimulus in 2010, which could be similar in size
to that of 2009. However, with bond markets becoming more sensitive to long-run
sustainability concerns, as well as the need to preserve sufficient room for possible additional
financial sector support, any new stimulus should be temporary in nature and well targeted.
Long-term reforms of entitlement programs should remain on the authorities’ agenda.
53.
Policy interest rates have been appropriately steered toward zero as growth
prospects and inflationary expectations declined. Rising risk premia and persistent
currency appreciation due to safe-haven flows caused an undesirable tightening in monetary
conditions. Given the sharp deterioration in the economy and increasing deflation concerns,
there was a legitimate need to relax monetary conditions. The SNB’s shift to a quantitative
easing track in March—including intervention in currency markets to stem further
appreciation pressures—reflects limited options to further influence monetary conditions.
Unsterilized foreign exchange intervention within Switzerland’s floating regime should be
aimed at countering disruptive pressures, including those caused by safe haven flows. This
would also provide some positive spillovers, including for Eastern European countries. Once
the recovery commences, the SNB will need to exit quantitative easing, and reverse the
build-up in monetary base to protect price stability.
54.
Switzerland’s current account surplus reflects structural factors. The surplus is
mostly structural, reflecting the country’s high per capita income, an aging population, and
its position as an international financial centre. The writedowns of financial assets and
decline in investment income flows will cause a reduction in the surplus in the near term.
Some of this decline is structural, although it is too early to assess how much.
55.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12
month cycle.

Appendix I. The SNB Stabilization Fund
The authorities undertook a stabilization initiative for UBS through distressed asset
purchases and a capital injection (Table A). On October 16, 2008, the Swiss Confederation
announced that it will strengthen the UBS capital base by subscribing to mandatory
convertible notes to the amount of SFr 6 billion, while the SNB created an SPV entity that
would absorb problem assets (“bad bank” model). The SPV is funded by a first loss position
taken by UBS, which is assumed to cover 10 percent of the SPV asset portfolio, and by a
$35 billion non-recourse SNB loan—collateralized by the assets of the fund. The capital
injection from the government came from the structural surplus, while the SNB initially
procured the funds required for the transfer of the illiquid assets into the SPV from the
U.S. Federal Reserve by means of a U.S. dollar – Swiss franc swap.
Owing in particular to amendments made to international accounting standards since
the announcement of the stabilization measure, the transfer of assets has been reduced
from its original level of approximately $60 billion to approximately $39 billion. The
SNB and UBS agreed that certain categories of assets (structured products backed by student
loans and assets that have been wrapped by monoline insurers) are to be withheld from the
StabFund. The decision to retain the structured products on student loans reflected changes to
IFRS accounting standards (IAS39) in October 2008 that made it possible for UBS to
reclassify these assets (from “held for trading” to “loans and receivables”). The reclassification resulted in cost savings from accepting a low impairment charge (in lieu of the
10% equity contribution and possibly an additional write-off at the transfer price agreed by
the SNB). The impact on UBS in the short term is similar to that of the StabFund in that
further pressures on net income from mark-to-market losses have been avoided. By not
transferring these assets, UBS remains exposed to possible impairment of the assets.
Assets have been transferred at prices set by an independent valuation process. In two
steps, the SNB StabFund acquired assets from UBS in the equivalent amount of about
$39 billion. Asset prices were determined by the SNB based on a valuation conducted by
third-party valuation experts. The assets purchased were primarily U.S. and European
residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities as well as other asset-backed
securities.

Capital injections of financial institutions have been administered through a wide range of capital and
subordinated debt instruments.

Appendix II: Regulatory Reform in Switzerland
The financial services regulator FINMA, in collaboration with the SNB, is undertaking
extensive reforms to its regulatory framework to respond to the lessons of the financial crisis.
The main elements are as follows.
Capital adequacy
Basel II, including the Pillar 3 disclosure requirements, has been implemented for all Swiss
banks. Six groups use the Internal Ratings-Based approach for credit risk and two the
Advanced Measurement Approach for operational risk. Under Pillar 2, all banks are required
to hold capital at least 20 percent above the Basel II 8 percent minimum ratio (the “Swiss
finish”). The reforms will provide for:
•

Changes in the calculation of the Basel II ratio in line with Basel Committee
standards. The emphasis on revised requirements for trading book risks will make the
impact particularly strong for the major Swiss banks because of the continuing
significance of their investment banking business.

•

Increased capital buffers (under pillar 2) above the Basel II minimum requirements
for the two major banks: starting on 1 January 2013, they will have to meet a
minimum ratio (capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets) of 12 percent—but
higher “in good times” (see below).

•

The introduction, also from 1 January 2013 and just for the two major banks, of a
minimum leverage ratio: they will have to hold capital as a percentage of
(unweighted) assets of 3 percent at group level and 4 percent at bank level – and
higher “in good times”; the ratio calculation excludes domestic lending (except
interbank) and selected assets used in central bank repos, and allows use of Swiss
GAAP measures of positive replacement value on derivatives that recognize a higher
degree of netting than IFRS.

•

Variations to address the procyclicality of existing requirements: the Basel II
minimum will rise to as much as 16 percent of risk-weighted assets in good times and
the minimum leverage ratio will also be significantly higher. “Good times” are
defined as periods of at least two years in which a bank generates profits of at least
the normal level for the industry.

•

A redefinition of eligible capital (for both Basel II and leverage measures) to
anticipate changes planned by the European Union in the revised Capital
Requirements Directive.
Stress-testing

•

FINMA is developing a “building block approach” to supplement the existing top
down stress tests coordinated by the SNB. Large banks are required to submit
sensitivity analyses for their main risk clusters which FINMA uses to assess the
impact of its scenarios.

•

FINMA will use the results to inform risk management discussions with the banks
(especially vulnerability to future shocks) and possibly as an input into capital

46
adequacy decisions. The two banks submitted initial results in relation to June 2008
data, the analysis of which will help FINMA refine the approach.
Liquidity
•

New requirements are planned to be introduced for the two large banks in 2009 and
extended as appropriate to other banks. Banks will have to demonstrate their ability
to withstand a liquidity crisis on the basis of scenarios defined by the regulator. The
details are under development. They will capture bank specific and market wide
stresses.
Remuneration

•

FINMA will issue guidance later this year on remuneration practices. This will be
applicable to all regulated financial companies and will address risks in all areas of
business, not only investment banking. It will draw on FINMA’s experience in
approving 2008 UBS bonus allocations, a FINMA task under the stabilization
package.

The Swiss National Bank reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All
settlements are made at free market rates. Switzerland maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for restrictions in place for security reasons notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision
No. 144-(52/51).
On April 2, 2009, Switzerland notified the IMF of the exchange restrictions that have been
imposed against certain countries, individuals, and entities, in accordance with relevant UN
Security Council resolutions and EU regulations.
In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, restrictions are currently in place with
respect to specific individuals and entities associated with the former government of Liberia,
Iraq, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Al-Qaïda network, specific individuals and
entities posing a threat to international peace and security in Côte d’Ivoire, in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), impeding the peace process in Sudan, engaged in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)–
related programs, ban on financing and financial services related to the provision of arms and
related materiel to Lebanon, specific individuals and entities involved in the nuclear and/or
ballistic missile programs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The lists of individuals and entities
against whom financial sanctions are in force are based on the decisions by the competent UN
Security Council sanctions committee and are amended regularly.

3
In accordance with EU regulations, restrictions are currently in place with respect to specific
individuals associated with the previous government of the former Republic of Yugoslavia,
Zimbabwe, Myanmar, ban on financing and the provision of financial services related to
military activities in Uzbekistan, specific individuals and entities associated with the
government of Belarus. The lists of targeted individuals are identical to the list in the
corresponding EU regulations.

Appendix II. Switzerland: Statistical Issues
Switzerland’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Switzerland generally publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full observance of SDDS
requirements, and it is availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options on dissemination of
production index data (for periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and earnings data (for
periodicity). However, a number of statistical gaps and deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a
lack of resources and the limited authority of the Federal Statistical Office (BfS) to request
information:
•

reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due to
delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;

•

pension statistics are published with a long lag;

•

GDP by industry appears with a considerable lag.

To address deficiencies, the authorities are taking or intend to take the following steps:
From July 2006, the SNB conducts the monthly survey on the cost of borrowing. Data on
financial flows and non-financial assets was published in 2007. In conjunction with the SNB’s
centennial, long-run historical time series covering monetary aggregates, capital markets, and
the SNB balance sheet have been published. At the end of 2007, the SNB introduced a new
monthly survey on interest rates for various banking products. Under the agreement with
SFBC on reciprocal exchange of data, the SNB has since 2007, been collecting the new capital
adequacy statement information, in accordance with Basel II. Since 2007, the SNB has
conducted surveys of Liechtenstein-based companies when preparing its international
investment position. In order to gain information on the effects of the financial crisis on
domestic bank lending, the SNB has been collecting qualitative data on the lending policies of
about 20 banks since the first quarter of 2008. The results of the survey complement the
quantitative data obtained from existing statistics. This supplementary quarterly survey is only
temporary and not published.
Annual national accounts were upgraded in 2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004 data, the Secretariat for Economics (SECO)
revised accordingly its quarterly national account estimates. SECO started publishing in
March 2006 a quarterly production account. The main innovations in the new national accounts
were in investment (with detail on information and communications technology), private and
public consumption (hospitals were transferred to the private sector), and the use of chain price
indices (without adjustment for quality).

5
In 2004, a statistical cooperation agreement was concluded with the EU as part of Bilateral II
for the harmonization of several Swiss statistics with EU standards.
The Federal Finance Administration has started preparations for revamping fiscal statistics
with the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, the reform of the
accounting standards for cantons and communes (Harmonisiertes Rechnungslegungsmodell
der Kantone HRM2) and the introduction of full accrual budgeting and accounting at the level
of the federal government (Neues Rechnungsmodell Bund NAM) along the lines of the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Figures according to the new
accounting standards have been produced for the federal government (NAM) 2007 and for
some cantons (HRM2) for 2009. Figures according to GFSM2001 may be reported beginning
in 2009. A ROSC mission on fiscal transparency took place during January 16–29, 2009.
Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled by
the SNB and meet international standards. However, monetary gold transactions relating to
sales of gold reserves not required for monetary policy purposes have not been correctly
reflected in the balance of payments. For legal reasons, and until the distribution of the
proceeds of gold sales between the SNB and the Federal Department of Finance was concluded
in February 2005, the proceeds of the gold sales not needed for monetary purposes were
considered as part of the official reserves in the balance of payments. After that date, they
appear in the position “other assets of the SNB” in the balance of payments.
Switzerland participated in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators of the soundness of the
financial system (for year-end 2005) has been posted on the IMF website.
The authorities have made progress in completing the implementation of the FATF
AML/CFT recommendations. The federal law implementing the revised FATF
Recommendations was adopted by the Swiss Parliament in October 2008 and entered into
force on February 1st 2009. Supervisory ordinances on the private insurances, gaming, banking
and non banking sectors have also been adopted, and a revised banking association due
diligence code has come into force in mid-2008. The Swiss authorities last reported on these
reforms to the FATF in February 2009.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On May 18, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Switzerland.1
Background
Switzerland’s recent economic performance has been strong. From 2004 to 2007 real
GDP growth remained above potential—and the euro area average—while inflation was
muted. Exports and financial service flows rose rapidly in line with a favorable external
environment, and unemployment fell to 2½ percent, even as cross border workers and
immigration flows increased labor supply. A fiscal rule resulted in budgetary surpluses in
2006–07 of some 2 percent of GDP.
Global credit strains, however, have had an impact on the financial sector. Financial
sector writedowns have been substantial, requiring sizeable capital injections and staff
cuts. While deleveraging at financial institutions is ongoing, domestic lending has
remained on a steady pace. The absence of a housing and credit bubble, in particular,
has helped to support credit growth.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The economy entered a recession in the second half of 2008. Growth in exports slowed,
falling from 9½ percent in 2007 to 2¼ percent in 2008, with a marked fall in the fourth
quarter, as world trade collapsed. From the supply side, financial intermediation value
added declined by about 7 percent. Investment spending contracted since the second
quarter, as firms scaled back plans given the deteriorating outlook. However, with labor
markets robust, private consumption grew by a still healthy 1.7 percent, a rate not much
lower than in 2007. Leading indicators, however, suggest the downturn will deepen.
Economic growth is expected to decline from 1.6 percent in 2008 to -3.0 percent in 2009
as the worsening external environment takes its toll on exports and financial sector
inflows, and lower employment will gradually weaken consumption.
Headline inflation averaged 2.4 percent in 2008, while core inflation was about 1½
percent. CPI inflation declined sharply in late 2008 due to fuel and food price decreases
and is expected to remain negative in the near-term, given base effects and a weak
global environment. For 2009, inflation is projected to average -0.6 percent, with
negative inflation continuing into 2010. Flat real wage growth helped to support
competitiveness, but export market shares have fallen.
With inflationary expectations declining rapidly, and the currency appreciating due to
safe haven effects, the SNB aggressively relaxed the monetary stance. The SNB’s
target range for the 3-month Libor has been decreased by 250 basis points since
October and now stands at 0 to 0.75 percent. To counter an unwanted tightening of
monetary and financial conditions, the SNB implemented quantitative easing measures
in March, including foreign exchange intervention to limit upward pressure on the Swiss
franc.
The fiscal stance was neutral in 2008. The general government recorded a surplus of
about 1 percent, as continued surpluses at lower levels of government offset a small
federal deficit. Debt to GDP ratios have fallen below 42 percent but aging-related
expenditures are expected to reverse this trend in the medium-term. A fiscal impulse
and full use of automatic stabilizers are expected to push the general government
balance into deficit in 2009.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Switzerland’s strong growth performance over the last
few years, but noted that the global financial crisis and collapse in world trade had
pushed the Swiss economy into a recession in the second half of 2008. Given
Switzerland’s openness and the size of its financial sector, the economy is projected to
experience a significant contraction in the near-term, with sizable downside risks to the
outlook.
Against this background, Directors observed that the key policy priority is to maintain
domestic financial stability, which would contribute also to international financial stability
given Switzerland’s strong international linkages. They commended the authorities for

3
their proactive and effective response to date to limit the fallout from the financial
turbulence. In particular, Directors welcomed the relaxation of macroeconomic policies,
creation of the bank stabilization fund, enhancements to deposit insurance, and
introduction of innovative capital requirements, including a minimum leverage ratio.
They also praised the authorities for their active cooperation with other central banks,
including in Eastern Europe, to ensure liquidity to the international interbank market.
Looking ahead, Directors noted that persistent financial sector turmoil may require
further policy actions. They therefore welcomed the authorities’ commitment to take
prompt action if needed and their preparation of contingent policy strategies. With
regard to the financial sector, Directors stressed that strong and effective regulation and
supervision will remain key, with a particular focus on monitoring of potential
vulnerabilities—such as earnings of the large banks and related funding pressures—and
on early response to risks. Directors welcomed the increased capital requirements for
large banks and the authorities’ recognition of the need to avoid exacerbating the
downturn by tightening these rules too soon. Some Directors felt that government
guarantees could be helpful to ensure funding of systemically important institutions.
Directors considered that the deposit insurance scheme, while improved, should be put
on a sounder footing through the introduction of ex ante funding.
Directors observed that the creation of a new integrated supervisor (FINMA) provides a
good opportunity to strengthen financial supervision. To this end, FINMA should make
further progress in enhancing resources, integrating sectoral regulatory approaches,
and strengthening forward-looking systemic surveillance. Continued intensive oversight
of large banks as well as close supervision of the large (re)insurance sector will also be
essential. Other important actions will be increased on-site examination by FINMA staff
and strengthened pension fund supervision undertaken by the cantons. Directors
welcomed the adoption by Switzerland of the OECD standard on administrative matters,
which will permit a fuller exchange of information with foreign tax authorities.
Executive Directors supported the authorities’ relaxation of monetary policy as growth
prospects and inflationary expectations have declined. Most Directors considered that
the recent shift to quantitative easing—including intervention in currency markets to
stem further appreciation pressures—was appropriate, and reflected limited options to
further influence monetary conditions and counter deflation risks. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to a timely and orderly exit from quantitative easing once
recovery commences, and their intention to reverse the build-up in the monetary base to
protect price stability. Careful communication of policy intentions by the authorities will
remain important.
Directors commended Switzerland’s strong fiscal performance in recent years, which
has provided room for the welcome fiscal stimulus in the 2009 budget and the full use of
automatic stabilizers. Many Directors considered that a further stimulus package in 2010
would be appropriate given the severity of the current downturn and the available fiscal
space. Many other Directors, however, supported the authorities’ intention to consider
further stimulus in 2010 should prospects deteriorate further, and underlined the need to
preserve fiscal space for possible additional financial sector support given the significant
uncertainty surrounding global financial developments. All Directors agreed, however,
that long-term fiscal sustainability requires that any new stimulus be temporary and

4
targeted, and that long-term reforms of entitlement programs remain firmly on the
authorities’ agenda.
While noting that Switzerland’s large external current account surplus largely reflects
structural factors, Directors recognized that writedowns of financial assets and a decline
in investment flows will likely cause a reduction in the surplus in the near-term. Taking
into account these considerations, Directors agreed with the staff assessment that the
exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Switzerland
May 18, 2009

1.
On behalf of the Swiss authorities, I would like to thank the staff for a very thorough
report, their thoughtful and well-balanced analysis, and the candid policy recommendations.
We consider this a very good standard for Fund Article IV reports, both in terms of quality
and detail. It also sets an example of how financial sector issues should be incorporated in
Article IV reports.
2.
The Swiss authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment and specific policy advice.
They welcome the positive assessment of their response to the financial market turmoil to
date. Looking forward, in most areas - and in particularly in the area of financial sector
stability, - my authorities have developed wide-ranging policy strategies that should only be
implemented if the economic situation deteriorates further, or when private sector solutions
are lacking. At this stage, my authorities do not see a need for additional policy measures.
3.
Following strong performance in recent years, driven not only by external demand
but also by private consumption, external shocks pushed the Swiss economy into recession in
the second half of 2008. Given its openness and the importance of the financial sector, the
Swiss economy will experience a significant contraction. However, there are mitigating
factors. Credit developments have continued to develop favorably through February, and
since there has been no housing bubble in Switzerland, the construction sector – supported by
favorable mortgage rates and rising real housing prices – still experiences a very satisfactory
degree of capacity utilization.
Monetary policy
4.
Given the size of the shock and the traditionally low level of inflation in Switzerland,
deflationary risks are clearly present. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) expects headline
inflation to remain in negative territory throughout 2009, and to average around -0.5 percent
over the year. As regards 2010, inflation should hover around 0 percent. It might even be
slightly positive, but the uncertainties remain very large at this stage.
5.
My authorities fully share the staff’s description and appraisal of Swiss monetary
policy. In particular, the report adequately describes the constraints and reasons for the recent
shift to unconventional measures. The SNB has early and aggressively relaxed the monetary
policy stance. Given the low interest-rate level in Switzerland, the SNB reached the zerointerest-rate floor earlier than other central banks. In mid-March, when a further expansion of
monetary policy became necessary, the SNB took three additional measures: increasing the

2
number of longer-term repo transactions, purchasing Swiss franc bonds issued by private
sector borrowers, and buying foreign currency on the open market. The SNB has also stepped
up the provision of Swiss-franc liquidity outside of Switzerland. Foreign banks are allowed
to participate in the SNB’s repo transactions since 1999, but since the end of last year the
SNB is also providing Swiss-franc liquidity via swap lines to the ECB and the National Bank
of Poland, and since this year to the Hungarian central bank and to the Fed.
6.
The decision to purchase foreign currency on the foreign exchange market was taken
in order to prevent a further appreciation of the Swiss franc, which would have defeated the
SNB’s efforts to counter deflation risks. The aim was not to reinforce artificially the
competitiveness of the Swiss economy but to limit undue appreciation of the Swiss franc.
This decision must be understood against the backdrop of the very limited options available.
Interest rates were effectively at zero, and interest rate differentials with other currencies
were widening.
7.
The Swiss authorities are aware of the necessity of an orderly and timely exit of the
current exceptional monetary policy stance in order to reduce liquidity and maintain price
stability in the future. The SNB has the necessary instruments at its disposal, including the
recently introduced SNB bills. My authorities are also conscious of the fact that the exit will
have to occur before unemployment ceases to increase, which will require a particular
communication effort.
Maintaining financial sector stability
8.
My authorities broadly share the staff’s view on financial sector issues and welcome
the positive assessment of the measures they have undertaken to support the stability of the
financial system. They are aware of the uncertainties in financial markets and the real
economy lying ahead. In the past, they have communicated effectively and proved that they
are ready to act swiftly if needed. Structures and instruments for additional support are in
place and are constantly being optimized.
9.
As a general point, the Swiss authorities attach considerable importance to the costs
of public interventions both in terms of fiscal costs and market distortions, and prefer private
sector solutions whenever possible. The only banking sector intervention so far has been the
one to support UBS, with a transfer of US$38.7 billion of distressed assets to an SNBsponsored special purpose vehicle, and a capital injection of SFr 6 billion from the Swiss
Confederation. No government guarantees of bank debt or of bank borrowing have been
granted, and there is no apparent need for such measures so far.
10.
Exposure of Swiss banks to emerging markets, mentioned in paragraphs 29 and 49 of
the staff report, are not a significant concern of my authorities. Exposure is not significantly

3
higher than for other small advanced countries, and it is more diversified, with a higher
exposure to the Asia/Pacific region, where growth rates are still positive.
11.
My Swiss authorities fully agree with the importance of international cooperation,
and they are well aware of the systemic importance of the two large Swiss banks and the two
largest Swiss (re)insurers. Both the SNB and FINMA have been actively involved with their
respective foreign counterparts in the exchange of information and the coordination of policy
responses. Switzerland is also actively contributing to the multilateral efforts and
international initiatives in the relevant international fora.
12.
The key regulatory reforms are well described in the staff report. The requirement for
Swiss banks to hold capital well above international standards will continue, and the capital
buffers for the two large banks will be increased even further, including a cyclical
adjustment, while a minimum leverage ratio will have to be observed. Also, FINMA
introduced a regular, mandated stress testing exercise with the two large banks to supplement
the existing top down stress tests conducted by the SNB. Previously initiated initiatives to
address the immediate and long-term risks in the insurance sector were further advanced
(Swiss Solvency Test; quality assessment of governance, risk management, and internal
controls). For FINMA, the benefits of being an integrated supervisory agency are becoming
evident.
Fiscal policy
13.
Despite the economic slowdown in 2008 and measures to stabilize the financial
sector, the general government continued to register a surplus for the fourth consecutive year.
The surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP stemmed mainly from cantons and municipalities,
whereas at the federal level, expenditures increased significantly in 2008 because of
budgeted extraordinary spending, as well as the support for UBS. However, a large part of
the increase was compensated by the much better than expected revenue performance. The
strong fiscal performance across all levels of government in the past years has led to a sharp
decline in public debt levels, with gross public debt currently at 41.5 percent of GDP.
Uncertainties regarding the outlook for 2009 and 2010 are significant. For 2009, my
authorities currently project a general government deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP, which is
lower than the staff’s projection.
14.
Against the backdrop of strong fiscal performance at all levels of government during
recent years, Switzerland can allow the full use of its automatic stabilizers. This, together
with the discretionary measures adopted at the federal and cantonal level for 2009, will
provide a combined stimulus of around 1.4 percent of GDP. Staff’s estimate is lower, which
partly reflects the definition of stimulus measures. On this issue, my authorities underscore
the need for caution with cross-country comparisons. In particular, my authorities are not
persuaded by the assessment of the size of the Swiss automatic stabilizers used in the staff

4
report, which depends largely on the definition of measures to be included, on
methodological uncertainties and on country-specific conditions, such as the lag of automatic
stabilizers. In any case, the economic impact of automatic stabilizers corresponds to a large
extent to IMF fiscal policy advice, i.e., the effects are temporary, they kick in when economic
activity is low, and they benefit mostly households whose buying power is at risk.
15.
The federal authorities have taken a phased approach in providing additional fiscal
stimulus to the economy, with the scope of the measures depending on the expected depth of
the economic downturn. The measures were carefully selected to ensure a timely, targeted,
and temporary effect. As noted by staff, the authorities will consider an additional stimulus in
2010, should the outlook deteriorate further. This decision must be considered carefully,
since this would require that the escape clause under the fiscal rule (the “debt brake”) be
invoked.
16.
In judging the appropriateness of the fiscal stimulus, my authorities carefully weigh
the effectiveness of the measures. An important element in their considerations is not to
compromise the positive effects of the recent fiscal consolidation efforts. The authorities
consider that an adequate balance has been achieved in strengthening confidence through
timely actions without weakening confidence by taking on excessive future liabilities. As
regards the latter, my authorities fully share the staff’s view that comprehensive reforms of
entitlement programs will be key to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. The efforts under
the Assessment of the Tasks of Government will be stepped up as soon as the economic
recovery is on solid grounds.
