STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 14, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Growth performance in Bangladesh has been strong the past few years, bolstered by
efforts to reduce longstanding infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly power generation,
and aided by accommodative policies. Despite global uncertainties, near-term prospects
remain favorable, supported by resilient garment exports, a more reliable electricity
supply, and consumption-boosting remittance inflows.
At the same time, macroeconomic pressures are intensifying. The balance of
payments is under strain owing to increased demand for oil and capital goods imports
and elevated levels of commodity prices. Fiscal pressures have emerged due to rising
subsidy costs, mainly on account of increased fuel consumption. Finally, inflation is at
a multi-year high, with aggregate demand pressures and food price increases the
major drivers.
Policy discussions focused on upfront actions needed to reduce these pressures, as
well as reforms aimed at boosting medium-term growth prospects and reducing poverty.


On the macroeconomic front, official fiscal and monetary targets for FY12
(July 2011–June 2012) provide solid anchors, but achieving them requires timely and
well-coordinated policy actions. To this end, subsidy costs should be reduced by
adjusting fuel and electricity prices in order to protect priority spending and contain
the budget’s domestic financing requirement. Interest rates need to be made more
flexible to boost demand for government paper, minimize central bank financing of
the budget, and allow the envisaged monetary tightening to be transmitted to the real
economy. The greater exchange rate flexibility observed recently should help relieve
external pressures.



In structural areas, further reforms to tax policy and administration, public financial
management, monetary and exchange rate operations, the financial sector, and the
trade and investment regime should help bolster growth and poverty reduction
efforts and reduce external vulnerability.

BANGLADESH

INTRODUCTION
1.
Growth performance in Bangladesh
is improving, but macroeconomic
imbalances have also emerged. Official
estimates place real GDP growth at 6.7 percent
in FY11 (July 2010–June 2011), up from
6.1 percent in FY10 and an average of
5.8 percent over the last decade (Table 1). At
the same time, inflation is now in double
digits, running at a three-year high. Despite
record export growth, the balance of payments
(BoP) went into a deficit in FY11 for the first
time in a decade. As a result, foreign reserves
slipped from their highs in late 2010. To
absorb external pressures, the taka was
allowed to depreciate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
over the past 12 months, in contrast to the
preceding three years, when the exchange rate
was kept stable but imbalances built (Figure 1).
2.
Medium-term growth targets are
appropriately ambitious, but they are also
likely to intensify macroeconomic pressures
if not managed well. Under the government’s
Vision 2021 and backed by its Sixth Five-Year
Plan (2011–15), growth is targeted to increase
to 8 percent by FY15 and 10 percent by FY21.1
If realized, the poverty rate is expected to
decline from 31.5 percent in FY10 to
22.0 percent in FY15, driven down by more
inclusive growth. Achieving this vision will
require Bangladesh to leave behind the low
revenue-low investment-low growth
equilibrium highlighted by Directors during
the last Article IV consultation. Since then,
growth has picked up and other signs of

as their new poverty reduction strategy paper. The
plan will replace the National Strategy for Accelerated
Poverty Reduction II (FY09–11).

progress have emerged, through a rising tax
take, higher public investment, and rapidly
expanding exports, although each from a small
base. Growth in ready-made garment (RMG)
exports, in particular, has been a major
employment generator, especially for women,
who make up 80 percent of the sector’s four
million workers. Micro, agricultural, and smallto-medium enterprise credit opportunities
continue to multiply. However, the
infrastructure deficit is enormous (see
Appendix I), foreign direct investment (FDI)
remains dismally low (at well under 1 percent
of GDP annually), and employment
opportunities are still limited, as exemplified
by the large number of workers seeking
opportunity abroad.
3.
The 2011 Article IV consultation
focused on accelerating growth-promoting
structural reforms, while ensuring a stable
macroeconomic environment. Discussions
took place against the backdrop of an ongoing
dialogue on a possible IMF-supported
program.2 In this context, reform priorities of
the government are appropriately focused on
tax policy and administration, public financial
management (PFM), monetary and exchange
operations, the financial sector, and the trade
and investment regime. They are intended to
help bolster growth and poverty reduction
efforts and reduce external vulnerability. Until

2

The staff and authorities have been discussing the
policy framework for a possible three-year Extended
Credit Facility arrangement over the past year. In early
2011, a terms-of-trade shock due to rising oil prices
and policy accommodation put additional pressure on
the BOP, requiring further adjustment. Since then,
policy discussions have continued on a range of issues
needed to address these pressures.

A key indicator of the external position—the sum of net
exports and remittances—has weakened, with the uptick
lately largely due to pre-Ramadan remittance inflows.

Turnover in the official interbank foreign exchange market
dwindled in January-February and May-June, as BB
intervention was at below market-clearing rates.

Instead, banks started buying and selling at a much more
depreciated exchange rate than the official rate, although
market and official rates have now reconverged.

these reforms take hold, BOP pressures are
likely to intensify. These pressures, in part,
stem from import-intensive investment now
on the rise as Bangladesh tackles power,
transport, and water supply bottlenecks, which
have dampened growth performance. Efforts

to address electricity shortages are already
leading to a surge in oil and capital goods
imports, with the immediate focus of the
government’s Power and Energy Sector Road
Map on installing fuel-intensive rental power
plants to boost the power supply.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Macroeconomic Developments
4.
The economy expanded at a strong
pace in FY11, but external and inflation
pressures also intensified.




6

Growth and inflation: Growth in FY11 was
buoyed by services, construction, and
manufacturing, led by RMG exports and
supported by accommodative policies
(Figure 2). Headline inflation has been
pushed up the past year primarily by food
prices, reaching 11.3 percent (y/y) in
August 2011. Nonfood inflation is also on
the rise owing to demand pressures,
reaching 8.8 percent in August.
Balance of payments: External factors and
domestic demand conditions contributed to
a marked deterioration in the overall BOP in
FY11, with external vulnerability on the rise
(Box 1). Weak aid inflows added to BOP
pressures. Export growth (42 percent), fueled
by gains in global market share for RMGs,
was more than offset by import growth
(42 percent), with its larger base driven up by
demand for oil, RMG- and food-related, and
capital goods imports , as well as a surge in
commodity prices (Table 2 and Figure 3). At
the same time, remittances growth slowed,
owing to declines in manpower exports since
2009. As a result, the current account surplus
eroded by almost 3 percentage points of
GDP in FY11 to about 1 percent of GDP.
Performance in FY11 deviated from the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

recent past, when strong remittance growth
and suppressed import demand resulted in
large current account surpluses and rapid
reserves buildup.


Gross official reserves were
US$10.0 billion at end-FY11 (2.9 months of
prospective imports of goods and
nonfactor services), compared to
US$10.1 billion at end-FY10 (3.4 months of
import cover). However, this masks
underlying pressures, in part owing to
valuation gains (US$639 million) and
nonreserve asset sales (US$145 million) by
Bangladesh Bank (BB) to help finance the
BOP deficit. Reserves stood at
US$9.4 billion (2.6 months of import cover)
as of end-September 2011.



Exchange rate: The taka also came under
pressure, having depreciated by around
7 percent against the U.S. dollar over the
12 months to end-September 2011,
notwithstanding about US$1.4 billion in
official foreign exchange sales by BB,
including foreign exchange overdrafts
(FXODs), over the same period. In recent
months pressures have eased, due partly
to seasonal factors, but also owing to
increased reliance by Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation (BPC) on
short-term nonconcessional suppliers’
credit to finance oil imports.

Bangladesh’s reserves adequacy is low by most
measures, including compared to regional peers.
Under the current outlook, foreign reserves are
projected to decline to around 1½ months of import
cover by FY15—again very low by most standards and
pointing to fairly sizable financing and adjustment
needs to reduce vulnerability. In the past, Bangladesh
often relied on administrative measures and moral
suasion to cope with low levels of reserves. However,
with the increased openness of the economy, a return
to these practices would be counterproductive. Most
importantly, it could discourage remittance inflows
through formal channels. These flows have become a
key driver of the current account in recent years and
provided important support again in FY11,
notwithstanding a slowdown in their growth.

100

Nepal

At a glance, Bangladesh’s susceptibility to a global
downturn appears limited, but declining foreign
reserves makes it increasingly vulnerable to shocks.
Under a scenario with a global downturn akin to the
2008–09 global recession, the current account could
deteriorate by an additional ½ percentage point of
GDP in FY12, while GDP growth could be lower by up
to ¾ percentage point relative to the FY12 baseline.
This would translate into additional reserve losses of
around US$500 million, bringing foreign reserves down
to around two months of forward import cover by endFY12.

Reserves, in percent of Broad Money

Bangladesh’s economy has become increasingly
open in recent years, but it still remains insulated
compared to regional peers. Despite impressive gains
over the past decade, total exports were only
21 percent of GDP in FY11. However, they remain
highly concentrated both in terms of products and
destinations, which carries some risk, with RMG exports
to the E.U. and the U.S. the current mainstay. As a
reputable low-cost producer of garments, Bangladesh
has gained further global market share in recent years.
This trend is expected to continue over the medium
term, which could partially mitigate the impact of slow
growth in advanced economies.

5.
The fiscal stance in FY11 was
moderately expansionary, with an overall
deficit (including grants) estimated at
3.7 percent of GDP (Tables 3 and 4, and
Figure 4). While less accommodative than
budgeted, the deficit was financed almost
entirely domestically, with a sizable portion
from BB.


Revenue: Tax revenue surpassed
10 percent of GDP—a major milestone for
Bangladesh, with gains coming mainly
through tax buoyancy and administrative
reforms (i.e., automation, registration, and
enforcement).3 At the same time, nontax
revenue missed the mark, reflecting
unanticipated delays in collecting
telecommunications fees and other
receipts.



Expenditure: Annual Development
Program (ADP) spending increased to
4.2 percent of GDP—its highest level in
four years, but still below budget.4 On the
other hand, subsidies and transfers,
including net lending to BPC, far exceeded
the budget. They were driven up by
higher-than-anticipated commodity prices,
food security measures (see Appendix II),
and subsidy-related transfers to energy
and fertilizer-related state-owned

enterprises (SOEs), notwithstanding recent
fuel price and electricity tariff adjustments
(Box 2).5 To cover its losses, BPC also
received financing from state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs) and the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB), which could
eventually bear on the budget.6


Budget financing: External aid inflows fell
substantially in FY11, elevated in the
previous year by crisis-related budget
support from the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB). Domestic nonbank financing
declined further, too, in part due to less
favorable tax treatment and nominal yields
on National Savings Certificates.
Consequently, domestic bank financing
rose sharply. Suppressed treasury yields
shifted added burden onto BB, directly
through increased ways and means
advances and overdrafts to the
government and indirectly through
targeted liquidity support provided to
primary dealers to encourage participation
in treasury auctions.

6.
Monetary policy remained
accommodative in FY11, with BB taking only
partial tightening measures, despite the
prevailing loose credit conditions and inflation
5

Tax revenue in Bangladesh is still very low as a share
of GDP, comparing collections in its most recently
completed fiscal year with those in Vietnam
(24 percent), China (18 percent), India (15 percent),
Nepal (13 percent), and Sri Lanka (13 percent).

In February 2011, bulk and retail electricity prices
were raised by 5 and 11 percent, respectively. In May,
petroleum prices were increased by around 4 percent,
and compressed natural gas prices by 49 percent. In
September, petroleum prices were raised by a further
11 percent.

The implementation rate of foreign-financed projects
remains low, as was the case in FY11. A July 2010
report prepared by Bangladesh’s Ministry of Finance
identified overlapping responsibilities of central
government agencies and a process- rather than
results-oriented approach as main factors in hindering
the planning, budgeting, and ultimately
implementation of aid-funded development projects.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

In FY08, the government securitized SOCB loans to
the BPC, then equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP. At
end-FY11, SOCB loans to SOEs amounted to
1.9 percent of GDP, of which half were to the BPC. In
addition, BPC’s outstanding debt to the IsDB was
estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP at end-FY11; this debt
is guaranteed by the government and is captured in
the DSA.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Bangladesh: The Budgetary Impact of Subsidies1
Subsidy costs in Bangladesh are increasing
rapidly, mainly due to higher domestic demand
and rising import-related costs of heavily
subsidized products—namely fuel, electricity, and
fertilizer. Currently, broad subsidies are used to
shield consumers from the full impact of price
movements. For the largest ones, they are initially
absorbed in the financial positions of large stateowned enterprises (SOEs)—namely Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation (BPC, fuel), Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB, electricity), and
Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC,
fertilizer). Operating losses for these SOEs are, in turn,
covered by loans from state-owned commercial
banks, direct budget transfers, and/or net lending by
government (effectively transfers).
The largest single contributor is fuel subsidies,
which could undermine fiscal sustainability absent
price adjustments. This cost alone could rise to
about 1.6 percent of GDP in FY12 from 1.0 percent in
FY11 and 0.1 percent in FY10, mainly due to the lack
of pass-through of higher oil prices and rising energy
demand. Even after the latest price hike, the retail
price of diesel in Bangladesh would have to rise by
another 44 percent, by staff estimates, for the BPC to
break-even, i.e., to cover its import and operating
costs. Higher subsidy costs in FY12 do not factor in
potential smuggling to India, where diesel prices at
end-September 2011 were about 40 percent higher
than in Bangladesh. Electricity and fertilizer related
subsidies are expected to be around 1½ percent of
GDP in FY12. On the other hand, food-related
subsidies, though increasing in FY11, appear to be
contained to around ¾ percent of GDP (see
Appendix II on food security).

The government has indicated that budgetary
transfers are expected to fully cover SOE losses, a
substantial departure from past practice. Still,
major reforms to these SOEs are urgently needed to
contain costs. Although below-market pricing has
contributed significantly to their poor financial state,
some losses also stem from operating inefficiencies.
Regular audits of these SOEs are critical to improving
their financial health.
Without further fuel and electricity price
adjustments, subsidies are likely to rise over the
medium term. Greatest concern arises from fuel
imports for power generation, notably at new rental
power units being set up to provide short-term relief
to major electricity shortages (see Appendix I on
infrastructure development). These units, as well as
several new natural-gas fueled power plants, will
drive energy demand over the next few years.
Recent and prospective increases in the price of
petroleum products will likely have knock-on
effects on other SOEs. For instance, electricity tariff
adjustments announced in February 2011 may not be
sufficient to contain the BPDB’s operating losses if
the input costs for its power plants and the newly
setup rental power plants rise.
Effect on the poor. Evidence on welfare impact of
fuel prices in Bangladesh suggests that there is a high
degree of subsidies leakage to mid-to-upper income
households. Moving to cost recovery for fuel and
electricity would obviate the need for subsidies to
loss-making SOEs. Some of the freed-up government
resources could be used to enhance safety nets for
the most vulnerable groups.

pressures (Table 5 and Figure 5). As a result,
the central bank missed its reserve money
target by a wide margin in FY11. In part,
monetary policy effectiveness continues to be
constrained by weak anchors and objectives
(Box 3). Under these conditions, private credit
expanded rapidly in 2010 and the first half of
2011, with growth peaking at a record
29 percent (y/y) this past March. It moderated
to 23 percent (y/y) in August 2011 (the latest
available data). With some delay, BB began
raising its repo rate in August 2010—
cumulatively now by 275 bps to the current
7.25 percent, while also increasing its cash
reserve requirement in December 2010.
Nonetheless, repo auctions continued to be
severely oversubscribed in much of FY11
owing to strong credit demand and negative
real rates. To address emerging liquidity
pressures at banks, BB resorted occasionally to
open market purchases, in addition to
providing regular and emergency repo
support. At the same time, most bank lending
rate caps were lifted in March 2011, with a
subsequent 200–300 bps rise in their base
rates.7 Bank-by-bank credit-to-deposit ratio
(CDR) ceilings were imposed around the same
time.
7.
Financial sector stability remains a
concern (Box 4). Despite newly adopted
Basel II standards, solvency risk among some
banks may be increasing, exacerbated by rising
liquidity pressures, stock market exposure, and
weak supervisory oversight. Recent external

audits of the SOCBs pointed to still lax
controls. Financial soundness indicators at
these and specialized banks remain
significantly weaker than at private banks,
notwithstanding some recent improvement
(Table 6). Equity markets have been volatile,
fueled in part by loose credit conditions. The
main Dhaka index has fallen by about a third
from its December 2010 all-time high (when
total stock market capitalization exceeded
50 percent of GDP), after market valuation
tripled during 2009–10. Attempts to cushion
the fall by relaxing margin lending
requirements for retail investors and providing
market support through public financial
institutions (including through the new
Bangladesh Fund) have potentially elevated
fiscal risks and created moral hazard.8 Equity
markets remain grossly under-regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
subject to extensive manipulation, as found by
a high-level probe in mid-2011 looking at the
preceding market drop.
8.
The debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) indicates the risk of external debt
distress is low, reflecting the high degree of
concessionality and relatively low level of
external debt (22 percent of GDP). However,
debt burden indicators are less favorable when
domestic debt (21 percent of GDP) is included.
Risks are also more elevated when taking into
account contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal
activities of SOEs and SOCBs.

Lending rate caps remain on agriculture, industrialterm, and SME loans, as well as loans for the
importation of several other items.

Box 3. Bangladesh: Improving the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy1
Monetary policy in Bangladesh is constrained by
several factors, which limit its effectiveness. At
the outset, the multiplicity of objectives in
Bangladesh Bank’s (BB) half-yearly Monetary Policy
Statements (MPS) lead to an obscured focus on price
stability, providing a weak anchor for inflation
expectations. The July 2010 MPS, for example, stated
BB’s monetary policy stance as “…designed to
support government’s policies and programs in
pursuit of faster inclusive economic growth and
poverty reduction, while also maintaining price
stability.” The January 2011 MPS speaks to the need
to keep monetary expansion in line with GDP
growth, but also seeks a “growth supportive
approach” involving financial inclusion and directed
credit, conflating several objectives. The July 2011
MPS, however, has a clearer focus on restraining
credit.
Further clarity is needed on the relationship
between monetary aggregates and prices, as well
as inflation dynamics, in order to properly
calibrate monetary targets. While BB espouses a
monetary targeting framework, the link between
money growth and inflation has been tenuous. In
part, this may be due to the large weight of food in
headline inflation, which distorts measurement of
core inflation (currently proxied by nonfood
inflation). The effect of various lags also needs to be
better understood. For example, the second-round
effects from food price inflation to nonfood inflation
appear to be rising in recent years—a period when
global food prices have become more volatile.
Earlier limits to exchange rate flexibility have
contributed to deviations from monetary targets.
While BB purportedly had in place a monetary
targeting framework in recent years, it effectively
operated an exchange rate targeting framework until
late 2010, with the aim of stabilizing the taka against
the U.S. dollar. During this time, amidst heightened
external inflows, BB’s unsterilized interventions in the
foreign exchange market increased net foreign

assets, driving reserve money (RM) above
programmed levels (see table). The resulting buildup of excess liquidity likely contributed to asset price
inflation, including the stock market boom, and also
fed into rapid credit growth (see figure), sowing the
seeds for rising demand-driven inflation that
emerged in FY11.
Policy inconsistency has also undermined the
effectiveness of policy instruments. Attempts by
the central bank to tighten monetary policy in FY11
via increases in policy rates and reserve
requirements were undercut by its own expanded
provision of repos to primary dealers and foreign
exchange overdrafts to state-owned commercial
banks, causing RM to again exceed targets. The RM
overshooting has been exacerbated by BB’s direct
financing of the government deficit, which eventually
drove almost half of the expansion in RM, pointing
to the need to strengthen the whole monetary policy
framework by giving greater independence to the
central bank.

Box 4. Bangladesh: Recent Banking System Developments1
Broadly speaking, recent financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) point to marginally improved
performance for the banking system, but risk
factors remain. Capital adequacy ratios (CARs) have
improved across all banks, with 40 out of 47 in
compliance with new Basel II-consistent
requirements at end-June 2011 (i.e., a minimum CAR
of 9 percent). Key asset quality and bank profitability
indicators have also strengthened for most
categories of commercial banks, although private
commercial banks saw a slight rise in bad loans and
slippage in profit indicators in the first half of 2011.
However, banks’ true financial health is likely
masked by reporting standards that are not in
line with international best practices. For example,
loan classification standards, specifically the
definition of past-due loans, is more lenient than in
most banking systems, with loans delinquent by
3–6 months put in the “special mention” category
(against the standard 2–3 months) and loans
overdue by more than 18 months considered a
“loss” (against the standard 12 months). Loan
provisioning standards need to be more clearly
conveyed by BB to banks.
The financial performance and capital needs of
state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) require
special attention, as evident in their latest FSIs.
The same holds for specialized development banks,
although these institutions represent under
6 percent of total banking system assets. For the
SOCBs, CARs are overstated by most recognized
standards. In 2007, the authorities allowed special
accounts to be set up on the asset side of these
banks’ balance sheets, which reflected the difference
between the market and the book value of SOCBs’
assets. These accounts effectively represent
accumulated losses that have not been deducted
from the banks’ capital base. Each SOCB is expected
to amortize these losses against future earnings over
a 10-year period. Once the amounts booked in these
accounts are deducted from capital, the SOCBs’
average CAR drops to 1.5 percent from the reported
9.5 percent at end-June 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Bangladesh Bank has attempted to improve SOCB
operations through memoranda of understanding
(MOUs) and external audits. The MoUs set out
quarterly performance indicators for each bank.
However, they are routinely adjusted, potentially
undermining their effectiveness. Audit reports of the
four large SOCBs for the 2010 financial year drew
attention to lags in writing off bad loans, including
those classified as such for more than five years. The
reports also pointed to shortfalls in provisioning and
increased risk, due in some cases to profit
concentration in stock market investments rather than
from traditional banking activities.
For the banking system as a whole, recent risks
have arisen from:
 Stock market volatility. Most banks are currently
within the overall shareholding limit of 10 percent
of total liabilities. However, this limit is more
relaxed than the regional norm, which is typically
around 25 percent of bank regulatory capital (in
Bangladesh, this would be equivalent to
2.3 percent of total liabilities at end-June 2011).
Recent stress tests suggest that SOCBs’ capital
(adjusted for the value of the aforementioned
special accounts) would be depleted in the event
of further 25 percent decline in stock prices.
 Merchant bank subsidiaries. Commercial banks
have been allowed to set up subsidiaries since
October 2010. These newly created institutions
remain under-supervised, with parent institutions
possibly off-loading risk. Supervisory weaknesses
in the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
are directly responsible for overseeing these
subsidiaries, remain an issue.
 Liquidity pressures. Rapid credit expansion has
put liquidity pressure on some banks, exacerbated
by the December 2010 stock market correction,
heavy funding needs of government, and weak
secondary market development. In response, BB
imposed a ceiling on banks’ credit-to-deposit
ratios (CDRs) of 85 percent (90 percent on Islamic
banks) in mid-2011 to better align bank credit and
deposit growth. As of end-August 2011, 13 banks
exceeded the CDR limit.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
The growth outlook in FY12 is
favorable, but macroeconomic pressures
are likely to become more acute, putting
this outlook at risk without policy
adjustments. Real GDP growth is projected to
be 6.3 percent in FY12, with domestic demand
the main driver, bolstered by expansionary
policies. However, inflation is expected to
remain at an elevated level—projected at 10.7
percent (y/y) at end-FY12—given prevailing
aggregate demand conditions and food and
energy price pressures. The current account is
likely to slip into a deficit in FY12 of around ¾
percent of GDP, with the deterioration driven
by oil imports, putting more pressure on
foreign reserves and also adding substantially
to subsidy costs, without sizable fuel price
adjustments. Under this outlook, which itself is
subject to considerable uncertainty (see Box 1),
gross official reserves are projected to decline
to US$9.1 billion (2.3 months of import cover)
by end-FY12.
10.
The medium-term growth outlook
hinges on the government making steady
progress on key structural reforms aimed at
increasing government revenues; boosting
investment rates, including FDI; and expanding
the export base. Strong, transparent
governance will also be critical to improving
the business climate. In the event, real GDP
growth is projected to average 6¾ percent
during FY13-16 (Table 7). Inflation is expected
to fall over the medium term on moderate
policy tightening, stable commodity prices,
and easing supply constraints. However, BOP
pressures are likely to prevail, notwithstanding
a favorable export and remittances outlook, as
oil import volumes increase and infrastructure
investment intensifies. With reserves adequacy
already low, even the moderate projected

current account and BOP deficits are expected
to bring the import cover below 1.5 months
over the next several years, highlighting
Bangladesh’s potential financing and
adjustment needs and growing vulnerability to
external shocks.
11.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside. Continued loose macroeconomic
policies and weak policy anchors could be
further destabilizing. Possible fuel and
electricity price adjustments could add to
inflation pressures, if second-round effects are
not properly managed. Weaker-thanforecasted growth in mature economies could
weigh on RMG exports and remittances,
adding to BOP pressures. Likewise, insufficient
progress in addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks, including generating adequate
internal resources through tax reform, could
dampen both public and private investment,
potentially stifling growth. Lax oversight of
financial markets could exacerbate risks,
including fiscal ones, especially if excessive
market volatility invites further public
interventions. On the other hand, unforeseen
gains in RMG market share and an uptick in
manpower exports could cushion both growth
and external prospects.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment of near-term outlook and
risks. The official growth target is 7 percent in
FY12, pushed up by stronger domestic demand
than envisaged by staff. At the same time, the
authorities saw potentially larger pressures on
the current account owing to investment-related
import demand, financed, in part, from timely
disbursement of development partner resources,
including those associated with the Padma
Bridge mega-project (see Appendix I for more

details on the project). The authorities believed
realization of their near- to medium-term growth
and stability objectives required (i) a concerted
approach to ease power and infrastructure
bottlenecks, including through public-private
partnerships (PPPs); (ii) more incentives to the
garment sector to diversify to new markets;
(iii) new market penetration by Bangladesh’s

migrant workers, with better facilitation of inward
remittances through improved cross-border
financial linkages and innovations; and
(iv) strengthened regulations and supervision of
the banking sector to address potential risks,
including those emanating from the stock
market.

MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY
DISCUSSIONS
13.
Policy discussions for the 2011 Article
IV consultation focused on upfront policy
actions needed to preserve macroeconomic
and financial stability and on structural reform
priorities to support medium-term growth. For
FY12, staff noted that the fiscal and monetary
targets set forth in the FY12 budget and BB’s
Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) provided
solid anchors, but needed to be supported by
well-coordinated

policy actions, in particular on budget
financing. The authorities were also urged to
move forcefully on passing new tax laws,
bringing down subsidy costs, and further
tightening monetary policy, while at the same
time maintaining a flexible exchange rate. In
addition, staff also noted the need for more
progress on strengthening banking
supervision and SOCB operations, including
their governance.

A. Easing Subsidy Pressures and Creating Fiscal Space
Overview

Staff’s views

The official fiscal stance points to a further
widening in the overall deficit (including
grants) to 4.5 percent of GDP in FY12. However,
in staff’s view, expenditures are likely to be
more heavily tilted toward covering subsidy
costs. External financing is also expected to be
weaker than budgeted. In the event, the
domestic financing requirement will remain
large, with the burden expected to continue to
fall on BB. If so, monetary targets might be
seriously undermined, heightening inflation
risk. To ease subsidy pressures, staff urged
upfront adjustments to fuel and electricity
prices, coupled with further progress on
structural fiscal reforms.

14.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Main discussions focused on :
Containing subsidy costs. Maintenance of
fiscal space for vital social and
development spending requires urgent
action on fuel prices. In the event domestic
prices are not adjusted, total subsidy costs
are expected to rise to 3.4 percent of GDP
in FY12 from 2.2 percent in FY11, with
most of the increase to cover additional
losses by BPC. Staff urged that these costs
be brought fully on budget, but also noted
the need to contain subsidy growth
through a committed plan for fuel price
adjustments. As a first best option, an
automatic adjustment mechanism would

BANGLADESH

depoliticize pricing decisions. Staff urged
that any adjustments also come with welltargeted safeguards. Regarding
outstanding loans from SOCBs to lossmaking energy and fertilizer related SOEs,
staff cautioned that securitizing them
should be done only as part of broader
subsidy reforms.


Pressing ahead on tax reforms. Timely
approval of a new VAT law and direct tax
code would provide the main anchors to a
modern tax regime, as necessary for the
government to achieve its medium-term
tax revenue target of 13 percent of GDP. A
clear, time-bound strategy, inclusive of
stakeholder consultations, is needed to
finalize each law for Parliament’s approval.
For the VAT, staff noted that the
implementation could take 18–24 months
to execute, given extensive training,
procedural, and automation needs, with
considerable follow up technical assistance
(TA) anticipated.9 On direct taxes, staff
urged priority be given to the new income
tax provisions, as more controversial
wealth and property tax (excluding
agricultural lands) sections in the draft law
could slow its approval. Staff welcomed
the outline by the National Board of
Revenue (NBR) of a tax modernization
scheme (2011–16), which provides a
blueprint for a well-sequenced action plan
and future capacity building. The plan
envisages moving the NBR to a functional
system of organization, which should
streamline tax processes currently
separated across its income tax, VAT, and
customs wings. To strengthen the NBR’s

Kingdom’s Department for International Development.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

capacity, the government approved in
FY11 a long-time request to begin hiring
new tax officers. The NBR is also rolling out
a coordinated system of individual and
business taxpayer identification numbers.
In addition, it plans to further modernize
customs by putting in place the ASYCUDA
World System in the next few years, with
UNCTAD support.


Strengthening PFM. Reforms to planning,
budgeting, and procurement processes are
expected to be immediate priorities of the
government’s Strengthening Public
Expenditure Management Project
(SPEMP).10 The project, which will guide
PFM reforms, has been slow to start, and in
staff’s views also should aim to accelerate
reforms in cash and debt management.
Staff encouraged the government to
update its fiscal Report on Standards and
Codes (ROSC) to gauge progress against
the last ROSC (2003) and benchmark
future reforms. A Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment
was completed in 2011, identifying the lack
of transparency in inter-governmental
operations, poor oversight of aggregate
fiscal risk from public sector entities, and
weaknesses in expenditure controls,
internal audit, and fiscal reporting.
Regarding ADP implementation, staff
urged finalization of a plan to prioritize
projects, speed up approvals, and
strengthen procurement processes by
end-2011. A medium-term macro-fiscal
framework is being developed to enhance
the coherence between budget
formulation, resource availability, and

macroeconomic objectives. Staff welcomed
the new cell set up in the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) to oversee the use of
government funds in PPPs for
infrastructure development and
encouraged steps to ensure proper budget
integration of related projects. A PPP
office, to be staffed by professional
managers, has been established to guide
the overall process.


with a medium-term fiscal and debt
sustainability framework. With respect to
short-term nonconcessional borrowing by
the BPC, such borrowing should be done
in the context of broader strategies to raise
domestic energy prices and to address
BOP financing needs. On domestic
borrowing, staff urged that treasury bill
and bond rates better reflect market
conditions. Low, nonmarket clearing yields
undermine fiscal discipline, weaken the
monetary policy framework, and create
myriad distortions in the financial system.
In this context, BB, as the government’s
fiscal agent, should ensure cut-off rates
reflect prevailing supply and demand
conditions. Currently, primary dealers are
being effectively taxed through
devolvement, which impinges on banks’
profitability and may encourage excessive
risk taking in other activities.

Improving debt management. A strategy
to improve debt management is being
formulated by the MOF, which staff urged
be finalized by end-2011. On external
borrowing, staff pressed the need for
continued reliance on concessional
borrowing. At the same time, any mediumto-long term nonconcessional borrowing
should be limited to high-return
infrastructure projects and well-integrated

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly shared the
staff’s views. They noted their track record of
fiscal prudence and indicated that raising
revenue and boosting ADP spending were top
priorities. The budget framework adopted in
FY11 requires quarterly reporting by the MoF
to Parliament, which has increased fiscal
transparency.


16

On subsidy costs, the authorities
recognized the need to increase cost
recovery for energy. They noted that
various scenarios for phased increases in
retail petroleum prices were under active
consideration, with concerns about
inflation implications being weighed
against budgetary imperatives. The
authorities cited their own commitment to
semi-annual tariff increases for power over
the next three years, with increased

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

electricity supply allowing better service
delivery. They also indicated pending TA
from the World Bank on better tracking
subsidy schemes and effectiveness,
potentially delivering cost savings.


On tax policy and PFM reform, the
authorities were hopeful new VAT and
direct tax laws could be sent to Parliament
in the course of FY12, with the necessary
political consensus. However, they also
recognized a challenging political road
ahead, given numerous tax exemptions and
flagrant tax avoidance under the current
tax regimes. The authorities noted that the
SPEMP would continue to guide PFM
reforms, focusing initially on strengthening
budget planning and execution. The PEFA
assessment and a recent SPEMP-related
diagnostic study were expected to inform

BANGLADESH

other PFM reform priorities. The authorities
also indicated that an inter-ministerial
coordinating committee has been
established to prioritize ADP projects
(including externally funded ones).


2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

authorities viewed short-term
nonconcessional borrowing by BPC as
unavoidable, given necessary oil imports.
However, they accepted that the recent
rise in domestic borrowing was
unsustainable and that treasury rates
might need to rise further while other
steps were taken to bring the deficit under
control. The authorities also noted their
interest in seeking budget support from
the World Bank and other development
partners. They see this support as essential
until the government can adequately
expand its tax base.

On debt management and budget
financing, the authorities recognized the
need to develop a sound debt
management strategy. With Bangladesh
having received its first sovereign rating in
2010 (Moody’s Ba3 and S&P’s BB-), they
suggested a sovereign issue could be part
of their medium-term borrowing plans.
Under current circumstances, the

B. Allowing Monetary Tightening to Take Hold and Market Rates to Adjust
Overview
Monetary policy in FY12 needs to be
appropriately tight, but its effectiveness
requires greater policy coordination and
consistency. Bangladesh Bank’s performance
against its own targets has been weak owing
to a lack of central bank independence, an
inadequate liquidity management
framework, and delays in policy responses,
all of which have combined lately to
undermine BB’s nominal anchor and
increase inflation risk. In this respect, staff
welcomed recent increases in the repo rate,
removal of most lending rate caps, and
other tightening measures. Increased
exchange rate flexibility has also been
allowed in FY11, in line with Directors’
advice given in the context of the last Article
IV consultation, which has prompted staff to
reclassify the de facto exchange rate regime
from “stabilized” to “crawl-like.”
Staff’s views
16.

Main discussions centered around:



Tightening monetary policy. To achieve
its targets for key monetary aggregates
and contain inflation risks, BB needs to be
prepared to further increase the repo rate
and limit its market operations to meeting
temporary liquidity needs. Reserve money
growth should continue to serve as the
nominal anchor, with net domestic assets
of BB as an operating target. That said,
staff cautioned that fiscal loosening in
FY12 could lead to considerable monetary
easing, if the government continues to
depend heavily on BB to meet its financing
needs. In the event, staff expect reserve
money growth to be 22 percent in FY12,
against an official target of 16 percent.



Increasing interest rate flexibility. Repo,
interbank, and treasury bill rates should be
made more responsive to supply and
demand conditions, in order to improve
interest rate signals and strengthen the
monetary policy transmission mechanism.
Staff noted that the rationing of taka

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BANGLADESH

liquidity in repo auctions—where banks
currently seek a large uptake from BB at a
fixed repo rate—would be better
addressed by letting the repo rate respond
to excess demand, with the higher
emergency repo rate a step in the right
direction. Remaining caps on lending rates
should be phased out, and moral suasion
over deposit rates should be avoided, so
banks can meet their retail funding needs.


Operating a flexible exchange rate
regime. Bangladesh Bank should continue
to allow its buying and selling rates to be
guided by the average buying and selling
rates set by commercial banks to ensure
smooth market operations. To help further
develop the interbank foreign exchange
market, staff urged BB to limit intervention
to smoothing short-term volatility in the
exchange rate, ensure all banks remain
within their net open position limits, and

cease use of moral suasion on banks to
keep their rates stable. Bangladesh Bank
also needs to modify new reserve
management guidelines, approved in
September 2011, to incorporate provisions
on the terms and use of FXODs. Staff also
cautioned that the use of deferred
payments for oil imports could put added
pressures on reserves in the months ahead.
17.
Exchange rate assessment. The
exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals (Box 5). The estimated size of
the taka’s undervaluation has fallen during the
past year, mostly due to a less favorable
current account balance and more robust
growth outlook over the medium term, under
the current baseline. However, BOP pressures
and reserve losses are projected to continue
over the medium term, suggesting the
exchange rate could face continued downward
pressure.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities generally agreed
with staff’s views on monetary and
exchange rate policy. They recognized that
monetary conditions could warrant further
tightening, especially if nonfood inflation
continued to rise. However, they also
expressed concerns about the impact of rising
lending rates on growth and a weaker taka on
inflation. The authorities further noted that
bank-by-bank ceilings on CDRs would be
phased out once new liquidity management
guidelines being formulated were in place and

also suggested that remaining lending rate
caps might be lifted (mainly on certain export
and industrial credits). They pointed out that a
more flexible exchange rate had helped
increase transaction volumes in the interbank
market and reduce BB’s stock of FXODs. The
authorities acknowledged the need to
safeguard reserves. They noted, however, that
the central bank would likely continue to
facilitate lumpy payments for fuel and food
imports, but with foreign exchange transacted
in line with commercial bank rates.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. Bangladesh: Exchange Rate Assessment1
The application of the three standard methodologies
for the exchange rate assessment suggest that the real
exchange rate is broadly in line with its long-run
equilibrium, consistent with the previous Article IV
Consultation staff report (Country Report No. 10/55).
Application of a CGER approach to the exchange rate
assessment, which takes into account the sizable level of
remittances in Bangladesh, supports this view. These
remittance inflows, which have been a main driver of the
current account over the past decade, now exceed
10 percent of GDP. However, over time, they are expected
to decline as a share of GDP, as Bangladesh moves toward
middle-income country status. The other CGER approaches
do not account explicitly for remittances and find evidence
of a slight undervaluation. However, BOP pressures and
reserve losses are projected to continue over the medium
term, suggesting the exchange rate could face continued
downward pressure.
In this context, the specific adjustment made to the
CGER approach recognizes the significant impact on
the current account of remittance inflows. In particular,
if remittances are viewed as an exhaustible resource over
the long term, then intertemporal consumption-saving
behavior suggests that remittances could cause saving to
increase over the medium term to smooth out future
consumption, as Bangladesh transitions to being a more
mature economy. As a result, CGER estimates of the
medium-term equilibrium current account balance (saving
less investment) that do not properly account for
remittances could result in underestimating the current
account balance.

dummies for South and East Asian high remittance
countries shows that the real effective exchange rate is
broadly in equilibrium.3 However, the same adjustment to
the equilibrium RER approach does not find a significant
coefficient for remittances, with results showing a slight
undervaluation. The external sustainability approach also
shows a small undervaluation.

A Bangladesh-specific trade elasticity of 0.45 is used in this

This adjustment for remittances changes the current account
norm from a deficit of 6.6 percent of GDP to a deficit of 0.3
percent of GDP consistent with staff projections. It is also
important to note that an STA TA mission has found that a
recent widening of the discrepancy between exports reported
on a customs basis and settlement basis suggests a
potential overstatement of the reported current account
balance, which distorts the measurement of the current
account gap.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BANGLADESH

2009 FSAP update, measured reforms have taken
place, but rapid growth in the banking system
and equity markets is straining supervisory
capacity and oversight. The SOCBs remain
vulnerable to outside interference, undermining
gains from corporatization efforts in recent years.

should aim to strengthen banks’
governance, foremost by giving BB the sole
legal authority to take actions against any
bank that fails to comply with prudential
regulations. The act should also stipulate the
fit and proper criteria for directors, officers
and key shareholders at all banks,
superceding exemptions for SOCBs in this
area. Staff further recommended that the
government defer approving new banking
licenses until supervisory capacity is
strengthened, liquidity pressures ease, and
strict licensing criteria are in place, following
a decision by BB to lift the ban in September
2011. Regarding the SOCBs, staff saw need
for further elaboration of plans to
strengthen their financial position and
internal governance, given underlying
inadequacies in their capital bases, using the
results of the recent external audits as a
guide. The government itself should refrain
from interfering in the operations of SOCBs,
as this could undermine their profitability,
limit proper provisioning, and exacerbate
recapitalization needs. In turn, the SOCBs
need to accelerate their amortization of
unrealized losses being held in special
accounts on their balance sheet.

Staff’s views
19.




20

Main discussions covered:
Strengthening bank supervision and
enforcement. Bangladesh Bank should
continue to strengthen its supervision and
oversight of the banking system, focusing on
improving the governance and finances of
SOCBs and ensuring all banks comply with
new capital adequacy requirements. Due to
weak capacity at the SEC and lack of a
consolidated supervisory framework, staff
recommended that merchant bank
subsidiaries fall under the supervisory and
reporting framework of BB, in order to
protect parent banks’ capital and limit
operational risk. Recently announced new
stock market exposure limits for banks
(25 percent of regulatory capital) could
provide added protection, if implemented in
a timely manner. Staff also urged regulatory
guidelines on loan loss classification and
provisioning standards be brought in line
with international best practices by end-2011.
Crisis contingency plans, lender of last resort
facilities, and a prompt corrective action
framework would also help reduce systemic
risk. Finally, BB should begin taking steps
toward Basel III standards, while ensuring
strict Basel II compliance by all banks.
Improving bank governance and
performance. Staff urged timely finalization
of the draft amendments to the Bank
Companies Act and submission to
Parliament by end-2011. The amended law

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Intensifying equity market oversight.
Staff recommended stepped up efforts to
improve stock market governance and
oversight. The advisory board set up after
the high-level probe of market
irregularities should possess the necessary
expertise, backed by sufficient capacity
building. Besides containing risks posed by
merchant bank subsidiaries, reforms
should concentrate on strengthening the
book-building method and listing and
reporting requirements, and providing
clear sanctions for trading violations and a
stable set of margin lending requirements.

BANGLADESH

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities were in broad
agreement with the staff’s views. They
noted that the generally weak state of
SOCBs—several of which remain technically
insolvent—is an active concern. The authorities
stressed that they remain in close contact with
the commercial banks that exceed the current
stock market exposure limits to bring them in
compliance. They also pointed to improved
coordination of onsite and offsite bank
examinations, which should facilitate

movement toward more risk-based
supervision, with the support of the new IMF
resident advisor in BB. The authorities also
expressed a commitment to improve oversight
of the securities’ market and highlighted the
work that was under way to strengthen the
laws underpinning the anti-money laundering
framework. They also noted plans being
formulated to demutualize the Dhaka and
Chittagong stock exchanges in order to
improve their governance.

OTHER ISSUES
21.
Trade reform issues. Bangladesh is
making progress in increasing integration with
its main trading partners. Addressing its trade
barriers, which are high even by regional
standards, would support these efforts. Since
January 2011, exports have benefitted
significantly from a relaxation in rules of origin
requirements for RMG exports to the European
Union. In September this year, in conjunction
with a visit by the Prime Minister of India,
duties and quotas on exports to India of 61
items were removed, including on 46 garment
products. While the issue is still pending,
efforts were also made to open up transit
trade and transshipment through Bangladesh
for India’s northeastern states.
22.
Statistics. Macroeconomic statistics are
adequate for surveillance, with the authorities

committed to strengthening them, in order to
better inform policy decisions and monitor
outcomes. They aim to seek parliamentary
approval of the new Statistics Act by end-2011.
Staff welcomed recent actions by the Ministry of
Planning’s Statistics Division to modernize CPI
compilation. Deficiencies in national income
accounts and the BOP are expected to be
addressed through further IMF TA.
23.
Safeguards assessment. Staff
encouraged BB to implement recommendations
of the recent safeguards assessment over the
near to medium term. In particular, early action
was encouraged in improving the quality of
external audits to ensure compliance with
international standards, and in strengthening
governance over FXODs and reserves
management.

STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
The growth outlook in FY12 is
favorable, but overheating pressures
threaten to undermine macroeconomic
stability. Rising oil and capital goods imports
and accommodative policies are putting

pressure on the BOP, which requires policy
rebalancing and tightening. Higher commodity
prices and demand pressures are feeding into
inflation, with the nonfood rate becoming
worrisomely high. Balance of payments

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BANGLADESH

pressures are expected to build over the
medium term because of import-heavy
infrastructure investment and the further large
increases in oil demand. Managing them will
likely necessitate exceptional financing and
upfront policy adjustment.
25.
Longer term growth prospects hinge
on generating sufficient resources to relieve
infrastructure bottlenecks and ensuring a
competitive business environment focused
on labor-intensive activities. To put
Bangladesh in the ranks of emerging
economies by end-decade, public and private
investment rates will need to rise substantially
in the next few years, including FDI. For this to
occur, the government must ensure strong tax
enforcement and compliance; a stable, wellgoverned financial system; and a streamlined
and transparent trade and investment regime.
Achieving these objectives will necessitate an
inclusive policy dialogue and strong,
transparent governance.
26.
Accordingly, the authorities need to
build on the momentum of recent reforms.
Gains made in revenue mobilization should be
consolidated by continuing tax administration
reforms and by pushing ahead with the new
VAT and income tax laws. Efforts to strengthen
PFM, streamline the ADP implementation
process, and operationalize the PPP framework
should also be stepped up. While debt
sustainability indicators suggest a low risk of
external debt distress, a sound debt
management strategy should concentrate on
concessional external borrowing, supporting
Bangladesh’s development needs. The
domestic debt burden should also be
managed carefully, properly accounting for
contingent liabilities.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27.
To ensure a stable macroeconomic
environment, vigilance is foremost required
on the fiscal front. Subsidy costs need to be
brought under control through upfront fuel
price and electricity tariff adjustments,
combined with targeted safeguards, in order
to reduce operating losses of the BPC, ease
demand pressures, and protect the integrity of
the FY12 budget. This would reopen space for
more social and development spending. Even
so, the domestic financing requirement could
be large, necessitating greater access to
external financing.
28.
The balance of risks also points to
the need for further monetary tightening.
As a first step, BB financing of the deficit
should be reduced, accompanied by higher
policy and treasury rates and limited liquidity
support, to better enable the central bank to
achieve its FY12 monetary targets. Increased
interest rate flexibility should also help
strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism.
29.
Continued exchange rate flexibility
is needed to facilitate external adjustment,
and also to safeguard foreign reserves. Staff
consider the exchange rate to be broadly in
line with fundamentals, although it could face
continued downward pressure. Market
intervention by BB should be limited to
smoothing short-term volatility and consistent
with maintaining an adequate reserve cover.
New reserve management guidelines come at
a critical time, especially in view of volatile
global markets.
30.
Financial sector vulnerabilities
should be addressed as a matter of priority
to ensure system soundness and reduce
fiscal risks. The regulatory and supervisory
framework over commercial banks needs to be

BANGLADESH

strengthened and enforced. Governance over
banks, in particular the SOCBs, should be
fortified to ensure sound banking practices.
Stock market volatility could pose systemic risk
to the banking system as well as create fiscal
risk, if not managed well. Market oversight
should be strengthened and banks’ exposure
should be carefully monitored.
31.
Finally, further improvement in the
quality and timeliness of statistics would
improve policymaking. Progress in
addressing weaknesses in national account

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

and BOP statistics is particularly important.
Greater autonomy to statistical bodies should
allow more accurate measurement of policy
outcomes.
32.
No timetable exists for the removal of
the one remaining exchange restriction on
the transferability of funds in nonresident taka
accounts. Therefore, staff does not recommend
its approval by the Executive Board.
33.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Bangladesh take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. BANGLADESH: INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS1
Overview
1.
Infrastructure bottlenecks are a
fundamental constraint to higher economic
growth in Bangladesh. According to the
Global Competitiveness Report 2010–11,2
inadequate infrastructure is the most
problematic factor for doing business in
Bangladesh. A comparison of infrastructure
quality in Asia places Bangladesh as the second
worst after Nepal, marked by a severely
inadequate electricity supply. Accordingly, the
government’s Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY2011–15)
(SFYP) prioritizes a scaling up of infrastructurerelated investment in an effort to put
Bangladesh on a growth trajectory on par with
China, India, and Vietnam.

To close the infrastructure deficit
and raise growth rates, regional experience
shows that Bangladesh needs to ramp up
investment rates—both public and private.
Real GDP growth during the last decade
averaged 5.8 percent, while the overall
investment rate was just below 25 percent of
GDP. However, public investment averaged
only 6 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, India

rate of around 30 percent, while China
achieved an average growth rate of 10 percent
during the last decade, with an average
investment rate of nearly 40 percent, of which
more than half was public investment. In line
with these trends, Bangladesh’s SFYP targets a
growth rate of 8 percent and investment rate
of 32 percent of GDP by FY15, through a
strategy of higher public investment
catalyzing more private investment, including
in infrastructure.

Power Infrastructure
3.
While Bangladesh faces a host of
serious infrastructure challenges, an
inadequate and unreliable power supply
has by far been the most debilitating to
growth, increasing production costs, reducing
external competitiveness, and constraining
investment, including foreign direct inflows.
Currently, Bangladesh has the second lowest
per capita consumption of energy in the
region, with less than half of population having
access to electricity. The authorities still
estimate electricity shortages average

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BANGLADESH

1,800 MW a day during peak hours, or more
than a third of current generating capacity.3, 4
Frequent load-shedding (averaging 1,000–
1,200 MW a day) causes serious disruptions
and also reduces productivity in both industrial
and agricultural production. Back-up
generators cost firms up to 50 percent more
than base electricity costs.5 Due either to poor
electricity access or frequent power outages,
many farmers have to depend on more costly
diesel for running irrigation pumps.
4.
Power sector development has been
held back for various reasons. The most
significant factor has been below-cost
administered power tariffs, which have made
power sector investment an unattractive
business venture for private investors.
Currently, the public sector in Bangladesh
generates around 56 percent of total electricity
production, with the Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB) alone producing
42 percent of the total. The private sector
generates the rest, selling it to bulk and retail
consumers at a government-determined fixed
rate. However, this arrangement tends to
perpetuate inefficiencies, including high
transmission and distribution losses, low plant
efficiencies, and inadequate plant maintenance.
The overwhelming share of traditional power
plants is still fueled by gas. However, crippling
domestic gas shortages combined with ageing
power plants has resulted in actual electricity
generation falling well short of full production

capacity, with only three-fourths of installed
capacity considered available.
5.
Starting in early 2010, the
government embarked on an ambitious
plan to more than double electricity
generation by 2016, relying heavily on private
sector participation. Under this plan, BPDB is
entering into agreements with plant operators
to purchase power at profitable rates.
However, these agreements are putting
pressure on fuel subsidy costs, as power
generating capacity and related oil imports
rise. Over the near to medium term, power
sector plans envisage the following:

In the near term, most new capacity is
coming from “quick rental” and “rental”
power stations, which can be set up quickly
and are typically capable of producing
50–100 MW of electricity per plant, mainly
using imported diesel or furnace oil.6 As a

A rental unit refers to the length of the contract to operate a
plant (generally three to five years). They are typically
commissioned in four to six months to meet short-term and
emergency power requirements of a country. On the other
hand, independent power producer plants (IPPs) are usually
contracted for at least 20 years (either as build-own-operate
or build-operate-transfer). They generally take three to five
years to bring online. Rental units are mainly simple cycle
plants (i.e., have no capacity for waste heat recovery) and
consume marginally more fuel than combined cycle power
plants, which are normally set up as IPPs.

result, electricity generation capacity has
picked up noticeably. By end 2011, the
government expects to add around
2,200 MW in electricity generating capacity
to the national grid, representing more
than a 50 percent increase in capacity over
the past two years.




Over the medium term (2012–16), new
power plants with more than 12,000 MW in
total generating capacity will be set up.
Under this plan, Bangladesh could generate
surplus electricity from 2012 onward if
projects are commissioned on time.
Bangladesh also has a Regional Grid
Interconnection Plan, which aims to install
a 400 KV transmission line and high
voltage direct current power sub-station in
order to import 500 MW a day from India
by end-2013. The Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) approved funding for this project in
2010, but disbursement has been delayed
due to the absence of a signed Power
Purchase Agreement between Bangladesh
and India.

production and employment opportunities are
constrained, especially in rural areas. As such,
developing the transportation infrastructure is
critical to helping achieve poverty reduction
goals and reduce rural migration pressures.
Better transportation infrastructure could also
improve regional integration, mainly with
India.
7.
The government is currently
embarking on several large transportation
projects. While these projects look to relieve
major transport bottlenecks, they will need to
be supported by more ambitious plans to
develop secondary and tertiary road networks
to bring greater rural-urban connectivity. With
waterways also a major source of internal
transport, water management and dredging
activities (and associated environmental
concerns) will need to be part of an integrated
transportation plan. In the meantime, major
transport-related projects focus on the
following:


Transportation Network
6.
The transportation network has also
long been neglected and needs significant
investment to support growth. In
Bangladesh, only 10 percent of roads are
paved, compared to India’s 47 percent.7 The
availability of land is the most serious
constraint in expanding the road network in
Bangladesh, as one of the most densely
populated countries in the world. The existing
road network in Bangladesh is also of poor
quality, increasing transport costs and
restricting market access. As a result,

Bank’s International Development Association (IDA)
(US$1.2 billion), AsDB (US$615 million), Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) (US$420 million), and Islamic

resettlement efforts have begun in order
to facilitate bridge construction. The
government also approved the
construction of the Dhaka Elevated
Expressway in March 2011, in an effort to
reduce traffic congestion and improve
urban road connectivity by linking major
commercial centers. The project is
expected to be undertaken on a PPP basis
at a total estimated cost of US$2 billion.
The government has called for proposals
from interested investors.


Rail links: The government plans to use a
portion of the US$1 billion credit line from
India’s Eximbank, approved in
October 2010, to upgrade rail lines and
improve railway integration between India
and Bangladesh. In addition, it is looking at
the feasibility of a metro rail in Dhaka, with
possible external support.

Port Infrastructure
8.
Improving port infrastructure is also
key to reducing transport-related costs,
expanding foreign trade, and fostering
greater regional integration. Bangladesh
ranks second lowest to Nepal in its quality of
port infrastructure among South Asian
countries and 107 out of 139 countries,
according to the Global Competitiveness Report
2010–2011. Chittagong port, the principal
seaport of Bangladesh, handles about
92 percent of total external trade. The port is
under increasing strain, with cargo handling
growing by 8 percent in 2009 compared to
only 2 percent in 2008. Current facilities lack
sufficient space and equipment, which
prolongs wait times for incoming and outgoing

credits have yet to be made effective.

cargo and contributes to high shipping and
port charges. To reduce congestion, major
envisaged projects center on:


Developing a master plan for Chittagong
port, with technical support from the AsDB,
in order to improve port operating
efficiency and intermodal transport
logistics, so as to bring the port up to
international standards.



Reviving Mongla port in southwestern
Bangladesh, as part of the SFYP, by
providing transit access to neighboring
countries, such as India, Nepal, and
Bhutan. The Ministry of Shipping has
already embarked on developing an
ambitious development plan for the port,
which encompasses increasing handling
capacity and automating port operations.

Resource Mobilization Challenges and
Initiatives
9.
The resources needed for a scaling
up of infrastructure in Bangladesh are
significant. Carrying out large infrastructure
projects will also require substantial long-term
technical and financial assistance and better
coordination between the government, private
sector, and development partners. To meet
these needs, Bangladesh will continue to
depend on government and donor resources.
At the same time, given huge investment
requirements, it will need to find more
effective means of channeling domestic
savings into infrastructure investment by
developing new funding vehicles, including
those needed for newly envisaged publicprivate partnerships (PPPs) and surrounding
formulation of a domestic bond market. While
the bulk of Bangladesh’s sizeable savings rate
of almost 30 percent of GDP is concentrated in

BANGLADESH

the banking system, maturity mismatches
mean that domestic banks would find it
difficult to fund long-term projects.
10.
The government is developing the
institutional framework to use PPPs to
undertake infrastructure projects, in view of
the funding requirements, specialized
management, and technical capacity needed
to address the country’s large and complex
infrastructure needs. Guidelines to frame the
formation, appraisal, and approval of projects
have already been issued. In addition, the
government is in various stages of setting up a
PPP Advisory Council; a PPP Office under the
Prime Minister’s Office; a PPP Unit in Ministry
of Finance to assess budget implications; and
PPP focal points in line ministries. The AsDB is
providing TA to make operational the different
steps in the PPP cycle.
11.
Specific guidelines are also being
formulated for financial participation in
PPP projects in three forms: (i) technical
assistance (TA) financing (i.e., access to
government-sponsored TA funds), (ii) viability

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

gap financing (bridging financial gaps for
economically viable projects), and
(iii) infrastructural financing for extending
financing facilities for the PPP projects in the
form of debt or equity. The government has
already established Bangladesh Infrastructure
Finance Fund (BIFF), which is expected to serve
as a financing vehicle for private investment in
large infrastructure projects.9
12.
In this regard, lessons may be
learned from India’s experience with PPP,
which has been mixed, but overall highlight
the need for a detailed PPP policy that ensures
proper planning and risk allocation, adequate
protections for private investors, and capacity
development in the public sector.
13.
Another source of financing that the
government may access for infrastructure
development is nonconcessional external
borrowing. In the event, this type of financing
should be limited to high priority, high-return
projects and managed carefully within wellintegrated medium-term fiscal framework and
a national debt management strategy.

9

The BIFF is expected to operate similar to the India
Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL). The IIFCL,
which was established in India in 2006, raises long-term debt
domestically and externally from bilateral and multilateral
institutions, backed by a sovereign guarantee.

APPENDIX II. FOOD SECURITY IN BANGLADESH1
1.
The recent surge in global
commodity prices has complicated
Bangladesh’s efforts to achieve food
security, as a net food, fuel, and fertilizer
importer. In response, the government of
Bangladesh, supported by development
partners and nongovernmental agencies, has
taken steps over the past year to mitigate the
effects of rising food prices. Food inflation
peaked at 14.4 percent (y/y) in April 2011—just
below the previous peak in late 2007.2 Since
then, it has moderated slightly, running at
12.7 percent in August (the latest available
data). When Bangladesh went through its last
bout of high food price inflation in 2007–08,
the country experienced social unrest, which
the current government has been keen
to avoid.

3.
Achieving food security remains a
major challenge in Bangladesh and the
South Asian region. More than one-fifth of
the region’s population still lives in hunger.
Despite strong economic performance over
the past decade, hunger levels remain high,
although lower-income countries in the region
perform well compared to global low-income
country benchmarks. Food imports have also
pushed up import growth in some countries in
the region, adding to balance of payments
pressures.

2.
Broadly defined, food security aims
to ensure all people have access to
sufficient, nutritious, and affordable food. It
is an integral part of the Millennium
Development Goals for Bangladesh (see
Table 8), where about two-thirds of the
consumption basket comprises food and
31.5 percent of the population lived below the
national poverty line in FY10 (July 2009 to
June 2010). As a result, Bangladesh is highly
vulnerable to food price increases. The Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) reported earlier this
year that a 10 percent rise in food prices in
Bangladesh could drag an additional 4 million
people into poverty.3



First, official subsidies on various inputs
have helped cushion against rising
costs. Over the past year, for example, the
increasing cost of urea fertilizer has posed
a significant challenge to farmers. In
response, the government expanded the
resources available for fertilizer subsidies
(around 0.7 percent of GDP in FY11). It also
continued to subsidize diesel (used to run
the irrigation pumps) and to encourage
banks to expand farm loans (agricultural
loans are about 6 percent of total loans).
Bangladesh Bank also continues to make
lending to agriculture a priority sector for
banks, as reiterated in the latest Monetary
Policy Statement.



Second, a variety of food-related social
safety net programs exist, with several
recently expanded. These programs focus
on meeting food needs of vulnerable
groups, providing food for work, and
undertaking open market sales of strategic

In the year preceding April 2011, rice and wheat prices in
Bangladesh increased by 13 and 12 percent, respectively.

See Global Food Price Inflation and Developing Asia, AsDB,
March 2011 (Manila).

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4.
Recently, the government of
Bangladesh has taken several measures to
better ensure food security, which are in
line with regional efforts to achieve the
same. Efforts have focused on the following:

BANGLADESH

food reserves at subsidized prices.
Through its food distribution system, the
government released 2.3 million metric
tons of food grains in FY11 (mostly rice
and wheat)—a 17 percent increase from
the previous fiscal year.


Third, food imports increased sharply in
FY11, mainly through government
purchases used for open market sales
and strategic reserves. In total, food grain
imports rose by 128 percent in FY11 to
US$1.9 billion. Previously, most reserve
stocks were built up through local
purchases. The government scaled back
these programs in FY11 to manage its own
procurement costs. Some food grain
imports have been sold in the local market
and the rest retained as part of official
food reserves, which rose to 0.89 million
metric tons at end-June 2011 from 0.52
million metric tons at end-June 2010.



2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Finally, the sources of food imports
have become more diversified, which
has helped hold down their cost.
Bangladesh has moved away from
traditional source markets such as India,
where past export bans on rice created
supply disruptions. Over the past year,
food grains have been increasingly
imported from Pakistan, Thailand,
and Vietnam.

5.
A key policy challenge is to balance
stabilizing food prices and assuring a fair
return for the farmers. The price of rice in
Bangladesh, the main staple, was down by
about 15 percent from its recent peak (as of
end-August 2011). In part, this is due to earlier
increases in imported procurement and the
emergency release of grain reserves, as well as
a strong boro rice crop harvest in mid-2011. At
current price levels, local farmers appear to be
able to recoup their production costs and
obtain a fair price, thus mitigating some of the
effects of higher food grain prices on rural
households.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

Approved By

Prepared by

Masahiko Takeda and Thomas Dorsey (IMF)
Ernesto May and Jeffrey Lewis (IDA)

International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

The results of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) are similar to those of the previous
DSA. Bangladesh’s risk of debt distress on external debt remains low. The level of public
and publicly guaranteed external debt as a share of GDP in FY11 is in line with that
anticipated in the previous DSA, but has improved as a share of exports and revenues
given their recent strong growth.2 Under the baseline scenario, Bangladesh’s external
debt burden indicators remain below the relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds.
They also do not breach the thresholds under the stress tests.3 Debt burden indicators are
less favorable when domestic debt is included.

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs and in consultation with the Asian Development Bank,
using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both institutions.

2

See IMF Country Report No. 10/55.

3

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions allow

countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. Bangladesh’s policies and
institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium
performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent
for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-toexports ratio, and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly
guaranteed external debt.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS BANGLADESH

INTRODUCTION
1.
This DSA incorporates a new baseline
macroeconomic outlook, including revised
assumptions on the public sector’s external
and domestic borrowing plans. The outlook,
summarized in Box 1, follows the broad trend of
the government’s Sixth Five-Year Plan (FY11–15)
(SFYP) 4 and medium-term budget framework.
Compared to the previous DSA, the baseline
assumptions for economic growth in this DSA are
moderately higher. At the same time, rising
demand for oil and capital goods imports, in part
associated with a ramping up of infrastructure
investment, is accompanied by moderate current
account deficits over the medium to long run, in
part financed by larger external borrowing. As a
result, the projected rate of external debt
accumulation over the medium term is higher
than in the previous DSA.

3.
Bangladesh’s current debt stock
comprises the following:


Public and publicly guaranteed external
debt had a face value equivalent to
21.6 percent of GDP at end-FY11. The
debt is owed mostly to multilateral
creditors, including the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank. Japan is the
main bilateral creditor (see table below).



Domestic debt amounted to
21.3 percent of GDP at end-FY11, up
from 20.3 percent in the previous year.
It mainly comprises treasury bills and
bonds (42 percent), held mostly by
domestic commercial banks, and National
Savings Certificates (NSCs) (38 percent),
held mainly by the nonbank private sector
(see table below).6

2.
Debt dynamics are positively affected
by the higher growth assumptions, but
negatively affected by the higher projected
rate of debt accumulation. On balance, the
present value (PV) of external debt now declines
by about 3 percentage points of GDP over the
immediate six-year projection period (FY12–17),
similar to the decline over the immediate six-year
projection period in the previous DSA. Under the
baseline scenario, this DSA has a less favorable
external debt path than the historical scenario, the
opposite of the previous DSA.5

4

FY11 refers to the period July 2010–June 2011.

5

The large noninterest current account surplus recorded in
FY10 (4 percent of GDP) and more moderate surplus in FY11
(1.1 percent of GDP) raise the 10-year average noninterest
current account balance, which is used in the historical
scenario to generate the relevant path for external debt. At
the same time, compared to the baseline scenario in the
previous DSA, the current account balance in this DSA
weakens more over the near to medium term. This translates

(continued)
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

into a higher external borrowing requirement in the baseline
scenario.
6

Net domestic government debt (i.e., including government
deposits) was 18.1 percent of GDP at end-FY11. Deposits are
mostly held by autonomous and semi-autonomous
government bodies that are largely outside the control of the
central government. Hence the public DSA focuses on gross
public debt.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
All external debt indicators remain
well below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, and no
thresholds are breached under the
standardized stress tests. The main results of the
external DSA are as follows:




All debt indicators in the baseline
scenario are expected to decline over
the 20-year projection period (Table 1).
During the projection period, the PV of the
debt-to-GDP ratio decreases from
17½ percent in FY11 to about 8½ percent
in FY32 (compared to an indicative
threshold of 40 percent), while the PV of
the debt-to-exports ratio decreases from
75 percent in FY11 to 26 percent in FY32
(compared to an indicative threshold of
150 percent).
The standard stress tests do not reveal
any serious vulnerability (Table 2 and

Figure 1). The strong increase in
remittances in Bangladesh in recent years,
from about 8 percent of GDP in FY06 to
11 percent of GDP in FY11, has further
raised Bangladesh’s capacity to repay.7
While remittances growth slowed
significantly in FY11 relative to earlier years
and remittances as a percent of GDP are
projected to gradually fall over the long
term, they will remain substantial and will
continue to contribute toward reducing
Bangladesh’s vulnerability to shocks.
Strong growth of exports and revenues in
FY11 also contributed to lower the debtto-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios,
respectively.
7

A recent review of some aspects of the LIC DSF
recommended greater recognition of remittances in DSAs for
countries where they are large, including in the determination
of risk ratings (see
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4358).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS BANGLADESH

Box 1. Bangladesh: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Real GDP growth is projected to average 6¾ percent a
year over the immediate projection period (FY12–17),
broadly in line with the government’s medium-term
growth targets. This is above the ten-year average
(5¾ percent), reflecting stepped-up investment and
reforms. Over the longer run, growth is projected to
average around 6½ percent a year. The near-term
outlook factors in more robust growth in garments
exports than envisaged in the previous DSA, which was
prepared in late 2009 when there was substantial
uncertainty about the pace of recovery from a severe
global downturn. In addition, the baseline assumptions
for growth presume a pickup in structural reforms,
concentrated on strengthening fiscal management,
deepening the financial sector, and improving the trade
and investment climate. Finally, they take account of
ongoing efforts to relieve energy shortages and
infrastructure bottlenecks, most notably through higher
public investment, as envisaged in the government’s
Annual Development Program (ADP), also with greater
private sector participation in power and transportation
sector development.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator in domestic
currency, decelerates from 10.0 percent in FY12 to
6.8 percent in FY17 and slightly more thereafter,
reflecting an easing of upward pressures from import
prices, moderate policy tightening, and a reduction in
domestic supply constraints.
The growth of exports and imports of goods and
services is moderately strong over the immediate
projection period (around 13¼ and 12½ percent, on
average, respectively, compared to about 10 percent for
both in the previous DSA). Exports would continue to
be driven by ready-made garments, as Bangladesh’s
low-cost advantage allows it to capture greater market
share. As noted earlier, imports would be driven by
stronger investment demand, including that associated
with infrastructure development. Improvements in the
trade and investment climate would also contribute to
higher export and import growth.
The current account is projected to slip into a
moderate deficit starting in FY12 and remain as such
over the medium to long run. Main drivers during
FY12–17 are strong envisaged growth in oil and capital
goods imports, in part to address electricity shortages
and infrastructure bottlenecks, and more moderate
growth in remittances compared to recent years,
because of lower net migration. Macroeconomic and
structural reforms would also trigger larger foreign
direct investment inflows, including in infrastructure,
which would finance at least part of the higher imports.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Net aid inflows (disbursements of grants and loans,
net of amortization payments) are projected to average
1.4 percent of GDP a year in the long term—around the
current level. However, in FY12–15, official
disbursements are projected to rise substantially, with
net aid inflows averaging about 1.8 percent of GDP,
owing to the construction of the Padma Bridge (with
gross disbursements equivalent to around 2.5 percent
of GDP) and stepped-up implementation of existing
donor-supported projects.
The grant element of new external borrowing is
assumed to average about 31 percent in FY12–17,
despite some expected recourse to nonconcessional
borrowing to fund infrastructure projects. Real
domestic interest rates on government debt are
currently suppressed and negative in real terms. With
greater interest rate flexibility and financial markets
development, real domestic interest rates are assumed
to increase steadily over the medium term.
The primary fiscal deficit (including grants) is
expected to average 2.3 percent of GDP during
FY12–17, about 1 percent of GDP higher than the
average of the past 10 years. The higher deficits factor
in substantial expected improvement in revenue
collection over the long run driven by the introduction
of new VAT and income tax laws and implementation of
the tax modernization plan, which will improve revenue
collection processes. Offsetting these gains are steady
increases in public investment which peak in FY20
before falling slightly as a percent of GDP to a long-run
equilibrium consistent with continuing large investment
needs. They also encapsulate rising subsidy costs
associated with expected incurred losses by energy and
fertilizer-related state-owned enterprises. In the
electricity sector, the greater reliance on high-cost
rental power plants to address the power deficit is
expected to add to these losses over the near to
medium term. The current baseline assumes gradual
movement to full cost recovery for electricity by middecade.
On balance, the current outlook carries some
downside risks, which, if realized, could result in a
slightly lower growth trajectory, that is, a scenario
more in line with the IMF’s 2009 Article IV Consultation
staff report and World Bank’s July 2010 Country
Assistance Strategy. These risks stem mainly from weak
implementation capacity, persistent governance issues,
and political opposition to reforms. In addition, the
global economic recovery remains fragile, with
Bangladesh’s heavy dependence on garment exports to
the U.S. and E.U. and on workers’ remittances, mainly
from the Middle East, exposing it to potential setbacks.

BANGLADESH 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS8
5.
In the baseline scenario, the PV of
public debt-to-GDP ratio remains steady
initially, but then falls gradually over the long
run to 38½ percent of GDP in FY32 (Table 3).
The decline in the PV of external public debt-toGDP ratio is partially offset by a rising domestic
debt-to-GDP ratio. Reflecting reform plans to
boost domestic revenue collection and a slight
tapering off of public investment in the outer
years, the PV of public debt-to-domestic revenue
ratio declines steadily in the long run.
6.
The alternative scenarios and bound
tests indicate that the projected paths of debt
indicators are sensitive to alternative
assumptions and point to some risks (Table 4
and Figure 2). A case in point is the low-case
scenario, in which limited progress on fiscal and
financial as well as trade and investment reforms
causes real GDP growth and the primary fiscal
balance to remain at their historical averages

(Alternative Scenario 1). In this scenario, key debt
and debt service ratios rise over the long term.
Greater-than-envisaged dependence on highcost power from rental power plants, slower-thanenvisaged adjustments to electricity prices, and a
larger-than-anticipated rise in world oil prices
would add to prospective operating losses of
energy-related state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
which could exacerbate contingent liabilities of
the government and necessitate budgetary
absorption through larger fiscal imbalances.9
Recapitalization needs of state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs), including those
brought on by absorbing SOE losses, could put
further pressure on contingent liabilities. One of
the standardized shocks in the DSA framework
assesses the impact of a one-time 30 percent real
depreciation in FY13. As a result of this shock, the
debt service-to-revenue ratio would reach
39 percent in FY14, compared with the baseline
ratio of 31 percent.

DEBT MANAGEMENT
7.
In response to a request from the
authorities, a joint World Bank/IMF mission
visited Bangladesh in September 2010 to
provide follow-up technical assistance to help
build capacity to improve debt management.
The mission’s main recommendations focused on
operationalizing the debt management strategy,
including the preferred choice of strategy and the
need to develop annual borrowing plans. The
authorities are making progress on devising a
comprehensive debt management strategy that is
built on estimates of the long-term public
investment requirements and the associated
financing needs. This strategy will also need to
take into account the direct and contingent
liabilities arising from infrastructure projects,
including those being developed under the new

public-private partnership framework, given the
envisaged use of viability gap funding for some
projects. Finally, work is also under way to
establish a single, comprehensive, and wholly
accurate database on domestic and external debt,
which covers the wider public sector, as well as
loan guarantees.10 These reforms are being
____________________________________________
8

Public debt includes central government domestic debt and external
public and publicly guaranteed debt.

9

Legacy loans of these and several other large SOEs to the SOCBs
currently amount to about 2 percent of GDP. The DSA explicitly accounts
for short-term external nonconcessional borrowing by the Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation, which is guaranteed by the government. The
total stock was US$0.7 billion at end-FY11 and is projected to rise.

10

The authorities are also working to improve their database on private
sector external debt, which was estimated at US$1.2 billion at end-FY11.
Capital controls generally impede borrowing from abroad. Industrial
projects in Bangladesh can access medium- and long-term external
borrowing with prior approval by the government’s Board of Investment.
Until recently, the absence of a sovereign credit rating inflated the
country risk premium, making such borrowing relatively expensive. In
April 2010, S&P gave Bangladesh its first sovereign credit rating (BB-).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS BANGLADESH

implemented in alignment with the objectives of
the Strengthening Public Expenditure

Management Project to develop capacities for
debt policy and management.

VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
8.
The authorities were in broad
agreement with the DSA. They underscored that
the government would continue to assess the
budgetary, debt, and growth implications of
individual projects and ensure that the terms of
new external borrowing are consistent with a debt
management strategy currently being formulated.
However, the authorities also indicated that

should concessional resources fall short of
financing development spending needs, the
government might access non-concessional
medium to long-term borrowing. They also
recognized that progress on developing domestic
bond markets would create a deeper and more
stable source of financing for domestic debt.

CONCLUSION
9.
In the staffs’ view, Bangladesh is at low
risk of debt distress based on external
indicators, but the analysis reveals less
favorable debt indicators on public debt. The
baseline projections and the associated standard
stress tests show little risk related to external debt
given that none of the indicators breach the
indicative debt burden thresholds. However, in
view of Bangladesh’s continued low domestic
revenue base, risk to total debt and debt service,
including domestic debt, remains a concern.
10.
The substantial increase in debt ratios
when domestic debt is included calls for a
prudent fiscal policy. While the PV of the public
debt-to-revenue ratio would decline over the
20-year horizon under the baseline assumptions,
the ratio would remain high over the medium term
and rise over the long term in some of the
alternative scenarios and bound tests. Public debt
and debt service ratios also remain high over the
long term when some of the key variables are fixed
at historical levels. This underscores the importance
of undertaking structural fiscal reforms aimed at
expanding domestic resources, containing subsidy
costs, and raising public investment, ultimately with
an aim of boosting growth.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11.
Efforts to mobilize domestic revenues,
to manage expenditures prudently while
protecting priority outlays, and to contain
contingent liabilities are key to improving
debt indicators. Higher pass-through of changes
in world energy prices would help reduce SOE
losses and associated subsidy costs, protecting
the fiscal space needed to raise social and
development spending and put Bangladesh on a
higher growth trajectory, as targeted in its SFYP.
This exercise also underscores the importance of
effective management of the existing debt and
new debt accumulation, including relying
primarily on concessional external debt over the
medium term to finance infrastructure needs.
12.
The staffs encourage the authorities to
build on recent steps and move forward as
quickly as possible to strengthen debt
management capacity. In this regard, it will be
important to continue the work under way to
develop a comprehensive debt management
strategy and public debt data base, covering both
domestic and external debt and integrating it with
centralized reporting of all external aid flows.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ The increase in debt service in FY12 is, in part, due to projected interest for AsDB loans that is not paid during the loan's grace period.
7/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt. The increase in debt service in FY12 is, in part, due to projected interest for AsDB loans that is not paid
during the loan's grace period.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ The increase in debt service in FY12 is, in part, due to projected interest for AsDB loans which is not paid during the loan's grace period.

Safeguards Assessment

Joined August 17, 1972; accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on
April 11, 1994.

A safeguards assessment of the Bangladesh
Bank (BB) was concluded in July 2011.
Bangladesh Bank’s governance structure and
legal underpinning need to be updated to
strengthen autonomy and thus better
safeguard resources. Important areas of BB
operations such as management of foreign
reserves and extension of overdraft facilities in
foreign exchange are not monitored by BB’s
board. Audit committee oversight is
ineffective, as evidenced by current external
and internal audit mechanisms, which are
inadequate to provide necessary
accountability. These safeguards are much
needed in an environment where BB is seeking
to modernize its accounting and auditing
systems and controls.

ANNEX II. BANGLADESH: IMF-WORLD BANK
COLLABORATION
(October 2011)
The IMF and World Bank Group (both
International Development Association (IDA)
and International Finance Corporation (IFC)
teams) work together to promote critical
reforms that are essential for maintaining
macroeconomic stability and improving
growth conditions in Bangladesh.
Collaboration on the ground is strong
through the IMF resident representative’s
office and the World Bank’s Country Office.
The teams also discuss regularly the division
of labor between the two institutions.

Bank Group, IMF (including through its
regional revenue administration advisor),
and Asian Development Bank will
collaborate in this area, in alignment with
the National Board of Revenue’s plan for
tax modernization.


Public financial management. Sound
public financial management (PFM) is
important for improving the quality of
public expenditure as well as increasing
public investment through better
implementation of the government’s
Annual Development Program. Division of
labor: IDA will take the lead in this area
through its administration of the
Strengthening Public Expenditure
Management Program (SPEMP),
supported by a multi-donor trust fund.
The SPEMP focuses on core PFM issues in
the executive branch of the government
of Bangladesh, as well as strengthening
public expenditure oversight functions in
Parliament and supreme audit institutions.
The IDA is also taking the lead on public
procurement reform and capacity
building. The IMF will coordinate in this
area through its regional PFM advisor.



Debt management. Debt burden indicators
do not signal debt servicing difficulties.
However, there is no integrated debt
management strategy and no single entity
responsible for managing total public sector
debt. Division of labor: The IMF and IDA will
continue working jointly in this area,
including on the joint IDA-IMF Debt
Sustainability Analysis, with the IMF

The teams note that collaboration between
the IMF and the Bank is good—both in the
field and at headquarters—with informal and
frequent exchange of information on each
other’s activities and through shared analysis
of key policy issues.
Based on this assessment, the teams agreed
that the two institutions should remain
focused on the following reform areas:


4

Tax policy and administration. Higher
public investment is needed for
Bangladesh to accelerate economic
growth. To achieve this, improved revenue
generation is important for creating the
necessary fiscal space to raise public
investment to 7–8 percent of GDP by
mid-decade. Developing a modern tax
regime, establishing a supportive legal
framework, and strengthening tax
administration are essential, requiring
concerted efforts to deal address legal,
institutional, and other capacity
constraints. Division of labor: The World

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

coordinating views on main macroeconomic
assumptions and outlook and IDA providing
technical support on debt management
capacity through the SPEMP.


Monetary and exchange rate policies.
The IMF will take the lead in this area. The
IDA will play a complementary role
through operations to strengthen policy
formulation and payments systems at
Bangladesh Bank (BB).



Financial sector reform. A sound and
viable financial sector will remain critical
for creating an improved environment for
private sector investment. Ensuring steady
sector growth and institutional
development and sound prudential
oversight and risk management will
require considerable technical resources
in the coming years. Strengthening the
central bank’s regulatory and supervisory
framework and internal accounting and
controls underpins this work. Division of
labor: both the IDA/IFC and IMF are
engaged in this area, with the former
taking the lead on financial market
development and governance and the
latter on bank supervision and oversight,
supported by a resident advisor in BB.



Energy sector reform. Severe power
shortages constrain growth in Bangladesh.
Proper incentives are needed for
stepped-up private investment in the
sector. Foremost, the government needs
to implement a well-designed strategy to
raise retail and bulk tariffs in a phased
manner to reduce overall subsidies and
create fiscal space for more pressing

spending needs. Complementary actions
are under way to develop a monitoring
framework and use of performance audits
to contain losses of energy-related
state-owned enterprises. Given the
likelihood of higher fuel and electricity
prices, properly designed and targeted
safety nets will also need to be put in
place. Division of labor: IDA will lead on
policy dialogue and investment in this
area, with the IMF focused on fiscal
implications.


Statistical policy. Improvements in
statistics are critical to formulating sound
policies and monitoring their outcomes.
Both IDA and the IMF have sustained
engagement in this area and will ramp it
up further in the future. Division of labor:
IDA on poverty, social, and development
statistics and the IMF on macroeconomic
statistics.



Other structural policies. The World
Bank keeps the IMF informed about its
work on governance and anti-corruption,
local government and decentralization,
social protection, trade policy and private
sector development. Upstream sharing
allows the IMF to comment on such work
before it is finalized.

The teams agree to continue to keep each
other informed of their respective activities,
coordinate financial and technical support,
and share key documents.

ANNEX III. BANGLADESH: RELATIONS WITH THE
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(September 2011)
Lending and Technical Assistance Operations
Bangladesh had cumulative public sector
borrowing from the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) of almost US$12.1 billion (212 loans) as
of December 31, 2010, and technical assistance
(TA) grants of US$202.7 million (363 projects).
The country is one of the largest borrowers of
concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF)
resources. The loans and TA have supported all
key sectors, including energy and transport,
social infrastructure, and agriculture and
natural resources. The AsDB has also
supported eight private sector projects worth
US$242.2 million, including the Meghnaghat
Power Project—the first build-own-operate
power project in the country—and
GrameenPhone, which substantially expanded
rural access to mobile phone services.
In 2010, the AsDB approved a total amount of
US$1.3 billion in loans. This included loans to
(i) construct the Padma River multipurpose

Country Partnership Strategy
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
2006–10 lapsed in December 2010. The AsDB
is currently preparing the CPS for 2011–15,
which is expected to be considered by the
AsDB’s board in October 2011. The new CPS is
aligned to the government’s Sixth Five-Year
Plan (SFYP) and the AsDB’s Long-Term
Strategic Framework (Strategy 2020). It will
support the government’s SFYP objectives of

BANGLADESH

higher growth and accelerated poverty
reduction. Under the CPS, the AsDB will seek
to mainstream climate change and
environmental sustainability considerations
into its project operations. In addition, more
emphasis will be given to promote publicprivate partnerships, especially in
infrastructure. The CPS will also seek to foster
regional cooperation and integration.
The Bangladesh country operations business
plan for 2011–13, approved in July 2010,
comprises 24 projects totaling about
US$3.2 billion, including assistance for primary
education and the energy and transport
sectors. The TA program for 2011–13 consists
of 41 projects, with an annual allocation of
about of US$7.9 million.
Co-financing operations enable the AsDB’s
financing partners—government or their
agencies, multilateral financial institutions, and
commercial organizations—to participate in
the financing of AsDB projects. The additional
funds are provided in the form of grants,
official or commercial loans, and syndications.
In 2010, three projects received loan
cofinancing: from the Korea Export-Import
Bank for the Natural Gas Access Improvement
Project (US$45 million); from the International
Fund for Agricultural Development for the
Participatory Small-Scale Water Resources

Sector (US$10 million); and from the Islamic
Development Bank (US$140 million), Japan
Agency for International Cooperation
(US$300 million), and the World Bank
(US$1.2 billion) for the Padma Multipurpose
Bridge Project. A grant was provided by KfW,
Germany for the Sustainable Rural
Infrastructure Improvement Project
(US$16 million). As of end-2010, cumulative
direct value-added cofinancing for Bangladesh
amounted to US$2.87 billion for 30 investment
projects and US$60.4 million for 74 TA
projects.
Economic and Sector Work Program
Each year, the AsDB publishes its Asian
Development Outlook and Asian Development
Outlook Update, in which it assesses
macroeconomic performance. The AsDB’s
Bangladesh resident mission also publishes the
Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update. A
bimonthly Economic Indicators Update is also
prepared. In support of the AsDB’s CPS
(2011–15) exercise, several thematic
assessments and sector studies were
completed. These include: thematic
assessments for poverty; private sector
development; governance, gender, and
environment issues; and various sector studies.

ANNEX IV. BANGLADESH: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(September 2011)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision has some shortcomings,
but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
most affected areas are national accounts, fiscal,
and external sector statistics.
National accounts. The paucity of source data
remains the main impediment to improving
national accounts statistics. It adversely affects
the ability of the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS) to absorb technical assistance
aimed at improving compilation techniques.
The BBS does not conduct an annual national
accounts survey of business enterprises. Source
data are primarily from benchmark surveys and
a biennial census of manufacturing
establishments and household expenditure
survey. Many of the benchmark surveys were
conducted over five years ago and are based
on outdated sample frames. The shortcomings
in the data also affect compilation practices. In
addition, a system of price indices for
estimating national accounts at constant prices
needs to be developed. Technical assistance
missions conducted in September 2009 and
January 2011 developed and agreed a detailed
work program with the BBS for undertaking the
exercise of updating the base year from
1995/96 to 2005/06 and creating a
comprehensive benchmark estimate and new
series with the new base year. The work
program envisages the release of a new base
year series by early 2012.
Price statistics. The CPI and PPI weights are
outdated, which introduces uncertainty, but
these are already being addressed by BBS,
which is working on rebasing the base years to
2005/06 and accordingly updating the weights
by incorporating recent household survey data.
Government finance statistics. A 2008 STA
multisector mission recommended additional
actions to strengthen the analytical usefulness
of fiscal data, including to: (i) improve the

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

integration of debt stocks and related financial
flows; (ii) sensitize donors to the need to
promptly provide complete data on direct
project assistance; and (iii) establish an
interagency committee to prepare a migration
plan to the GFSM 2001. In addition, the
authorities need to map the monthly budget
data to GFSM 2001 presentation, disseminate
stock data on financial assets and liabilities, and
broaden the coverage to general government.
Monetary and financial statistics. Bangladesh
Bank compiles monetary data using the
standardized report forms (SRFs) framework. The
SRFs are reported electronically to the IMF on a
regular basis. As a result, a consistent time series
based on SRF data is available from December 2001.
External sector statistics. Pressing issues need to
be addressed in balance of payments and
international investment position statistics, mainly in
trade in goods, trade credits, and related financing.
In the area of goods transactions, data are collected
from different data sources; exports are based on
information from customs declarations and imports
are based on foreign exchange settlements. Efforts
are under way by the authorities to unify the source
data based on customs declarations only, in line
with STA’s recommendations. This should help
resolve inconsistencies with the national accounts,
where customs trade data are used in compiling net
exports of goods and services. Bangladesh Bank, the
institution in change of external sector statistics,
also needs to employ additional data sources, apart
from the settlement data, for the financial account,
including for trade credits, and should discontinue
some adjustments to the financial account that are
deemed to be unsound. International investment
position data remains weak.
Data Standards and Quality
Bangladesh has participated in the GDDS
since March 2001. The Data Module of the
ROSC was published in December 2005.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Bangladesh
On October 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Bangladesh.1
Background
Growth performance in Bangladesh has been strong the past few years, bolstered by efforts to
reduce longstanding infrastructure bottlenecks and aided by accommodative policies. Export
growth also reached a record high in fiscal year 2011 (July 2010–June 2011), driven up by a
bustling ready-made garments sector. Official estimates place real GDP growth at 6¾ percent in
FY11, up from around 6 percent in FY10. At the same time, macroeconomic pressures are
intensifying, with the current account balance deteriorating by around 3 percentage points of
GDP to slightly below 1 percent in FY11 and the overall balance of payments (BoP) running a
deficit in FY11 for the first time in a decade. Despite strong export growth and supportive
remittance inflows, BoP pressures are emanating from rising oil and capital goods imports,
volatile commodity prices, and weak aid inflows. Fiscal pressures have also emerged due to
increasing subsidy costs, mainly on account of fuel consumption, despite tax revenues having
exceeded 10 percent of GDP in FY11—a milestone for Bangladesh. Finally, inflation reached a
multi-year high in August 2011, with aggregate demand and food prices the major drivers.
In response, the authorities have allowed greater exchange rate flexibility over the past year to
relieve external pressures; undertaken moderate fuel price and electricity tariff adjustments to
contain subsidy costs; and attempted to tighten monetary policy, mainly through policy rate
hikes and credit-related ceilings. Certain lending rate caps have also been removed. However,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Bangladesh Bank has also increasingly been called to provide credit to the government. As a
result, fiscal pressures are undermining monetary policy, reducing its effectiveness. Measured
reforms have taken place in the financial sector, but rapid growth of the banking system and
equity markets is straining supervisory capacity. Despite recently adopted Basel II standards,
risks have emerged from liquidity pressures, stock market exposures, and weakened
governance, especially at the state-owned commercial banks, in an environment of strong credit
expansion.
Notwithstanding global uncertainties, real GDP growth is projected to reach 6.3 percent in FY12
on still supportive domestic demand. Inflation is expected to remain at around 10 percent, given
relatively accommodative macroeconomic policies and possible upside pressures from higher
food and energy prices and a weaker taka. The current account will likely slip into a deficit in
FY12 of around ¾ percent of GDP and remain near this level over the next few years,
notwithstanding a favorable exports and remittances outlook, as fuel imports grow and
infrastructure investment intensifies. Concomitantly, foreign reserves are expected to decline to
2.3 months of import cover at end-FY12 from 2.9 months at end-FY11, and decrease further
over the medium term, absent stronger policy adjustment and timely structural reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ economic performance and poverty reduction
efforts in a fragile global environment. While the near-term growth outlook is favorable, high
commodity prices and accommodative policies are contributing to a deterioration in the current
account and inflation pressures. To preserve macroeconomic stability and to boost mediumterm growth prospects, Directors stressed the need for prudent macroeconomic policies and
advancing the reform process.
Directors emphasized that reducing vulnerabilities while maintaining space for social and
development spending will require concerted policy actions. In the fiscal area, they called for
well-designed measures to reduce subsidy costs. This will require further adjustments to
domestic energy prices, with targeted safeguards to protect the poor. Welcoming the recent
efforts to increase tax revenues, Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with tax
reforms, including modernizing the tax regime and timely approval of the new VAT and income
tax laws. They also highlighted the need to strengthen public financial management and to
continue to improve Annual Development Program implementation, including more effective use
of development partner resources. Directors observed that Bangladesh is at low risk of external
debt distress. It will nevertheless remain important to pursue a sound debt management
strategy with continued reliance on concessional external financing, careful control over the
domestic debt burden, and proper accounting for contingent liabilities.
Directors supported further monetary tightening and continued exchange rate flexibility. They
urged Bangladesh Bank to reduce its financing of the budget deficit in line with achieving its
FY12 monetary targets, accompanied by higher policy and treasury rates and limited liquidity
support. Increased interest rate flexibility will help strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism, and greater central bank independence will improve overall policy effectiveness. In
view of external pressures, Directors stressed the importance of limiting foreign exchange

3
market intervention to smoothing short-term volatility and maintaining adequate reserves. They
welcomed the new reserve management guidelines, and recommended that they also govern
the use of foreign exchange overdrafts.
Directors emphasized that ensuring the soundness of the financial sector is essential to
maintain macroeconomic stability and reduce fiscal risks. Key priorities are to strengthen bank
supervision and oversight, and improve governance and performance, in particular of stateowned commercial banks. Directors also stressed the need for strong equity market oversight,
including to contain systemic risks that could arise from market volatility.
Directors agreed that further progress on key structural reforms will be critical to achieve the
ambitious growth and poverty reduction objectives. The focus should be on reforms aimed at
relieving infrastructure bottlenecks, enhancing the trade and investment regime, and improving
the business environment, including for labor-intensive activities.
Many Directors favorably noted the authorities’ interest in a possible Extended Credit Facilitysupported program to help stabilize the reserve position and foster the reform efforts, to be
underpinned by strengthened macroeconomic policies.

Statement by Arvind Virmani, Executive Director for Bangladesh and
Koodathumuriyil Eapen, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 25, 2011
1.
The Bangladesh authorities would like to put on record their appreciation to the Fund
staff for their constructive engagement which has led to an effective and productive 2011
Article IV Consultation. They have found the discussions on various aspects of the
Bangladesh economy and the evolving outlook open-minded and useful. They have also
found the reports presenting a balanced view of the economy and broadly reflecting the
discussions held between them and the staff. The authorities are in general agreement in
principle with the assessments and policy messages of the reports.
Macroeconomic Developments and General Outlook
2.
The authorities point out that Bangladesh is steadily moving towards a high growth
trajectory, which is evidenced by the fact that, over the last 5 years, the country has achieved
an average annual growth rate of 6.2 percent. Real GDP growth in FY’11 (Bangladesh
follows a July to June fiscal) has increased to 6.7 percent from 6.1 percent in FY’10. This
development has been primarily attributed to the good performance of the industrial and
agricultural sectors along with improved growth in the service sector. Industrial production
has risen by 9.5 percent mainly due to external demand for garment products. Further, the
authorities’ steps to overcome infrastructural bottlenecks in the power, energy and
communication sectors have had a positive impact on all sectors of the economy. An
additional 2022 MW of electricity has been added to the national grid between January, 2009
and June, 2011and this is likely to go up to 2969 MW by December 2011.
3.
Given brighter prospects for increasing agricultural and manufacturing output, as well
as due to strong remittance inflows, the authorities estimate that the economy will grow by
7.0 percent in FY’12. There has been a substantial increase in remittance inflows in JulySeptember 2011 and they feel that remittances are likely to further register higher inflows in
the current fiscal year. Besides, they note that prudent fiscal policy measures and effective
public investment coupled with public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives will support
achieving this planned growth by crowding in private investment. Continued reforms in the
financial sector and in the capital markets together with appropriate monetary and other
growth supportive policies will further contribute to the process of realizing growth targets.
4.
Bangladesh has increased its real per capita income by more than 130 percent and cut
the poverty rate by 60 percent over the past 40 years. This development is due to a range of
improvements in the socioeconomic structure of the country, including enhanced economic
growth, expansion of primary and secondary education, reduction in infant and child
mortality rate, control of the spread and fatality of malaria and tuberculosis, reforestation and

2
access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The percentage of population living below the
poverty line has gone down from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 31.5 percent in 2010.
5.
Regarding inflationary pressures, the authorities point out that inflation in Bangladesh
is mainly driven by external supply-side factors, triggered by international price hikes in
food, fuel and fertilizer. In addition, there has been enhanced internal demand for food and
energy, which has also caused upward inflationary pressures. The 12-month average CPI has
risen by 7.3 percent in FY’10 and further increased to 8.8 percent in FY’11. Accommodative
monetary policies in FY’11 to support higher credit demand for public and private sector
investment could also have contributed to this rise. Inflationary pressures have remained on
the rise in the current fiscal, with a rise in the average CPI by 9.4 percent till August 2011.
However, with the likely positive supply responses of the real sector to the policy measures
of the Government and the Bangladesh Bank (BB), the impact of the price rise is expected to
moderate in due course. The authorities feel that recent steps taken to contract monetary
expansion as well as domestic supply-side interventions to ensure uninterrupted flow of
essential commodities in the market are likely to further restrain inflationary pressures. They
will keep a constant watch on the current inflationary trends and are ready to take necessary
steps in case the inflationary scenario poses a threat to macroeconomic stability.
Fiscal Sector Developments
6.
On the fiscal front the authorities state that total revenue, as estimated in the FY’12
budget, is likely to reach a level of 12.1 percent of GDP. The increase in revenue
mobilization has been encouraging with a 20 percent growth in FY’11. There has been a 27.8
percent growth in the National Board of Revenue (NBR) collected taxes, exceeding the
budget estimate by nearly 1½ percentage points and the scaled up revised tax revenue
estimates by 0.8 percentage points. For the first time, the Tax-GDP ratio has crossed 10
percent by reaching a level of 10.1 percent in FY’11 compared to 9.0 percent in FY’10.
Following the recent drive to step up tax revenue collection, the estimated tax revenue
growth in FY’12 is likely to be 20.4 percent. The authorities have indicated that the
improvement in revenue performance can be attributed to the effectiveness of various
reforms initiated by the government in tax policy and administration including modernization
and automation of tax administration, expansion of tax net and coverage, reduction of tax
exemptions and the creation of awareness among citizens for paying taxes. The draft new
VAT Act is now under stakeholders’ consultation prior to being placed before the Parliament
by FY’12. A Direct (Income) Tax Act has also been drafted and stakeholder’s consultation
will be started soon. Nevertheless, a number of legal provisions included in these two laws
have already been given effect through the Finance Act passed by the Parliament, along with
the budgets of FY’11 and FY’12. These measures are expected to give a further impetus to
enhanced revenue collection.

3
7.
On the expenditure front, the implementation of the Annual Development Program
(ADP) has remained satisfactory (92 percent of revised allocation) in FY’11. In order to
further enhance the effectiveness of public expenditure and investment, emphasis is being
placed on reforms in the areas of project implementation, procurement, and monitoring. To
make public spending more effective, the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework has been
rolled out across all ministries/divisions in the government. Initiatives are also underway to
create a Budget Management Wing/Branch in all line ministries/divisions to strengthen the
process of budget formulation. The Ministry of Planning has taken up steps to amend the
existing procedure for project planning, approval and implementation to speed up project
processing and implementation. Private sector investment is also being actively sought
through PPP initiatives.

The expenditure on subsidies was 2.2 percent of GDP in FY’11. To reduce the
pressure on public resources, the authorities have recently raised the administered prices of
fuel oil, compressed natural gas (CNG) and electricity even though they feel that it might
have some impact on inflation. They have plans to further rationalize prices of fuel and
electricity by aligning them with international prices. This is likely to reduce the fiscal
burden and also create greater space for expenditure on physical and social infrastructure.
Under the power tariff rationalization plan (FY 2009-2014), the Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB) will reach a breakeven level by FY 2014. Similarly, fuel prices
in local markets will also be gradually aligned with prices in the neighboring countries.
9.
The authorities have indicated that prudent fiscal management has enabled the
government to keep the overall budget deficit at an acceptable level of 3.9 percent of GDPin
FY’11. However, the budget deficit has been estimated at 5.0 percent of GDP in FY’12 with
an expected financing mix of 3.0 percent from domestic sources and 2.0 percent from
external sources. The debt situation remains within acceptable limits. There has been a
continuous focus on reforms in domestic debt instruments, for exploring cost-effective
external financing sources and for keeping contingent liabilities within sustainable limits.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis of Bangladesh indicates that the economy’s risk of debt
distress is low. The External Debt to GDP ratio has decreased from 24.3 percent in FY’09 to
20.4 percent in FY’11. A draft Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) is under preparation
and will be finalized by December 2011.
Monetary and Financial Sector Developments
10.
The expansion in broad money (M2) at 21.3 percent during FY’11 was marginally
lower than that of 22.4 percent experienced during FY’10. Domestic credit has also increased
by 27.4 percent in the FY’11 compared with 17.9 percent in the previous year. Reserve
money (RM) recorded an increase of 21.1 percent during FY’11 compared with 16.0 percent
during FY’10 mainly driven by increase in net domestic assets of BB by 87.0 percent. To

4
reign in monetary expansion and credit growth, the BB has raised repo and reverse repo rates
four times in FY’11 and once in September during the current fiscal year. As a consequence,
growth in broad money, reserve money and domestic credit are all now moving along the
BB’s programmed levels. Meanwhile lending rate caps have also been removed to provide
interest rate flexibility in the market and this is expected to reduce credit flow to
unproductive sectors.
11.
The authorities have indicated that the broad targets set forth in the government’s
FY’12 budget and the BB’s Monetary Policy Statements (MPS) for July-December 2011 are
aimed to keep money supply growth within acceptable levels in order to target inflation
without affecting macroeconomic stability, growth and poverty reduction efforts. They have
stated that the monetary policy stance during the first half of the FY’12 aims at ensuring
reasonable price stability and providing support to the sustainable and high output growth
targets as adopted in the macro framework of the current fiscal. In order to provide for
growth supportive policies, the policy stance would give priority to unhindered flow of
private sector credit to the economy’s productive sectors, with agriculture, SMEs and the
rural economy being the prime targets. While the policy stance would be to lessen the
pressures on inflation by increasing supply of output and keeping demand pressures within
control, the target rate of average inflation has been kept at around 8.0 percent for FY’12.
12.
The authorities have also indicated that reforms are also being actively pursued with a
view to modernizing and strengthening the financial sector. The draft amendments to Bank
Companies Act 1991 have already been posted on the Bangladesh Bank's website seeking the
views of the public. Audits of the State Owned Commercial Banks (SOCBs) for FY’10 have
been carried out by internationally-affiliated audit firms in order to improve their financial
performance. In order to comply with Basel II requirements, the BB has raised the riskweighted capital adequacy ratio for banks to 9 percent from July 1st 2011 and this will be
further raised to 10 percent from July 1st 2012.
13.
The government has also undertaken various reform initiatives to develop the capital
market and restore confidence of small investors. The authorities have indicated that these
reforms include, inter alia, demutualization of two stock exchanges; the Dhaka and
Chittagong Stock Exchanges have been asked to submit comprehensive concept papers
detailing the steps and legal requirements needed to be followed in the demutualization
process. Other reform initiatives include revising the book building method, intensifying
market surveillance, framing a Financial Reporting Act and establishing a Financial
Reporting Council to oversee the audit and accounting standards. The authorities expect that
these initiatives are likely to bring back confidence in the capital markets as well as help it
grow further.

External Sector Developments
14.
The authorities have pointed out that export receipts have increased by 41.7 percent
as against an import growth of 41.8 percent in FY’11. Garment products, especially knitwear
and woven garments, raw jute and jute products dominate the export sector in Bangladesh.
There has been an exponential growth in imports, mainly of capital machinery and industrial
raw materials. Despite significant export growth, increased import bills have led to a
widening trade deficit of US$ 7.3 billion in FY’11. Further, sluggish growth in private
transfers including remittance has altogether contributed to the deterioration of current
account balance (US$ 995 million in FY’11 as against US$ 3737 million in FY’10). In
addition, stagnant foreign direct investment (FDI) and a decline in foreign assistance have
resulted in deficits in the capital and financial accounts of Balance of Payment (BoP) in
FY’11. With a small surplus in the current account balance and a higher deficit in capital and
financial accounts, the resulting deficit in the overall balance has led to a drawdown from the
foreign exchange reserve. In addition, the nominal exchange rate also depreciated due to
higher import demand and slower growth in foreign remittances, FDI inflows and external
assistance.
15.
Export receipts have registered a 22.5 percent growth in July-September, 2011 while
imports grew only by 19.6 percent during July-August, 2011. In addition, remittance growth
in the first quarter of FY12 was 9.3 percent as compared to 6.0 percent in FY 2011. Despite a
small easing of the situation in the current account balance in the recent months with
reduction in import growth, the higher deficits in the financial and capital account, mainly
due to net outflows of foreign resources and stagnancy in FDI inflows, are posing a threat to
foreign exchange reserves and the BoP. The authorities have indicated that the foreign
exchange reserves are around US$ 10.0 billion at present- sufficient only to meet import bills
for 2.9 months. In this context, the authorities have mentioned that access to IMF resources
under a three-year Extended Credit Facility, would be crucial for stabilizing the reserve
position and strengthening reform efforts that have already been initiated.
16.
In conclusion, the authorities have indicated that Bangladesh aspires to reach the status
of a middle income country by FY’21. The current pressures on BoP are mainly due to rising
petroleum and food prices and also, to some extent, due to increased public and private sector
investment demand which is needed to take the country to a desired higher growth trajectory.
However, the pressure on BoP is expected to be eased through efficient and effective
macroeconomic management. The authorities need appropriate assistance from development
partners as they seek to strike a balance between enhanced demand for infrastructure,
continued efforts for poverty reduction and keeping reform initiatives on track. They feel that
this will help achieve the sustainable higher growth that the country is striving for.
