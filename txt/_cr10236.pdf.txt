KUWAIT
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
Approved by Alfred Kammer and David Marston
June 30, 2010


Discussions: Held in Kuwait during April 7–18, 2010 with Mr. Khalifa Hamada,
Undersecretary of Finance; Mr. Mohammad Y. Al-Hashel, Deputy Governor of the
Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK); Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Anjari, Member of the
Economic and Financial Committee of the National Assembly; other senior
government officials; and private sector representatives. Mr. Shaalan (OED) also
participated in some of the policy discussions.



Team: Ms. Khamis (Head, MCD); Messrs. Cevik, Charap, Prasad, and Rodriguez
(all MCD).



Mission Focus: Short- and medium-term growth strategy, risks to the outlook—
particularly for the financial sector, and the appropriate policy mix to sustain growth
and macroeconomic and financial stability.



Previous Consultation: Concluded on April 10, 2009. The staff report and the PIN
of the Executive Board’s discussion is available at:
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22951.0.



Exchange Arrangements: The exchange regime is classified as conventional peg to
a basket. Kuwait has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4,
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers of
international transactions, other than certain security-related restrictions notified to
the Fund pursuant to Decision 144-(52/51).



Data: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Further progress regarding quality and timeliness is needed, particularly
in the national accounts.

I. CONTEXT
1.
Kuwait’s economy was affected significantly by the global crisis. The impact hit
Kuwait in the second half of 2008, through the decline in oil prices and production, and was
further exacerbated by the intensification of liquidity shortages in global financial markets
post-Lehman’s collapse. Oil market developments had a direct impact on government
finances and external positions, but they also had an indirect impact on financial and
corporate sector liquidity as the speculative capital inflows experienced in 2007 and early
2008 reversed in the second half of 2008 and investor confidence declined. These
developments triggered a steep fall in real estate and equity prices and weakened the
financial system’s balance sheet.1
2.
Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by about 4½ percent in 2009—the
weakest performance among GCC countries. Real oil GDP declined by more than
11 percent, and real non-oil GDP is estimated to have remained flat, mainly reflecting weaker
activity in the financial and construction sectors. Lower domestic demand and a 12 percent
drop in import prices reduced average consumer price inflation to 4 percent. Equity prices
continued to decline, money growth slowed, and credit growth plunged on account of lower
demand and higher risk aversion by banks. Fiscal and external surpluses narrowed as oil
revenues and investment income declined. The Kuwaiti dinar (KD) depreciated by about
4 percent against the U.S. dollar (Figures 1 and 2).
3.
The financial sector, particularly investment companies (ICs), experienced
funding pressures and deterioration in asset quality. ICs—with significant dependence on
external financing, maturity mismatches,

A forceful early response by the authorities contributed to financial sector
stability. Measures were extensive, ranging from liquidity support to the introduction of a
financial stability law (Figure 4 and Annex 1). The CBK required banks to take precautionary
provisioning and encouraged some to increase capital. Only one bank needed public funds for
recapitalization. As of end-2009, the banking sector’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was at 18
percent and all banks maintained CARs well above the regulatory minimum of 12 percent.
Similarly, the leverage ratio stood at a comfortable level of 12 percent. Banking system
liquidity was adequate, with liquid assets covering 35 percent of short-term liabilities,
supported by public sector deposits. The overall open net foreign currency position was
marginal. Nevertheless, the impact of government support measures on credit growth and
non-oil activity was limited in light of the absence of fiscal stimulus and the limited utilization
by borrowers and banks of guarantees provided for under the financial stability law.2

The absence of a fiscal stimulus reflected the authorities’ perception that fiscal prudence was warranted in
light of the sharp decline in revenues and the uncertainty surrounding oil price developments (IMF Country
Report No. 09/152).

5.
The relationship between the government and the National Assembly has
improved but remains tense. In particular, the Assembly’s approval of a debt relief law—
opposed by the government—could reignite tensions.
II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
6.
The economic outlook is broadly positive. Real GDP is projected to increase by
around 2 percent, with non-oil GDP growth of about 2½ percent—spurred by government
spending in the context of the recently approved development plan (DP)—and oil GDP
growth of about 1 percent. Inflation will remain at around 4 percent in 2010, primarily due to
a moderation in rental rates, which is expected to offset the increase in imported inflation.
The economy is projected to grow steadily over the medium term as the global recovery
boosts the demand for oil and the government continues the DP’s implementation. The fiscal
and current account balances are expected to remain stable in 2010–11 and improve in
subsequent years, as oil receipts and investment income recover (Figure 5 and Table 5).

The financial sector is expected to continue to face challenges in the immediate
term. Bank loan concentration in the weak real estate sector, equities, and ICs are likely to
result in higher NPLs in 2010 (Figure 6). Nevertheless, high CARs—which were supported
by capital increases in some large

generally (Box 1).

Box 1. Kuwait: Investment Companies—A Tale of Two Restructurings
Corporate debt restructuring has taken various forms in different countries. During the Asian crisis, key
elements included government financial intervention, the establishment of state restructuring agencies, the
implementation of legal and regulatory reforms, and out-of-court settlements. The current global financial
crisis necessitated significant government support to the financial sector, particularly in light of substantial
systemic cross-sectoral linkages.1
The crisis management strategy in Kuwait included immediate measures to ensure macroeconomic and
financial stability, followed by measures to support the corporate debt restructuring phase and economic
growth. Macroeconomic and financial stability facilitated market-based debt restructuring of investment
companies (ICs). The March 2009 Financial Stability Law (FSL) established an orderly and efficient
mechanism for facilitating the timely restructuring of debt of solvent companies through legal protection,
and facilitated access to sufficient financing to support an economic recovery.
As of June 2010, five ICs had defaulted on their debt. Global Investment House (GIH), the largest IC,
defaulted on the majority of its $3 billion debt; Investment Dar (ID) on its $100 million sukuk; Gulfinvest
International on a U.A.E. dirham 200 million loan from the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank; International
Investment Group, on a payment for its $200 million Islamic bond; and Kuwait Finance and Investment
Company (KFIC) restructured $495 million in debts owed to local and foreign lenders.
The conclusion in late 2009 of a market-based debt restructuring agreement by GIH with 54 lending banks
demonstrated a speedy and orderly debt restructuring process, with constructive facilitation by the CBK.
The key terms of the GIH market-based restructuring included the full repayment of outstanding debt and
an overhaul of the business model to ensure long-term viability. The specific terms of GIH restructuring
encompassed the exchange of existing debt with secured new multi-currency, conventional, Islamic and
bilateral facilities; a reduction in operational costs; orderly deleveraging of principal investment positions
through transfers to a global macro fund and a domestic real estate fund; a strengthened focus on asset
management and brokerage business; and enhanced corporate governance.
ID has reached a debt standstill agreement with more than two-thirds of its creditor banks and investors
pending a final agreement, which envisages the repayment of its obligations with an enforceable security
package over a five-year period. ID has sought protection under the FSL to ensure a stay against litigation
and execution of judgments against it from minority creditors until its restructuring plan is approved.
As of May 2010, the restructuring of ICs involved no fiscal cost to the government, avoided contagion to
the banking system, and ring-fenced fiduciary assets from the restructuring process. In light of the
protracted insolvency procedures in Kuwait, creditors are likely to prefer restructuring rather than pressing
for dissolution of ICs.

8.
The authorities agreed that 2009 had been challenging and highlighted recent
positive developments. They noted progress achieved in the restructuring of the two largest
ICs, the increase in precautionary provisions by banks, and the large degree of liquidity in the
banking system. Furthermore, they argued that the increase in the banking system’s NPLs
was skewed by the results in two banks and that banks’ asset quality could improve with the
envisaged economic recovery. There were some positive signs regarding credit expansion,
with credit allocation going largely to households for installment loans rather than for equity
purchases. They viewed the pace of ICs’ restructuring as reasonable and argued that
problems were concentrated in only a few large companies.

10
III. RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK AND VULNERABILITIES
9.
The economic outlook largely depends on the pace of global recovery. Although
Kuwait has the financial strength to smooth out the impact of short-term oil price fluctuations
on its fiscal position, a weaker than expected global recovery and a decline in oil prices could
impact regional and domestic asset markets, investor confidence, and government spending,
leading to a worsening of the balance sheet of financial institutions. Additionally,
deterioration in the regional economic or political environment might have an impact on
investor confidence and Kuwaiti entities’ access to and pricing of international funding.3
10.
The outlook is also subject to domestic downside risks. The overarching risks
would be associated with the inability of the government to meet the DP’s spending targets,
particularly in light of capacity constraints and the under-spending of the capital budget in
previous years. Notwithstanding the improvement in relations between the government and
the National Assembly, as evident from the recent progress made on the legislative front,
political gridlock could delay necessary reforms and impact implementation, and red tape
and bureaucratic hurdles could discourage private sector participation. A slow recovery of
the nonfinancial corporate sector could stretch their debt-service capacity and limit their
ability to finance new investments. A further deterioration in the balance sheet of financial
institutions or delays in the restructuring of ICs would protract banks’ risk aversion to
lending, limit private sector financing for new projects, and constrain non-oil GDP growth.

In the longer term, slow progress in the implementation of oil projects could
constrain fiscal revenues. Kuwait has adequate excess oil production capacity in the
medium term. Nevertheless, unless progress is made toward oil sector project
implementation, protracted capacity constraints could have a significant impact on revenues
in the long term.
12.
The authorities concurred with staff on downside risks to the outlook. In addition
to high oil price volatility and oil dependency, they were concerned about geopolitical risks
affecting confidence in the region. They also highlighted some domestic political risks—such
as the passage of the debt relief law and the tensions related to the privatization law—that
could affect the credit culture and the pace of structural reforms.
Stress Tests
13.
Banking system stress tests conducted by the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) update indicate that the system could broadly withstand significant

Since only one government-related entity (the Gulf Investment Group, owned by the six GCC countries) has
issued debt internationally, the impact would be largely related to private sector debt issuers.

11
shocks, although some banks could be vulnerable to a severe shock.4 Two adverse
scenarios (intermediate and severe) were constructed involving a slowdown in the global
economy that would lower oil revenues, reduce investor and consumer confidence, constrain
access to credit, increase domestic interest rates, and depress asset prices. In turn, these
would increase NPLs—up to 19 percent of total loans under the severe scenario—and result
in bank losses. Recapitalization needed to restore banks’ regulatory CAR to 12 percent would
be around 1.0 percent of GDP under the intermediate scenario, and 3.8 percent of GDP under
the severe scenario. Vulnerability to interest rate and foreign exchange risks was limited.
14.
Stress tests of ICs point to their limited capacity to withstand adverse shocks.
Under an assumption of 15–33 percent asset loss rates, three ICs (out of eleven) would lose
all of their capital and seven ICs would have a capital-to-assets ratio below 10 percent. Under
a more severe scenario, which assumes 20–66 percent loss rates, eight ICs would lose all
their capital and only one IC would have a leverage ratio above 10 percent. Stress tests of
nonfinancial corporations also point to some fragility in the real estate and industry sectors,
particularly to increases in domestic interest rates and a revenue shock (Box 2).
15.
Spillovers from the Dubai debt developments have been limited so far. The
banking sector has minimal direct exposure to Dubai real estate and entities. However,
indirect exposure could arise through the exposure of ICs and real estate companies to Dubai.
Single factor stress tests indicate that banks could be vulnerable to a deterioration in their real
estate portfolios (including loans to real estate companies), but losses related to a
deterioration in loans to ICs would be manageable.
16.
The authorities reiterated that the financial system was resilient. Additionally,
four banks were in the process of increasing their capital further in 2010 and one bank has
already increased its capital in early 2010. These will further enhance the resilience of the
banking sector.
IV. POLICY ISSUES
A. Strategy for Sustained Economic Growth
17.
Swift financial sector measures have helped support financial and
macroeconomic stability. Early action in the financial sector and continued vigilance by the
authorities should also help restore healthy credit conditions and support non-oil economic
activity. Nevertheless, in light of weak private sector balance sheets, fiscal stimulus will also
be needed to support financial sector measures and revive non-oil economic growth.

4

At a request from the authorities, a mission visited Kuwait in March 2010 to undertake the FSAP update. The
FSAP focused on assessing the overall financial system stability and identifying priorities to strengthen the
regulatory framework in banking, investment companies, capital market, insurance, and real estate sectors. The
mission also reviewed the crisis management, contingency planning and the resolution framework.

12
Box 2. Kuwait: Vulnerabilities of the Nonfinancial Corporate Sector
This analysis focuses on the balance sheet of the 109 non-financial companies listed on the Kuwait Stock
Exchange. The total assets of these firms were $75 billion (147 percent of non-oil GDP) as of the end of
2009 and their total debt was $22 billion (43 percent of non-oil GDP). Net corporate profits increased to
$1.8 billion in 2009, compared to $0.8 billion in 2008, while the combined cash holdings of nonfinancial firms stood at $5 billion (down marginally from $5.8 billion in 2008). The average debt-toequity ratio at end-2009 was 1.1 and short-term debt constituted 35 percent of the total debt stock.
Nevertheless, the unprecedented pace of debt accumulation in the boom years—for example, the debt-toequity ratio doubled between 2006 and 2008— raises questions about the vulnerability of the nonfinancial corporate sector to financing constraints and a prolonged economic slowdown.
Listed non-financial corporations as a whole appear to have adequate debt servicing capacity, with the
ratio of total liabilities to total assets at 49.6 percent as of end 2009. Similarly, the interest coverage ratio
(ICR)—defined as earnings before interest and taxes over interest payments—stood at 2.6 on an assetweighted basis, well above the threshold of 1 for debt distress. Nevertheless, out of 109 listed nonfinancial companies, 49 already had either operating losses or an ICR below 1 in 2009. Including cash
balances, the ICR increases to 6.2, with only 25 non-financial companies with an ICR below 1.

Source: Fund staff calculations based on company balance sheets.

If short-term interest rates increase by 300 basis points, or if there is a negative income shock of
25 percent, 31 listed non-financial firms could end up with an ICR below 1 (17 companies, if cash
balances were included). Furthermore, in testing the tail risk, if monetary tightening leads to an increase
of short-term interest rates by 500 basis points, 36 firms would have an ICR below 1 (18 companies, if
cash balances were included). Some sectors, such as industrial and real estate, have more leveraged
balance sheets and are therefore more sensitive to interest rate and income shocks. Overall, although
cash reserves of companies provide a reasonable cushion for the time being, it would diminish if
economic slowdown persists.

18.
Staff welcomes the thrust of the DP and the planned role of the private sector in
its implementation. The DP provides the needed fiscal expansion to support recovery in the
immediate term. It seeks to boost investment expenditures across the board, enhance the role
of the private sector in the economy, and have positive spillover effects through higher
healthcare and education spending. The government’s cost of the plan is estimated at
$55 billion (about 56 percent of 2009 GDP), which is expected to be matched by the private
sector through public-private-participation and the establishment of joint stock companies.
Approximately $17 billion is budgeted to be spent by the general government in 2010/11,

13
half of which has been allocated in the central government’s budget. As a result, the adjusted
non-oil fiscal deficit is projected to widen by 10 percentage points of non-oil GDP.5
19.
Implementation of the DP needs to be managed carefully. Implementation should
take into account absorptive capacity and supply constraints. Spending should focus on social
and key physical infrastructure projects, keeping in mind project viability, and excessive
private sector leverage should be avoided. Successful implementation would require progress
in structural reforms to create an enabling environment for private investment and financing.
In this connection, initiatives to diversify financing channels, including corporate debt
market development, should be pursued.
20.
Progress achieved in structural reforms is welcome, but significant challenges
remain. The new Capital Markets (CMA) Law paves the way for the establishment of an
independent capital market authority that will regulate the Kuwait Stock Exchange, supervise
public and private subscriptions, and regulate and supervise acquisitions and mergers. The
Law also grants broad regulatory and supervisory authority over ICs to the CMA. The new
private sector labor law introduces sweeping changes to labor regulation, including allowing
for the portability of expatriates’ work permits, and the recently approved privatization law
opens up most activities to the private sector with the exclusion of the oil, gas, health, and
education sectors. Amendments to the companies and tender laws are expected to be
considered by parliament in the second half of 2010. Staff encourages an expeditious
implementation of the new laws and cautions that a reversion to political gridlock could
cause significant delays to additional necessary legislative reforms.
21.
The authorities acknowledged the need for further progress in structural
reforms. They emphasized their commitment to enhance the environment for private sector
investment and noted their intentions to initiate reforms in the education and health sectors to
prepare Kuwaiti nationals for private sector employment. While they were aware of the need
to diversify financing channels to corporates, they highlighted the failure of earlier efforts to
stimulate private sector bond activity and noted that supportive market fundamentals are
needed to complement initiatives by the authorities.
B. Macroeconomic Policy Mix
22.
Expansionary capital expenditures are welcome. Planned expenditures in the
context of the DP are essential to resume non-oil sector growth and are consistent with the
government’s long-term economic diversification objectives. They should help strengthen
investor confidence and private sector balance sheets, and revive non-oil economic growth.

5

The adjusted non-oil fiscal balance excludes investment income and the recapitalization of social security, and
is calculated after the transfers to the Future Generations Fund.

14
23.
The growth of current expenditures should be contained. Past conservative fiscal
policies have allowed the accumulation of a sizeable stock of financial wealth and placed
Kuwait in a good position to meet the challenges of economic diversification and
intergenerational equity in the distribution of oil wealth. Nevertheless, government current
expenditures have expanded rapidly in recent years, largely on account of increases in wages,
subsidies, and transfers. In addition to contributing to an inefficient allocation of resources,6
this trend could undermine long-term fiscal sustainability (Box 3). While an assessment of
long-term sustainability of fiscal policy is highly sensitive to the parameters involved in the
calculation, staff estimates suggest that the government’s non-oil deficit is somewhat above
its long-term sustainable value, and this gap is projected to widen over time.7
24.
Monetary policy remains subject to the constraints associated with the exchange
rate regime. In this context, the responsibility for ensuring adequate credit growth and
maintaining financial stability if demand pressures were to reemerge will fall on
macroprudential policies.8 A reemergence of inflationary pressures in the immediate term is
not expected in the baseline scenario. During the past year, the CBK adjusted downward its
policy rates on several occasions, in line with domestic credit conditions and U.S. interest
rate reductions.
25.
The basket peg has served Kuwait well and remains an appropriate exchange rate
regime in the run up to the GCC monetary union. Staff calculations using CGER-type
analyses suggest that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with its fundamentals (Box 4).
The regime provided some flexibility to the nominal and real exchange rate during 2007–09
(Figure 7), which witnessed high volatility in oil prices.
26.
The authorities agreed with staff about the need to control current expenditures.
They noted that the privatization program would contribute to this objective and the
introduction of a personal income tax and a VAT system would also help reduce the non-oil
deficit. They also emphasized that the pace of implementations of these measures would
likely be gradual. On the macroeconomic policy mix, while monetary policy had played a
key stabilizing role during the crisis, the authorities emphasized that fiscal policy was now
needed to stimulate growth. They also argued that the basket peg provided sufficient
monetary policy flexibility, as indicated by a sustained deviation of domestic interest rates
from U.S. monetary cycle, including during 2008–10, both with respect to timing and the
extent of interest rate reductions.
6

High levels of untargeted subsidies, such as those observed in Kuwait’s power sector, create an inefficient,
high level of consumption. High levels of public sector wages—particularly if not tied to performance—weaken
the incentives of Kuwaiti workers to acquire the skills needed for private sector employment.

7
8

The authorities are in the process of establishing a macro-fiscal unit to support policy formulation.

Kuwait has in place a loan-to-deposit prudential ratio. Maximum limits debt service/income ratios are also in
place.

15
Box 3. Kuwait: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
The fiscal sustainability analysis suggests that Kuwait’s government expenditure path
should be reduced in the medium-term to ensure long-term sustainability. In this
exercise, long-term sustainability assumes intergenerational equity by assuming a constant
real per capita government expenditure path that delivers a constant real per capita annuity
after oil revenues are exhausted. In the baseline scenario, the non-oil fiscal balance for
FY 2010/2011 is estimated to be approximately 3½ percentage points higher than its
equilibrium value, and the gap is projected to reach approximately 7 percent by 2014/15.
While the results are sensitive to
the assumptions, they provide
useful guidance.1 For instance,
under an alternative set of
assumptions, the gap in 2010/11
would switch signs, indicating a
non-oil deficit below its
equilibrium value. Nevertheless,
even under this scenario, fiscal
sustainability would face
challenges, as the non-oil deficit
would have approximately
reached its equilibrium value by
2014/15.

The baseline calculations assume long-term values of the real rate of return of assets, inflation, and population
growth of Kuwaiti nationals of 4 percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent, respectively. Oil reserves are assumed to be
depleted in 73 years and the oil price to reach 83 dollars per barrel in 2015 and remain constant in real terms
thereafter. The alternative calculation assumes long-term population growth of 1.4 percent (as forecasted for the
whole population [i.e., nationals and expatriates] by the 2008 United Nations World Population Prospects for the
period 2010-50).

C. Ensuring Financial Sector Stability
27.
Progress made so far on strengthening the financial system’s oversight
framework is welcome. The CBK has issued comprehensive regulatory guidance addressing
several weaknesses in banks’ risk management processes that came to light during the crisis
and has begun moving towards a risk-based supervisory process. It has also begun the process
of improving the oversight framework for ICs and has issued new regulations pertaining to
leverage, liquidity, and foreign exposure.9 The intended establishment of a Financial Stability
Department with an appropropriate mix of supervisory, financial market, and macroeconomic
expertise would help address financial stability issues in a systematic manner.
9

The regulations were issued in mid-2010 to be effective by mid-2010.

16
Box 4. Kuwait: Exchange Rate Assessment
A CGER-type analysis indicates that the Kuwaiti Dinar is in line with fundamentals, with all the
misalignment values being very close to zero.
The macrobalance (MB) approach suggests a slight overvaluation (less than ½ percent). Cross-country
work (see below) suggests an equilibrium current account for Kuwait of 40.1 percent of GDP, which is
slightly higher than the projected medium-term current account.
The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests an undervaluation of approximately
3 percent. This approach indicates that the depreciation in the equilibrium real exchange rate resulting
from recent developments (i.e., worsening in the terms of trade, decline in investment income, and
increase in government expenditure) has been fully offset by the actual depreciation of the real exchange
rate.
The external sustainability (ES) approach suggests an undervaluation of around 2½ percent, as the
current account surplus is slightly higher than what would be needed to guarantee intergenerational
equity in the consumption of oil resources. This result is very sensitive to the assumed parameters as
small declines in the assumed rate of return or increases in the projected population growth would result
in an indication of some overvaluation (e.g., the equilibrium current account would decline to
30¼ percent of GDP if—similarly to the stress tests in the fiscal sustainability analysis—population
growth were 1.4 percent). Furthermore, the external sustainability approach does not take oil price
uncertainty fully into account. For instance, Bems and de Carvalho Filho (2009, IMF WP/09/33)
calculate that precautionary savings associated with oil price uncertainty could increase Kuwait’s
equilibrium current account by about 5.6 percent of GDP.

of population growth; (iv) a riskless real rate of return of 4 percent [as in Bems

28.
Nevertheless, the financial system’s prudential and systemic oversight
framework needs to be strengthened further. The recent introduction of a set of new
regulations for ICs is welcome. Nevertheless, the oversight framework of ICs needs to be
strengthened. In particular, while the implementation of the Capital Market Authority (CMA)
Law would enhance securities regulation and supervision, there is a need for proper
coordination between the three regulatory agencies—the CBK, CMA, and the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry (MOCI). Regulatory overlaps and gaps should be closed to avoid
regulatory arbitrage (Box 5).
29.
The household debt relief law is counterproductive to building an efficient
financial culture. If promulgated, the proposed write-off of interest payments and debt
restructuring for Kuwaiti nationals (Annex 1) would create moral hazard that would
undermine the creation of a sound credit culture. It might also encourage banks to take riskier
positions and households to assume higher debt. Targeted household debt relief could be
implemented instead through the already existing Insolvency Fund. Fund size and terms of
access could be modified, if needed.10 The authorities have stated their strong opposition to
the household debt relief legislation.
30.
The crisis management and contingency planning system should be enhanced
further. As part of an exit strategy from all support measures provided in the context of the
crisis, the blanket guarantee introduced during the crisis should be replaced by an explicit
deposit insurance system once conditions allow. The resolution framework should be
upgraded by adopting a special resolution regime for failing financial institutions.
31.
The authorities are engaged to make their anti-money laundering and combating
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT ) legislation conform to international standards. A
draft law is expected to be considered by the National Assembly before the AML/CFT
assessment scheduled to be conducted by the IMF in October 2010.

18
Box 5. Kuwait: Priority Recommendations of the FSAP Update
General. The CBK, the CMA, and Ministry of Commerce and Industry should (i) clarify at the outset
their respective supervisory responsibilities and initiate a coordination process to ensure efficient
oversight architecture; (ii) establish a financial stability unit responsible for macroprudential supervision;
and (iii) develop an exit strategy from support measures to the financial system to be implemented once
conditions allow.
Banking supervision. The CBK should (i) perform periodic stress tests including for real estate and
other sectors with credit concentration risk and review the supervisory assessment of banks’ treatment
of risk concentrations in their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP); (ii) lower the
maximum exposure limits on related parties; (iii) enhance the legal framework to prohibit conflict of
interest concerning related party transactions; (iv) complete the migration from compliance-based
supervision to risk-based supervision; (v) continue strengthening the supervision capacity through
further hiring and training; (vi) shorten the on-site supervision cycle; and (vii) organize a comprehensive
ICAAP on-site examination.
Investment companies. There is a strong case for strengthening regulations on (i) licensing (in
particular “fit and proper” criteria); (ii) permissible activities; (iii) corporate governance, including
requirements on internal organization, internal control, risk management, external auditors, and
accountancy rules; and (iv) prudential limits on leverage and liquidity/maturity mismatch. Consideration
could also be given to varying the minimum capital depending on the activities and risks assumed by
supervised entities.
Financial Safety Net Framework. Consideration should be given toward (i) putting in place a deposit
insurance system that promotes market discipline; and (ii) improving the emergency liquidity assistance
framework.
Resolution Framework. Overhaul the bankruptcy framework for financial institutions to adequately
handle bankruptcies of banks or other financial institutions.

32.
The authorities argued that financial sector stability was due to the strong
oversight framework that was already in place. The authorities highlighted the resilience
of the banking system and believed that the oversight framework for ICs was adequate.
Nevertheless, they intended to strengthen the latter further by (i) delineating the
responsibilities of the CBK and the CMA regarding ICs’ supervision; and (ii) developing a
five-pronged regulatory prudential structure over ICs covering leverage, liquidity, foreign
funding risks, risk management, and corporate governance. The authorities also noted that
whereas the CBK continuously sought to enhance staffing quality, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, existing staffing capacity was fully adequate to ensure the discharge of CBK
responsibilities.
D. Statistical Issues
33.
The authorities should continue their efforts to improve their statistical system.
Staff welcomes recent progress to improve the timeliness of the CPI and the accuracy of
external debt, foreign assets, and workers’ remittances data. Nevertheless, statistical data
quality and timeliness continues to suffer from weaknesses, particularly with respect to
national accounts and trade.

19
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The global financial crisis had a significant impact on Kuwait given its
international trade and financial linkages. The impact was felt strongly in 2009 as real
GDP contracted, asset prices declined, and fiscal and external surpluses narrowed. The
financial and nonfinancial sectors witnessed a substantial fall in profitability, and five ICs
defaulted in 2009–10. Credit growth slowed significantly. The financial system remained
stable, underpinned by swift policy actions by the authorities, but credit growth and non-oil
activity were subdued in light of the absence of fiscal stimulus and the limited utilization of
guarantees provided for in the financial stability law.
35.
The economic outlook is broadly positive. The economy is expected to rebound in
2010, and to grow steadily over the medium term as the global recovery boosts the demand
for oil and the government implements the planned fiscal stimulus in the context of its fouryear DP, starting with an expansionary budget in 2010/11. The fiscal and current account
balances are expected to remain stable in 2010–11 and improve in subsequent years, as oil
receipts and investment income recover.
36.
The financial sector is expected to continue to face challenges in the immediate
term. Rising NPLs and large concentrations in banks’ loan portfolio—particularly in real
estate, ICs, and equities—are a source of concern. Nevertheless, aggregate financial soundness
indicators show that the banking sector is well capitalized and highly liquid, which should help
the system to remain stable. On the other hand, challenges facing ICs will be more extensive.
37.
The economic outcome for 2010 depends largely on government spending and
the associated private investment. External risks to the outlook include a weaker than
expected global recovery and a deterioration in the regional economic or political
environment. The overarching domestic risks would be associated with the inability of the
government to meet the spending targets set out in the DP. Political gridlock could delay
necessary reforms and impact implementation, and bureaucratic hurdles could discourage
private sector participation.
38.
Stress tests indicate that the banking system could reasonably withstand
significant shocks, although some banks are vulnerable to a severe macroeconomic shock.
Stress tests for ICs point to their limited capacity to withstand adverse shocks. Stress tests of
listed nonfinancial corporations suggest vulnerability in real estate and industrial sector
companies to a prolonged economic slowdown and financing constraints.
39.
The macro policy mix is adequate but growth of current expenditures should be
contained. Increases in recent years in wages, subsidies, and transfers could undermine
long-term fiscal sustainability and should be moderated. As monetary policy remains
constrained by the exchange rate regime, macroprudential policies should ensure financial
stability if a credit boom were to reemerge. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, and the current exchange rate regime remains appropriate in the run up to the
GCC monetary union.

20
40.
Successful implementation of the authorities’ growth agenda would require
progress in structural reforms. In this context, the passage of recent key laws, namely the
Capital Markets Law, the Labor Law, and the Privatization Law is welcome. The authorities
should move ahead with an efficient implementation of these laws and the amendment of
other key legislation, particularly the Companies and Tender Laws. DP implementation
should take into account project viability, absorptive capacity, and supply constraints.
41.
The financial system’s oversight framework should be strengthened. Proper
coordination should be ensured between the three regulatory agencies—the CBK, the CMA,
and the MOCI, particulalry with regards to ICs; and the crisis management, contingency
planning, and resolution frameworks should be enhanced. The authorities’ plans to introduce
an enhanced regulatory prudential structure over ICs are welcome.
42.
If promulgated, the household debt relief law would undermine the financial
culture. The law was passed by the National Assembly but rejected by the Amir. Targeted
household debt relief could be implemented instead through the already existing Insolvency
Fund.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The total recapitalization of Gulf Bank was KD 376 million, of
which 32 percent was bought by KIA.

2. Stock market purchases

5.25

KIA, along with other government entities (including Kuwait
Petroleum Corp and the Public Institution for Social Security),
launched in Dec. 2008 a Fund of KD 1.5 billion for investment in
the domestic stock market. As of April 2010, deployed funds
amounted to 30 percent of allocated funds.

3. Guarantees
(i) Gurantees on bank lending to the economy and ICs

…

The Financial Stability Law was issued in March 2009 by an Amiri
Decree and will continue to be in effect unless the parliament
rejects it. The intention of the law is to support: (i) banking sector
stability by providing full guarantees on banks’ provisioning
shortfalls; (ii) credit growth by guaranteeing 50 percent of loans to
the productive sectors of the economy, with a total allocated
guarantees amount of about KD 2 billion over 2009-10; and (iii)
viable ICs that face liquidity pressures by guaranteeing 50 percent
of their new borrowing, in addition to introducing a bankruptcy
protection clause, similar to Chapter 11 in the U.S., to allow for
the their orderly restructuring. As of April 2010, only KD 87 million
in loans have been extended under this provision, and only one IC
has applied to utilize bankruptcy protection provisions. The
banking sector has been fully provisioned and accordingly did not
resort to government underprovisioning guarantees.

(ii) Gurantees on bank deposits

…

In late 2008, full guarantees on customer deposits in local banks
were established through a law.

1.75

A KD 500 million fund was created in July 2008 to help nationals
whose repayment obligations represented more than half of their
monthly salary.

This law, which was approved by parliament in January 2010,
requires the government to first write off all outstanding interest on
personal and consumer loans taken out by Kuwaiti citizens from
banks and ICs until Dec 14, 2009. Banks and ICs would then
restructure the remaining debt in interest-free monthly
installments that must not exceed 35 percent of the debtors'
income. The repayment must be made over a period of at least 10
years. The law was rejected by the Amir, but could become law if
passed by a simple majority during the next session of paliament
(October 2010).

ANNEX II. KUWAIT—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 7, 2010)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait are currently developing a new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), to build on the previous CPS agreed on in 2007. The current CPS
has already received a strong support from the government; it will address specific sector
areas for which the Government needs Bank’s support within a multi-year strategic
framework.
Ongoing Activities—FY2010/11


Governance TA – Phase II. This is a continuation of the Governance program that
began in FY08 (Phase I completed in FY09.) The scope of the project included
review and/or assistance in drafting legislation pertaining to conflict of interest, and
asset and income disclosure by public officials; advice and guidance on the creation
of a well-functioning anticorruption agency including legal and institutional
framework; development of the agency’s strategic plan, operational manual and
guidelines; and public awareness campaign. The project is currently close to
completion.



Economic Zones Development. The World Bank has been assisting the Foreign
Direct Investment Bureau (KFIB) and the Public Authorities for Industry (PAI) in
conducting assessment of the development opportunities for several economic and
industrial zones in Kuwait. The Bank has procured consulting services for this
purpose and is supervising consultants’ work. Master plans for a PAI site
(Shadadiyah) have been delivered, along with engineering drawings for Shadadiya.
KFIB has also asked for assistance with feasibility study for several other Economic
Zones, as well as with the capacity building. The Bank is currently developing a
proposal to accommodate the request.



Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA). The PEFA
framework provided for a careful examination of a country’s public financial
management practices by monitoring the quality of Public Finance Management
work. This project also supported a significant capacity building effort so that future
exercises can be conducted by Kuwaiti consultants, academics and NGOs. The
project has been completed in FY10.



Corporate Governance Banking Sector Review. The Government requested the
ROSC – Corporate Governance, which entailed an evaluation of the corporate
governance practices in the Kuwait banking sector. The Bank team had also been
asked to evaluate a number of investment banks. The draft report has already been
discussed with the Government, and the project is close to completion.
Review of Spending Allocations. The Bank undertook an analytical desk review of
the major components of public spending in Kuwait. The review used as inputs (1)
the budget final accounts for the last six years (FY2003-2008 inclusive); (2) IMF staff
reports and selected issues papers; (3) previous Bank technical assistance reports on

spending effectiveness in the education and health sectors in Kuwait; (4) the World
Development Indicators database; and (5) the Bank’s report on education in the
Middle East North Africa region. The full report was presented to and discussed with
the MoF in March 2010.
Assessment of the Financial Crisis Impact. Kuwait’s Ministry of Finance (MOF)
has expressed interest in a World Bank assessment of the financial crisis’ impact on
the following sectors: (i) financial; (ii) real estate; (iii) industrial; (iv) commercial; (v)
construction; and (vi) services. After consulting with Central Bank of Kuwait on the
scope of the work, the MOF officially requested the Crisis Work be done in two
stages; starting with a quick analysis of the impact of the crisis on the above
mentioned sectors, and leading to a deeper analysis of those sectors that are impacted
the most.
Education Sector TA. This technical assistance program in general education sector
supports the Ministry of Education in the following three: improving the output of the
education process, diversifying secondary education (Grades 10-12) and developing
an education system for special needs and gifted students. This program builds on the
Education Indicators and Assessment Project successfully completed in FY10, which
over six years of its implementation involved publication of the annual Kuwait
Education Indicators report, capacity building in policy relevant data analysis,
implementation of the TIMSS and PIRLS, and other activities aimed at raising the
awareness regarding the quality of education in Kuwait.
Health Sector TA. To improve the performance of the Kuwaiti health system and to
ensure that the health sector contributes to the ongoing restructuring of the Kuwaiti
economy, the Ministry of Health (MOH) proposed work program covers a number of
areas in the short & medium term, including: health finance, health service quality &
standards (in partnership with UK NICE), communications within and outside the
MOH, drug & medical supplies, and Health Management Information Systems
(HMIS).
Solid Waste Management. The objective of this activity was to assist Industrial
Bank of Kuwait (IBK) in identifying market opportunities in the solid waste sector
while proposing a country program for the upgrade of the existing solid waste
management systems in Kuwait. More specifically, the Bank helped IBK to (i) better
understand the current situation of the solid waste sector in Kuwait; (ii)
identify/evaluate untapped business opportunities for the private sector in the solid
waste area; and (iii) promote reforms in the solid waste sector that would lead to
enhanced cost effectiveness of private sector participation, particularly in collection,
sorting and recycling of waste. This project was completed in February 2010.
Solid Waste Management II. Based on the reports delivered by the Bank team for
the first Solid Waste Management project and the recommendations proposed, the
Municipality of Kuwait City requested the Bank’s assistance in implementing four
main recommendations: (i) preparation & implementation of a national priority
project for the closure and rehabilitation of existing dumpsites, (ii) elaboration and

6





adoption of a solid waste master plan consistent with Kuwait Land-Use Master plan,
to identify national policy & investment priorities for the solid waste sector, (iii)
completion & harmonization of existing legal instruments, starting with a Solid Waste
Law, and (iv) establishment of a municipal solid waste agency under the
municipality’s authority.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): Partnership Technical Bureau (PTB)
Capacity Building. The objective of this activity was to assist the PTB in the
implementation of the BOT (build-operate-transfer) Law 7, 2008. More specifically,
the task team (i) prepared operating BOT guidelines in line with the new Kuwait law
and international best practice; and (ii) assisted the PTB in becoming a fully
operational body by recommending a suitable organizational structure as well as
provided ad hoc support in preparing and finalizing documents, including:
procurement documents for recruiting transaction advisors, Requests for Proposals.
The first phase was completed in March 2010, and currently the project team has
begun implementation of the second phase that will focus on the formal launch of the
Kuwait PPP program (and the dissemination of the PPP guidebook), including
preparation of a PPP policy note, the organization of a regional launch event;
institutional and capacity development for PTB; and assistance in establishing a
project development fund.
Technical Assistance to the Central Agency for Information Technology (CAIT).
In March 2009, CAIT asked the Bank’s assistance in three areas: establishing a
monitoring and evaluating framework to monitor and evaluate Kuwait’s egovernment strategies; putting in place a policy framework to help CAIT identify and
promote SMEs in the IT field; and producing a regulatory framework that would help
guide CAIT in their outsourcing efforts through PPPs.

ANNEX III. KUWAIT—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 28, 2010)
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There is
scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics
through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timelines, particularly for the
national accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production
Recent improvements of national accounts include: change of the base year for the constant
price data to 2000 and the estimates of value added for subsidized goods and services of the
public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the household expenditure survey was
used previously). Continued progress, especially in the estimation of value added for the oil
sector, requires the dedication of adequate resources and improved coordination between the
Ministries of Planning, Oil, and Finance. STA has provided technical assistance to the
Ministry of Planning to improve national accounts and price data. It would be useful if the
Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) would publish oil sector information in the Quarterly
Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output, refining, domestic consumption, export price for
crude and refined products and the domestic price of petroleum products. These data are
available from the Ministry of Oil. Timeliness of the data needs to be improved. Recent
delays in the production of price indexes have caused long delays in the production of real
GDP data.
Price Statistics
CPI weights are based on the 1999–2000 household expenditure survey and were introduced
into the index for a reference year of 2002. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised
basket has been published in monthly CPI bulletins with about one-month lag. The wholesale
price index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer price index (PPI) which is
consistent with the national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods,
ex-factory, for the export and the domestic market. Timely and comprehensive labor force
data are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). The major components of its extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign
debt and treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not
reported. Data on investment income, and on interest on foreign debt and treasury paper,
however, are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions.

8
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable
classification of data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring
effectively fiscal developments during the year. The authorities’ presentation is not yet fully
compliant with the GFSM 2001 guidance, but progress is being made in terms of creating a
new chart of accounts and moving reporting to accrual basis.
Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available.
Sharing of information between various government agencies could be improved. STA has
indicated to the authorities that operations of the two reserve funds should be classified as
part of government, as they perform activities for public policy purposes (management of
debt and assets, and financing of the budget). To this end, reporting subannual GFS in the
form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the consolidated central government
could be encouraged. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to
enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of Good
Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to adopt some of the practices
recommended in the Code. The Public Expenditure Management (PEM) system could
usefully be strengthened.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis. Monetary and
financial statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) have been finalized and
will be published in the April 2008 issue of the International Financial Statistics Supplement.
CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept
deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies
that accept deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations
sector. In the current SRFs, all investment companies (including those that accept deposits)
are classified as other financial corporations. However, the amount of deposits accepted by
investment companies is considered as not significant. CBK staff attended a workshop on
harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in the GCC region that was conducted by STA
staff in Riyadh in July 2006
Balance of Payments Statistics
The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in accordance with the
methodology of the BPM5—quarterly data are provided to Article IV consultation missions.
However, data on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited, which has
likely contributed to the “errors and omissions” item. To improve coverage for inward
foreign direct investment, the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct
investment enterprises. The Central Statistical Office (CSO), working with the CBK, plans to
implement the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey in 2010-2011. This initiative
should improve foreign direct investment statistics. Enhancements have been made in the
estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements are

9
needed in compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and
private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001 onwards in STA
publications. However, the information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it
excludes the external assets held by the general government due to domestic legal constraints
on dissemination (however, loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic
Development and general government trade credits are included).
The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data
reported for 2003 onwards. These data are for the financial sector acting as end-investors or
as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include holdings of foreign securities held
by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good
progress since then, particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the
separate reporting of financial transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the
international investment position. It has also made progress in the estimation of remittances
data. Yet, major delays and data gaps remain. In particular, major government entities do not
report quarterly data to the CBK in time to compile timely quarterly statistics. Trade data are
compiled by the CSO annually and provided to the CBK with a time lag of well over one
year. Furthermore, the response rate for the private nonfinancial sector is low.
Data dissemination
Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants. However, most of its metadata, with the
exception of the real sector and socio-demographic metadata, have not been updated since
October 2002. The CBK maintains its own webpage where it provides the following data to
the public: money and banking statistics; balance of payments statistics; trade balance
statistics; exchange rate; GDP by sector and expenditure at current and constant prices;
public finance statistics; CPI and WPI; and security market indicators. Similarly, the Ministry
of Planning has a webpage where the CSO publishes data on national accounts, prices, and
other related statistics. The Ministry of Finance webpage includes detailed data for actual and
estimated budget operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock Exchange webpage provides data
on stock market indices, volume and value of securities traded, as well as privatization
schedules and other related information.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 21, 2010

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Kuwait
On July 16, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kuwait on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes the Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.1
Background
The 2010 consultation discussions were held against the backdrop of the global financial
crisis, which has had an adverse impact on Kuwait via trade and financial channels. The oil
sector was affected by a large contraction in global oil demand and a decline in oil prices,
while the financial sector—with large foreign assets and liabilities—was affected by the
tightening of global liquidity conditions and declining asset prices, both domestically and
abroad.
In 2009, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by about 4½
percent—the weakest performance among Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries—on
account of a decline in real oil GDP of more than 11 percent, and flat real non-oil GDP, mainly
reflecting weaker activity in the financial and construction sectors.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Lower domestic demand and a 12 percent drop in import prices reduced average consumer
price inflation to 4 percent. Equity prices, money growth, and credit growth declined
significantly. Fiscal and external surpluses narrowed as oil revenues and investment income
fell. The Kuwaiti dinar (KD)—which is pegged to an undisclosed basket of major currencies—
depreciated by about 4 percent against the U.S. dollar.
The financial sector, particularly investment companies (ICs), experienced funding pressures
and deterioration in asset quality. Five ICs are known to have defaulted in 2009–10 and banks’
nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio doubled to 10 percent in 2009. Nevertheless, the sector
appears stable, mainly due to swift actions by the authorities and its high capital adequacy
ratio (CAR around 18 percent at end-2009). The authorities’ measures were extensive, ranging
from liquidity support to banks to the introduction of a financial stability law.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The global financial crisis had a significant impact on Kuwait given its international trade and
financial linkages. The impact was felt strongly in 2009 as real GDP contracted, asset prices
declined, and fiscal and external surpluses narrowed. The financial and non-financial sectors
witnessed a substantial fall in profitability, and five ICs defaulted in 2009–10. Credit growth
slowed significantly. The financial system remained stable, underpinned by swift policy actions
by the authorities, but credit growth and non-oil activity were subdued in light of the absence of
fiscal stimulus and the limited utilization of the financial stability law.
The economic outlook is broadly positive. The economy is expected to rebound in 2010, and to
grow steadily over the medium term as the global recovery boosts the demand for oil and the
government implements its four-year development plan, starting with an expansionary budget
in 2010/11. The fiscal and current account balances are expected to remain stable in 2010–11
and improve in subsequent years, as oil receipts and investment income recover.
The financial sector is expected to continue to face challenges in the immediate term. Rising
NPLs and large concentrations in banks’ loan portfolio—particularly in real estate, ICs, and
equities—are a source of concern. Nevertheless, aggregate financial soundness indicators show
that the banking sector is well capitalized and highly liquid, which should help the system to
remain stable. On the other hand, challenges facing ICs will be more extensive.
The economic outcome for 2010 depends largely on government spending and the associated
private investment. External risks to the outlook include a weaker than expected global
recovery and a deterioration in the regional economic or political environment. The overarching
domestic risks would be associated with the inability of the government to meet the spending
targets set out in the development plan. Political gridlock could delay necessary reforms and
impact implementation, and bureaucratic hurdles could discourage private sector participation.

3
Stress tests indicate that the banking system could reasonably withstand significant shocks,
although some banks are vulnerable to a severe macroeconomic shock. Stress tests for ICs
point to their limited capacity to withstand adverse shocks. Stress tests of listed nonfinancial
corporations suggest vulnerability in real estate and industrial sector companies to a prolonged
economic slowdown and financing constraints.
The macro policy mix is adequate but growth of current expenditures should be contained.
Increases in recent years in wages, subsidies, and transfers could undermine long-term fiscal
sustainability and should be moderated. As monetary policy remains constrained by the
exchange rate regime, macroprudential policies should ensure financial stability if inflationary
pressures were to reemerge. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and
the current exchange rate regime remains appropriate in the run up to the GCC monetary
union.
Successful implementation of the authorities’ growth agenda would require progress in
structural reforms. In this context, the passage of recent key laws, namely the Capital Markets
Law, the Labor Law, and the Privatization Law is welcome. The authorities should move ahead
with an efficient implementation of these laws and the amendment of other key legislation,
particularly the Companies and Tender Laws. The implementation of the development plan
should take into account project viability, absorptive capacity, and supply constraints.
The financial system’s oversight framework should be strengthened. Proper coordination
should be ensured between the three regulatory agencies—the Central Bank of Kuwait, the
Capital Markets Authority, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, particulalry with
regards to ICs; and the crisis management, contingency planning, and resolution frameworks
should be enhanced. The authorities’ plans to introduce an enhanced regulatory prudential
structure over ICs are welcome.
If promulgated, the household debt relief law would undermine the financial culture. The law
was passed by the National Assembly but rejected by the Amir. Targeted household debt relief
could be implemented instead through the already existing Insolvency Fund.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
