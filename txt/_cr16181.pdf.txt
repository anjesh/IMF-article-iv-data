IMF Executive Board Completes Combined Eleventh and Twelfth Reviews under the
Extended Fund Facility for Jamaica and Approves US$80 Million Disbursement
On June 17, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
combined eleventh and twelfth reviews under the Extended Arrangement under the Extended
Fund Facility (EFF) for Jamaica. The completion of the reviews enables the disbursement of an
amount equivalent to SDR 56.64 million (about US$80 million) bringing the total disbursements
under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 530.42 million (about US$748.2 million).
The Executive Board approved the EFF arrangement for four years and a total equivalent to SDR
615.38 million (about US$948.1 million), the equivalent of 225 percent of Jamaica’s quota in the
IMF at the time of approval of the arrangement (see Press Release No. 13/150) on May 1, 2013.
Since May 2013, Jamaica’s implementation of the economic reform program supported by the
EFF has been exceptional by international standards. After three years of difficult economic
reforms, inflation is at historical lows, the current account deficit has more than halved, net
international reserves have doubled, and access to domestic and international financial markets
has been restored, supported by upgrades in credit ratings and historically high business
confidence indicators. Comprehensive reforms in tax policy and administration have been and
continue to be undertaken, while strict adherence to fiscal discipline together with a PetroCaribe
debt buyback have helped place debt on a downward trajectory. Financial sector resilience has
been strengthened and supply-side growth constraints have been eased. Elections in February
2016 resulted in a change in government. The new government remains committed to continuing
reforms under the program, with a focus on maintaining fiscal discipline while achieving
equitable growth through increased capital spending and the strengthening of the social safety
net.
Following the Executive Board's discussion today, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Jamaica’s economic reform program supported by the Fund’s Extended Fund Facility has made
major strides in restoring macroeconomic stability, pursuing fiscal consolidation, reducing public
debt and undertaking significant tax policy reforms, building financial sector resilience, and

2
tackling structural issues. Business confidence is at an all time high, while inflation and the
current account deficit have been significantly reduced. The domestic bond market has reopened
after the 2013 debt exchange, and private credit growth is recovering.
“The new administration is committed to continued fiscal discipline. The phased personal
income tax reform launched with the FY2016/17 budget is a bold step to shift the tax system
from direct to indirect taxation. Proper execution of this reform is critical to ensure revenue
neutrality and safeguard the revenue base. Strengthening and better targeting conditional cash
transfers will help mitigate the impact of the reform on the low-income population.
“Concrete reforms are needed to sustainably reduce the government wage bill, which continues
to crowd out priority social and infrastructure spending. Actions should be expedited to divest
and outsource certain government services and implement the human resource management
system.
“Jamaica’s growth remains weak and unemployment, while declining, is still high. Further
structural reforms to boost growth and employment should focus on facilitating private sector
development by expanding financial access and reducing financing cost, lowering energy cost,
maintaining external competitiveness, reducing tax compliance costs, and improving public
sector resource allocation.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Jamaica
On June 17, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Jamaica.
Since May 2013, Jamaica’s implementation of the economic reform program supported by the
EFF has been exceptional by international standards. After three years of difficult economic
reforms, inflation is at historical lows, the current account deficit has more than halved, net
international reserves have doubled, and access to domestic and international financial markets
has been restored, supported by upgrades in credit ratings and historically high business
confidence indicators. Comprehensive reforms in tax policy and administration have been and
continue to be undertaken, while strict adherence to fiscal discipline together with a PetroCaribe

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

inflation, halving of the current account deficit, reduction of public debt, and regained access to
international and domestic bond markets. Nonetheless, growth and employment have remained
weak, and Directors underscored the need to accelerate efforts to address deep-rooted structural
impediments to strong private-sector led growth. In this regard, they welcomed the new
administration’s commitment to the reform objectives.
Directors commended the authorities’ significant fiscal reforms and their commitment to
continued fiscal discipline. They welcomed their bold effort to reorient the tax system from
direct to indirect taxation, and emphasized the importance of implementing measures to offset
the revenue losses from the personal income tax reform, and protecting the poor from the impact
of the higher indirect taxes. Directors also highlighted the need to improve public resource
allocation in favor of priority social and infrastructure spending. They considered reducing the
wage bill and enhancing public employment efficiency to be priorities. They also encouraged the
authorities to continue to take steps to improve revenue administration and compliance, broaden
the tax base, undertake pension reforms, and enhance public financial and debt management.
Directors noted that the monetary stance is broadly appropriate, and encouraged the central bank
to continue to focus on price stability. They stressed the need to strengthen central bank
autonomy and improve monetary transmission. In this context, the authorities should continue to
refine monetary operations and reduce the high spread in banks’ interest rates by increasing
banking sector competition and reforming financial sector taxation. Directors also emphasized
the importance of continued exchange rate flexibility.
Directors welcomed the progress in enhancing financial sector resilience. They concurred that
the financial sector should be strengthened through further retail repo reforms and enhanced
financial sector supervision and crisis management, including establishing a legal framework for
the resolution of banks and securities dealers. Directors also highlighted the importance of
promoting further development of the domestic debt market. They welcomed the Fund’s
commitment to better understand and address the issues related to the loss of correspondent
banking relationships, and urged the authorities to work with the Fund and other partners in this
area, in tandem with efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework.
Directors stressed that continued structural reforms are needed to boost growth and employment.
They highlighted, in particular, the need to reduce energy costs, increase access to finance,
enhance public sector efficiency, expedite labor market reforms, and continue to improve the
overall business environment to attract private investment. Proper communication will be
important to secure continued support by the population for the reform efforts.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH REVIEWS UNDER THE EXTENDED
FUND FACILITY AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
Context. Jamaica is implementing an economic reform program that has been
supported by the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility since May 2013. Significant strides have
been made in restoring macroeconomic stability, pursuing prudent fiscal policy,
reducing public debt and undertaking significant reforms in tax policy, financial sector
resilience, and structural issues. Meanwhile, in the February 25 general elections, the
Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) narrowly won, defeating the incumbent People’s National
Party (PNP). Prime Minister Holness has reiterated his government’s commitment to the
EFF-supported program, including continued fiscal consolidation, evidenced by the
primary surplus target of 7 percent of GDP in the budget for FY16/17.
Focus of the Article IV Consultation. The spotlight was on further reducing
macroeconomic vulnerabilities, fostering growth, creating the conditions for financial
deepening and inclusion, reallocating public resources to maximize economic returns,
and improving competitiveness. These reforms would need to be undertaken along
with continued debt reduction and fiscal consolidation.
Program Issues. All quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks for the
completion of the 11th and 12th reviews were met. The government’s intention is to
implement a phased reduction in the personal income tax burden, but to do so in a
revenue-neutral, equitable, and efficient way that achieves a rebalancing from direct to
indirect taxes. Efforts are also underway to reduce the public sector wage bill to redirect
spending toward growth-enhancing capital spending. Modified performance criteria
(PCs) for September 2016 and new PCs for December 2016 are proposed, reflecting the
downward growth revision, and new structural benchmarks were set for fiscal and
financial reforms.

POLITICAL CONTEXT
1.
The Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) won the general election in February 2016, defeating
the incumbent People’s National Party by one parliamentary seat. The new government took
office in March with a mandate to boost growth and reduce the tax burden for the low and middle
income groups. Prime Minister Holness has stated the government’s intention is to continue with
the IMF-supported program to build on the macroeconomic stability achieved thus far, including by
maintaining the fiscal targets of the program while supporting inclusive growth.

BACKGROUND: TOWARD STABILITY AND GROWTH
2.
Jamaica’s economy has been afflicted for several decades by a combination of low
growth and rising public debt. Real growth has averaged 0.7 percent since 1990 and
unemployment has rarely dropped below 10 percent. Meanwhile, the public debt has been above
100 percent of GDP since 2000. Poor fiscal discipline propelled the debt increase, which crowded out
private sector credit, raised financing costs, and further depressed growth. Weak growth, in turn,
undermined fiscal performance and caused further increases in debt.
3.
An IMF-supported program was approved in 2013 to avert a severe fiscal and balance
of payments crisis. The economy contracted by 0.2 percent in FY2012/13 in the wake of Hurricane
Sandy. The current account deficit deteriorated to 12 percent of GDP. Foreign reserves dropped
sharply to 1.4 months of imports, resulting from weak foreign inflows, including from the
multilateral institutions, central bank foreign exchange sales to sustain the exchange rate, and debt
payment. At the same time, fiscal performance fell short of budget targets and public debt rose to
nearly 150 percent of GDP. To prevent the looming crisis, the IMF’s Executive Board approved a
four-year EFF-supported program in May 2013 (SDR 615.38 million, 225 percent of quota at the time
of approval of the EFF, 161 percent of current quota).
4.
The authorities’ economic reform program aimed to sustainably reduce debt and
boost growth. The goals of the reforms include boosting growth and employment, improving
external competitiveness, achieving fiscal and debt sustainability, strengthening the financial system,
and supporting the poor. To increase the credibility of the reform program against a history of
repeated reform failures, the authorities frontloaded important policy actions. These include a multiyear public sector wage agreement, an upfront tax package, and a debt exchange to secure an
immediate reduction in the debt stock.
5.
Significant progress has been achieved owing to strong program ownership and
implementation.


Sustained fiscal consolidation. For three years, the central government primary surplus was
maintained at 7½ percent of GDP, while public debt fell by 20 percentage points of GDP, aided
by the PetroCaribe debt buyback in 2015. The faster than anticipated decline in debt allowed for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

a reduction in the primary surplus target (to 7.25 and 7 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 and
FY2016/17 respectively) to accommodate growth-enhancing capital spending.


Stabilization of the macroeconomic environment. Inflation has more than halved and is now
at historical lows, while the current account deficit improved by over 7 percentage points of
GDP. Foreign reserves now cover 6 months of imports. Improved stability is reflected in
increased business and consumer confidence, as well as a fall in EMBIG bond spread, which is
now aligned with the emerging market average. Jamaica also successfully reentered the
international financial market, issuing external bonds of US$800 million and US$2 billion in 2014
and 2015, respectively, supported by upgrades in the country’s credit ratings by all major rating
agencies.



Strengthening the tax system and tax administration. Tax incentives and discretionary
waivers have been significantly reduced and replaced with a rules-based and transparent
framework (Box 1). Tax administration has been improved through capacity building in the Large
Taxpayers’ Office, better compliance supported by the publication of a National Compliance
Plan, and enhanced tracking of goods in customs with the ASYCUDA World system. In public
financial management, a comprehensive plan has been created to expand the Treasury Single
Account.



Greater financial sector resilience. The legal and regulatory framework for retail repo
transactions of securities’ dealers (SDs)—which finance the acquisition of long-term government
bonds with short-term, deposit-like investments—was improved by transitioning all retail repo
contracts to a trust. Also, backstop facilities for the SDs have been established and the minimum
transaction size for retail repos steadily increased. The foreign asset investment cap for the
collective investment schemes (CIS)—an alternative for retail repos with more transparent risk

The domestic debt market reopened. Capitalizing on
the liquidity influx from the J$60.4 billion (4 percent of

successfully issued J$15 billion bonds domestically. This

balance sheets. Secondary market trading is also now slowly restarting, which should help
further improve financial intermediation.
Stronger social safety net. During the fiscal consolidation, social expenditures were protected
with a required minimum level of targeted spending, at about 1.5 percent of GDP. The
conditional cash transfer program (PATH) has been strengthened with recurrent increases in
transfer amounts well beyond inflation. A social protection strategy was launched in July 2014,
and a National Poverty Reduction Committee has been tasked with developing a poverty
reduction program.

Better business environment. The construction permit approval process was streamlined
to reduce the processing time to 90 days. A new insolvency legislation was passed to streamline the
bankruptcy process and facilitate the rehabilitation of insolvent businesses. An online system for
business registration is being put in place to reduce the turnaround time for registrations to two
days. Supported by these reforms, Jamaica’s ranking in World Bank’s 2016 Doing Business Indicators
improved by 7 positions.

Significant administration reforms. A key reform of the Tax
Administration of Jamaica (TAJ) has been the strengthening
of the Large Taxpayers’ Office (LTO) which yields half of total Corporate Income Tax (CIT) revenues. Improvements
in LTO are key to safeguarding the revenue base in countries with capacity constraints. Significant reforms have
been undertaken in the context of the program, with the help of an IMF advisor:


Capacity increases and amendments to the Revenue Administration Act have allowed the TAJ to (i) compel for
third-party information to cross-check taxpayers’ information and activities, (ii) require mandatory e-filing for
LTO clients for main tax types including the General Consumption Tax (GCT) and the CIT.



A National Compliance Plan has been published and performance indicators have been established to
improve compliance measurement.



TAJ was empowered to collect outstanding arrears and seize and sell taxpayers’ property.

Customs administration reforms have also focused on capacity strengthening, with the hiring of new auditors for
the Post-Clearance Audit unit, and the implementation of the ASYCUDA World software which has helped
strengthen the tracking of imports and exports. The Jamaica Customs Agency (JCA) and TAJ are respectively
transitioning into full executive agency status and semi-autonomous revenue agency, which will lower costs,
enhance efficiency of service delivery, and improve decision-making and management practices.
Challenges remain. A recent GCT gap analysis by FAD shows that Jamaica’s GCT collections could be higher by as
much as 2 percent of GDP if compliance were improved and by 5 percent of GDP if tax expenditures and policy
were improved. These gaps, while still sizable and on par with Latin America, have been declining in recent years
due to the ongoing reform efforts. Within the region, Jamaica outperforms smaller countries like Dominica,
Barbados and St. Vincent but fares worse than Trinidad and Tobago and Dominican Republic. These gaps are
calculated against a theoretical benchmark and effective gains would likely be much smaller. Nevertheless, the
analysis points to significant gains that could be reaped from improved compliance and policy. As identified by a
recent FAD TADAT assessment, reforms going forward should address inaccurate taxpayer data, low on-time filing
and payment rates, delays in the payment of GCT refunds, and low quality of audits leading to high rates of
objections. In terms of tax policy, a continued broadening of the GCT base will not only reduce the policy gap but
also improve compliance as exemption loopholes are closed.

7.
However, the reform dividends in the form of growth and job creation have been
disappointing. Over the past three years, real GDP growth has remained at the historical average of
about 0.6 percent. Despite a decline in the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points since
2013, it remains high at over 13 percent. The weak growth is partly due to negative external shocks:
the drought conditions for two consecutive years led to a decline in agriculture; the chikungunya
outbreak in 2014/15 reduced labor productivity; and the falling aluminum prices depressed exports.

However, there have also been positive shocks (e.g., lower global oil prices), though these factors
appear to have done little to support faster growth. The weak growth is reflected in Jamaica’s
Human Development Index which has been declining since 2011. Inequality, which increased from
0.38 in 2001 to 0.46 by 2013, is high with one-fifth of the population living under the poverty line.

Forward-looking indicators have improved despite slow growth. Business confidence
has increased to an all-time high in February 2016. Consumer confidence is also trending up. With
agricultural recovery remaining slow, growth is estimated at 0.8 percent in 2015. Good tourism
performance (arrival increased by 2.1 percent y/y in 2015) continued to drive growth, with recovery
in manufacturing, including the normalization of petroleum refinery operation, also contributing.
Net foreign direct investments increased by 30 percent in the first three quarters of FY15/16. The
unemployment rate dropped to 13.3 percent in January 2016 from 14.2 percent in January 2015.
Trade and construction generated the largest employment gains.

Falling oil prices have lowered inflation and the current account deficit. Inflation was
2.4 percent in April 2016, among the lowest historically, primarily owing to lower global oil prices
and continued weakness in domestic demand. The current account deficit was 2.2 percent of GDP in

B. Outlook and Risks
11.
Growth is projected to increase over the medium term. Growth for FY16/17 is revised
down to 1.7 percent, largely reflecting the slower-than-expected increase in investment. Agricultural
recovery is expected to contribute to a third of the real growth for the fiscal year, in addition to a
recovery in manufacturing and sustained growth in BPO, tourism, and trade. Over the medium term,
growth is projected to gradually rise to around 2¾ percent, as large transportation and energy
infrastructure projects come to fruition and planned structural reforms raise private investor
confidence and investment.
12.
Inflation and current account balance projections are influenced by oil prices. Headline
inflation is expected to be 5.3 percent (y/y) by end FY16/17, as oil prices recover. Core inflation is
also expected to rise, due to indirect impacts from the oil price increase. The current account deficit
is expected to continue to decline as the economy grows and domestic production gradually
replaces imports.
13.

Macroeconomic risks remain significant (Annex I):



Reform fatigue, capacity constraints, and the thin parliamentary majority of the current
government could pose challenges to implementing key reforms. Continued sluggishness in
growth and job creation may undermine public support for reform and fiscal prudence.



Uncertainty regarding the revenues from the ongoing PIT reforms and accompanying revenue
offsets (see ¶37) pose risks to the fiscal position, which may then translate into weaker growth if
disappointing revenues crowd out critical capital spending.



Government financing could be challenged by the still fragile domestic bond market,
competition from potential corporate issuances, and the reliance on financing from international
markets and other IFIs (both of which are dependent on continued strong program
performance).



Growth could also be affected by natural disasters, a worsening of the Zika virus (particularly
insofar as it impacts tourism), and an economic slowdown in trade partners.



Derisking activities from overseas banks may interrupt international financial flows (Box 3 and
¶22).

14.
The authorities broadly concurred with the outlook and risks. The BoJ’s growth forecast
is 1.6 percent in FY16/17, with slower-than-expected investment growth being the main risk. They
are optimistic about growth over the medium term, as the new Economic Growth Council’s strategy
for raising growth to 5 percent in four years unfolds, combined with the planned implementation of
the large investment projects in energy and infrastructure. They are, however, concerned about
capacity constraints of the government, which could delay reform implementation.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
15.
Program implementation has been solid. All quantitative performance criteria (PC) for
end-December 2015 and end-March 2016 were met; the NIR and NDA targets were exceeded by
sizeable margins. Jamaica has outstanding arrears to Iraq, which has consented to Fund financing
notwithstanding these arrears. The central government primary surplus for FY15/16 was 7.4 percent
of GDP, above the target of 7.25 percent of GDP mainly due to the lower nominal GDP. Capital
expenditures were J$33 billion in FY15/16, driven by an overexecution of nearly J$6 billion during
December to March, including the additional fiscal space for growth-enhancing capital spending of
J$4 billion approved at the 10th review.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PROMOTING STABILITY AND
RAISING POTENTIAL GROWTH
A. Safeguarding Macroeconomic Stability
Fiscal Sustainability
17.
Fiscal discipline is the central plank for macroeconomic stability in Jamaica. Decades of
high public debt and interest bills have hindered public service provision, including security,
education, and energy. The risks from a precarious fiscal position have also undermined confidence
and raised risk premia, crowding out private investments. Strong program implementation in the
last three years has improved fiscal credibility and lowered borrowing costs. Staying the course is
critical to further reduce debt and create the space for productive spending.

Improving Monetary Framework
18.
Monetary policy should be guided by an overarching mandate for achieving price
stability. Until its recent steady decline, inflation has been high and unstable, making expectations
hard to anchor. Although the BoJ regards inflation target as its nominal anchor, the effectiveness of
actual monetary operation is weakened by the central bank’s multiple objectives, which include
managing credit conditions to promote production, trade, and employment, while maintaining

forecasting ability, and improving policy communication, are also important. The work program for
monetary reforms should be organized around the long-term goal of moving to a full-fledged
inflation targeting regime. The annual inflation targeting readiness review is a helpful step in this
direction.

Strengthening Financial Sector Stability
19.
Improving prudential regulations for the retail repo industry is important for financial
stability. Regulatory requirements for SDs need to be tightened and the risks of the retail repo
industry be reduced to a systemically safe and prudentially manageable level, drawing on IMF TA
recommendations. The authorities are currently working on prudential guidelines, including
introducing an operational risk-weighted asset component in calculating the SD’s CAR, requiring
regular stress test reports, and limiting SD’s exposure to any counterparty. They are also aiming to
implement a minimum retail repo leverage ratio. Due to the strong sovereign-financial sector nexus
in Jamaica, the speed of regulatory tightening needs to take into account the health of the SD sector
and domestic financing needs.
20.
Strengthening debt management and developing domestic debt markets will help
lower public borrowing costs and financial stability risks. While successful reopening of the
domestic government bond market in February 2016 was an important milestone, more work is
needed to build a deep and liquid domestic debt market (Box 2), so as to reduce the currency,
duration, and concentration risks for both the government and the financial sector. To the extent
that the market conditions and the absorptive capacity of the domestic investor base allow, the
upcoming bond redemptions should be refinanced in the domestic market, to help rebalance the
debt portfolio from FX to local currency (Annex IV). Additional reforms, in line with
recommendations from IMF TA, to reform the primary dealer system and introduce competitive
auctions to replace taps should be pursued.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

Box 2. Re-establishing Domestic Bond Market Access
It took Jamaica three years to reestablish domestic market access following the 2013 National Debt
Exchange (NDX). Jamaica regained international market access quickly (in July 2014) supported by strong
program performance, investors’ search for yield, and the exclusion of international bonds from NDX. However,
with 2 debt exchanges in a span of three years, reestablishing domestic market access after the NDX took almost
three years.
The hard work of facilitating debt market development is still ahead. Efforts are needed in:

Better coordination between the MOFP and the BOJ to avoid
competition between debt and monetary policy objectives, to
address liquidity swings from large bond redemptions coming
up in FY 2017/18.

21.
Reforms on contingency planning and crisis management should continue. A national
crisis management plan and agency-specific contingency plans in all supervisory agencies (BoJ, MoF,
FSC, JDIC) have been adopted. Regular financial crisis simulation exercises are necessary to identify
weaknesses in the plans. Recovery plans for certain participating institutions are needed to give
them access to the emergency liquidity and capital support facilities. A working group led by the
JDIC has been designing reforms to the legal framework for the resolutions of the financial sector,
but tangible progress is still needed.
22.
Multi-pronged efforts are needed to address potential future loss of correspondent
banking relationships. The trend of globally active banks scaling back their correspondent banking
presence has caused interruptions in money service businesses (Box 3). While this has not yet
significantly impacted the domestic deposit taking institutions in Jamaica at this point, there is
prospective risk that should be addressed to avoid potential disruptions in financial services and
reputational risks for the financial sector. In this regard, Jamaica should continue to address

14

JAMAICA

remaining weaknesses in its AML/CFT framework in the context of implementing the
recommendations by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force’s mutual evaluation, enhance the
risk-based supervision of the financial sector, notably the money service business (MSB) sector, and
effectively communicate its compliance efforts to overseas partners. In addition, contingency plans,
including possible interventions from the BoJ for a limited period, should be prepared in the event
of a broader loss of correspondent bank linkages.
Authorities’ views
23.
Authorities concurred with the need to safeguard and further enhance macroeconomic
stability. In particular:


Authorities are cognizant of the gains achieved by the sustained fiscal discipline, including
confidence in both domestic and international markets. They agreed with the need for sustained
consolidation, while also emphasizing the need to rebalance fiscal policy towards growth. They
also agreed that the rising dollarization of government’s debt portfolio needs to be addressed
through active measures to develop the domestic debt market.



They are committed to continued reforms of the SD sector and strengthening the national crisis
management framework and resolution schemes. They expressed concerns about the potential
negative impact of reductions of financial services by overseas banks on financial sector stability
and financial inclusion, and requested Fund support in their effort to communicate the issue
with overseas financial regulators.



They agree with the need to further refine the monetary framework, but emphasized that the
decision to pursue inflation targeting needs to be a deliberate one and further investigation is
needed to determine whether it is a path suitable for Jamaica.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

Box 3. Loss of Correspondent Bank Relationships and the Impact on Jamaica
Decisions by globally active banks to scale back operations has affected the operation of money service
businesses (or cambios) in Jamaica. In 2012, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued recommendations that
identified cambios as high risk entities. Enhanced scrutiny by correspondent banks, including requirements for
Jamaican respondent banks to have in place a solid risk management system for suspicious transactions, led to an
intensified assessment and monitoring of cambios. Subsequently, multiple overseas correspondent banks gave
notice to Jamaican domestic banks that prohibited transactions on behalf of cambios through their accounts,
given the difficulty of undertaking due diligence on such transactions. As a result, domestic banks have stopped
cash transactions with cambios altogether (Cash transactions are about 20 percent of total cambio transactions).
There have also been some losses of correspondent bank relationships (CBR). Since 2012, five domestic banks
have had some of their CBRs terminated. But the FX transactions of these banks have not been impacted, as they
were able to maintain their existing relationships with other overseas banks or find replacement for their lost CBRs.
A large Canadian bank exited the Jamaican market in 2014, citing a reevaluation of their business mix as the
reason. However, this appeared unrelated to regulatory restraint and was more a product of a broader realignment
of that bank’s global business model.
The shifting pattern of global banking has not significantly impacted financial flows into Jamaica, but its
implication on financial inclusion could be relevant. Cambio transactions are typically small exchanges with
individuals and provide convenience for workers in the tourism industry. The disruption in cambio services may
also potentially drive FX transactions underground and increase dollarization in Jamaica.
Possible actions are currently being discussed in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to mitigate the
impact on the loss of CBRs for the region. These include: (i) collective action and bundling of services to
increase the business volume brought to a smaller number of correspondent banks; (ii) introduction of a scheme
to purchase CBR insurance policies; (iii) the possible creation of a US-licensed special purpose vehicle (SPV) to
process international transactions; and (iv) payment of CBR service fees.

B. Raising Potential Growth and Creating Jobs
24.
Jamaica’s growth strategy should focus on fostering the development of a dynamic
private sector (Annex II). Jamaica’s per capita GDP growth has averaged 0.3 percent since 2000; the
current potential growth is less than 1 percent. Investments and FDI inflows are among the lowest in
the region. Traditional goods exports such as bauxite and sugar are losing market share to intense
global competition, while the process of diversifying into new export categories has been slow.
Tourism has contributed to the largest share in total exports of goods and services, but the upward
potential of the sector is constrained by the enclave model that limits positive spillovers into the rest
of the economy. Mobilizing the private sector is essential to support an increase in potential growth.

Access to and Cost of Financing
26.
Low financial access and high financing cost hamper private sector growth. Commercial
banks have historically focused on providing government financing, resulting in crowding out of
private credit. Low level of bank operational efficiency and high taxation of the financial sector have
led to high interest rate margins on loans to the private sector.
27.
Efforts are needed on both macro and micro fronts to improve financial access and
reduce the interest rate spread.


Financial regulations. Increasing banking sector competition, including by allowing qualified new
entrants, conditional on implementing requisite supervision and regulation, should help lending
rates become more responsive to policy rate changes and lower interest rate spreads. High
collateral requirements (currently averaging over 200 percent of loan value) hinder financial
access. The Security Interests in Personal Property Act was a helpful step to encourage the use of
movable properties as collaterals, although complementary regulatory changes are needed to
make the new law effective. The reporting requirements for opening bank accounts and
applying for loans are onerous. Implementing a risk-based approach in assessing applicant risks
can help reduce the reporting cost for low-risk borrowers. Improving land titling and creditor
protection, and speedy implementation of the new bankruptcy law are also important.



Taxation. The financial sector currently faces a combination of asset taxes, a higher CIT rate, and
distortionary transaction taxes, resulting in combined statutory tax rates of 40-50 percent. A
more equitable tax treatment across regulated and non-regulated entities would help lower the
interest rate spread and costs of financial services. Reforms could be combined with the
introduction of a capital gains tax and broadening indirect taxation to the financial sector. Tax
reforms, combined with more competition and better credit assessment, could increase private
credit creation and support growth.



Financial services. The development of agency banking services, mobile money products, and
factoring and leasing services should facilitate financial inclusion and deepening, especially

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

JAMAICA

among the under-banked population, such as rural borrowers and SMEs. Advancing electronic
payment/transaction systems can help reduce the usage of cash and bank operating costs.


Equity and debt markets. Developing financial markets to provide alternate financing sources is
important for building private sector entrepreneurship. For example, expansion of the junior
stock exchange should be encouraged. However, this should be achieved by lowering barriers to
entry and simplifying listing requirements—with appropriate risk control—rather than using tax
incentives to encourage listing, which is subject to abuse.

Energy, Logistics, and External Competitiveness
28.
Energy generation sources should be diversified to help sustainably reduce energy
cost. Several projects are underway to diversify Jamaica’s energy landscape, including the
conversion in the Bogue power plant from diesel- to natural gas-based power generation and the
new 190MW gas-powered plant by Jamaica Public Service. Upgrading the grid infrastructure and
improving metering and billing should help reduce distribution losses and lower electricity cost.
Strengthening public-private partnerships in renewable energy and the power sector’s regulatory
framework to encourage private-sector participation will facilitate investments in the sector.
29.
Efforts are ongoing to improve critical infrastructure. Concession of the Kingston
Container Terminal and privatization of the international airport in Kingston will help modernize and
lower operational costs of both structures, increasing Jamaica’s attractiveness as an investment
destination and a logistics hub. Improving road connectivity across the island would promote
linkages between tourism and the rest of the economy.
30.
Exchange rate flexibility is needed to avoid the past patterns of the competitiveness
erosion from currency overvaluation. In applying EBA-lite methodologies on exchange rate
valuation, special consideration is given to external sustainability, given Jamaica’s large negative
international investment position (-140 percent of GDP, Annex III). Convergence to a more
sustainable IIP position (-70 percent of GDP, about the average for other emerging market countries
at a similar GDP per capita level) in a period of no more than 15 years would require a somewhat
more depreciated real effective exchange rate. The equilibrium real exchange rate model also points
to overvaluation, while the current account model points to modest undervaluation. Given the mixed
findings, staff’s view is that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. That said, given
the importance of the IIP sustainability, the balance of risks is toward a modest overvaluation, which
was a past pattern that eroded external competitiveness. Thus, it is essential to maintain a floating
exchange rate, with the Jamaican dollar depreciating by at least as much as the inflation differential
with trading partners. Maintaining a flexible exchange rate would imply that interventions in the FX
market—which should be governed by BoJ’s decisions—should be largely for the purpose of
building reserves and smoothing out excessive exchange rate volatility.

32.
Efforts are needed to reduce taxpayer compliance costs and improve tax
administration, particularly given the risk of revenue loss from the ongoing PIT reform.


Significant progress has been achieved in improving compliance among large taxpayers. In the
future, there is scope for expanding audit capacity to improve compliance also among the
medium and small taxpayers.



Also, in light of the new transfer pricing law, and in line with IMF TA advice, a review of Jamaica’s
international tax regime is warranted, with a focus on thin capitalization rules, tax treaties and
withholding taxes. This is especially important given the reliance on taxes from the financial
sector which has large multinational players.



The new Special Economic Zones (SEZ) will also pose leakage risks. Stronger domestic ties from
SEZs, while increasing value added to the economy, will also put additional strain on a still
developing revenue administration. Regulations to safeguard revenues should be passed as
soon as possible, including clear administrative penalties, sanctions against tax evasion, and
strong bonded warehouse controls.



With help from the World Bank, Phase III of the Customs Act is expected to be tabled by
December 2016 and will include measures to facilitate trade and streamline customs procedures
(e.g., uniform documentation requirements, improving multi-agency coordination, and
permitting electronic payments) to lower the costs of compliance to importers and exporters.

33.
Improving public sector efficiency will support private sector-led job creation. The
recent announcement of the divestment of Petcom to private investors is a welcome step. The
authorities’ commitment to a time-bound action plan for the divestment of public enterprises and
implementing shared-corporate services (proposed structural benchmark end-September 2016) is
important. A strategic examination of the role of government in different areas will be needed with a
view to scale back some services and prioritize others. Strengthening control systems and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

JAMAICA

accountability, and addressing duplication and inefficiencies in public employment will be key first
steps to achieve the 9 percent of GDP wage bill target and open fiscal space for growth-enhancing
capital spending (¶38).

Protecting the poor
34.
Strengthening PATH transfers and services is key to protecting the poor and reducing
inequality. Rebalancing from direct to indirect taxes will require improved targeting of PATH
transfers to ensure that any increased funding only goes to the neediest. Speedy implementation of
the national identification system (NIDS) will be an important step in this regard. The first phase of
the project, which included the development of the legislative and institutional framework and
designing the ICT infrastructure, has been completed with IDB support. In addition, services
currently provided through PATH, such as entrepreneurship and skills training, should be
strengthened and expanded to help workers transition into dynamic sectors.
Authorities’ Views
35.

There was agreement on the need for reforms to boost growth.



Authorities emphasized that promoting growth is the central mandate of the current
government. They have launched an Economic Growth Council, comprised of private sector
leaders, to advise the government and hold it accountable on initiatives to stimulate growth. The
authorities also plan to invest in agro-parks and water infrastructure, seek out large foreign
investments, and improve skill training for young people, in order to support growth and job
creation.



Authorities noted that the PIT reforms will be an important step in rebalancing from direct to
indirect taxes and could generate compliance dividends from increased formality. They are
committed to increasing the efficiency of the public sector, and noted that the plans for
divestment and outsourcing will yield significant gains. Authorities are cognizant of the risks
posed by transfer pricing practices and SEZs and will seek to put in place containment measures,
while noting that staff should be mindful of capacity constraints.



On the junior stock exchange tax incentive, the authorities noted that the tax incentive played an
instrumental role in SMEs’ decision to go public, and intend to continue implementing the
incentive while tightening rules to prevent its abuse.



On exchange rate valuation, the authorities agree that external competitiveness should be
maintained. But they stressed the importance of exchange rate stability in facilitating economic
activities and reducing dollarization pressure.



With the support of IMF TA, authorities are exploring revenue offset options for FY17/18 to
continue rebalancing towards indirect taxation, including the scope for environmental/carbon
taxes. As the balance shifts further toward indirect taxes it will be essential to strengthen
conditional cash transfers to mitigate the impact on the poor.

38.
Capital and social spending will continue to be protected and enhanced. Social
spending in FY16/17 remains protected with a floor under the program. Capital spending will
increase by around 2/3 percent of GDP relative to the FY15/16 outturn (including the 1/2 percent of
GDP additional space created at the 10th review). The government’s list of priority projects identified
for the additional space is included in the TMU. The budget includes a contingency reserve of
1 percent of GDP to cover changes in debt service costs and natural disasters, and also to mitigate
potential overruns in the wage bill. However, given the uncertainties surrounding revenues in
FY16/17, it is imperative to identify other revenue and spending contingencies early which can be
deployed if needed to safeguard fiscal targets without compressing capital expenditure.
39.
The reduction of the large wage bill, which continues to crowd out other spending,
hinges on reforms to modernize the public sector. The public sector wage bill is budgeted to
exceed 10 percent of GDP in FY16/17, driven by the

financing higher levels of pro-growth public investment
and/or further increasing the tax burden.


Informed by the ongoing compensation review which is expected to be concluded in December
2016, the authorities’ goal is to achieve the wage to GDP ratio of 9 percent by FY18/19 (MEFP
¶10). The compensation review will also provide inputs to the medium-term wage policy to
guide the next round of wage negotiations (expected to begin in November 2016).



The implementation of the human resource management system (HCMES) is ongoing, and the
pace needs to be accelerated by giving it higher priority with more ambitious action plans and
stricter timelines. Strengthening information gathering to arrest duplication and inefficiencies in
public employment are necessary.



The comprehensive review of allowances and the employee verification exercise (both proposed
structural benchmarks for end-November 2016) will represent key first steps to improving control
and oversight over the wage bill. Pilots in the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service will be
implemented for both exercises by end-August 2016. In addition, the allowances pilot will

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

encompass Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Ministry of National Security, which
together represent the lion’s share of central government employment and receive the majority
of allowances. For the employee verification exercise, the pilot will target public employees in
the civilian workforce of the police, the non-teaching personnel at the Ministry of Education, and
the National Insurance Scheme—areas where turnover of personnel is highest and maximum
gains could be had from a headcount exercise. Significant capacity constraints limit faster
progress in this area; thus, both exercises will be completed for all central government
employees by Q1 2017.
40.
Reforms to the public pension system are necessary for its sustainability. Full
implementation of the reforms could lower cash flow costs from the unfunded public pension
system by as much as 0.5 percent of GDP in the long run, with immediate gains of about 0.1 percent
of GDP if the government does not make matching contributions. The new government is expected
to re-table the draft law in parliament by July 2016 (MEFP ¶10). The main features from the previous
draft should be maintained, including the mandatory contribution of 5 percent and increasing the
retirement age to 65 years. These are essential reform measures in order to improve the
sustainability of the system, especially in light of population aging. Parametric changes should also
follow in order to lower an overly generous benefits accrual rate, and reform the benefits calculation
formula.
41.
Improvements in public financial management (PFM) will enhance management of
domestic arrears. The approval for the new organizational structure of the Accountant General
Department (proposed structural benchmark end-September 2016) will greatly aid in the
department’s transition to becoming a modern treasury and enhancing its capacity. The ongoing
expansion of the TSA will soon make it the only account in the public sector with a positive balance,
providing a complete picture of the government’s cash position at any point in time. The review of
legal provisions for all revenues to be paid into the Consolidated Fund and improving accounting
and fiscal reporting will also be important steps in this direction.

B. Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies
42.
There is scope for improving liquidity provision and modernizing the structure of
monetary operations. Empirical analysis indicates that the policy rate was broadly aligned with the
neutral rate after the rate cuts by a total of 50 bps in 2015 (Box 4). Meanwhile, the BoJ cut the policy
rate by another 25 bps in May 2016 to 5 percent, given the moderate inflation outlook. More policy
rate cuts are feasible if inflation expectations decrease. Meanwhile, pricing for short-term liquidity
provision (14-day repos) could be further reduced to be consistent with the lowered policy rate. The
transmission from BoJ’s policy rate to market interest rates is relatively weak (Box 4). In line with IMF
TA advice, improving monetary policy effectiveness requires establishing a clear operational target
and further narrowing the interest rate corridor by consolidating the instruments that define its
boundary, taking consistent actions to steer the target within the corridor. Improving the turnover
and depth of the interbank market and the secondary bond market will also help strengthen
monetary transmission.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

JAMAICA

43.
The BoJ should continue to build international reserves. Although the reserve position
has significantly improved over the program period, further accumulation is warranted. The nearterm goal should be to raise reserve coverage

44.
Progress is needed to establish a resolution framework for the financial sector. Clearly
defining the roles and responsibilities of different agencies in the resolution process is critical. As a
next step, a consultation paper with concrete proposals on the framework should be drafted
(proposed structural benchmark for October 2016), following which legislations to support the
framework and the national crisis management plan should be drafted and tabled. The BoJ’s
mandate for financial stability needs to be substantiated with concrete tools, and information
exchange among financial regulators needs to be strengthened. The Financial System Stability
Committee—instituted by the amended BoJ Act in 2015—should be formally established to advice
on evolving financial stability risks and promoting information exchange across the various agencies
(MEFP ¶15).

Box 4. Monetary Stance and Monetary Transmission in Jamaica
The policy rate is a main tool for calibrating monetary policy stance in Jamaica. To assess the
appropriateness of the monetary stance, it is useful to compare the current rate with the neutral interest rate—i.e.,
the prevailing rate at which output gap is closed and inflation stable.
Several models are used to estimate the neutral rate:



Uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition. The method relies on the assumption that nominal domestic
Interest Rate Gap
interest rate should be equal to nominal international interest
(Actual - Neutral)
10
rate, plus expected nominal depreciation and a country risk
8
premium.



Dynamic Taylor Rule. In this model the policy rate is assumed
to respond to deviations of (i) inflation from the BoJ’s inflation
target, and (ii) real GDP from its potential.



General equilibrium. This semi-structural model relates the
output gap to the neutral interest rate and the inflation rate to
the output gap (Philips curve).

2

-4
-6

Interest rate parity

Taylor rule

General equilibrium

For the 2nd and 3rd models, systems of equations were estimated using Kalman filter.
Model estimates indicate that the current interest rate is aligned with the neutral rate. Based on quarterly
data from 2000 to 2015, the UIP method suggests the neutral rate for 90-day T-bills to be 6.3 percent at end-2015,
compared to the actual rate of 6 percent. Meanwhile, both the Taylor rule and general equilibrium methods
suggest a neutral rate for BoJ 30-day CDs at around 5.1 percent, compared to the actual rate at 5.25 percent.
Hence, assuming the output gap being closed in 2016 and inflation within target, the interest rate stance appears
broadly appropriate.
Monetary policy is responsive to inflation conditions, but not to output gaps. Estimates show that there is a
positive relationship between inflation gap, i.e. deviation of inflation from its target, and interest rate gap, which
indicates that the policy rate has been adjusted to close the inflation gap. On the other hand, monetary policy has
not been used to actively moderate business cycles. Moreover, regression results show that the policy rate stance
has little effect on economic growth of the subsequent period, indicating potential weakness in monetary
transmission through the credit channel, as discussed below.
Changes in the BoJ policy rate have limited effect on market lending rates. Theoretically, changes in the
central bank’s policy rate will cause changes in inter-bank rates and the interest rates on short-term government
securities in the same direction, through arbitrages among commercial bank asset holdings. A reduction in the
interbank rate from an increased supply of funds will tend to reduce bank lending rate and increase credit
availability. However, these interest rate channels appear to be relatively weak in Jamaica. Results from estimating
a autoregressive distributed lag model using monthly interest

C. Other Program Issues
46.
Modifications to the quantitative PCs for September 2016 and December 2016 are
proposed. Revisions are proposed to the existing PCs on central government primary balance, tax
revenues, and overall balance of the public sector due to the downward revision to growth. The
following new structural benchmarks are also proposed:


Draft a consultation paper for the resolution framework for the financial sector, including
proposals on (i) the scope, roles and responsibilities, and powers of institutions that would be
covered by the resolution regime; and (ii) the legal structure of the regime (i.e., administrative,
court-based, or a combination (end-October 2016).



Complete a two-part pilot to build a comprehensive database on all allowances paid to public
employees in the Ministries of Finance, Health, Security, and Education (end-November 2016).



Verify each government employee’s work position, eligibility for allowances, and role in the
government, across the Ministry of Finance, the civilian population of the Ministry of Security,
and the NIS, and non-teaching personnel in the Ministry of Education (end-November 2016).



Submit to Cabinet implementation plans and timelines to (i) privatize entities (to be identified by
end-July), (ii) implement shared corporate services across ministries in HR administration and
payroll execution, asset management, communications (end-September 2016).



A new organizational structure of the Accountant General Department will be approved by the
Corporate Management Development (CMD) branch in the Ministry of Finance and the Public
Service (end September 2016).

Safeguards assessment. The updated safeguards assessment of the BoJ, completed in
September 2013, found that the BoJ has relatively strong safeguards, particularly in financial
reporting and the audit mechanisms. The BoJ publishes audited financial statements annually and
continues to receive unqualified (clean) audit opinions. In addition, the BoJ has made progress in
further improving the safeguards framework by strengthening its independent oversight functions,
enhancing transparency in the financial statements, and conducting an independent external review
of the internal audit function. There is ongoing work on the recommendation to amend the BoJ Act
to address shortcomings in the legal provisions on governance and autonomy.

STATISTICS
49.
Weaknesses in data provision need to be addressed. Jamaica currently produces annual
and quarterly GDP estimates by production and annual GDP estimates by expenditure. Work has
started on quarterly GDP statistics by expenditure, and on compiling financial accounts and balance
sheets by institutional sector. The national accounts data is of reasonably good quality. A breakdown
of government and private sector contributions to fixed capital formation would help track the
evolution of sectoral growth drivers overtime. To better assess external competitiveness, more data
is essential on private sector wages and unit labor cost.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The government’s reform program, supported with the four-year EFF arrangement
approved in 2013, has been a turning point for the Jamaican economy. The government
embarked on the reform program to break the cycle of high debt and low growth that afflicted
Jamaica for several decades. It embarked on a path of fiscal discipline to restore economic stability,
reduce debt, and enhance growth through a wide range of structural reforms. The fiscal
consolidation and extensive reform agenda have been difficult, yet necessary, in order to reverse the
trajectory of vulnerabilities and achieve sustained stability, growth and job creation.
51.
With strong program implementation, macroeconomic stability has been restored and
public debt is declining, but growth remains weak. Macroeconomic stability is marked by
inflation at historical lows, halving of the current account deficit over the program period, doubling
of the NIR, and re-access to domestic and international financial markets. Yet, growth dividends
from the reforms have been slower than expected, and unemployment remains high. The slow
growth recovery is a symptom of entrenched structural bottlenecks whose correction requires
perseverance and continued commitment to difficult reforms.
52.
Achieving private-sector led growth requires addressing some deep-rooted structural
issues. A history of fiscal dominance has resulted in inadequate lending to the private sector.
Policies should focus, inter alia, on increasing banking sector competition and reducing collateral
requirements to improve access to finance and inclusion. Reducing crime, lowering energy cost,
reducing tax compliance cost, and improving infrastructure are essential to improve the business
climate and increase private investment. The external competitiveness gains achieved during the
program so far should be maintained by keeping the exchange rate flexible and allowing nominal
depreciation to at least offset the inflation differential with trading partners.
53.
The phased PIT reform is a bold step by the new government, which, if done well, will
reorient the tax system towards indirect taxation and improve compliance. The rebalancing
from direct to indirect taxes will reduce the marginal and average tax rates across the majority of PIT
taxpayers, encouraging formality while spreading the tax burden. The new top tax bracket increases
progressivity and fairness. However, revenue neutrality is essential and should be safeguarded

during the reform process. Also, an improved and well-targeted conditional cash transfer system,
backed by a national identification system, will be essential to protect the poor and vulnerable.
54.
Public resource allocation must shift significantly towards essential capital spending.
The additional fiscal space created during the 10th review should be preserved solely for growthenhancing capital spending, supported by the necessary capacity to execute the budgeted
investment projects. The large public sector wage bill continues to crowd out other crucial
expenditures. Informed by the ongoing compensation review, concrete measures need to be taken
to lower the wage bill, including divestment and outsourcing of public services, and improving
public sector efficiency with the aim to achieve the 9 percent of GDP wage bill target by FY18/19.
Replacing distortive taxes (such as asset taxes, stamp duties and transfer taxes) with high quality
taxes such as capital gains taxes and property taxes while reducing tax compliance cost will support
private sector growth.
55.
Reforms to the monetary framework should center on achieving price stability. The
effectiveness of monetary operations is hampered by the multiple objectives of monetary policy.
Maintaining a flexible exchange rate will help clarify the central bank’s single mandate for price
stability and provide the foundations to an eventual shift toward inflation targeting over the long
term. Improving monetary operations will enhance credibility and help reduce interest rate spread.
The BoJ’s liquidity provision should be more consistent with the lowered policy rate, including by
ensuring that the 14-day repo rate staying in the middle of the interest rate corridor.
56.
The financial sector should be strengthened through further retail repo reforms and
enhanced financial sector supervision and crisis management. The successful implementation of
the trust framework significantly reduced legal and operational risks of retail repo transactions. The
next step should be to bolster prudential requirements for retail repos and facilitate the reduction of
overall retail repo portfolios to a level deemed by the authorities as systemically safe and
prudentially manageable over the medium term. In addition, a legal framework for the resolution of
banks and securities dealers should be set up without delay. To address rising dollarization and
speculative FX pressures in the financial system, the authorities should explore the feasibility of
introducing prudential limits on the FX net open position of financial institutions.
57.
Important risks remain, but continued reform implementation should yield stronger
growth and job creation. Risks include reform fatigue and loss of social support for the reform
agenda in the absence of stronger growth, capacity constraints, thin majority of the government
which may delay reform implementation, and weak revenue performance which could undermine
fiscal consolidation and raise public borrowing costs. Notwithstanding those risks, the government’s
continued demonstrable commitment to the program and reform implementation should boost
confidence and growth, and further buttress fiscal sustainability. Therefore, the staff supports the
authorities’ request to complete the 11th and 12th reviews for the arrangement under the Extended
Fund Facility and the proposed modifications of performance criteria.

Likelihood of Realization of the Threat

Expected Impact if Threat is Realized

High
The heavy reform agenda, especially legislations, is
testing capacity limits, contributing to reform
delays. Reform fatigue and lack of political will may
aggravate tackling important, yet challenging
reforms, e.g. public sector reform.

High
A modest delay in many reforms could be
accommodated without serious repercussions.
Others, in particular those related to budget
implementation, are critical and highly time
sensitive. Reforms associated with fiscal/debt
sustainability remain critical.
High
The recovery of investment and growth relies on
public confidence in macro stability. Policy
slippage, especially those concerning a
sustainable fiscal consolidation, would have
severe repercussions.
High
Without a significant growth payoff, the public
support to the program may falter. Sustainable
medium-term debt reduction also relies crucially
on a growth pickup.

Medium
The new government has stated its intention to
continue with the program. However, a period of
credible policymaking may be needed to convince
the financial markets and investors of the
government’s commitment.
High
Confidence has improved since the start of the
program, but increase in investment and growth has
not yet materialized. Structural constraints that
hinder growth, e.g. crime, low access to finance, are
persistent and take time to resolve.
Medium
Government successfully returned to local bond
market after three years of market freeze. But
domestic demand for government papers may still
be fragile. PetroCaribe inflows may be affected by
oil price decline. Financing from development
partners is contingent on program implementation.
High
With US monetary lift and growth performance
improving, US$ has appreciated significantly and
the trend may continue.
Medium
A sharp slowdown in China and other large EMs
could materialize as a result of weak demand and
corporate/household deleveraging.
Medium
Domestic banks have stopped receiving cash from
money changers (cambios) due to concerns over
potentially losing the correspondent banking
relationships with overseas banks.
Medium
Weather related disasters are prevalent.
Zika virus has been found in Jamaica, though the
number of cases are still small.

1

High
While the impact is limited by the absence of net
financing needs, refinancing needs are expected
to rise over the coming years. A rise in financing
pressures would compress the scope for fiscal
spending or lead to monetization of the deficit.
Medium
US$ appreciation increases Jamaica’s external
debt burden, creates further dollarization risk,
and increases pressure on domestic interest rate
at a time when growth is still below potential.
Medium
External demand of Jamaican exports could be
negatively impacted,, which could affect growth
and sustainable debt reduction.
Medium
Losses of correspondent banking services could
significantly curtails cross-border payments, trade
finance, and remittances, and encourage the
development of underground economy.
High
Droughts and hurricanes can cause severe
damage to infrastructure and agriculture. A Zika
outbreak could undermine tourism growth and
affect labor productivity.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. Growth Drivers and Constraints1
Jamaica’s growth impediments, just like many other countries which have suffered from protracted low
growth, are numerous and severe. While a simple growth accounting exercise points to losses in TFP as
the main cause of growth sluggishness, this result hides many factors, most of them structural. Using
the framework of Hausmann et al, 2005, one can think of the constraints to growth divided into three
broad categories all related to capital and labor investment: (i) is there financing?, (ii) are the returns
appropriate?, and (iii) are the legal/institutional bases in place so that the investor can collect his
return? Findings based on limited data point to weaknesses in all three pillars, with access to financing
a constraint to both human and physical investment.

A. Potential Growth, Investment and Institutions
1.
Jamaica’s potential growth has historically been one of the lowest in the region. Based
on various filters, Jamaica’s current potential growth is below 1½ percent. Although this is higher
than some neighbors’ current potential growth, the persistent low growth rates mean that Jamaica’s
PPP-based GDP per capita is only half of that of Barbados and one-third of that of Bahamas (Figure
A2.1).
2.
Factor accumulation has been the main growth driver. Labor was the main contributor to
growth until 2002, but both capital and labor accumulation have since slowed, driving down GDP
growth. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth has been negative throughout the last 25 years, in
contrast with other tourism-based economies like Costa Rica which saw a turnaround in this period.


TFP captures the efficiency with which labor and capital generate output, which, in turn, depends
on (i) businesses’ ability to innovate, (ii) an economic environment that fosters competition,
(iii) the absence of unnecessary administrative burden, (iv) modern and efficient infrastructure,
and (iv) easy access to finance. Productivity shortfalls in Jamaica reflect a combination of all these
factors.



Given the structural nature of these factors, one should not read the turn-around in these
countries’ TFP as an overnight achievement; most of them involved decades-long reforms. For
instance, Costa Rica’s changes was largely driven by U.S.’s Intel Corporation’s decision to place its
manufacturing plant in the country, which in turn was motivated by Costa Rica’s (i) high levels of
educational attainment, (ii) economic openness, (iii) stable political, social and macroeconomic
environment, (iv) strong doing business environment. This environment was the outcome of
many decades of reforms, including significant investment in educational expenditures (which
are constitutionally mandated to reach 8 percent of GDP).

3.
Total investment in Jamaica is among the lowest of the region, with FDI concentrated
in tourism. Total FDI and domestic investment totaled only 21 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure A2.1),
significantly behind Bahamas or Costa Rica. Furthermore, nearly all of the FDI in 2014 went into

JAMAICA

tourism, reflecting not only the dynamism of the sector but potentially also the lack of it in other
sectors such as manufacturing and other services. The literature has found that non-competitive
sectors are usually not made competitive through FDI; instead they must be seen as competitive
before investment flows into them.
4.
Jamaica performs well in most governance indicators albeit with weaknesses in the
transparency of public sector decision-making (Figure A2.1). Jamaica outperforms the rest of the
Caribbean in most governance indicators. However, it lags behind in voice and accountability, which
encompasses important pillars such as freedom of expression and association, transparency in
government policymaking and procurement process, and reliability of public accounts and statistics.
These are especially important for large-scale investors seeking policy continuity and
macroeconomic stability.

B. Diagnostic on the Constraints to Growth
5.
A cross-country growth diagnostic is used to evaluate the relative constraints to
private sector growth in Jamaica. An index was compiled looking at the relative performance of
Jamaica across an extensive list of common constraints facing emerging market economies, including
constraints that impact the cost of investment, the overall returns on investment, and the
appropriability of investment returns. A standard score is calcuated for Jamaica on each of the
growth obstacles, comparing Jamaica to other countries in the world. The score consists of two
components, measuring: 1) to what extent an obstacle is objectively present in Jamaica, and 2) how
relevent an obstacle is for private sector firms. For the first component, the following variables are
used to approximate the severeness of each constraint:

48

-

Access to finance: credit to GDP ratio

-

Business licensing and permits: time cost for obtaining construction permits

-

Corruption: corruption perception index

-

Cost of finance: real lending interest rate

-

Crime: homicide rate

-

Customs and trade regulations: cost of export

-

Electricity: transmission and distribution losses

-

Quality of workforce: population with secondary/tertiary education

-

Labor regulations: firing cost

-

Informality: informal employment ratio

-

Tax rates: CIT rate

-

Tax system and administration: hours per year spent on paying taxes

-

Transportation infrastructure: road density

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

For the second component, firm survey data from IDB/CompeteCaribbean and World Bank on the
percentage of firms identifying each factor as a major obstacle to conducting business is used.
6.
The diagnostic points to five key areas of constraints. The top five obstacles to growth in
Jamaica, when compared to other countries in the world, are: (i) crime, (ii) the cost and availability of
credit, (iii) tax compliance cost, (iv) electricity

at the final severity score for each growth obstacle.
Interest payments have averaged nearly
10 percent of GDP per year in the last 25 years, which has undercut critical public investment and
fostered structural deficiencies. Furthermore, the risks associated with the fiscal position have also
undermined confidence, keeping the risk premium high.

C. Improving Financial Access and Reducing Financing Cost
8.
Jamaica performs well in bank account coverage, but obstacles remain for their actual
use by households and SMEs (Figure A2.2). A high percentage of households and formal
businesses have bank accounts. Nevertheless, credit represents only 29 percent of GDP (compared to
51 percent in the Caribbean) while deposits total 40 percent of GDP. Only 26 percent of SMEs report
having a loan or a credit line (compared to double in Barbados or Dominican Republic); over 40
percent of SMEs cite credit access as a major constraint, well above the LAC average of 31 percent
and 26 percent in the Dominican Republic. Few SMEs use banks to finance working capital (only 13
percent, compared to nearly a quarter in Trinidad and Tobago), which could be related to the high
levels of collateral requirements, averaging over 200 percent of the loan value. Household access to
credit mirrors the SMEs’ patterns, with nearly 30 percent of households saving at a financial
institution but only 11 percent having credit from one.

Real GDP growth

9.
Jamaica has very high lending-deposit
interest rate spread compared to its peers.
Simple analysis shows that reducing the lendingdeposit rate spread by 1 percentage point is
associated with up to 0.4 percentage point
increase in GDP growth2. Historically, the lack of
fiscal responsibility and high sovereign borrowing
needs pushed up the lending rate and contributed
to the phenomenon of high spread. The interest
rate spread is further elevated by the high
operating cost of the banking sector, which is
likely the result of a combination of factors,
including (i) high financial sector taxation (CIT and
asset tax amounting to nearly 50 percent of bank
revenue); (ii) high personnel cost due to unionized
wage structure; (iii) high percentage of cash
transactions and underdevelopment of electronic
payment and transaction systems; (iv) insufficient
competition within the banking sector; and (v) high
operating expenditure including in the form of
elevated security costs.

10.
Improving financial inclusion and reducing the cost of credit are essential to promote
growth. These could include:


Corporate bond and equity markets. Jamaica’s corporate bond market is quite deep compared to
the rest of Latin America and Caribbean (LAC); financial market access and efficiency, however,
remain low (Figure A2.2). Expanding the pool of institutional investors, including moving towards
a fully-funded pension system and the introduction of prudential limits to retail repo activity,
could increase demand for corporate instruments. While the tax incentive for listing in the junior
stock market has just been restored—which by itself opens the potential for abuse, unless well
circumscribed—a better practice (done in the UK and Canada) could be to incentivize the end
investor to fund these companies by giving the tax relief to the investor instead of the listing
company.



Bank lending. Private sector lending has been constrained to existing customers largely due to
underdeveloped risk models and credit bureaus to assess creditworthiness, and limited
competition in the banking sector. Moreover, the pass-through of interest rate cuts to the real
economy is low in Jamaica, reflecting weaknesses in the monetary transmission mechanism. This
partly reflects the highly segmented interbank market, as well as weak financial intermediation,

by US GDP growth.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

resulting from banks’ historical focus on providing low-risk financing to the public sector, rather
than lending to the private sector. Expanding financial literacy through enhanced information
disclosure requirements on banks’ financial products and improved dispute resolution
mechanisms would allow clients to compare products and force banks to compete on quality and
price of services. Developing a well-functioning interbank market, with higher turnover and
depth, will improve transmission. The recent issuance of banking license to Jamaica’s largest
building society, creating its 3rd largest bank, has helped improve competition. Additional
competition could encourage consumer mobility, and make lending rates more responsive to
policy rates.


MSME finance. High informality levels (estimated at 43 percent of GDP) hamper credit access. To
help lower inequality and informality, and improve financial inclusion, solutions for microinsurance, agency banking services, regular saving products, and factoring and leasing should be
considered to help rural and MSME sectors. The high collateral requirements noted earlier,
combined with weaknesses in land titling, limit credit to a small portion of asset owners. The
ongoing expansion of the partial credit guarantee of the Development Bank of Jamaica is a
useful step to improve MSME lending. Expanding the use and reach of e-payment infrastructure,
including by its use by the government to distribute social security payments, would help lower
financial services costs.

D. Fostering Diversification and Competitiveness
11.
Jamaica has experienced limited domestic production diversification and losses in
market share. As a small open economy, Jamaica’s growth is largely export driven due to limited
domestic demand. However, the country’s traditional exports—bauxite, alumina, and sugar,
comprising over 50 percent of total exports—are losing global market share (Figure A2.3), as a result
of more efficient competitors (e.g. Australia with alumina and Brazil with sugar) coming on stream
and loss of preferential trade treatments. Nevertheless, Jamaica’s loss in market share in total goods
and services exports is smaller than that of its traditional industries, pointing to likely gains in service
exports such as tourism and the BPO sector. In the absence of detailed data, however, this is difficult
to assess. In recent years, Jamaica’s exports have drifted towards lower value-added products such as
foods and commodities at the cost of knowledge intensive goods such as transport, electrical
equipment, machinery and chemicals. Only 15 percent of goods exported by Jamaica are in the
knowledge intensive/high value added category, compared to about 30 percent for Bahamas, Costa
Rica and Dominican Republic.
12.
There is scope for Jamaica to upgrade in the current production value chain. Jamaica’s
small size and limited potential to exploit economies of scale imply that the cost of moving into a
large number of new products could be prohibitive; quality upgrading within existing products could
be a more feasible route toward diversification. Producing higher quality varieties of existing
products can build on existing comparative advantages and can boost export revenue potential
through the use of more physical- and human-capital intensive production techniques. Thus, quality
upgrading opportunities in Jamaica could be quite strong in foods, drinks, or specialty agricultural
items. Fostering new comparative advantages and upgrading quality will require improving key areas
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

JAMAICA

such as fostering innovation and knowledge intensive sectors, improving ICT prevalence and usage,
and improving labor market flexibility.

E. Increasing Value-Added and Spillover from the Tourism Sector
13.
Tourism is the largest exporting sector, but growth momentum is relatively weak
(Figure A2.4). Tourism contributes to over 50 percent of total exports in Jamaica. And the country’s
reliance on tourism has increased over time, given the subdued performance in other export sectors.
However, growth momentum of tourism is weak relative to the sector’s overall performance around
the world. Data shows that tourism offerings in Jamaica is not cheap compared to other tourismintensive small countries, likely due to high energy cost and lack of exchange rate competitiveness.
On the other hand, expenditure per tourist in Jamaica is low compared to peers, indicating a lack of
diversified tourism products and services.
14.
Increasing the linkage between tourism and the rest of the economy is essential. A
vector autoregressive model associating GDP growth on tourist arrival shows that the impact of
tourist arrival on growth is small in Jamaica compared to other tourism-intensive countries. This is
Tourist Arrival Multiplier on GDP
likely related to Jamaica’s enclaved tourism model—
(Percentage change in GDP corresponding to 1 percent change in
inbound tourist arrival; 1995-2013)
tourists mostly stay in all-inclusive resorts that have
little linkage with the rest of the economy, partly due
to safety concerns. In addition, the sector imports
most of its non-labor inputs. To increase the sector’s
contribution to the economy, better coordination by
local producers is needed to reorient the sector’s
supply chain towards domestic goods and services. To
diversify from the all-inclusive operating model, it is
essential to reduce crime rate and encourage the
development of domestic SMEs.

F. Other Supply-Side Constraints

activities are also prevalent. Nearly 50 percent of firms

Moreover, total costs of crime are over 6 percent of

businesses’ annual sales, once security costs and

direct losses are accounted for. To effectively combat
crime, World Bank and the CARICOM Regional
Taskforce on Crime and Security suggest that a

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

national plan for crime reduction is needed to ensure multi-sectoral collaboration. In addition, better
data gathering and analysis should help identify geographical and demographic patterns of crime for
improved interventions. Crime prevention elements should be integrated into social programs in
health and education, especially among the youth population. The criminal justice system should
also be reformed to improve performance measurement and promote institutional accountability.
16.
Survey indicators point to regulatory, educational and infrastructure weaknesses. While
Jamaica ranks well in starting a business and getting credit, these indicators reflect intensive margin
improvements while a significant portion of the population still remains outside of those markets.
Regulatory and legal weaknesses around contract enforcement, property registration, and paying
taxes increase red tape and the hidden costs of doing business. Labor and goods markets are
inefficient, driven by restrictive product market regulations and high separation costs. Labor mobility
from the non-tradable to the tradable sector is also constrained by lack of training.
17.
Improving energy and transport infrastructure can reduce the cost of doing business in
Jamaica. Like other Caribbean countries, Jamaica’s power system suffers from high dependency on
imported fossil fuels.3 The good news is that Jamaica has already embarked on moving from costly
oil to natural gas-based power generation. For example, the Jamaica Public Services’ new 190MW
gas-powered power plant is on track to be operational by mid-2018, which should help sustainably
lower electricity costs—especially if the current low global oil price is transitory—and help diversify
Jamaica’s energy generation matrix. Reforms to replace old and inefficient power plants,
transmission/distribution lines, and improving metering would also help cut losses and costs. The IDB
estimates that for 2018-2023, US$860 million investments are needed in diversifying energy sources
and improving efficiency. Given limited fiscal space, strengthening public-private partnerships in
energy diversification and power sector regulatory framework are important to mobilize private
sector resources for energy investments. On infrastructure, the concession of Kingston Container
Terminal and privatizing the international airport in Kingston will help modernize both structures and
reduce their operational costs. Improving road connectivity and mass transit would promote linkages
between tourism and the real economy.
18.
A stunted private sector has lead to brain drain and fostered a large informal sector.
The educational attainment of Jamaican immigrants in the U.S. is much higher than those in the
country, pointing to severe brain drain due to lack of economic opportunities. This, in combination
with a high tax burden and labor market rigidities in such forms as high minimum wage and
complex/costly dispute resolution framework, has in turn led to a large informal sector where
activities are concentrated in low-productivity, labor-intensive areas such as small retail and
agriculture. Improving labor market flexibility through training programs to facilitate transition out of
agriculture and by tackling high separation costs, improving incentives to enter the formal sector
(e.g. through a strong safety net) and improving regulatory/taxation hurdles would help foster

3

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

JAMAICA

formality and generate a virtuous cycle in the lower parts of the income distribution which would
also reduce brain drain and crime.
19.
A long history of high debt service combined with a bloated and inefficient public
sector has weakened public service delivery. The high levels of interest and wage expenditures
have significantly crowded out productive capital spending. This, combined with weak execution
capacity over even the budgeted amounts each year,
Composition of Public Expenditure
(In percent of GDP, 2014)
has resulted in weak infrastructure and

telecommunications and electricity matrices. Some
20
steps have also been taken to modernize an archaic
15
tax system, but efforts should continue towards a
broad-based, transparent system which reduces the
10
reliance on distortive taxes (e.g. direct and turnover
5
taxes) and eliminates almost all ad-hoc and sectoral
0
exemptions. Modern taxes such as property taxes,
capital gains tax and consumption taxes should be
implemented or broadened to fill the void, with the
added advantage that these taxes incentivize savings
and are deemed to be more growth friendly. As reforms to raise public sector efficiency come on
stream and the private sector becomes more vibrant, the newly found fiscal space should target
much needed improvements in public sector provisions.

G. Emerging Transformational Investments
20.
Strategic investment projects can help transform the economy. These investment
projects help close the gap in crucial infrastructure and/or provide the foundation for the
development of industries in which Jamaica potentially has a comparative advantage. With only
limited fiscal space, private sector participation in these projects should be encouraged and
facilitated through the use of privatization and different types of private-public partnership.

The completion of Phase II of the Highway 2000 project (the North-South Highway), is an
example of such partnership with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). The highway
reduces travel time between Kingston, the industrial and logistics center of Jamaica, and the
North Coast where the tourism economy is concentrated, facilitating positive spillover of tourism
into the domestic economy.



Similarly, modernizing and expanding the container terminal in the Port of Kingston (KCT), with
financing from private banks and the IDB, will boost the competitiveness of the Port, help
establish Jamaica as a regional transshipment hub—particularly in light of potential competition
from Cuba’s Mariel port—and attract FDI in the logistics industry and related sectors.



The Norman Manley Airport in Kingston is also being offered to private concessionaires for
modernization and expansion, and improvements in the operational efficiency. The privatization

and expansion of the NMIA is expected to help increase Jamaica’s competitiveness as a regional
logistics hub and boost the investment attractiveness of the Kingston area.
21.
Private sector dynamism supported by an improved business environment and
investments in physical and human capital can generate growth. Jamaica offers opportunities to
the private sector in various growth sectors like BPO, tourism, manufacturing and agri-business,
Jamaican specialty goods, creative industries, creating a Kingston waterfront, housing development,
etc. The proximity to large export markets in North America, combined with the English-language
advantage, puts Jamaica in a unique position to leverage its geography and culture to ignite private
investment. The virtuous cycle of raising physical and human capital, which in turn increase
productivity, attract private investment, generate job opportunities, and eventually higher growth is
an achievable goal, requiring dedicated effort to sustain macroeconomic stability and deep structural
reforms.

B. Composition of Capital Flows and of the Net International Investment
Position (IIP)
2.
The significant narrowing of the current account deficit has allowed for continued
accumulation of international reserves, despite reduced financing from the financial and
capital accounts. The current account deficit narrowed sharply from US$1,128 million in 2014 to
US$326 million in 2015, largely as a result of lower oil prices. Over the past two years, foreign direct
investment (FDI) has increased significantly: net FDI amounted to US$760 million in 2015, up from
US$511 million in 2014. By contrast, portfolio flows, which have historically been much more volatile
than FDI, were negative at US$225 in 2015 and a positive contribution of US$775 in 2014. The
issuance of two sovereign bonds in the international capital markets in July of 2015 to finance the
PetroCaribe debt buyback operation led to a negative contribution of net official investment flows of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

JAMAICA

US$1,202 million in 2015, which contrasts with a positive contribution of US$821 in 2014. Thus,
despite the lower contribution of the capital and financial account to the current account financing,
international reserves increased by US$953 million in 2014 and 435 million in 2015.
3.
Jamaica’s net international investment position (IIP) has been relatively constant over
the past year, although it remains very high. Jamaica has a large negative IIP, which has grown
over time both in absolute terms and as a share of GDP. At end-2015, the net IIP registered a deficit
of US$22 billion, equivalent to -150.0 percent of GDP. This net IIP was largely unchanged from the
deficit at end-2014 (US$22 billion), even if as a share of GDP it deteriorated as a result of the
depreciation of the Jamaican dollar vis-a-vis the US dollar, which implied a lower level of GDP.
4.
The relatively high share of foreign direct investment in total liabilities, together with
the longer maturity of the majority of other liabilities, suggests a smaller need to hold
reserves for precautionary purposes. The maturity profile of the other investment component of
liabilities in end-2015 suggests that the majority of liabilities (80 percent) correspond to long-term
loans; liabilities maturing in less than one year account for the remaining 20 percent. That said, the
PetroCaribe debt buyback operation reduced the average maturity of liabilities and resulted in the
bunching of repayments in some years.

C. Reserve Adequacy
5.
Jamaica’s international reserves are below the suggested range by the metric proposed
in the IMF’s Board paper “Assessing Reserve

(Percent of ARA Metric)

New weights (20 percent to Other liabilities)

D. Wage and Non-Price Competitiveness Indicators
6.
Wage comparisons provide an additional
measure of international competitiveness, but are
significantly hampered by data availability. In the
absence of data on average manufacturing wages, a
comparison of minimum wages among a group of
countries in Central America and the Caribbean shows
that Jamaica’s minimum wage is not high in absolute
U.S. dollar terms; it is, however, relatively high as a share
of GDP per capita.

Non-price competitiveness indicators have improved in recent years including the
World Bank’s 2015 Ease of Doing Business improving from 71 to 64 (among 189 economies).
In terms of the distance to frontier (DTF), it narrowed the distance from 64.7 in 2015 to 67.3 in 2016.1
8.
Among the 11 areas of competitiveness considered, however, progress was uneven.
While the DTF ranking rose significantly in five areas (resolving insolvency, getting credit, starting a
business, paying taxes, and dealing with construction permits), it remained nearly constant in 4 areas
and declined in one (getting electricity). The decline in the average electricity price from US¢41.6 in
2014 to US¢28 per kWh in 2015, was more than offset by declines in the quality and reliability of
service.
9.
Despite improvements, in terms of levels, Jamaica is still far from the frontier in five
areas (registering property, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, and
enforcing contracts). Moreover, it lags behind its regional peers or relevant comparator countries in
paying taxes and trading across borders.

Annex IV. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under the current baseline scenario, Jamaica’s public debt remains high but is on a downward trend
underpinned by sustained fiscal consolidation. The projected decline in public debt is vulnerable to risks
from key macro-fiscal shocks, contingent liabilities, and natural disasters.1

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Jamaica’s public debt has declined steadily over the past few years. Between
FY2012/2013 and FY2015/16, public debt has fallen by about 11 percent of GDP to 129 percent of
GDP, and is now projected to further decline to about 128 percent of GDP at end of FY2016/17.
Under the current baseline projections, public debt would be reduced to 102 percent of GDP at endMarch 2020, still higher than the 96 percent marker set at the start of the program.
2.
The steady decline in Jamaica’s public debt has been underpinned by strong fiscal
consolidation under the IMF-supported program and the buyback of the PetroCaribe debt in
July 2015.2 Jamaica’s central government operations posted a primary surplus of 7½ percent of GDP
over FY2013/14 and FY2014/15. The primary surplus target was lowered slightly by ¼ and ½ percent
of GDP for FY2015/16 and FY2016/17, respectively, to accommodate growth-enhancing spending,
but remains at a level compatible with public debt reduction (7 percent of GDP per year from
FY2016/17 onwards). Fiscal consolidation has contributed to the reduction in public debt; the decline
in public debt in FY2015/16 also reflects the gains from the buyback of the PetroCaribe debt in July
2015, which resulted in an upfront reduction of public debt by 10 percent of GDP.
3.
Nevertheless, public debt sustainability risks are significant, particularly from key
macro-fiscal and contingent liability shocks.


The dynamics of debt reduction hinge on sustained fiscal consolidation. The reduction in
public debt since 2013 has been supported by fiscal consolidation and the recent buyback of the
PetroCaribe debt. While slippages in fiscal consolidation do not seem to have a significant direct
impact on debt trajectory (Figure A4.5),3 its indirect effects on public debt can be significant. For
example, fiscal complacency could undermine policy credibility and investor confidence, causing
a spike in sovereign bond yields, which could lead to unpleasant public debt dynamics.
Maintaining strong fiscal stance is critical, in line with the government’s commitment to the
program objective to bring public debt down to 96 percent of GDP by 2019/20 and to 60 percent
of GDP by 2025/26, as entrenched in the Fiscal Responsibility Law.

The main assumptions underpinning the DSA are presented in the lower panel of Figure 4 and are based on the
medium-term macroeconomic framework under the extended arrangement under the EFF.

See Box 2 in IMF Country Report No. 15/270.

The scenario describes a cumulative relaxation of the primary balance by 4.2 percentage points of GDP, spread over
FY2017/18–FY2021/22 (Figure A4.5, lower panel).



Economic slack could derail the debt profile. In a scenario with 1.7 percentage points lower
real GDP growth in FY2017/18 and FY2018/19, corresponding to one standard deviation of
growth over the past 10 years, the primary balance would deteriorate by 0.4 and 0.8 percent in
these two years, respectively. Public debt would rise to 101 percent of GDP by end-March 2021,
about 6 percent above the current projection.



Debt profile is also vulnerable to a contingent liabilities shock. A financial sector contingent
liability stress test suggests that public debt could rise to 104 percent at end-March 2021, if it is
subject to a one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of the
banking sector’s assets.4 It is therefore important to implement reforms to strengthen financial
sector stability.



Overall risks to the debt outlook remain elevated as indicated by both the symmetric and
asymmetric fan charts (Figure A4.1). Based on the joint historical distribution of the main
macroeconomic aggregates (real GDP growth, interest rate, nominal exchange rate, and primary
balance), there is a 25 percent probability that public debt would exceed 100 percent of GDP at
end-March 2021, even absent a contingent liability shock.



Although the heat map shows a somewhat worse market perception since the last DSA,
recent developments point to improvements. A large part of the increase in Jamaica’s EMBIG
yield since the last DSA was in August 2015 when the yield rose by 84 bps, after the international
bond placement of US$2bn; otherwise, Jamaica’s yields have broadly moved in line with the EM
average. Moreover, recent developments point to strengthening market confidence: (1) there
have been two credit ratings upgrades in the last 12 months, including in February by Fitch,
(2) recent surveys which point to a 15 year high in confidence levels and (3) a downward path in
yields since the beginning of 2016.

4.


Jamaica’s debt position also remains vulnerable to natural disasters.
Calibration of the shock. Given Jamaica’s high exposure to natural disasters,5 this test assumes
that such a shock causes 4 percent of GDP in damages, twice the conditional average cost of
natural disasters in Jamaica over the past two decades.6 The calibrated shock is a conservative
estimate, given that the largest (hurricane Gilbert in 1988) and second largest natural disaster
(hurricane Ivan in 2004) caused damages of 65 percent and 6.6 percent of GDP, respectively.

4

It is assumed that the financial stress would also trigger GDP losses in the magnitude of the real growth shock
described above.
5

Jamaica ranks 101 out of 206 countries worldwide in the frequency of disasters (frequency of disasters per 1000 km2),
1990-2014 (Source: Growth and Resilience Initiative: Stylized Facts About Natural Disasters)
6

Jamaica had 9 major hurricanes and storms over the past two decades (estimated damages in percent of GDP): 1988
hurricane Gilbert (65), 2002 flood (0.6), 2004 hurricane Ivan (6.6), 2005 hurricane Dennis and Emily (1), 2005 hurricane
Wilma (0.6), 2007 hurricane Dean (2.9), 2008 storm Gustav (1.8), 2010 storm Nicole (1.9), 2012 hurricane Sandy (0.8).

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA



Parametrization of the scenario. With a disaster of such magnitude, real growth would typically
be about 2 percentage points lower in the year of the disaster, and accelerate by 0.5 percentage
points the year after the disaster (boosted by low base and reconstruction). Based on the past
distribution of damages between the public and the private sectors, it is assumed that the
government would cover ¾ of the damages, corresponding to 3 percent of GDP in this scenario.
The associated fiscal expenditure is assumed to be spread over 3 years: 1.5 percent of GDP in the
first year, and 1 and ½ percent of GDP in next two years respectively.



Impact on public debt. The shock would have a material impact on public debt, shifting the
entire public debt trajectory up by around 5 percent of GDP above the baseline. Thus, public
debt would reach 99.6 percent of GDP at end-March 2021. In light of frequent natural disasters, it
is important to build sizable and lasting fiscal buffers to cover the fiscal cost of future disasters.

5.
The reopening of the domestic bond market could mitigate financing risks, including
rollover risks of a still high debt burden. Capitalizing on the liquidity available from the
redemption of a J$62 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) government bond, the domestic bond market
re-opened in February (after being frozen for almost three years), through the issuance by the GoJ of
J$15 billion bonds at various maturities to meet the demand for new government assets. Concerted
efforts to further develop local currency bond market offer the government an additional funding
source to meet its financing needs and to address the FX risk of the debt portfolio. The risk profile of
public debt would indeed benefit from reduced reliance on foreign currency (see ¶6).

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
6.
The recent shift towards external financing sources has increased public debt’s
exposure to exchange rate risk. Jamaica tapped the international capital markets while the
domestic bond market was frozen between 2013 and 2015, shifting the composition of public debt
towards foreign currency (Figure A4.4). External debt is now estimated at around 70 percent of GDP
in FY2015/16, about 10 percentage points of GDP higher than in FY2013/14. The foreign-currency
denominated debt accounts for about 63 percent of total debt. As illustrated in Figure A4.5, public
debt is most vulnerable to exchange rate volatility. The recent reactivation of the domestic bond
market is a welcome step in this direction, as it provides scope for shifting the financing sources
towards domestic ones.
7.
There are risks related to PetroCaribe financing with the expectation of long-lasting
low oil prices. Given that oil prices are projected to recover modestly over the medium term, the
gross inflows at highly concessional terms from PDVSA are expected to be continuously low.
Securing alternative low-cost financing where possible (e.g., from IFIs) would mitigate risks to public
debt dynamics.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Kingston, Jamaica
June 2, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde,
Jamaica has continued the steadfast implementation of its Fund-supported economic reform
programme aimed at overcoming the long-standing problems of low growth and high debt. All
quantitative fiscal and monetary performance criteria under the programme have been met for all
quarterly test dates, with the exception of the March 2015 nominal target for the primary surplus for
the central government, which was missed by a narrow margin, owing to lower than projected
inflation and GDP growth (the surplus still came in at the projected 7.5 percent of GDP). The
Government has also implemented all of the structural benchmarks that were included in the
programme, albeit with some minor delays.
The Government remains fully committed to meeting the objectives of the programme, as well as its
specific targets. Attachment 1 to this letter is a supplementary Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP), presenting performance under the programme, and updating the specific
policies to meet the programme’s ultimate objectives, including the associated quantitative targets
and structural benchmarks. Attachment 2 is the updated Technical Memorandum of Understanding.
On the basis of our performance under the programme thus far as well as our strong commitment
to the continued implementation of the programme, the Government requests that the Executive
Board of the IMF complete the combined 11th and 12th reviews of the extended arrangement under
the Extended Fund Facility, and approve the modification of performance criteria for end-September
2016 and the new performance criteria for end-December 2016, as well as the purchases under the
arrangement of SDR 56.64 million.
The Government believes that the policies described in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve
the programme’s objectives. However, if necessary, the Government stands ready to take any
additional measures that may be required. The Government will consult with the Fund in advance on
the adoption of these measures and revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
The Government will also provide the Fund staff with all the relevant information required to
complete programme reviews and monitor performance on a timely basis. The Government will
observe the standard performance criteria against imposing or intensifying exchange restrictions,
introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payment agreements that
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

JAMAICA

are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and imposing or intensifying
import restrictions for balance of payments reasons.
As part of our communication policy, we intend to publish this letter on the websites of the Ministry
of Finance and Planning and the Bank of Jamaica to keep domestic and international agents
informed about our policy actions and intentions. In that regard, we authorize the Fund to publish
this letter and its attachments as well as the associated staff report.
Very truly yours,

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
I. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAMME
1.
Policy implementation under the programme remains strong and structural reforms
are progressing. All quantitative performance targets for end-December 2015 and for end-March
2016 were met. The structural benchmarks for the period mid-November 2015 to mid-May 2016
were also met:


Changes in legislation for the new public pension system were tabled in November 2015;



Key performance indicators, as outlined in the National Compliance Plan (NCP), to measure the
effectiveness and efficiency of the tax system were implemented in November 2015;



Phase 2 of the RAiS (GENTAX) integrated tax software package was implemented for all major
tax types by December 2015;



A full-time dedicated management team for the implementation of the human resource
software system was put in place in January 2016;



And the capacity of the Post-Clearance Audit unit in the Jamaica Customs Agency (JCA) was
increased through the hiring of 15 additional auditors by end-March 2016.

II. POLICIES FOR 2016/17 AND BEYOND
2.
The new Government remains fully committed to the reform programme. It aims to
combine prudent fiscal policies with efforts to boost growth and job creation, which have remained
too low for too long. The quantitative targets that serve as performance criteria and indicative
targets under the programme have been updated, and are presented in Table 1. The structural
conditionality under the programme is presented in Table 2.
Fiscal Policy
3.
The budget for 2016/17 targets a primary surplus of 7.0 percent of GDP, and increases
room for growth-enhancing capital expenditure to support growth and job creation. The
budget was adopted by Parliament in June 2016. Economic growth is projected at 1.8 percent for
the coming fiscal year, up from just under 1 percent in 2015/16. Capital spending is projected to
increase from 2 percent of GDP in 2015/16 to 2.6 of GDP in 2016/17, facilitated by the lower primary
surplus target. To keep public debt on a downward trajectory to 96 percent of GDP by 2020 and to
60 percent by 2026, a 7 percent of GDP primary surplus will be maintained over the medium term.

Tax Reforms
4.
Comprehensive tax reform is a key pillar of our economic reform programme. The goal
is an efficient and broad-based tax system that applies equitably to all entities, regardless of their
sphere of economic activity. Based on ongoing IDB TA, we will continue to improve the reporting on
tax expenditures and their estimated fiscal costs in the context of future budgets.
5.
Continuing tax reforms to rebalance from direct toward indirect taxes is a central
element of our program. Starting July 1, 2016, the exemption threshold for the personal income
tax will be raised to J$1,000,272 from the current J$592,800. A further increase to J$1,500,096 will
take place on April 1, 2017. The marginal tax rate for earnings above J$6 million will be increased
from 25 to 30 percent on July 1, 2016.


The cost of this tax reform is estimated at 0.7 percent of GDP (about J$12 billion) in FY16/17 and
a further 0.9 percent of GDP (about J$16 billion) in FY17/18.



Offsetting measures in FY16/17 will encompass (i) a J$7 increase in SCT on fuels, (ii) increasing
the departure tax to US$35, (iii) increase the SCT on cigarettes by J$2 per stick, (iv) implementing
a new LNG taxation regime. These measures are expected to yield 13.8 bn for FY16/17.



With the support of IMF TA, a comprehensive tax reform package will be put in place for
FY17/18 which continues to rebalance towards indirect taxation, including the scope for
environmental/ carbon taxes (for which Jamaica is particularly well suited given its tourism
potential).

6.
New legislation pertaining to transfer pricing including the requirement to file a
declaration of connected party transaction was passed in November 2015 and is now in force.
With OECD technical assistance, the Tax Administration of Jamaica (TAJ) is developing its capacity to
effectively administer the new law. TAJ will enforce compliance action for year of assessment 2016

Next steps to strengthen tax and customs administration include:



Continued implementation of the TAJ National Compliance Plan including the rationalization of
key performance indicators.



Completion of staffing of the TAJ as a Semi-Autonomous Revenue Authority (SARA) by endOctober 2016. Staffing at the four (4) top levels, (Executive to AGM levels), has been completed.



Following up on the entity-by-entity review of all grandfathered tax incentives, the Fiscal
Impacts Report will be produced by September 2016.



Improving the efficiency of the large taxpayers’ office (LTO) by (i) maintaining e-filing and ontime filing rates of 90 percent for LTO clients for major taxes and (ii) increasing the number of
comprehensive audits to 90 per year by March 2017.



Increasing the number of completed PCA audits to 60 a year by March 2017.

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA



Phase 1 of the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system processes comprising (1) the
electronic imaging and data capture of paper tax returns and (2) the electronic imaging of other
paper documents (e.g., taxpayer letters, certified copies of certificates, auditor working papers,
taxpayer rulings etc, in RAiS) has been completed. Interim testing on linking of these processes
to RAiS case actioning and reporting components is ongoing and expected to be concluded by
June 2016.



The legislative framework supporting enhanced trade facilitation practices by the JCA, as
articulated in phase III of the Customs Act, is being harmonized with trade facilitation, the
Special Economic Zone (SEZ) legislation, and treaty obligations with World Bank and CARTAC
assistance. Phase III of the Customs Act will be tabled in parliament by end-December 2016.



Upon finalization of the Phase III of the Customs Act, developing effective administrative
procedures will be critical for the successful implementation of the SEZ regime, in particular to
strengthen product identification and inventory management systems compliance enforcement
to enhance risk management, and post clearance audit.

Reforms to Public Financial Management (PFM) and the Budget Process
8.
The government is implementing its updated action plan for public financial
management reform, in collaboration with its development partners. In this context:


By November 2016 a new procurement manual will be prepared with IDB assistance. An
Electronic Tendering System has been implemented in four pilot entities (Ministry of Finance
and Public Service, e-Gov, Ministry of Health and National Health Fund) with two more entities
(HEART Trust and BOJ) expected to be finalized by end-June 2016.



The macro-fiscal capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (MoFP) will be
strengthened with the support of IMF and other TA. We aim to recruit additional qualified staff
by August 2016.



The Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) will be further expanded and
improved. The responsibility of managing the government’s banking arrangements will be
transferred to the Accountant General’s Department (AGD). An updated inventory of all bank
accounts in the public sector will be prepared by end-June 2016 with the aim of closing most of
them and converting the remainder into zero-balance accounts. Salaries of over 27,000 civil
servants in the central government are paid directly from the TSA. By June 2016, salaries of
about three-quarters of central government employees will be paid directly from the TSA,
including teachers and police. Most imprest accounts will be terminated by end-August 2016.



The first phase of CTMS enhancements will be concluded by December 2016. Transfer of the
responsibility for further development and management of the CTMS from the MoFP to the
AGD has commenced and is expected to be completed by August 2016. The mapping of
function is in progress and expected to be finalized by July 2016. A ledger accounting system
has been introduced into the CTMS with sub-ledgers for the RTGS and ACH accounts. A plan for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

JAMAICA

introducing sub-ledgers for all other bank accounts maintaining a cash balance will be prepared
by June 2016 and implemented starting August 2016.


By July 2016, a plan for paying all revenues, including earmarked revenues, into the
Consolidated Fund (CF) will be drawn up. In particular, the plan will outline the steps to: (i) close
all accounts used by MDAs to deposit funds earmarked as AIAs and (ii) enable deposit of funds
presently earmarked as AIAs directly into the CF.



By end-July 2016, all cash transfers for intra-government transactions will be eliminated.



By end-September 2016, a new organizational structure for the Accountant General’s
Department should be approved by Corporate Management Development (CMD) branch in the
Ministry of Finance and Public Service. (Proposed new structural benchmark for end-September
2016).



A service level agreement (SLA) between the BOJ and the Government for banking services
provided by the BOJ will be signed in June 2016 following the full transfer of responsibility for
the management of government accounts to the AGD.

Debt Management
9.
The Government is committed to sharply reducing public debt, which is expected to
decline to 96 percent of GDP by March 2020. This is expected to be achieved by sustained fiscal
efforts, policies to bolster growth, as well as a prudent debt management strategy. In designing and
implementing these undertakings, the Government will seek to ensure sound public sector
governance and public debt management. The Government will further strengthen its debt
management strategy development and implementation, with the goal of reducing the burden of
servicing government debt, supporting the continued reduction of public debt to a sustainable level,
and ensuring access to multiple sources of financing. Moreover, the debt management strategy will
seek to further develop and deepen the domestic bond market, so as to reduce currency, duration
and concentration risk for both the government and the financial sector.

Public Sector Reform
10.
The Government is committed to improving the efficiency, quality and cost
effectiveness of the public sector.


80

Public sector transformation. We will:


By March 2018, centralize legal services within the central government under the office of
the Attorney General , with support from Justice Canada.



Subject to legislative approval, implement the merged organizational structure between
Betting Gaming and Lotteries and the Racing Commissions in April 2017.



Merge selected commodity Boards and the Export Division of the Ministry of Agriculture &
Fisheries which deals with Spices into a single new body to be named the Jamaica
Agricultural Commodities Regulatory Authority (JACRA). It is anticipated that the legal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

aspects will be finalized by April 2016, and the full merger is expected to be completed by
September 2016.


Divest the Petroleum Company of Jamaica Limited, Petcom—Negotiations with the bidder
have been completed.



Consequent on securing funding, we will seek to complete the procurement of the system
for the Asset Management Shared Services and have a contract in place with the successful
bidder by April 2017.



We will submit to Cabinet an action plan for public sector transformation by end-September
2016. In particular, it will include detailed timelines for (1) the introduction of shared corporate
services for communications and human resource management and (2) the merger, abolition
and/or divestment/privatization of entities. The plan will also outline specific areas where
efficiency gains can be made. (Proposed new structural benchmark for end-September 2016)



Wages and salaries. The Government has signed new wage agreements for the 2-year period
after March 2015 with 97 percent of public sector employees. Discussions for the period starting
April 2017 are expected to be underway by November 2016. Informed by the compensation
review to be completed by December 2016, the government’s goal is to achieve a wage bill of 9
percent of GDP in 2018/19, and to firmly maintain the ratio of public debt to GDP on a
downward path over the medium term. In order to achieve this objective, the GOJ will continue
to reduce the size of the public sector through the elimination of posts and an attrition
programme, subject to the capacity needs in a limited number of priority areas.



Compensation Review. We will continue to build a comprehensive database to include all
allowances paid to public employees across each MDA to ensure adequate control and
oversight over this part of the wage bill. The database will be by occupational grouping and will
include all types of allowances paid, their amounts as well as the number of employees that
benefit from each type of allowance in a given fiscal year. A two-part pilot implementation will
be pursued. A pilot for the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service will be completed by endAugust 2016, followed by island-wide pilots, to be completed by end-November 2016, at the
Ministry of Health (medical professionals), Ministry of Education, Youth and Information
(teaching groups) and the Jamaica Constabulary Force (police groups). (Proposed new structural
benchmark for end-November 2016) The review of all other central government MDAs will be
completed by March 2017.



Employee Census. To ensure adequate oversight, we will verify each employee's post and
eligibility of the post for allowances beginning with a two-part pilot where the first part will
comprise of island-wide pilots at the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service, the civilian
population of the Ministry of National Security, and the NIS to be completed by end-August
2016. The second part will include an island-wide pilot for the non-teaching personnel in the
Ministry of Education to be completed by end-November 2016. (Proposed new structural
benchmark for end-November 2016). These pilots target groups with high turnover rates where a
headcount exercise could yield significant gains. The verification for all other central government
MDAs will be finalized by March 2017.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

JAMAICA



Pension Reform. Discussion of the proposed legislative changes in parliament has been
delayed by the early elections. The Pension Bill is expected to be re-tabled in Parliament by July
2016. The new public pension system, as described in the June 2014 MEFP, is expected to be
implemented in the first quarter of FY17/18.

11.
The implementation of the human resources software system (the HCMES system;
including Payroll) is progressing. A project plan was completed in August 2015 and a full-time
dedicated project management team (including specialists in the areas of Business Process
Mapping, Human Resource Management, Payroll Administration and Data Migration) was put in
place by end-January 2016 (structural benchmark). The configuration of the system will be
completed by end-June 2016, when the roll–out to the first 14 MDAs will begin.
12.
In the area of public bodies, further improvement is to be achieved to improve their
efficiency and supervision.


To enhance transparency, the annual reports (including audited statements) for three-quarters
of self-financing public bodies has been completed. The sanctioning process under Section 25 of
the Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act of self-financing public bodies that failed
to meet the statutory condition without reasonable cause is ongoing.



The new structure of the Auditor General’s office has been approved. Its ongoing
implementation will allow for more in-depth and frequent reviews of financial statements of
budget funded public bodies and enforcement of the six months’ time limit for their submission
to the Auditor General.



We will develop and submit to Cabinet for approval a new policy on public bodies that will
ensure consistent PFM rules for public bodies (structural benchmark for June 2016). The policy
will create classes of public bodies, identify key PFM principles to be adhered to for each class,
and eliminate the current classification by funding source. A unit in the MOFP will be assigned to
be responsible for ensuring that the policy on public bodies is being adhered to across the full
body of PFM reform projects.



Upon approval by Cabinet of the new policy on public bodies, we will conduct a review of all
existing public bodies to determine their classification. The review will also evaluate the scope
for merging and reintegrating some public bodies into the central government. This review will
be completed by December 2016.

III. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS
13.

We are strengthening the prudential framework for financial supervision.



Under the Banking Services Act, the code of conduct on consumer related matters will be issued
by August 2016. Regulations pertaining to agent banking will be tabled by August 2016. The
suite of regulations and rules that will comprise the regime for financial holding companies and
consolidated supervision will be tabled by end-December 2016.

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA





Following industry consultation and guidance from the Steering Committee, we have started
implementing a strategy to introduce and gradually tighten prudential standards for the
securities sector:
-

In April 2016, we introduced an operational risk-weighted asset component in the
calculation of securities dealers’ capital adequacy;

-

By December 2016, we will require all securities dealers to conduct regular stress tests and
submit test results;

-

We will implement a limit of 25 percent on exposure to counterparty by 2019;

-

We are monitoring the dealers’ retail repo leverage ratio, with the goal of introducing a
minimum retail repo leverage ratio by April 2017;

-

We will start issuing comprehensive prudential guidelines for securities dealers in June
2016.We will ensure that in the near- to medium-term, the retail repo portfolios of individual
firms and the securities industry as a whole will be at a level deemed by the BOJ and the FSC
to be systemically safe and prudentially manageable.

We will have taken steps to further strengthen depositor protection and investor compensation
across financial institutions.

14.
We are enhancing the arrangements for financial crisis preparedness and
management.


We will prepare a consultation paper for the resolution framework for the entire financial sector,
including proposals on (i) the scope of institutions that would be covered by the resolution
regime; (ii) the resolution powers; (iii) the legal structure of the regime (i.e., administrative, courtbased, or a combination); and (iv) the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies with
respect to resolution (proposed new structural benchmark for end- October 2016). A working
group has been established to prepare this paper, with input from stakeholders and IMF TA.



By end-September 2017, we will table the legislative provisions, consistent with IMF TA, to
support the national crisis management plan and the resolution framework for the banking and
securities sectors.

15.
We will continue to strengthen the mandate and governance of the BOJ over the
programme period.


The Financial System Stability Committee, introduced by the amended BoJ Act which became
effective in October 2015 and vested the BOJ with the responsibility for financial stability, will be
formally established by September 2016. The functions and powers of the FSSC include
producing financial stability assessments, the regular exchange of information on financial sector
risks, commissioning stress tests and determining parameters that will trigger macro-prudential

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

JAMAICA

action. A proposal will be submitted to Cabinet in September 2016, discussing further
amendments to the BOJ Act for enhancing BOJ governance and autonomy.
16.
We are implementing measures to protect the interest of retail repo clients. In addition
to the transition to the trust-based framework in August 2015, we raised the investment cap for CIS
in foreign assets to 15 percent in June 2015, and to 25 percent by end-December 2015. Going
forward, the BOJ will continue to monitor market conditions and assess the need to lift the
investment cap further.

IV. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
17.
Monetary policy aims to achieve single digit inflation within a flexible exchange rate
regime. We envisage inflation in the range of 4.5 to 6.5 percent in FY2016/17. The long term
objective is to gradually reduce inflation to a rate that is consistent with that of our main trading
partners, and eventually to full-fledged inflation targeting. The BOJ is completing its first review to
assess our readiness for inflation targeting. The outcome of the annual reviews will provide the
inputs for an informed decision on inflation targeting to be made by Cabinet.
18.
The BOJ will continue to ensure the provision of adequate liquidity to the financial
system at a price consistent with its policy goals. Guided by IMF TA, the BOJ is developing a
comprehensive strategy to improve the effectiveness of its open market operations and liquidity
assurance framework in order to enhance the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Specifically,
as a further refinement to its liquidity provision framework, the BOJ has introduced periodic auctions
for repo operations in October 2015. The BOJ will begin a programme of transitioning its policy rate
to an overnight interest rate. This transition will be done over a six-month period and will
commence with the adjustment of the interest rate on its overnight deposit facility by July 2016. To
reduce the relative attractiveness of foreign-currency denominated investments relative to J$
alternatives, the BOJ will also require a portion of the foreign currency cash reserve requirement for
commercial banks to be held in J$, starting September 2016.
19.
The BOJ will continue to facilitate the development of the foreign exchange market.
The BOJ, in consultation with IMF TA, is exploring mechanisms to improve price discovery in the FX
market and to prevent excessive speculative position taking in the market. The BOJ also remains
cognizant of the need to purchase reserves to further boost the net international reserves.

V. GROWTH ENHANCING REFORMS
20.
We have established an Economic Growth Council (EGC). The EGC includes
representatives from the public and private sector who will focus critical work in the areas of growth
and job creation. The EGC is mandated by the Prime Minister and Cabinet to identify high-impact
growth initiatives. The EGC will be supported by an Executive Secretariat that is also mandated,
resourced and staffed to work closely with Government ministries, departments and the private
sector. Appropriate monitoring, evaluation and transparency mechanisms will be put in place to

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

ensure that the EGC works closely with the Jamaican people, the private sector and civil society in
the context of the growth and jobs agenda.
21.

Further actions for improving the business climate are critical:



A revised standardized pricing framework for development application fees has been drafted and
is expected to be approved by Cabinet soon.



We will continue to report, on a quarterly basis, on progress in reducing the time needed for the
approvals process for development projects, especially for commercial development projects,
including against the 90 day benchmark. For Q1 2016, around 65 percent of all building and
planning applications were approved within 90 days.



LAMP services were expanded to St. James, Trelawny, Hanover, St. Ann and Westmoreland in
2015/16, with 1,236 new titles issued during the year. Under the GoJ Land Titling programme,
15000 titles are expected to be issued each year for the period FY2015/16 to FY2017/18. For the
period April 1, 2015 – January 31, 2016, the number of titles issued under the programme
amounted to 7, 740.



The roll-out of the online system for business registration will start by end-June, 2016.



Urgent actions will be taken to reduce the time needed for entrepreneurs to get an electricity
connection. Plans foresee the automation of the work processes within the Government
Electrical Regulator (GER) and the acquisition of AMANDA software to streamline procedures for
scheduling, inspecting, approving and certifying electrical installations. Adoption of the
AMANDA system is expected to be completed by April 2017, with IDB support.



Plans to establish a Port Community System (PCS) to electronically integrate and streamline
export and import procedures are underway. The ASYCUDA World Customs Management
System acquired by the JCA will support integrated processes/procedures and the National
Single Window, the latter supported by a World Bank loan. Functions of the PCS that cannot be
offered through ASYCUDA will be pursued by the private sector, possibly under a management
contract. The GOJ has set up a Trade Facilitation Task Force which is examining the
public/private issues, including pertaining to the PCS. The implementation of the project started
in January 2016, and will be completed by end-December, 2017.



We are developing an umbrella financial inclusion strategy, with inputs from stakeholders and
consultancy from the World Bank, covering key areas including MSME financing, housing
finance, payments, rural finance, consumer protection and literacy. We will establish a financial
inclusion council by July 2016 to oversee the launch and implementation of the strategy.



The Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) achieved 121.2 percent of its MSME lending target in
2015/16. The DBJ is targeting to provide increased funding to MSMEs in 2016/17. The Mobile
Money for Microfinance initiative is being reconfigured to focus on establishing an ecosystem
for private-sector driven mobile money operations. With assistance from the IDB, the project will
start in August, 2016 and will be completed by 2018.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

JAMAICA



We will develop other areas of reform to improve the access to capital and reduce the cost of
funding for MSMEs, including provision of support for MSME capacity development
programmes, streamlining the process of listing on Junior Stock Exchange, establishment of a
venture capital eco-system, full implementation of collateral and insolvency reforms, SME value
chain development, promotion of factoring and lease financing mechanisms, enhancement of
the partial credit guarantee scheme and microfinance legislation and institutional reform.



The Agro Parks Initiative, which aims to stabilize the agricultural supply chain, boost exports, and
increase import replacement is progressing. Nine agro parks are already operational.
Negotiations are ongoing to establish at least three more parks in 2016/17, with the IDB and
CDB under solicitation to support at least two new Agro Parks. An IDB-financed consultancy is
underway to prepare a sustainability framework for the existing Agro Parks and criteria for
selection of new Parks. A matching grant scheme will benefit small farmers in their cluster work
with lead anchor firms that export.



A national strategic plan for the BPO industry is now being implemented. Key actions under the
plan include the establishment of a policy and legislative framework; labour market initiatives,
infrastructure development, the development of business plans to attract developers and
investors, and actions to support market penetration.

22.

Strategic investments to establish Jamaica as a logistics hub are well underway:



In early April 2015, a 30-year concession agreement was signed with a private consortium
regarding the privatization of Kingston Container Terminal (KCT). Under the agreement,
beginning in 2016, the concessionaire will undertake dredging the access channel to the
Kingston Harbour and the KCT basin to allow for the handling of larger vessels that will transit
the Panama Canal after its expansion. The transfer of the operating control to the concessionaire
is expected to take place shortly after financial close of the transaction, which is expected by
June 2016. The concessionaire is expected to invest approximately US$625 million over two
phases of the concession, with the possibility of a third phase to be negotiated.



Work is continuing on the privatization of Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA). The
Cabinet will need to approve the list of preferred bidders, to whom a request for proposal will
be sent.



Work is also proceeding on the Caymanas SEZ, with World Bank support. A request for
expression of interest was completed in December 2015, and we plan to issue the request for
proposals for the feasibility study to the pre-qualified firms soon. This work is closely aligned
with a Master Plan for the Logistics Hub Initiative expected to be completed by April 2017, also
supported by the World Bank.



The Framework Agreement has been extended for a year to August 2016 for the development of
a transhipment port and industrial and commercial zones in the Portland Bight area by China
Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). Technical feasibility studies for the project have
commenced. This is a prerequisite for determining the construction methodology and for
obtaining the terms of reference from NEPA for the Environmental Impact Assessment.

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

23.

Reducing the cost of electricity is critical to improve competitiveness:



The action plan prepared by the Electricity Sector Enterprise Team (ESET) foresees replacing
current (oil-fired) generation capacity with gas, coal and ethane-fired plants, to achieve
significant cost savings. Next steps will include the conversion of the Bogue power station from
oil to gas by August 2016. In addition, the government has approved the construction of
Jamaica’s first natural gas-fired power plant, a 190MW facility to be built and operated by JPS,
and to be completed by 2018. Several renewable energy projects are also under way.



We will prepare a plan to ensure that all public entities (central government, local government,
and public bodies) meet their financial obligations in a timely manner.

24.
Labour market reforms are progressing. In the context of the recently launched
Comprehensive Labour Market Reform Agenda, a Labour Market Reform Commission and
Secretariat was established and became operational on April 1, 2015. The Commission has been
reviewing policies and practices in the five thematic areas of education and training; productivity,
technology and innovation; labour policies and legislation; social protection; and industrial relations.
A first draft of recommendations will be submitted to Cabinet soon. Final recommendations will be
submitted by end FY16/17.

VI. REFORM OF SOCIAL SPENDING
25.
Efforts to strengthen the social protection framework are progressing. Implementation
of the graduation strategy for PATH households was reviewed by the World Bank in December 2015,
with recommendations on potential improvements. The graduation strategy will be submitted to
Cabinet by end-June 2016. The actual implementation of the strategy will start by September
2016.The government launched a comprehensive social protection strategy in July 2014; a
monitoring and evaluation framework has been developed.
26.
A national ID system (NIDS) will be rolled-out to all residents by 2020 which will
improve targeting of social spending. The first phase, which included the development of the
legislative and institutional framework and designing the NIDS ICT infrastructure, was completed
with IDB support. The second phase will begin in FY16/17 and will include the submission of the
NIDS policy to parliament by March 2017.
27.
We aim to improve the administrative efficiency of social protection programs. A
comprehensive plan for transition of PATH and NIS payments to retail electronic payment products
is expected by end-June 2016. Measures to deepen payment infrastructure in rural areas and
streamline procedures for collecting social payments are being identified.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understandings
between the Jamaican authorities and the IMF regarding the definitions of quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for the programme supported by the extended
arrangement under the EFF. It also describes the methods to be used in assessing the programme
performance and the information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets. In
addition, the TMU specifies the requirements under the continuous structural benchmark
concerning discretionary tax waivers.
2.
For programme purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities and flows will
be evaluated at “programme exchange rates” as defined below, with the exception of items
affecting government fiscal balances, which will be measured at current exchange rates. The
updated programme exchange rates are those that prevailed on December 31, 2014. Accordingly,
the exchange rates for the purposes of the programme are show in Table 1.

I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
3.
Definitions: The central government for the purposes of the programme consists of the set
of institutions currently covered under the state budget. The central government includes public
bodies that are financed through the Consolidated Fund.
4.
The fiscal year starts on April 1 in each calendar year and ends on March 31 of the
following year.

A. Cumulative Floor of the Central Government Primary Balance
5.
Definitions: The primary balance of the central government is defined as total revenues
minus primary expenditure and covers non-interest government activities as specified in the budget.
6.
Revenues are recorded when the funds are transferred to a government revenue
account. Revenues will also include grants. Capital revenues will not include any revenues from
asset sales proceeding from divestment operations. Central government primary expenditure is
recorded on a cash basis and includes compensation payments, other recurrent expenditures and
capital spending. Government-funded PPPs will be treated as traditional public procurements—the
associated costs will be recorded as on-budget investment during the construction phase of the
project. Primary expenditure also includes transfers to other public bodies which are not self-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

91

JAMAICA

financed. Costs associated with divestment operations or liquidation of public entities, such as
cancellation of existing contracts or severance payments to workers will be allocated to current and
capital expenditures, accordingly.
7.
All primary expenditures directly settled with bonds or any other form of non-cash
liability will be recorded as spending above-the-line, financed with debt issuance and will
therefore affect the primary balance.
8.
To kick-start economic growth, the following growth-enhancing projects will be added
to primary expenditures, accommodated by the 0.5 percent of GDP reduction in the central
government primary surplus target for FY2016/17: Rural Economic Development Initiatives
(REDI), Rehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure (NIC), Islandwide Flood Damage Mitigation &
Vector Control, Road Rehabilitation Project II, Major Infrastructure Development Programme (MIDP),
Support to SMEs Sector, Support to PIMC Pipeline Projects, Contingency for Natural
Disaster/Infrastructural Rehabilitation, BPO Expansion – Portmore and Montego Bay, Fiscal
Administration Modernization Programme (FAMP), Strategic Public Sector Transformation Project,
Jamaica Foundations for Competitiveness & Growth, Expansion/upgrading of educational
Institutions Infrastructure, Education System Transformation Programme, Major Rural Farm Roads
Rehabilitation, Drought Mitigation Programme in Farming Communities.
9.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.

B. Cumulative Floor on Overall Balance of the Public Sector
10.
Definitions: The public sector consists of the central government and public bodies. Public
bodies are institutional units that are themselves government units or are controlled, directly or
indirectly, by one or more government units. Whether an institution belongs to the public or private
sector is determined according to who controls the unit, as specified in the government Financial
Statistics (GFS) Manual 2001––Coverage and Sectorization of the Public Sector. For the purposes of
the programme, the assessment of whether an entity belongs to the public or the private sector will
be based on the guidance provided by the GFS criteria.
11.
Public bodies consist of all self-financed public bodies, including the 17 “Selected
Public Bodies” and “Other Public Bodies.” The 17 “Selected Public Bodies” include: Airport
Authority of Jamaica (AAJ); Human Employment and Resource Training Trust (HEART); Jamaica
Mortgage Bank (JMB); Housing Agency of Jamaica (HAJ); National Housing Trust (NHT); National
Insurance Fund (NIF); Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ); National Water Commission (NWC);
Petrojam; Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica (PCJ); Ports Authority of Jamaica (PAJ); Urban
Development Corporation (UDC); Jamaica Urban Transit Company Ltd. (JUTC); Caymanas Track Ltd.
(CTL); National Road Operating and Constructing Company Ltd. (NROCC); Petro-Ethanol; Clarendon
Aluminum Production (CAP);. “Other Public Bodies” include: Road Maintenance Fund; Jamaica
Bauxite Mining Ltd.; Jamaica Bauxite Institute; Petroleum Company of Jamaica Ltd. (Petcom); Wigton
Windfarm Ltd.; Broadcasting Commission of Jamaica; The Office of Utilities Regulation; The Office of

Commission; Aeronautical Telecommunications Ltd.; Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority; Jamaica
Ultimate Tire Company Ltd.; Jamaica Railway Corporation Ltd.; The Firearm Licensing Authority; Ports
Management Security Corps Ltd.; Transport Authority.
12.
The overall balance of public bodies will be calculated from the Statement A’s
provided by the Public Enterprises Division of the Ministry of Finance and the Planning
(MoFP) for each of the selected public bodies and the group of the other public bodies as
defined above. The definition of overall balance used is operational balance, plus capital account
net of revenues (investment returns, minus capital expenditure, plus change in inventories), minus
dividends and corporate taxes transferred to government, plus net other transfers from government.
For the particular case of the National Housing Trust and the House Agency of Jamaica, capital
account revenues will not be netted out since they do not refer to flows arising from assets sales but
rather to contribution revenue and therefore will be included among recurrent revenue such as is
done for pension funds. The definitions of “Selected Public Bodies” and “Other Public Bodies” will be
adjusted as the process of public bodies’ rationalization, including divestments and mergers,
advances. However, this process will not affect the performance criterion unless specifically stated.
All newly created entities, including from the merging of existing entities, will be incorporated in
either of these two groups.
13.
The overall balance of the public sector is calculated as the sum of central government
overall balance and the overall balance of the public bodies.
14.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than 6 weeks after the
test date.
15.
Adjuster: The floor for the overall public sector balance (cumulative since the beginning of
the fiscal year) will be adjusted downward (upward) by an amount equivalent to the shortfall (excess)
of PetroJam’s overall balance (relative to baseline projections in Table 2), with the value of the
adjustment at the end of any quarter capped at J$3.5 billion.

C. Ceiling on the Change in the Stock of Central Government Direct Debt
16.
Definitions: Central government direct debt includes all domestic and external bonds and
any other form of central government debt, such as supplier loans. It excludes IMF debt. It includes
loan disbursements from the PetroCaribe Development Fund to finance central government
operations. The target will be set in Jamaican dollars with foreign currency debt converted using the
programme exchange rate. The change in the stock of debt will be measured “below the line” as all
debt issuance minus repayments on all central government debt.
17.
For the purposes of computing the debt target, debt inflows are to be recorded at the
moment the funds are credited to any central government account.
18.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.
19.
Adjusters: The target will be adjusted upwards if explicit government guarantees (defined as
the stock of existing guarantees as of end March 2012 plus new guarantees allowed to be issued
under the programme) are called. The target will be adjusted downwards if net divestment revenues
(i.e. net of divestment expenses) take place. The debt target will be adjusted for cross-currency
parity changes; and pre-financing, as reflected by the increase in central government deposits.

D. Ceiling on Net Increase in Central Government Guaranteed Debt
20.
Definitions: Net increase in central government guaranteed debt is calculated as issuance
minus repayments of central government guaranteed debt, in billions of Jamaican dollars, including
domestic and external bonds, loans and all other types of debt. Foreign currency debt will be
converted to Jamaican dollars at the programme exchange rate. Central government guaranteed
debt does not cover loans to public entities from the PetroCaribe Development Fund. The
cumulative targets are computed as the difference between the stock of government guaranteed
debt as of end-March of each year and the stock of government guaranteed debt as of the target
date.
21.
The cumulative net increase in central government guaranteed debt will be monitored
on a continuous basis.

94

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

22.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.
23.
Adjuster: In the case where the central government debt guarantees are called, the stock of
central government guaranteed debt will be adjusted downwards in both the end-March of each
year and the target date in order to preserve the performance criteria.

E. Ceiling on Central Government Accumulation of Domestic Arrears
24.
Definition: Domestic arrears are defined as payments to residents determined by
contractual obligations that remain unpaid 90 days after the due date. Under this definition, the due
date refers to the date in which domestic debt payments are due according to the relevant
contractual agreement, taking into account any contractual grace periods. Central government
domestic arrears include arrears on domestic central government direct debt, including to suppliers
and all recurrent and capital expenditure commitments. This accumulation is measured as the
change in the stock of domestic arrears relative to the stock at end-March 2015, which stood at
J$21.3 billion.
25.
The ceiling on central government accumulation of domestic arrears will be monitored
on a continuous basis.
26.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.

F. Non-Accumulation of External Debt Payments Arrears
27.
Definitions: Consolidated government includes the central government and the public
bodies, as defined in sections A and B, respectively.
28.

Definitions: External debt is determined according to the residency criterion.

29.
Definitions: The term “debt”1 will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
i.
Loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds

1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

95

JAMAICA

and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
ii.
Suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
iii.
Leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property. For the purpose of the programme, the debt is the present
value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.
30.
Definitions: Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
31.
Definitions: Under this definition of debt set out above, external payments arrears consist of
arrears of external debt obligations (principal and interest) falling due after March 31, 2015 that
have not been paid at the time due, taking into account the grace periods specified in contractual
agreements. Arrears resulting from nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has
been agreed or rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded from this definition.
32.
The consolidated government and the BOJ will accumulate no external debt payment
arrears during the programme period. For the purpose of this performance criterion, an external
debt payment arrear will be defined as a payment by the consolidated government and the BOJ,
which has not been made within seven days after falling due.
33.
The stock of external arrears of the consolidated government and the BOJ will be
calculated based on the schedule of external payments obligations reported by the MoFP.
Data on external arrears will be reconciled with the relevant creditors and any necessary adjustments
will be incorporated in these targets as they occur.
34.

This performance criterion does not cover arrears on trade credits.

35.

The performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.

36.
Reporting: The MoFP will provide the final data on the stock of external arrears of the
consolidated government and the BOJ to the Fund, with a lag of not more than two weeks after the
test date.

96

JAMAICA

G. Ceiling on Central Government Accumulation of Tax Refund Arrears
37.
Definition: Tax refund arrears are defined as obligations on tax refunds in accordance with
tax legislation that remain unpaid 90 days after the due date. This accumulation is measured as the
change in the stock of tax refund arrears relative to the stock at end-March 2015, which stood at
J$21.7 billion.
38.
The central government accumulation of tax refund arrears will be monitored on a
continuous basis.
39.
Reporting: Data will be provided to the Fund with a lag of no more than four weeks after
the test date.

H. Floor on the Cumulative Change in Net International Reserves
40.
Definitions: Net international reserves (NIR) of the BOJ are defined as the U.S. dollar
value of gross foreign assets of the BOJ minus gross foreign liabilities with maturity of less
than one year. Non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into U.S.
dollar at the programme exchange rates. Gross foreign assets are defined consistently with the Sixth
Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) as
readily available claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They include
the BOJ’s holdings of monetary gold, SDR holdings, foreign currency cash, foreign currency
securities, liquid balances abroad and the country’s reserve position at the Fund. Excluded from
reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized or otherwise encumbered, claims on
residents, claims in foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currency vis-à-vis domestic
currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps and options), precious metals other than gold, assets in
nonconvertible currencies and illiquid assets.
41.
Gross foreign liabilities of the BOJ are defined consistently with the definition of NIR
for programme purposes and include all foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents,
including commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures,
forwards, swaps and options) and all credit outstanding from the Fund (including credit used
for financing of the FSSF, but excluding credit transferred by the Fund into a Treasury account
to meet the government’s financing needs directly. In deriving NIR, credit outstanding from the
Fund is subtracted from foreign assets of the BOJ regardless of its maturity.
42.
Reporting: Data will be provided by the BOJ to the Fund with a lag of no more than five
days passed the test date.
43.
Adjusters: NIR targets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in
programme loan disbursements from multilateral institutions (the IBRD, IDB and CDB) relative to the
baseline projection reported in Table 3. Programme loan disbursements are defined as external loan
disbursements from official creditors that are usable for the financing of the consolidated
government. NIR targets will be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

97

disbursements of budget support grants relative to the baseline projection reported in Table 3. NIR
targets will also be adjusted upward (downward) by the surplus (shortfall) in IMF budget support
purchases relative to the baseline projection reported in Table 3.

tax waivers, the granting of new discretionary waivers is subject to a de minimis cap’ of
J$10 million in any month.

100 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

54.
For the purpose of this condition, discretionary waivers are defined as: any reduction
in tax or customs duty payable, effected through the direct exercise by the Minister of
Finance of his powers under the various tax statutes; in circumstances where there is no express
provision for exemption in any statute.
55.
The amounts covered under the cap would exclude tax measures related to
international treaties not yet ratified and provisions for CARICOM suspensions which are
binding international legal obligations.

IV. CONDITIONALITY ON USER-FUNDED PPPS
56.
Under the continuous structural benchmark regarding the total loan value of all new
user-funded PPPs, the total value of all such loans contracted after May 1, 2013 will be
capped at 3 percent of GDP on a cumulative basis over the programme period. At end-June
2014, the total loan value of existing user-funded PPPs contracted after May 1, 2013 was zero.
57.
For the purpose of this condition, the loan value of a PPP may be excluded if the
Office of the Auditor General has established that the PPP involves only minimal contingent
liabilities (by demonstrating that the project has no debt guarantee, demand or price
guarantees or termination clauses that could imply a transfer of liabilities to the government).
58.
For the purpose of this condition, the applicable GDP is the projected nominal GDP for
the fiscal year published in the Fiscal Policy Paper tabled in parliament ahead of the adoption
of the budget. For FY2015/16, the projected nominal GDP used as a reference is J$1,690 billion, as

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Jamaica’s de facto exchange rate regime is classified as “crawl-like”, based on a standardized
classification methodology, and de jure as floating. The external value of the Jamaican dollar has
been determined in an interbank market operated by commercial banks beginning
September 17, 1990. The Jamaican dollar has depreciated significantly since that time. At May 12,
2016 it was trading at around J$124.36 to the U.S. dollar. Jamaica has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Last Article IV Consultation and Program Relations:
Jamaica four-year, SDR 643.70 million (235.4 percent of quota) Extended Arrangement under the EFF
was approved by the IMF Executive Board on May 1 2013, and the first ten reviews under the
program were completed on schedule. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board in June 2014.
A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Jamaica (BoJ) was completed in August 2013, with respect
to Jamaica's EFF. The assessment found that the bank has relatively strong safeguards in place,
particularly in the financial reporting and audit mechanisms. Annual financial statements continue to
be prepared and audited in accordance with international standards and improved Audit Committee
oversight is reflected in the development of the internal audit function. While oversight of the bank
was bolstered by the filling of Board vacancies during 2012, the assessment found a need to further
strengthen governance arrangements at the BoJ including through amendments to certain legal
provisions in the BoJ Act. Consistent with the safeguards assessment recommendations, in
December 2013 the government and the BoJ finalized a Memorandum of Understanding to clarify
the treatment of past BoJ cash losses and to formalize the policy of not distributing unrealized

valuation gains to the government. In February 2014, the MOU was amended to recognize plans to
settle an outstanding balance relating to prior years and to formalize the policy of not distributing
unrealized profits to the government. A proposal for further strengthening BoJ governance, taking
into account the safeguard assessment recommendations, is expected to be submitted to Cabinet
by September 2016.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of April 30, 2016)
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Jamaica was discussed by the World
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on April 29, 2014, following extensive consultations with
stakeholders. The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Jamaica in creating the conditions for
sustainable and inclusive growth over the period 2014-2017. The strategy is fully aligned with the
government’s National Development Plan ‘Vision 2030 Jamaica’ and aims to provide selective
solution oriented support in three strategic thematic areas: (i) public sector modernization;
(ii) enabling environment for private sector growth; and (iii) social and climate resilience. The
strategy has a focus private sector-led growth and increased competitiveness with the view to
unlock Jamaica’s growth potential while it continues to build on successes in social protection,
education, urban security and climate resilience. The IFC will work with the private sector and
collaborate with the Bank on the regulatory and private-public partnership issues to strengthen
Bank Group synergies in Jamaica and will place special emphasis on PPPs. The program will also
benefit from strong coordination with other development partners.

A. Projects
The Jamaica Integrated Community Development Project was approved in March 2014 for
US$42 million. The development objective is to enhance access to basic urban infrastructure and
services, and contribute towards increased community safety in selected economically vulnerable
and socially volatile inner city communities of Jamaica. The project will finance four components
over six years.
The Jamaica Foundations for Competitiveness and Growth Projects was approved in July 2014 for
US$50 million. The project will help to strengthen the business environment in Jamaica for private
sector investment. Key initiatives include (i) improving the competition-related business environment;
(ii) facilitating private investment including in strategic infrastructure assets and (iii) supporting SMEs
in high-potential supply chains to increase their capabilities.
The Strategic Public Sector Transformation Project was approved in July 2014 for US$35 million.
The project’s objective is to strengthen public resource management and support selected public
sector institutions in facilitating a more enabling environment for private sector growth.
The Youth Employment in Digital and Animation Industries Project was approved in July 2014 for
USD$20 million. The project taps into Jamaica’s creative industries as its aim is to support youth
employment in the digital and animation industries.
The Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project was approved in February 2016 for US$30
million. The project seeks to enhance Jamaica’s resilience to disaster and climate risk by improving
disaster preparedness and response, and reducing risk of key infrastructure failure as a result of
natural hazards.

JAMAICA

The Jamaica Social Protection Project (SPP) was approved in May 2008 for US$40 million, with an
additional financing of US$40 million approved in January 2014. Recognizing the government’s
budget constraints, the additional financing will continue to provide support to the most vulnerable
under a well performing project. The Jamaica Social Protection Project will: (i) further improve the
effectiveness of the Program of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) in order to
foster investment by poor families in human capital accumulation; (ii) develop a structured system for
assisting working-age members of PATH eligible households seek and retain employment; (iii) enable
the formulation of a reform program for the public sector pension schemes; and (iv) develop a
holistic social protection strategy.
The Jamaica Rural Education Transformation Development Initiative (REDI) was approved in
September 2009 for US$15 million. The objective of REDI is to improve market access for rural micro
and small-scale producers of agriculture and tourism products, as well as, other service providers.
The Jamaica Early Childhood Development Project (ECD) was approved in May 2008 for
US$15 million with additional financing of US$12million approved in February 2014. The additional
financing will help to scale up activities under the ECD project while endorsing the objectives of the
ECD National Strategic Plan and enhancing the impact of a well performing project. The revised
development objectives are to: (i) improve parenting education and support programs; (ii) improve
monitoring of children’s development, the screening of household level risks, and the risk mitigation
and early intervention systems, (iii) enhance the quality of early childhood schools and care facilities;
and (iv) strengthen early childhood organizations and institutions.
The Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement Project was approved in March 2011 for
US$15 million. The Project’s overarching objective is to support the implementation of the
Government Energy Policy, particularly the goals of enhancing Jamaica’s energy security and
efficiency by: (i) reducing energy costs; and (ii) reducing the country’s high dependence on imported
petroleum products. The project is expected to assist in improving Jamaica’s competitiveness.
IFC supported investments has a current portfolio of US$166.1 million with a focus on infrastructure,
energy and access to finance. The introduction of local currency instruments through an IFC bond
issuance will further leverage IFC resource mobilization capacity.

B. Advisory Services and Trust Funds
In addition to the aforementioned projects, the Bank also provides technical assistance and grant
funding to Jamaica. Currently, grants and trust funds under implementation approximate
US$20.2 million. Technical assistance complements investment financing in areas such as disaster
risk management, public investment management, creative industries, and investment climate.
IFC investment and advisory services continue to increase in Jamaica with investments in the
financial, telecommunications and energy sectors. Advisory services have been provided to support
the Government of Jamaica’s tax reform agenda in addition to focusing on improving the
investment climate, increasing Public-Private Partnerships and providing value chain support in the

diversification of the country’s energy mix, improve access to finance, especially to for the SME
sector, as well as expand the support to the agricultural sector by increasing Jamaican food exports.

project. MIGA will continue to encourage private sector development and facilitate inward foreign
direct investment.

C. Economic and Sector Work
Between FY2014–FY16, the following knowledge products have been delivered to the Government of
Jamaica and have formed the analytical underpinnings of Bank operations:

development priorities in the financial sector, including access to finance, housing finance, capital
markets, payment systems and remittances, financial literacy and consumer protection.
Recommendations included the development of a financial inclusion strategy.
Report on Observance of Standards and Codes-Accounting and Auditing – The report focused on
three primary strategic objectives: (1) Facilitate in making Jamaica's business environment more
conducive to private investment. (2) Supporting the governance agenda in Jamaica. (3) Facilitate
Regional integration on accounting and auditing matters. The review identified the strengths and
weaknesses in accounting and auditing practices that influence the quality of the country’s financial
reporting. It used International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Standards on
Auditing (ISA) as benchmarks, and draws on international experience and good practices.
Parliamentary Oversight of Public Finances-An Institutional Review – A review of the capacity of
the Jamaica Parliament to play its role in the oversight of the public finances was conducted. The
report looked at the key weaknesses in performing oversight of functions by the two key committees
such as, the Public Accounts Committee and Public Administration and Appropriation Committee. The
report also includes recommendations for developing the oversight capacity of the Parliament.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 1, 2016)
Jamaica joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1969. Since then, the IDB has
approved 116 loans to Jamaica amounting to almost US$3 billion and 220 technical cooperation
operations totaling US$88.2 million. IDB financial assistance has supported a wide range of
infrastructural, environmental and social sector projects with a view to enhancing Jamaica’s human
resource and absorptive capacity and strengthening the foundation for private sector-led growth. In
addition, the IDB has supported reforms aimed at strengthening the institutional and regulatory
environment.
The IDB is the leading lender to Jamaica among multilateral development partners. As of March
2016, Jamaica’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$1.56 billion, of which US$58.4 million were
loans to the private sector. The total represents 17% of public external debt and 46% of multilateral
debt (including the IMF).
Starting in 2004 there was a drastic reduction in the fiscal space needed to disburse existing Bank
loans. As a result part of the portfolio was cancelled and no new loans were approved between 2004
and 2008. The new administration that took office in 2007 intensified Jamaica's reform program and
emphasized a policy of expanding IFI financing for its development program.
This ushered in a new generation of Bank lending to Jamaica. The IDB approved eight new loans for a
total of US$405 million for Jamaica in 2008, including a US$200 million loan to increase private bank
lending to the real sector; a US$60 million policy based loan for improving public financial
management; US$50 million for road rehabilitation; US$30 million for education reform; a
US$30 million policy based loan for competitiveness; US$14 million for primary schools; US$11 million
for youth at risk; and US$10 million for rebuilding infrastructure damaged by floods.
This upward trend continued in January 2009 when the Bank approved two more loan operations: a
US$300 million liquidity program to protect the real sector from lost credit lines; and a
US$15 million social safety net program. In September 2009, a US$70 million loan was approved to
expand the highway network and a US$25 million for a citizen security and justice program and
US$10 million for road improvement.
The Bank provided unprecedented support to the country in 2010 as part of a broader financial
support from multilateral financial institutions in support of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF.
In February 2010, the Bank approved 3 policy based loans and 1 hybrid PBL/investment loan for a total
of US$215 million. The areas of intervention were the same as the previously approved PBLs (public
financial management, education and competitiveness) and a PBL focused on human capital
protection. During the second half of the year the Bank approved an investment loan to support

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

competitiveness in the agricultural sector US$15.0 million, as well as two phases of a new policy based
program totaling US$400 million aimed to support fiscal consolidation.
Because of the macroeconomic deterioration following the stalling of the SBA in 2011, IDB support to
Jamaica decreased. The Bank disbursed US$131 million in 2011 and US$69.6 million in 2012. Because
of the stabilization of the economy and in support of the Extended Fund Facility with the IMF, the
Bank’s support increased in 2013 with disbursements totaling US$101 million. Disbursements totaled
US$194 million and US$203 million in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
In 2013, the Bank disbursed US$101.4 million, including US$60 million in budget support in the area
of public financial and performance management. Another US$295 million in budget support was
approved in calendar years 2014 and 2015, supporting the areas of competitiveness, education and
fiscal reform. During 2013 to 2015, four investment loans were approved totaling US$105 million to
support public sector efficiency, citizen security, climate change and social protection. In addition,
one operation is programmed for approval in calendar year 2016 totaling US$15 million, which will
support the Government of Jamaica in continuing Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation efforts
through the retrofitting of government facilities with energy efficient equipment and infrastructure.
This operation could also benefit from JICA co-financing support in the amount of US$15 million.
As of May 1, 2016, the Bank’s portfolio consisted of 9 active investment loans1 valued at
US$348.0 million, another 6 investment loans valued at US$100.6 million are exiting the portfolio in
2016 and there are 27 non-reimbursable technical cooperation valued at US$57.7 million. Forty-six
percent of the IDB loan resources and twenty-seven percent of the TC funds have been disbursed,
leaving US$228.2 million available for disbursement.

Disbursements reached a low point of US$12.5 million in 2005, but have rebounded ever since. They
doubled to US$25 million in 2006, and reached US$34 million in 2007. Due in large part to policybased lending in 2008 and the approval of the liquidity program in 2009, total disbursements rose
dramatically to US$144.2 million, and US$151.5 million in those years respectively. The figures for

Country Strategy with Jamaica
The current Country Strategy focuses on supporting efforts to reestablish fiscal sustainability,
maintain social stability, and promote private-sector led growth. This will be realized through
lending and technical assistance in the following priority areas: (i) Fiscal Sustainability; (ii) Social
Protection and Safety; and (iii) Financial Sector & Business Climate. To mitigate fiscal and social
impacts posed by extreme climatic events, Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change
Adaptation will be a cross-cutting theme.
Country Systems
In keeping with the agenda to improve and use national systems the Government of Jamaica, with
the support of multilateral institutions and bilateral donors has prepared a wide range of studies in
different areas, including a joint World Bank and IDB, Country Financial Accountability Assessment
and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CFAA/CPAR) in 2005, and a Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Report (PEFA) in May 2007. Following the recommended actions of those
reports, the IDB and the Government agreed on the main areas of the local fiduciary systems for
financial control and procurement procedures that needed to be strengthened, and the IDB went on
to provide resources to finance development and reform activities stemming from the CFAA/CPAR,
with non-reimbursable technical cooperation funds. Furthermore, in order to ascertain progress

JAMAICA

made in recent years and to determine eligibility to audit IDB-funded projects a follow-up
assessment of the Office of the Auditor General of Jamaica was undertaken during a mission fielded
in the third quarter of 2010.
Since 2007, Jamaica has developed a comprehensive handbook, more concrete regulations defining
its public procurement including a procedure for managing contractual disputes, enhanced
accessibility of information, separation of the Office of Contractor General and the National
Contracts Committee, as well as creating national standard bidding documents. Although the
national procurement system conforms to established principles of procurement based on
international standards, some outstanding issues remain to be resolved. With the agreement of the
Government of Jamaica, the IDB would undertake an update of the latest country assessment of the
national procurement system to identify (a) the improvements in the pertinent aspects of the
country procurement system, and (b) the readiness to rely on Jamaica’s national procurement
systems for Bank-financed projects with a view to adoption of procurement country systems. Ideally,
this work can be accomplished together with the World Bank. In addition, the IDB PRODEV facility
and the PFPM Programmatic PBL will also support the introduction of performance-based budgets
and accrual accounting. The Multi-lateral Investment Fund (MIF) will also promote better access by
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to public procurement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of May 16, 2016

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In early
2003, Jamaica started participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS),
which provides participants with a framework for the development of the statistical system.
Key websites for statistics on Jamaica:
Bank of Jamaica:

http://www.boj.org.jm/

Ministry of Finance and Planning:

http://www.mof.gov.jm/

Planning Institute of Jamaica:

http://www.pioj.gov.jm/

Statistical Institute of Jamaica:

http://www.statinja.com/

National Accounts: The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) provides quarterly and annual
data on GDP by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure and income (both in
current and constant prices). GDP by expenditure and income was first published in 2014. STATIN
is currently working on quarterly demand-side GDP data and expects to disseminate the data in
2017. Progress has been made including through updating the base year for the national
accounts data in constant price terms from 2003 to 2007, but weaknesses remain, including dated
surveys for household expenditure (2004/5). A new household expenditure survey is expected to
start in 2017. Addressing the shortcomings in national accounts has been hindered by a lack of
resources. Assistance on national accounts methodology has been provided by Statistics Canada,
STA, and CARTAC.
Price statistics: Jamaica (with assistance from the IMF Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Center, CARTAC) revised its consumer price index (CPI) series in 2007. The CPI revision updated
expenditure weights of the CPI that had dated from 1984. The new CPI weights are based on a
household survey conducted in 2004–05. In addition, the STATIN compiles and disseminates the
producer price index (PPI) on a monthly basis covering mining and manufacturing industries (base
2005 =100). There are plans to improve the scope of the PPI by covering other industries like
agriculture, electricity, gas, services, etc.
Government finance statistics: Budgetary central government operations and public debt data
(with the exception of non-guaranteed debt by public entities) are updated on a monthly basis.
The demand side of GDP is not available at high frequency, making it difficult to assess the fiscal
policy stance. Also, data on operations of public entities outside the consolidated fund (which
includes all public bodies that are fully financed through the state budget) are only available with

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAMAICA

lag of more than a month, making the assessment of the overall balance of the public sector
challenging.
Government finance statistics are available at:
Debt: http://www.mof.gov.jm/dmu/
Budget: http://www.mof.gov.jm/programmes/em/fpmu/default.shtml

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics published by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) are
sectorized, classified, and valued in accordance with international standards, and are provided to
the Fund for the most part in a timely manner. The BOJ initiated the submission of monetary and
financial statistics based on standardized report forms in March 2007. Financial sector statistics
outside of the banking system have improved substantially, but some gaps remain.

Balance of Payments: The BOJ reports quarterly balance of payments (BOP) and international
investment position (IIP) in the format of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), and monthly International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity data to STA. In addition, the BOJ participates in the World Bank’s Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database with data on Gross External Debt Position. The quality
and dissemination of external sector statistics has significantly improved; however, there are
shortcomings for direct investment data and the coverage of nonfinancial sector needs to be
further improved. External debt data does not include intercompany debt.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since February 28, 2003.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data on industrial production, wholesale or producer prices, import volumes, or export and
import prices have been reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) in
recent years.
Detailed annual balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) data are reported
by the BOJ for publication in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and the IFS. In
September 2007, Jamaica reported for the first time IIP data to STA; annual IIP data since 2005 are
now available in BOPSY and IFS. Currently, information on deposit money banks and monetary
authorities is being reported on a regular basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by James Allison Haley, Executive Director for Jamaica,
Michael McGrath, Alternate Executive Director, and Trevor Lessard, Advisor
June 17, 2016

We thank the staff for their report and their constructive engagement with our Jamaican
authorities. While the review of Jamaica’s EFF needed to be reasonably delayed to allow for free
and fair democratic elections, the process and its outcome has not changed Jamaica’s strong
track record under this program. The elections ushered the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) into
power on a mandate that consisted of unwavering support for the Fund-supported adjustment
program and a redoubling of efforts to jumpstart private sector-led growth, which remains
disappointing. With the vitality of a new administration and a mandate to deliver strong,
sustainable, and job-rich growth, the Government of Jamaica is well positioned to continue the
reform agenda. For the eleventh and twelfth reviews all performance criteria and structural
benchmarks have been met.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Management
Our authorities remain resolute in maintaining a strong fiscal position, anchored in the
extraordinarily high primary surplus of 7 percent of GDP. While arduous, and entailing
significant opportunity cost, our authorities believe that fiscal discipline is an important anchor to
economic stability and investor confidence. A strong primary balance is also essential in order
for Jamaica to meet the Government’s commitment to bring debt-to-GDP down to 60 percent by
2026. Nevertheless, given the overall tightness of the fiscal stance, and the lack of fiscal space,
the new Government of Jamaica is placing extra attention on improving the efficiency of public
expenditures and making the tax system more growth friendly.
A key plank of the Government’s fiscal strategy is to improve the growth-friendliness of the
tax system by deliberately shifting some of the tax burden from productive inputs,
particularly labor, to indirect taxation. The 2016/17 budget represents a sizeable move in this
direction with the announcement to more than double the exemption threshold for personal
income tax from its current level of J$592,800 to J$1,500,096 in a two-step process. With the
help of Fund’s TA, the 2016/17 tax reforms will structurally improve the tax system and, in a
revenue-neutral way, encourage employment, job creation, and reduce informality in the labor
market. Our authorities wish to emphasize that this tax shift is not a one-off action, but is part of
a larger effort to improve the efficiency and growth-friendly nature of the tax system. With the
help of their international partners, including the Fund, World Bank, and IDB, the authorities
intend to systematically and responsibly overhaul the system so that it better incentivize
investment and job-creation while still providing the Government of Jamaica the revenue it
needs to provide essential public services.

2
This landmark tax policy shift will be complemented by ongoing efforts to improve debt
management, reduce the public sector wage bill to 9 percent of GDP, privatize public
entities to reap efficiency gains and lower public debt, and modernize the public sector. Our
authorities share staff’s view that unsustainable public sector wages and debt have in the past
crowded out critical public investment and eroded investor confidence. They agree that failing to
bring the public wage and debt service bills down to sustainable levels will stunt growth, and
without robust growth, social consensus for structural reforms will wane.
Generating More Robust Rates of Growth
Our authorities welcome staff’s focus on growth in this year’s Article IV consultation,
especially the inclusion of Annex II that examines growth drivers and constraints. Reducing
crime, improving the quality of services delivered by the public sector, reducing electricity costs,
and improving access to finance are all critical ingredients to growth identified by staff in their
Annex and are areas emphasized by the Minister of Finance during his presentation of the budget
to Parliament. While recognizing that some, or even most, of the benefits of these reforms will
not materialize until later in the medium-to-long term, my authorities are somewhat more
optimistic than staff that some of the dividends of structural reforms can be captured more
quickly if the government consistently implements its reform agenda and investor confidence
continues to build.
Our authorities share staff’s view that delays in implementing these reforms will negatively
affect Jamaica’s economic growth prospects, which is why they have created the new
Economic Growth Council. The Council has an ambitious goal, to raise GDP growth to 5
percent in four years, which will require a combination of structural reforms, public sector
modernization, and the implementation of several large investment projects in energy and
infrastructure. To support this work, the Council has been mandated by the Prime Minister to be
comprised of public and private sector participants, have a Secretariat to support its work, and
will be given the latitude necessary to drive important growth-oriented projects and proposals.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
The Bank of Jamaica continues to operate in a complicated environment, anchored in the
objective of price stability and a market-determined exchange rate. Our authorities share the
view that monetary transmission should be improved and continue to implement technical
reforms that will assist in achieving that objective. The Bank of Jamaica also stands ready to
further loosen the monetary stance if conditions warrant and if it does not threaten financial
stability or exacerbate the problem of increasing dollarization.
Our authorities are disappointed with the slow pace of the discussion on correspondent
banking relationships and call on the Fund to play a more active role within the
international financial community in resolving this issue, which now affects several dozen

3
Fund members. While weaknesses in AML/CFT have and will continue to be addressed, it is
important to stress that a strong AML/CFT regime is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for
maintaining macro-critical correspondent banking relations. While Jamaica has been less
affected than many EMDCs by the trend in globally active banks to scale back their
correspondent banking relationships, our authorities are nevertheless aware of the magnitude of
the risk and the lack of clarity from regulators and stakeholders on what is required to maintain
this important relationship. The Fund can play an important role in advocating on behalf of its
many members around the globe that have been affected and highlight how economically costly
the loss of banking relationships can be. The Fund is uniquely placed to not only summarize the
depth of the problem, but also play a supportive role, along with other bodies and multilateral
institutions, in developing solutions. We welcome the commitments in the Managing Director’s
Work Plan to deepen our understanding of the causes, and possible solutions, to de-risking and
the thoughtful analysis that has been included in the Article IVs of some systemically important
jurisdictions. There seems widespread agreement that more work needs to be done and that the
discussion in Jamaica’s Article IV, which is narrowly confined to improving AML/CFT and
prepare for (risky and untested) interventions by the central bank, will need to be broadened if
we are to get at the root of the problem.
