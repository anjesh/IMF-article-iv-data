Context and recent developments. Peru’s economic expansion is the longest on record and inflation
remains among the lowest in the region. The impact from the global crisis has been moderate, but high
dollarization poses risks. The outlook for 2009 is favorable, but with heightened downside risks.

•

Key policy recommendations and authorities’ views. There was broad agreement on the need to
preserve prudent policies in light of the deteriorating external environment and on advancing reforms
to sustain high growth and poverty alleviation. Fiscal policy would allow for automatic stabilizers to
operate and public expenditure would continue addressing infrastructure and social needs. Monetary
policy would aim at ensuring that inflation converges within the target range of 1–3 percent by end2009. A deeper impact from the global crisis would allow for cautious countercyclical policies,
consistent with the authorities’ recently announced plan. Recent prudential measures and financial
sector reforms should promote orderly financial deepening and crisis preparedness. Broadening the tax
base, enhancing the quality of public spending, and further strengthening of the policy framework are
also priorities. Further trade liberalization and administrative simplification would help reduce
informality and enhance labor productivity, essential to entrench poverty alleviation.

Relations with the Fund
•

Arrangement. A 25-month SBA for SDR 172.37 million (27 percent of quota) was approved on
January 26, 2007. The authorities treat it as precautionary. The Executive Board approved the third
review of the SBA on July 23, 2008. Peru’s has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and its exchange rate regime is classified as a managed float.

•

Program implementation. All performance criteria for end-June and end-September 2008, as well as
the continuous ones, were observed. Inflation exceeded the upper limit of the program’s consultation
band mechanism in September and December. Structural benchmarks have been met, except for the
issuance of guidelines to assess tax exemptions (end-June), the implementation of the Treasury Single
Account, and the submission to Congress of amendments to the Decentralization Law to reconcile
subnational government spending (both end-September).

Discussions. Conducted by M. Cerisola (Head), M. Gonzalez, M. Garcia-Escribano, M. Kaufman (all
WHD), M. Goretti (SPR), G. Gasha (MCM), and D. Leigh (FAD) in Lima (December 2–13, 2008), and
assisted by L. Breuer, resident representative. Staff met with Central Bank President Velarde, Minister of
Finance Valdivieso, and Prime Minister Simon. O. Hendrick (OED) participated in the discussions.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The 2008 Article IV Consultation and Fourth (and final) review under the SBA
takes place against a backdrop of strong macroeconomic performance but sharply
deteriorating global conditions. With the Fund-supported program coming to an end, the
consultation provided a good opportunity to highlight accomplishments in recent years, as
well as the policy challenges and risks going forward.

Inflation has risen but remains low by regional standards. Headline inflation was
6.7 percent in 2008, above the 2 percent target (+/- 1 percent band), mostly driven by
higher food and fuel prices. However, pressures broadened, with core inflation
(excluding food and fuels) rising from 1.5 percent at end-2007 to 4¼ percent at end2008.

Steady fiscal surpluses and declining public debt vulnerabilities. The nonfinancial
public sector surplus is projected at 2.1 percent of GDP by end-year—entailing an
expansionary fiscal stance, largely as a result of a significant increase in public

5
investment and 0.6 percent of GDP in repayment of liabilities under the Fuel Price
Stabilization Fund (FEPC). Fuel subsidies have been eliminated through adjustments
to the band price and the sharp decline in imported fuel prices, while excise taxes on
selected domestic fuel prices have been raised markedly (Box 1). Public debt has
been reduced from about 33 percent of GDP in 2006 to 25 percent of GDP in 2008.
The share of foreign currency denominated public debt has declined to almost
60 percent, the public sector has become a net external creditor, and the sovereign
was granted investment grade by Fitch and Standard & Poor’s in April and July 2008,
respectively (Box 2).

The economy is more open, with a better business climate and declining poverty.
Peru has been liberalizing external trade through tariff reductions in recent years and
has also been seeking enhanced market access through new bilateral agreements. To
complement the approval of the PeruPeru: Average effective tariff rate

2.
The economy has been moderately affected by the global financial crisis thus far.
Strong fundamentals, along with several measures implemented have helped limit the
contagion from the global financial crisis, preserve adequate liquidity conditions in domestic
financial and capital markets, and bolster domestic confidence in the economy. In particular:

6
•

Limited financial contagion. After tripling to above 620 basis points in late October,
sovereign spreads have eased to around 455 basis points more recently and equity
prices have recovered somewhat, but are still 60 percent lower than at end-2007.
Following US$8.5 billion in foreign exchange purchases earlier this year, the central
bank sold US$6 billion since September, to limit market volatility and contain
pressures on the Nuevo Sol, which has depreciated by 5.8 percent against the U.S.
dollar. Facing tight liquidity, reduced capital inflows, and a steepening of the
government yield curve, the central bank has held policy rates unchanged since
October, but eased reserve

2/ Regarding local banks' short-term USD-denominated obligations, the BCRP established a 35 percent ceiling to the average RR.

•

Banks have remained resilient, and a “credit crunch” is being avoided. After
growing at about 30 percent in the year to September, credit to the private sector
accelerated in October, particularly for the corporate sector, partly as a result of
tighter financing faced abroad and in domestic capital markets. Large official
reserves—which stood at $31 billion at end-December and strong financial soundness
indicators for the banking system, along with banks’ limited reliance on external
funding (at about 15 percent of total assets and two-thirds of long-term nature) have
helped preserve stable liquidity conditions.

•

Dollarization has rebounded in recent months after declining markedly over the
past two years. The share of dollar denominated deposits has risen markedly since

7
September, reflecting portfolio shifts associated with concerns on the global financial
crisis. Stress tests suggest that banks are better prepared to face a currency
depreciation, while corporates and households also seem less exposed to currencyrelated risks (Box 2). Nonetheless, a potentially sudden and sharp depreciation could
still bring strains to balance sheets and confidence, and revert the trend in
dedollarization.

Peru’s performance under the SBA has been good. All quantitative performance
criteria for end-September were met, but inflation exceeded the upper limit of the
program’s consultation band for end-September and end-December (see attached
letter from the authorities). With data yet to be released and no evidence that the
performance criteria will not be met, the authorities are requesting a waiver of
applicability for the end-December 2008 quantitative performance criteria. End-June
and end-September structural benchmarks were also met, except for the issuance of
methodological guidelines to assess tax exemptions, the implementation of the
Treasury Single Account (TSA) and the submission to Congress of amendments to
the Decentralization Law to reconcile subnational government spending limits with
those for the central government as presented in the Fiscal Responsibility and
Transparency Law (FRTL). The timing of implementation of these reforms is
uncertain.

Medium-term prospects are favorable and require preserving prudent
macroeconomic policies and dealing with long-standing structural challenges. With
heightened risks stemming from the global economy, preserving the high quality of
macroeconomic policies is necessary to sustain high growth, low inflation, external stability,
and poverty alleviation. Peru has become a more open economy, and continued capital
deepening should enhance productivity and potential output growth—estimated by staff at 6–
6½ percent, to generate strong

Against the backdrop of sharply deteriorating external conditions, the domestic
economic outlook for 2009 still remains favorable, but with risks on the downside. The
pace of economic growth is expected to slow to 6 percent in 2009—owing to the impact of
the global slowdown, lower terms of trade, and tighter financial conditions on net exports and
private investment. With global price disinflation already underway and imported food prices
expected to decline by 3½ percent in 2009,

A more severe and prolonged
global slowdown could also extend
downside risks into 2010. With almost
50 percent of exports to the United States,
Europe, and Japan, a deeper and more
protracted global slowdown—especially if
accompanied by a sharp deceleration in
large emerging market economies in Asia,
brings further downside risks. An
illustrative staff scenario suggests that Peru
would be vulnerable to a sharper-thananticipated fall in external demand and

commodity prices accompanied by a further tightening of financing conditions, lower foreign
direct investment, and higher risk aversion. This could bring real GDP growth down to 4–
5 percent. Moreover, under such scenario, a marked depreciation of the currency, could
promote dollarization, strain the economy’s balance sheets and lower official reserves below
comfortable levels. In these circumstances, the current adequate level of official reserves and
the recently announced government plan would provide an important buffer to preserve
significant economic growth, external stability, and poverty alleviation (Annex 1).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
6.
Discussions took place against a backdrop of heightened global uncertainty and
with the economy showing incipient signs of deceleration. Discussions focused on the
policies that could help shield the economy from a further deterioration in the global
environment, while helping to preserve the strong economic performance over the medium
term. In particular:
•

Achieving a “soft-landing”. The policies to respond to the global crisis and risks of a
sudden and sharp slowdown to preserve macroeconomic stability.

•

Strengthening the financial system and sustaining an orderly deepening. The key
reforms to ensure that financial deepening proceeds in an orderly manner and
markets improve their resilience to external shocks.

•

Further solidifying the policy framework. Reforms to consolidate the fiscal
framework, minimize fiscal risks, and strengthen the inflation targeting framework.

•

The poverty alleviation strategy and other structural reforms. Reforms to strengthen
the effectiveness of social programs and further steps simplify business procedures
and lessen regional disparities.
A. Achieving a Soft-Landing

7.
The authorities stressed the need to preserve the prudent policy strategy of
recent years. 1 They recognized that the still strong economic underlying momentum
provided an important buffer to face the global slowdown and financial crisis. However, they
remained concerned that a sharp and sudden deceleration in domestic private demand—that
could be precipitated by a sharp fall in commodity prices, domestic confidence, and potential
disruptions in the financial system—could compromise a “soft landing”. Therefore, the
conduct of fiscal policy in 2009 would be geared toward allowing for automatic stabilizers to
operate in full, while several of the measures contemplated in the anti-crisis plan would be

immediately implemented. Most notably, the authorities have extended the execution of
public investment projects budgeted in 2008 through March 2009 and boosted resources

balance between achieving a soft landing and addressing infrastructure and social needs
would imply a more prudent expansion of public spending. This would entail achieving a
neutral fiscal stance for the year as a whole—equivalent to an overall surplus of 0.7 percent
of GDP. The authorities expected that some of the intrinsic difficulties in executing spending
would likely bring fiscal policy close to a neutral stance.

In coordination with fiscal policy, monetary policy would continue to balance the
disinflationary effects from the deteriorating external environment with the need to
preserve adequate liquidity conditions.

was likely to intensify in the coming

months, as declining global food and fuel 0.5
prices had yet to be fully passed onto
domestic prices. 2 The authorities were
confident that recent reductions in reserve
requirements would preserve stable liquidity conditions and ward off the economy from a
sharp and sudden slowdown in domestic demand. They also noted that disinflation dynamics

12
could prove more severe, given some inventory build-up in specific sectors. Therefore, the
authorities were committed to continue monitoring closely the path of domestic demand and
inflation expectations, noting that, if needed, there could be scope for further easing of
monetary policy by lowering reserve requirements. Staff agreed with this assessment and
policy approach, and emphasized the importance of taking advantage of the expected global
disinflation to bring domestic inflation promptly to the target. Staff also noted the risk that,
with strong credit growth, the path of domestic demand could prove more resilient in the near
term and delay somewhat the disinflation process.
9.
Were the impact of the global crisis to intensify, the authorities and staff agreed
that there would be some scope for cautious countercyclical policies. Staff stressed that
the still strong underlying economic momentum and several of the measures implemented by
the authorities seemed sufficient to buffer the economy from the global slowdown. However,
should downside risks intensify and materialize, further reductions in reserve requirements
and policy interest rates, along with further fiscal easing, reflecting automatic stabilizers,
should be the first line of defense. The authorities and staff agreed that a prudent fiscal
stimulus should be carefully considered and paced, if the impact of the crisis were to extend
to 2010, and provided it could be financed with government savings accumulated in recent
years. 3 The authorities agreed with the need to proceed cautiously, as the scope for
implementing countercyclical fiscal policy has traditionally been limited, and despite
improved fundamentals in recent years, it could otherwise compromise the hard-won fiscal
credibility. They stressed that such course of action would be consistent with the measures
announced in the anti-crisis plan.

Discussions. The authorities stressed the uncertainty of these estimates associated
with the considerable structural changes in the economy—such as the recent trade
liberalization and labor market reform—and their implications for external stability
going forward. Their own time series estimates suggested that the Nuevo Sol would
be close to equilibrium, but ranging on average from an undervaluation of 4 percent
to an overvaluation of 6 percent, reflecting the different impact of changes in terms of
trade and labor productivity under different methodologies.

B. Strengthening the Financial System and Sustaining an Orderly Financial Deepening
11.
Financial soundness indicators show that banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and
with provisions exceeding nonperforming loans for all credit segments. 5 Recent stress
tests conducted by the Superintendency of Banks (SBS) also confirmed that the banking
system has gained resilience to market, credit, and exchange rate-related risks. Nonetheless,

sharp deterioration of
the economy and market risks. 6 The authorities and staff agreed that banks’ provisions—at
about $1 billion (25 percent of their capital) provided an important buffer to a potential
significant slowdown in the economy and deterioration in asset quality, without significantly
jeopardizing the comfortable level of capitalization. 7

5

Fitch’s October 2008 Banking System Risk Report, assessed the banking system potential vulnerability to
macro-prudential risks as low (similar to Panama), with its intrinsic quality—which is derived from Fitch’s
individual bank ratings—also deemed to be low, but typical of emerging markets.
6

Microfinance institutions account for 6 percent of total assets of the financial system and have a CAR of about
23 percent.

7

As of end-October, microfinance institutions provisions represented 29.6 percent, and 32.0 percent of capital
for Cajas Municipales and Cajas Rurales, respectively.

practices. The authorities noted that
banks had already begun to tighten lending standards, while the SBS established—effective
2009—more restrictive rules for granting credit card loans, as well as provisioning
requirements for all consumer loans, and introduced procyclical provisioning effective
December 1. 9 As a result, they felt that risks to asset quality would be contained, particularly
as banks were also expected to add most of their high profits expected for 2008 to their
provisions. Staff welcomed these measures, noting that it would be important to continue
monitoring the rapid expansion of nonperforming loans for consumer and microenterprise
loans, particularly as the pace of economic growth slows. 10
13.
The authorities noted that foreign-owned banks posed no systemic risks. They
noted that while foreign banks represented almost half of the banking system’s assets, they
continued to rely mostly on domestic funding. In addition, the SBS continued to monitor
closely—through the provisions provided by memoranda of understanding with foreign
supervisory agencies—the offshore operations of domestic financial conglomerates that
could be more exposed to the global financial crisis. To address this risk and others related to
large exposure to riskier operations (such as consumer and retail activities), staff encouraged
the authorities to consider requiring financial institutions to increase their capital base,
preferably with Tier-I contributions, as needed. The close monitoring of smaller banks and
larger microfinancial institutions was also important, given their weaker risk management
practices and potential contagion on other small financial institutions.

8

In Peru, commercial loans past due 15 days are treated as nonperforming, compared with 30 days in most
countries. In addition, the treatment of restructured loans—which payments have been rescheduled—has been
aligned with international accepted practices in 2007.

9

With the implementation of procyclical provisioning, the authorities amended the accounting rules for
financial institutions to avoid incompatibilities with the international accounting standards (IAS 39).

14.
The authorities and staff agreed that the ongoing reform agenda should enhance
the economy’s resilience to global financial shocks:
•

Crisis Preparedness. Intervention rules in cases where a bank experiences losses of
50 percent of capital have been clarified, with intervention triggered when such losses
occur within a 12-month period. A Coordination Committee comprising senior
officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the SBS has been
established to strengthen the framework for providing liquidity to all financial
entities. The group has been exploring several mechanisms, including the possibility
of establishing a trust fund that would allow private financial institutions to exchange
high quality portfolio for a new credit-enhanced instrument issued by the trust fund,
and potentially funded by the central bank. The authorities emphasized that such an
instrument would facilitate access of smaller financial institutions to the central
bank’s safety net. The authorities were also exploring the possibility of relying on the
Deposit Insurance Fund (FSD) as a complementary mechanism of liquidity
provision—via the acquisition of portfolio. For solvency issues, the legal framework
of the FDS already allows the provision of assistance through credit lines from the
Ministry of Finance. Staff noted that these measures would help minimize systemic
risks, and needed to be complemented by a well-established mechanism to protect the
central bank’s balance sheet. It would be important to recapitalize the FDS over the
coming years through contributions by financial institutions.

•

Proceeding with the gradual implementation of Basel II as envisaged. Amendments
to the General Banking Law and Organic Law of the SBS were approved by Congress
on June 22, 2008. As a result, minimum capital requirements for credit, market, and
operational risks will be introduced in line with Basel II. The minimum regulatory
capital adequacy ratio will be raised from 9.1 percent to 9.5 percent in June 2009 and
to 10 percent by 2011. Requirements for treating subordinated debt as Tier 2 capital
have also been strengthened relative to standard international practice. Diagnostic

16
Fund-World Bank missions confirmed that the authorities are well placed to
implement Basel II gradually.
•

Strengthening and expanding the operations of micro-finance institutions (MFIs).
The authorities submitted legislation to Congress in late August 2008 to increase
minimum capital requirements for microfinance institutions (end-June structural
benchmark). 11 The new legislation was approved by Congress’ Banking Commission
in mid-September and now awaits plenary approval. The authorities have recently
passed legislation that allows these institutions to engage in securitization and fixedincome product operations, including the purchase of central bank securities (which
could be used as collateral for LOLR support) permitting their direct participation in
the payments system (subject to central bank approval). The authorities emphasized
that they had enough flexibility to accommodate the expansion of these operations
with minimal risk.

•

Aligning the supervisory framework of public banks with that of private banks. The
market share of Peru’s public financial institutions has remained contained—mostly
as a result of the growth of private sector participants. Staff encouraged the
authorities to give full priority to bringing all public financial institutions fully under
the supervisory umbrella of the SBS, as envisaged by draft legislation currently
stalled in Congress.

15.
The authorities agreed that promoting competition and strengthening the
regulatory framework for domestic capital markets should help consolidate recent
reforms. New financial instruments have begun to emerge—such as long-term, fixed-rate
mortgage lending in domestic currency and mortgage securitization—while issuance of
private fixed-income instruments in Nuevos Soles has increased. The authorities also raised
the limits of pension funds’ investment abroad to 30 percent of total investments last May,
paving the way for further diversification. Opening competition to other institutions, further
streamlining their investment limits, and improving the coordination among public agencies,
would best serve these goals. The authorities intend to continue implementing reforms
related to the pension funds' minimum return guarantee and investment limits, and capital
market supervision, with MCM TA during 2009.

11

Minimum capital for Cajas Rurales y Municipales would be raised to US$1.3 million (from US$0.3 million),
and to US$ 0.8 million (from US$0.3 million) for Edpymes. All existing institutions will have 2 years to
increase their capital to the new minimums once the law is approved by Congress.

C. Solidifying the Policy Framework
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that the inflation targeting framework should
remain focused on preserving low and stable inflation. They noted that their strategy in
dealing with strong short-term capital inflows through higher reserve requirements earlier
this year had been appropriate in buffering the inflation targeting framework from the risks to
financial stability posed by large short-term capital inflows. The authorities felt that current
global financial conditions were now more propitious to reduce reserve requirements and to
rely on the policy interest rate as an instrument to control inflation. However, they stressed
that they would not hesitate in relying on such instrument again, to contain excessive credit
growth and risks posed by dollarization. Staff also encouraged them to prioritize
Congressional approval of the constitutional amendment delinking the appointment of the
central bank president and board

intervention has helped both build an adequate reserve buffer and contain the risks associated
with large swings in the exchange rate. There was also agreement that in the current context
of heightened global uncertainties, the timing for greater flexibility was less favorable given

18
the risks of stimulating excessive volatility and dollarization. 12 Staff encouraged the
authorities to issue regulations for the tax treatment of derivatives, critical to bolster market
incentives for hedging and to support a gradual increase in exchange rate flexibility.
18.
The authorities agreed on the need to strike a better balance between mediumterm fiscal sustainability and cyclical factors. Staff encouraged the authorities to begin
preparing for a structural fiscal rule that would formalize the broadly neutral fiscal stance of
recent years and strengthen the credibility of fiscal policy by ensuring a balanced budget over
the economic cycle. The formal adoption of such a rule could be gradual and brought
explicitly into the budget process before it is formalized. Staff suggested establishing and
independent expert panel to help alleviate the authorities’ concern on the difficulties in
assessing the stage of the economic cycle when implementing such rule. Going forward, they
agreed on the need to adopt a medium-term expenditure framework and remained committed
to introducing multiannual budgeting in 2010.
19.
Several reforms would also help strengthen the fiscal policy framework,
particularly to minimize fiscal risks in the face of external shocks. Specifically:
•

Higher public expenditure quality. Staff emphasized the importance of maintaining
an appropriate balance of risks between the public and private sector in initiatives
involving private sector participation in the provision of public services, including
infrastructure. In this context, staff highlighted the risks posed by the new Build and
Transfer program 13 and suggested close monitoring. Regional SNIP offices have been
established (end-December 2008 benchmark), to provide further impulse to public
investment in regions and municipalities. These efforts are being complemented with
the expansion of performance budgeting to 9 sectors in 2009—from 5 in the 2008
budget. The authorities also agreed that further reforms to the FEPC—including an
automatic price band—would help minimize fiscal risks of renewed subsidies. Staff
also suggested the possibility of liberalizing fuel prices over the medium term.

•

Enhancing the budget coverage and accounting. It was agreed that new
extrabudgetary funds, while still small in size, have proliferated in recent years and
could be better integrated into the budget documents. Also, the new fiscal accounting
rules for the PPPs have yet to be fully implemented. The fiscal accounting rules for
the recently approved Build and Transfer program have yet to be defined as well.

12
13

A Selected Issues Paper explores empirically the central bank’s motives for intervention.

The program allows the subnational government to contract private companies for investment projects in
exchange for credit certificates against future income tax liabilities. The ceiling for project contracts by each
SNG is roughly equal to the aggregated canon transfers for concept of mining revenues of the last two years.

19
•

Improving the consistency of the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law
(FRTL). There is a need to reconcile expenditure limits with those for subnational
governments (SNGs) in the Decentralization Law (DL) (end-September structural
benchmark), as well as to ensure that the granting of specific-exemptions to such
limits are prohibited under the law and not subject to Congressional discretion. The
authorities did not see scope to amend the DL in the near term and preferred to do so
once a well-defined timetable for decentralization is agreed upon.

20.

Despite significant progress, broadening the tax base remains a key challenge:

•

Tax revenue-to-GDP is at its highest since 1980. At 18.3 percent of GDP in 2007,
this ratio remains below many countries in the region—and is still largely dependent
on mining-related revenue, which represents a quarter of total central-government
revenue. The authorities were in the process of implementing the 2007 tax reform, to
begin taxing capital income and gains in 2009, although they did not rule out some
delays. They recognized that recent reforms to simplify VAT procedures for small tax
payers may undermine efficiency gains. 14 The authorities agreed that it was also
important to continue enhancing tax administration. 15 The new Customs Law
preserves its administrations at SUNAT, critical for exploiting synergies between
customs and domestic tax collection. They also agreed that it was important to restore
fuel excise taxes to 2004 levels in the period ahead, particularly for the most
environmentally noxious.

14

In particular, the new regime loosens the requirements to apply for VAT credit, while expanding the
registration period to one year. These changes may create an incentives to request increased VAT devolutions
and drawbacks during a economic slowdown, while delaying VAT receipts accruing to SUNAT.
15

Efforts should focus on streamlining audit procedures and quality, and setting noncompliance targets for tax
audit and arrears collection.

•

Staff encouraged the authorities to proceed with the reform of tax exemptions
planned for March 2009. Draft methodological guidelines for the assessment of all
existing tax exemptions (end-June 2008 benchmark) under the new regime had been
approved and the authorities intended to issue them shortly. However, they noted that
advancing this reform may prove politically challenging. One particular example was
the recent Congressional passage of a two-year-delay (to 2013) of the replacement of
exemptions of VAT and fuel and excises with direct budget transfers in the Selva
region.

21.
The authorities and staff agreed that decentralization needs to proceed while
carefully assessing fiscal risks. The authorities continued to assess the fiscal
decentralization process, initiated in 2002. The devolution of functions to subnational
governments proceeded in 2008 and pilot programs had been initiated for decentralizing
primary health and primary education. However, the laws that would clarify responsibilities
across government levels had yet to be issued to avoid duplication or loopholes in the
provision of services. 16 Staff stressed the need to evaluate the quality of public spending
under the new National System of Public Investment (SNIP)

16

The Organic Law of the Executive Power of December 2007 did not address the expenditure assignments
among levels of governments, but instead, indicated that the shared responsibilities would be determined in the
laws of organization and functions of each ministry.

21
D. The Way Forward on Poverty Alleviation
22.
While satisfied with the progress made in alleviating poverty, the authorities
recognized the need to persevere with their efforts. They stressed that the strong economic
performance and rising formal employment, along with more prioritized spending on social
assistance programs, have
been important contributing

23.
Other important reforms are needed to sustain poverty alleviation. Despite the
progress, social assistance programs—including those related to education and health
(universal programs)—continued to face significant targeting challenges. The authorities
were well aware of these problems, and noted that their effectiveness was also impaired by
difficulties in ensuring an adequate supply of public services. Therefore, they decided to link
2009 budgetary allocations to concrete improvements in several large targeted social
programs. For this, and to strengthen their effectiveness, they intend to finalize
comprehensive reviews of such programs, including Glass of Milk, by March 2009. The
conditional cash transfer program Juntos would also be subject to a review, with assistance
from the Interamerican Development Bank and the World Bank, to better articulate its
capacity to deliver public services. Staff encouraged the authorities to also assess and reform
universal programs on health and education, in line with the strategy presented in the March
2007 poverty reduction strategy. While the authorities agreed with the need to reform
universal programs, they indicated that it would be politically difficult, and emphasized that
their efforts would continue to be focused on improving their quality through performance
budgeting.

1/ Targeting performance of a social program is calculated as the ratio of poor beneficiaries to
total beneficiaries divided by the percentage of poor in the total population. Poor includes
extreme poor and non-extreme poor households. Poverty rates were 44.5 in 2006 and 39.2 in 2007.

The authorities were also well aware of the risks posed by increasing regional
disparities. Despite declining poverty, regional disparities were likely to increase, reflecting
different resource endowments (in terms of economic structure and mining-related revenues)
and ability to deliver public services. The authorities viewed the need to begin laying the
ground for some form of equalization. As a first step, the 2009 budget increased the
resources in the Fund for Regional and Local Public Investment (FONIPREL) by
0.5 percentage points of GDP so that the poorest regions could bid for resources to close their
infrastructure gaps. Based on international experience, staff noted that further reforms would
be needed to better help fill the gap between the subnational governments' expenditure needs,
their revenue capacities, and the central government’s transfers. 17
24.

E. Enhancing the Business Environment, Institutions, and Competitiveness
25.
Considerable progress has been made to enhance the business environment. The
authorities recognized that, according to World Bank indicators, Peru continues to lag other
investment grade economies on establishing a conducive business environment, particularly
in view of existing costly procedures for opening and closing businesses and for construction
permits, for tax payments, and external trade. They noted that, therefore, efforts have and
will remain focused on advancing reforms in key three areas:

Modernizing and simplifying procedures. The Positive Administrative Silence Law
has been in effect since 2008, and a one-step window for external trade is being
implemented to facilitate the Peru-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. In addition, an egovernment pilot project has been established that would allow the six more

Further trade liberalization. The authorities stressed that significant progress has
been made in recent years in adding new external markets, with about two-thirds of
external trade (exports) to be covered under bilateral free trade agreements. They
stressed that these agreements should continue to provide the private sector with an
important window to continue diversifying exports, particularly in light of the
weakening global conditions.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Peru’s strong economic performance owes much to prudent macroeconomic
policies and reforms under the favorable external environment of recent years.
Sustained fiscal surpluses have been the backbone of this success, supported by a prudent
conduct of monetary policy, which while underpinned by inflation targeting, has also aimed
at carefully balancing risks associated with high dollarization. Important structural reforms
have been advanced to expedite public investment, reduce fiscal risks, enhance the resilience
and depth of the financial system and capital markets, enhance the business environment and
reduce poverty. These efforts have helped establish the basis for low inflation, reduced
vulnerabilities, sustained high economic growth and a sustainable improvement in living
standards, all of which have been recognized by the achievement of investment grade status.
27.
Macroeconomic policies need to remain prudent and focused on achieving a softlanding. This will entail the need to balance the risks associated with the global slowdown
and the economy’s underlying growth momentum. In the staff’s view, achieving a neutral
fiscal stance in 2009 would enhance macroeconomic stability and would provide room for
implementing key elements of the authorities’ anticrisis plan, such as the decision to extend
the execution of ongoing projects through March 2009, phase investment projects more
evenly throughout the year and boost resources under the Fund for Regional and Local Public
Investment (FONIPREL). This, along with the recent reductions in reserve requirements and
steady growth in credit to the private sector, should help buttress business confidence and
ward off the economy from a sharp and sudden deterioration in private investment and net
exports. It will be important for monetary policy to re-anchor expectations and reduce
inflation to the 1–3 percent range during 2009. At present, a more aggressive discretionary
set of countercyclical policies risks delaying some needed slowdown in domestic demand
and a potentially sharper deceleration later on, with an ensuing weakening of credibility and
more limited progress in reducing inflation.
28.
Were the global slowdown to be more severe and prolonged, the authorities
would be in a position to implement cautious countercyclical measures in the second

25
half of 2009. In particular, further reductions in reserve requirements and policy interest
rates, along with some fiscal easing reflecting the use of automatic stabilizers, could be the
first line of defense. The need for additional fiscal stimulus should be carefully considered
and paced, and in the staff’s view, a prudent stimulus could be financed with government
savings accumulated in recent years. This policy response would be consistent with the
authorities’ intentions, as presented in their anticrisis plan.
29.
The authorities’ focus on strengthening the financial system and sustaining an
orderly financial deepening is timely. Given the risks stemming from still buoyant credit
growth, staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to tighten prudential regulations on
consumer loans and the implementation of new procyclical provisioning rules. Reforms to
enhance the bank surveillance and intervention regimes, and to implement enhanced
capitalization requirements in line with Basel II are also welcome. Going forward, it will be
important to continue monitoring the growth in nonperforming loans, which may increase as
a consequence of the slowdown in economic activity. Priority should be given in 2009 to
enacting the increase in minimum capital requirements for microfinance institutions to
protect their strong capitalization, including for new entrants. The continued close
monitoring of foreign operations of domestic financial conglomerates is important in light of
the recent experiences and risks posed by the global financial crisis. To address risks related
to the large exposure of banks to riskier operations (such as consumer and retail activities),
there may be a need to requiring financial institutions to increase their capital base,
preferably with Tier-I contributions.
30.
Staff welcomes the coordinated action among government entities to strengthen
the framework for crisis preparedness. The ongoing actions and plans to ensure adequate
liquidity to the financial sector and capital markets constitute a key step to minimize systemic
risks. In the staff’s view, these actions need to be complemented by a well-established
mechanism to protect the central bank’s balance sheet. Staff encourages the authorities to
recapitalize the Deposit Insurance Fund over the coming years through contributions by
financial institutions. In addition, the supervisory framework for public financial institutions
should be aligned with that of private entities. It will be important to continue with reforms to
enhance the depth and resilience of the domestic capital markets, including by improving the
coordination for their oversight and enhancing competition for private pension funds.
31.
There is scope to further solidify the policy framework and the economy’s ability
to buffer shocks. To bolster the credibility of the inflation targeting framework further,
priority could be given to enacting legislation that delinks the appointment of the central
bank president and board members from the presidential cycle. In addition, the authorities’
decision to reduce reserve requirements to inject liquidity in the system would also help
strengthen the signaling of the policy interest rate. Staff is of the view that the stronger
macroeconomic fundamentals and improved balance sheets in the economy provide scope for
greater exchange rate flexibility ahead, as external conditions permit. For this, it will also be

26
critical to advance reforms that facilitate hedging in the economy, such as the issuance of
regulations regarding the tax treatment of derivatives.
32.
Efforts to strengthen the fiscal policy institutional framework have been
significant and need to continue. Reforms to minimize fiscal risks, including through the
issuance of a legal framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), and aligning the budget
classification with international standards are to be commended. Going forward, it will be
important to finalize the implementation of the TSA, implementing the recently approved
fiscal accounting rules for PPPs and issue the pertinent accounting norms for the Build &
Transfer program. It will also be important that the PPP framework and other initiatives
involving the private sector maintain an adequate balance of risks between private and public
sectors. Staff encourages the authorities to prioritize the alignment of the expenditure limits
in the FRTL and the Decentralization Law, in line with commitments under the program. At
the same time, the adoption of a structural fiscal rule would formalize the broadly neutral
fiscal stance of recent years and strengthen the credibility of fiscal policy by ensuring a
balanced budget over the economic cycle. The formal adoption of such a rule could be
gradual and brought explicitly into the budget process before it is formalized. In addition,
consideration should be given to making the price-band adjustment and settlement of
liabilities of the Fuel Price Stabilization Fund automatic, or even liberalizing fuel prices over
the medium term.
33.
Broadening the tax base remains an important challenge ahead. With Peru’s tax
system highly exposed to commodity revenues, it will be key to press ahead with reforms
that broaden the tax base, including the taxation of capital gains. It is also critical to proceed
with the 2007 reform of the tax exemptions planned for March 2009, including by issuing the
recently completed methodological guidelines for the assessment of such exemptions, in line
with program commitments. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to unwind fully the
reduction in fuel excise taxes implemented since 2004 in line with environmental
considerations. Efforts to protect the integrity of the tax administration and to strengthen
procedures need to be sustained.
34.
Sustaining poverty alleviation would require continued efforts to improve the
effectiveness of social programs. Staff welcomes the commitment in the 2009 Budget to
link allocated spending to concrete improvements in social programs, as well as the intention
to assess the successful cash transfer program Juntos and other large social programs, to
strengthen their effectiveness further. It will also be important to garner support to assess
universal programs, in line with the poverty strategy of March 2007. Regional disparities
remain a challenge, and the expansion of the Fund for Regional and Local Public Investment
(FONIPREL) and the methodological changes to the allocation coefficients of Regional
Compensation Fund (FONCOR) are welcome steps that need to be complemented by reforms
toward institutionalizing an equalization scheme.

27
35.
Much has been accomplished in enhancing the business environment, and
further efforts are underway. Staff welcomes the implementation of the Micro and Small
Business law, an important step towards reducing informality. Efforts to promote trade
liberalization, could be complemented with further administrative simplification and reduced
costs for the business environment.
36.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth (and final) review and inflation
consultation under the SBA, as well as the authorities’ request for a waiver of applicability
of end-December performance criteria, given Peru’s strong performance under the program.
37.
It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation will take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. Fuel-Price Stabilization—Fiscal Cost and Social Distribution
With persistently rising international fuel prices, the Fuel-Price Stabilization Fund
(FEPC) has stabilized domestic fuel prices over the past two years. Firms that keep prices
within an official wholesale price band set by the authorities receive compensation for the gap
between the band and an import-parity reference price formula. The authorities also reduced
specific fuel excises to limit the pass-through to domestic retail prices.

indicate official price band above international reference price. Volume shares
based on annual sales.

The fiscal cost of the fuel-price subsidies reached a peak in July 2008, when the cost for
the year was projected at 1.4 percent of GDP. Of this cost, 1.2 percentage points of GDP
corresponded to the pure fuel-price subsidy, and 0.2 percentage points to ad-valorem tax
revenue foregone due to lower retail prices. In addition, the annual fiscal cost of fuel excise tax
cuts during 2004–08 was estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP, bringing the total 2008 cost of fuelprice stabilization policies to 1.9 percent of GDP. The average fuel-price increase required to
eliminate the subsidy peaked at 45 percent (Table 1).
The rising cost of fuel subsidies and their poor targeting led the authorities to implement
several measures. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) concluded that fuel-price
subsidies in Peru were poorly targeted, with the richest 20 percent of households receiving over
eight times the subsidies received by the poorest 20 percent. The intuition for this finding was
that richer households tend to consume a large share of fuel and final goods that use fuel as an
intermediate good. In response, the authorities increased the official FEPC price band under in
January, March, June and August 2008 by a cumulative 28 percent. They also made
adjustments to the import-parity price formula to ensure that it did not overstate true import
costs, and began unwinding the specific excise tax cuts in November, when these taxes were
more than doubled. However, the weighted average of fuel excises would need to increase by a
further 26 percent to reach end-2004 levels. With these measures, and the 50-percent fall in
fuel import prices from their peak, subsidies have been eliminated, and the FEPC price band is
now about 23 percent above the reference international price. With the FEPC now collecting
payments from domestic firms, the cost of the pure fuel-price subsidies is projected at
0.7 percent of GDP in 2008, of which 0.6 percentage points of GDP has already been paid by
the government.

Box 2. Balance Sheet Vulnerabilities
Peru’s overall external position has strengthened, but improvements differ across sectors. Between
end-2006 and mid-2008, the economy’s net international liabilities fell from 26¼ percent of GDP
(US$24.8 billion) to 23¼ percent

involved public debt repayments, an increase in public debt maturity, and a decline in the share of FX

undercoverage of FX-denominated deposits protected under the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF)—some
US$9.2 billion—as DIF resources represent only 2 percent of total insured deposits.

Banks can better withstand currency-related shocks, but remain subject to dollarization risks.
While credit dollarization remains high at 56 percent, the de-dollarization process has contributed to a
reduction of the FX induced credit risk stemming from unhedged borrowers. However, with banks
having reduced their net FX asset positions over the past year, a depreciation of the Nuevo Sol would

and January 1991 to February 2006 respectively.

The corporate sector has improved its net foreign position in recent years, particularly at the
short-end. Available data on 120 nonfinancial firms suggest that as of end-2006, the average firm held
net total short-term FX-denominated assets for about US$3 million, compared to net short-term
liabilities for US$6 million in 2003. Improvements were also reflected in the case of nonexporting firms.
The vulnerability of households’ balance sheets to exchange-rate shocks seems contained. Stress
tests on mortgage-market debtors based on end-2006 data (latest available) suggested that a depreciation
20 percent of the Nuevo Sol against the U.S. dollar would have raised the amortization burden on lowincome household by 5–6 percentage points—to nearly 35 percent.

30

Box 3. The Micro and Small-Sized Business Law
Peru’s strong economic performance has been accompanied by high levels of informality and
limited access to social benefits among micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). Data from
ENAHO 2006 shows that 60 percent of the Peruvian labor force works in enterprises with less than 50
workers, and many of these operate informally. High nonwage labor costs have been identified as one of
the key factors driving the informal economy in Peru. Nonwage labor costs, which include mandated
health and pension contributions, holiday bonuses, family assignments, and tenure bonuses amount to
72 percent of the basic wage in the general labor regime, compared to less than 30 percent in Chile and
Mexico. Informality hinders competition, productivity and economic growth since informal enterprises
do not benefit from trade liberalization or access to financing to invest in physical or human capital.
Further, workers operating in the informal sector are excluded from the benefits and rights incorporated
in the labor contracts and social systems.

The law for the promotion and formalization of MSEs approved in 2003 has not yielded the
expected results. In particular, this law established a special labor regime that lowers nonwage labor
costs of enterprises with less than 10 workers to 14 percent. However, this regime has not been attractive
to workers or employers since the health contribution is compulsory and fully financed by the employer,
while the pension affiliation is voluntary.
A legal reform to enhance the competitiveness, formalization and development of the small and
medium-sized enterprises was approved in June. Although the reform entails a fiscal cost—S/. 1,987
millions per year (equivalent to 0.5 percentage points of GDP) according to the authorities’ estimates, it
is expected that through formalization it raises the economy potential growth and lowers poverty. Key
features of the reform are as follows:
•

More labor incentives for micro-enterprises (those with less than 10 workers). In particular,
(i) affiliation to a health system will continue to be compulsory but cofinanced in equal amounts
by the employer and the government; and (ii) it establishes a volunteer pension contribution to a
portable individual pension account that will be managed by a private pension fund. Worker
contributions into the individual accounts will be matched by government contributions up to a
maximum, creating an incentive for voluntary savings. Affiliation to this pension scheme will
also grant the right to a disability pension and a pension for survivors.

•

Reduced nonwage labor costs for small-enterprises (those with less than 100 workers). Smallenterprises will benefit from reduced nonwage costs of about 41 percent. Social security and
pension affiliation are kept as compulsory, and other benefits such as life insurance, holiday
bonuses, tenure bonuses, and the right to union are also maintained.

1/ PIPP proceeds are included below the line.
2/ In 2007, the limit on the borrowing requirement of the combined public sector will be adjusted downwards by the amount central government revenues net of mandatory transfers exceed
program estimates of S/. 10,489 million at end-March, up to a ceiling of S/. 250 million; S/. 23,359 million at end-June, up to a ceiling of S/. 500 million; S/. 32, 807 million at
end-September, up to a ceiling of S/. 750 million; and S/. 44,821 million at end-December, up to a total ceiling of S/. 1,000 million. In 2008, the limit on the borrowing requirement of the
combined public sector will be adjusted downwards by the amount central government revenues net of mandatory transfers exceed program estimates of S/. 12,767 million at end-March,
up to a ceiling of S/. 450 million; S/. 26,493 million at end-June, up to a ceiling of S/. 900 million. No adjustors will be applied to the end-September 2008 nor to the end-December 2008
data when assessing the performance of the PSBR.
3/ The limit on the borrowing requirement of the combined public sector will be adjusted for the operating balance of the BCRP.
4/ The limit on the borrowing requirement of the combined public sector will be adjusted upward by up to US$100 million for capital spending by Petroperu, over the $30 million
already included in the program.
5/ The target for net international reserves will be adjusted upward by the amount by which net foreign borrowing of the nonfinancial public sector exceeds '-US$15 million at endMarch, -US$138 million at end-June, -US$274 million at end-September, and -US$148 million at end-December 2007. It will be adjusted downward for shortfalls from programmed
net foreign borrowing. The amounts in excess will be deposited at the BCRP.
6/ The target for net international reserves will be adjusted downward for withdrawals for portfolio management purposes of deposits held at the Central Reserve Bank by the
Consolidated Pension Reserve Fund (FCR) and any other funds managed by the ONP. This downward adjustment will not exceed US$300 million at any time in 2007.
7/ The limit will be adjusted upward by any amount of debt issued, and used in, debt-exchange operations, or for prefinancing of government operations.
8/ The current debt limits do not include contracting of non-guaranteed debt by Petroperu and will be adjusted upward by up to US$300 million for debt contracted by Petroper
during 2007.
9/ The limit on contracting and guaranteeing of nonconcessional public debt will be adjusted upwards for guarantees contracted or extended by the government in relation to
concessions, up to a ceiling of US$430 million for the year as a whole.
10/ Discount rates to calculate the NPV of the future stream of payments will be the currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD and
specified in the TMU.
11/ Should inflation fall outside the inner band, the authorities will discuss with the Fund staff the appropriate policy response. Should inflation fall outside the outer band, the
authorities will also complete a consultation with the Executive Board of the Fund on the proposed policy response before requesting further purchases under the arrangement.

ATTACHMENT I. INFLATION CONSULTATION LETTER
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
January 7, 2009
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
During 2008 inflation was considerably influenced by international food and fuel supply
shocks. In consequence, annual inflation reached 6.65 percent, above the upper limit of the
target range (1–3 percent). It should be noted that the joint price increase for food, fuels, and
electricity was 8.6 percent.
To prevent inflation expectations from affecting nonfood items, particularly in a context of
robust domestic demand, the Central Bank reinforced its anti-inflationary stance to ensure a
gradual return of inflation and inflation expectations to the target range. Accordingly, the
Central Bank increased the reference interest rate by 200 basis points, from 4.5 percent in
June 2007 to 6.5 percent in September 2008. This decision was complemented by increases
in reserve requirements on obligations in both domestic and foreign currency.
The global financial crisis worsened in the second half of September, creating high volatility
in international markets. Metal, fuel, and food prices dropped significantly; stock markets
plunged in a context of deteriorating market expectations; and emerging market currencies
experienced depreciation pressures. The resulting downward pressure on imported inflation
is expected to translate into lower domestic prices over the next months.
As the main developed economies fall deeper into recession, the Peruvian economy is
expected to decelerate. Growth is envisaged to decline from 9.3 percent in 2008 to
6.0 percent in 2009. At the same time, inflation expectations have started to ease, with a clear
downward trend expected over the next two years.
Under these circumstances, the Central Bank has kept its policy interest rate at 6.5 percent.
Additionally, in response to the financial system’s greater preference for liquidity in a
context of considerable market uncertainty, the Central Bank has provided adequate liquidity
through open market operations and reductions in reserve requirements. Official
interventions in the foreign exchange market have continued to be confined to smoothing
excessive exchange rate fluctuations in a context of financial dollarization.
The last Inflation Report envisages that inflation will return to the target range in 2009.
Inflation is expected to drop from 6,65 percent in 2008 (one of the lowest of the region) to
2,8 percent (within the target range) in 2009, driven by lower imported inflation, GDP

51
growth below potential (around 7 percent), and declining inflation expectations, in line with
the Central Bank’s commitment to the 1–3 percent target range.
Sincerely,

/s/
Julio Velarde
President, Central Reserve Bank of Peru

Note: The fan chart shows the probability of various outcomes for inflation over the forecast
horizon. The darkest band around the central forecast represents a 10 percent probability of
occurrence, and all bands together represent a 90 percent probability of occurrence.

52
ATTACHMENT II. IMPACT OF A SHARPER AND MORE PROLONGED GLOBAL SLOWDOWN
•

Real sector. Real GDP growth declines to 4 percent and 5 percent in 2009 and 2010,
respectively (compared to 6 and 6.8 percent in 2009 and 2010 in the baseline). Real
domestic demand growth decelerates by about 2 percentage points during 2009–2010
compared to the baseline, driven by weaker consumption and investment. Real GDP
growth is expected to rebound to 7 percent in 2011, stabilizing at its potential level of
6.5 percent of GDP in 2012–13, as in the baseline.

•

Exchange rate and prices. The average nominal exchange rate is assumed to
depreciate by an additional 6.2 and 8.4 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively,
relative to the baseline. Prices of major mineral commodities decline by 10 percent
compared to the baseline, implying a reduction on traditional export prices of
25 percent. This contrast with a reduction of 19 percent in the baseline, which is in
line with the WEO and authorities’ projections. End-of-year inflation is projected at
2.2 percent in 2009, reflecting a limited pass-through of commodity prices and the
exchange rate depreciation. By 2010, inflation declines to 2 percent, at the mid-point
of the inflation targeting range.

•

Fiscal policy. The decline in growth and the fall in mineral commodity prices lower
government revenue by 0.8 percent of potential GDP relative to the baseline. Nominal
government spending is assumed to remain unchanged, consistent with a neutral
fiscal policy stance. The overall combined public sector fiscal balance-to-GDP ratio
deteriorates by 0.8 percentage points from 0.6 percent of GDP in the baseline to 0.2 percent of GDP. The public debt-to-GDP ratio declines to 22.3 percent of GDP,
versus 21.7 percent of GDP in the baseline.

•

Current account. The current account deficit narrows from 3.3 percent in 2008 to
3.2 percent of GDP in 2009–10, led by a strong decline in exports as a result of the
decline in the price of mineral commodities, and significantly lower global real GDP
growth and domestic demand compared to the baseline scenario. Imports decline in
line with lower real GDP growth and oil prices. Foreign demand remains low in 2010
with a slow recovery towards the end of the year. The current account recovers to
2.5 percent in 2011, due to a rebound in foreign demand and despite a rebound in
imports, led by the implementation of delayed expansion projects in the traditional
sector.

•

Foreign direct investment. FDI is reduced on behalf of previously retained earnings
now being repatriated to their home countries. Retained earnings are assumed to
account for 60 percent of total FDI. In 2009, the crisis scenario assumes retained
earnings to fall by 80 percent compared to the baseline. This drop would bring
reinvested FDI in 2009 to about two times the 2001–03 average (which includes
episodes of negative retained earnings). In the hard-lending scenario, the remainder is

53
assumed to drop by 40 percent in 2009. FDI remain low in 2010 to recover to the
baseline levels in 2011. The lower reinvested earnings and corresponding returns
partly offset the decline in the trade balance during 2009–10.
•

Banks’ external medium- and long-term borrowing. It is assumed that US$200
million of the amortizations coming due in 2009 and 2010 are not rolled over.

•

Portfolio investment. In 2009, the crisis scenario includes around US$500 million in
outflows compared to the baseline. This includes outflows in investment by private
pension funds following the raise in their external investment limits. In 2010,
portfolio outflows decline but remain $150 million higher than in the baseline.

•

Other short-term capital flows. In 2009, US$2.1 billion are withdrawn, including
US$443 million of maturing CDs not rolled over; US$663 million of foreign deposits
(5 percent of total FX deposits), and US$1 billion of other liabilities. Continued
outflows for US$ 1 billion are assumed in 2010.

ATTACHMENT III. SURVEILLANCE DECISION—EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
In real effective terms, the Nuevo Sol has been recovering from its low level in recent
years. In October, the real effective exchange rate (REER) was 3 percent below its 1991–
2008 average. During 2004–07 the Nuevo Sol had been at its lowest level since it was
introduced in 1991 following Peru’s recovery from the crisis of the late 1980s. This decline
had been accompanied by a large accumulation of reserves. Nonetheless, since September, as
a result of market pressures from the global financial crisis, reserves have declined by US$4
billion as the exchange rate depreciated by about 5 percent.
CGER-type analysis suggests that the exchange rate is undervalued (by about 2–
7 percent). In particular, the macroeconomic balance approach shows an undervaluation of
7 percent in the real effective exchange rate, while the external sustainability approach
suggests the Nuevo Sol is undervalued by about 6 percent. Finally, estimates under the
equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests an undervaluation of 2 percent.
CGER-type estimates are subject to considerable

Calculations based on an alternative methodology for countries with large stocks of
nonrenewable resources confirm the CGER-type results. Using a stock approach
(Thomas, Kim, Aslam, 2008) for Peru based on copper as the sole nonrenewable resources
suggests an undervaluation of 7 percent. Uncertainties in this approach are linked to the
estimate of the stock of copper reserves, assumptions on the return on investment and the
discount rate, and the exclusion of other nonrenewable resources in the country.
Under the 2007 Surveillance Decision, the underlying current account balance is
defined as the medium-term level of the current account stripped of temporary factors
influencing the trade and income balances. The projected current account may differ from
the underlying current account for several reasons, including:

55
¾

Domestic output gap. Peru’s output above potential currently entails a higher level of
imports—and lower trade and current account balances—than a closed gap.

¾

Trading partner’s output gap. With output below potential abroad, Peru’s exports—
and trade and current account balances—are lower than at a closed gap.

¾

Commodity prices. Being a commodity exporter, if prices were to fall back to a
smoothed average, Peru’s trade and current account balances would deteriorate.

¾

Hydrocarbon prices. Being a net importer of hydrocarbon products, if prices did not
fall back to a smoothed average, Peru’s current account would be higher.

Peru’s underlying current account deficit is estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP compared
to a projection of 3 percent of GDP in 2009. With mining products representing two-thirds
of goods exports, lower longer-term commodity prices have the strongest effect on Peru’s
current account—some 0.9 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, this is more than offset by the
closing of trading partner’s negative output gap and Peru’s positive output gap. Peru’s
misalignment vanishes if this adjusted current account is used as the underlying current
account in the macroeconomic balance approach.

ATTACHMENT IV. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 19
Peru’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline considerably under the baseline debt
sustainability scenario. Economic growth would average close to 7 percent a year in 2008–
13 underpinned by a moderate fiscal surplus position. The public sector revenue-to-GDP
ratio is expected to decline by a cumulative 1.6 percentage points, reflecting the decline in
growth and mining government revenues. Under these assumptions, Peru’s public sector debt
stock (including CRPAOs) would decline from 30.9 percent of GDP at end-2007, to
13.6 percent of GDP by 2013.
Given that nearly two thirds of total external debt is public, in the baseline scenario the
projected drop in public debt largely determines the path of Peru’s total external debt.
Private external debt rose in 2007 as banks sought long term loans abroad to expand their
domestic business, but is projected to decline over the medium term as more financing
becomes available domestically. Given the recent declines in public external debt, total
external debt is projected to decline from 32 percent of GDP at end-2007 to 20 percent by
2013 (public external debt would decline from 20 percent to 10 percent over the same
period).
Peru’s external and public sector debt ratios are robust to alternative assumptions about
underlying macroeconomic variables. Sensitivity tests based on 10-year historical standard
deviations to form alternative medium-term assumptions for real GDP growth and interest
rates show that Peru’s debt dynamics are only moderately vulnerable to such changes.
Despite the increasing share of domestic currency in public sector debt, external and
public debt ratios remain sensitive to changes in exchange rate changes, given the high
foreign currency share of Peru’s debt. Specifically, under a one-off 30 percent real
depreciation of the exchange rate, the external debt-to-GDP ratio would shift by 6 percentage
points above the baseline projections in the medium term. This test assumes that the
exchange rate would remain at its depreciated level permanently—a scenario that could only
occur in case of the current exchange rate being significantly overvalued. Available data,
however, do not point to such an overvaluation. Noninterest current account shocks (such as
in the terms of trade) would have a moderate adverse impact on external indebtedness.
A similar pattern is observed under a 10 percent of GDP shock to the contingent liabilities
of the public sector: The public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise sharply in the short run and,
while declining over the medium term, would, by 2013 remain 9.3 percentage points above
the debt levels projected under the baseline scenario.
19

The DSA includes standard sensitivity tests around the baseline medium-term scenario. The methodology
used is in line with that endorsed in the Information Note on Modifications to the Fund’s Debt Sustainability
Assessment Framework for Market Access Countries, dated July 5, 2005.

Safeguards Assessments

An off-site safeguards assessment of the central bank in 2007 found that safeguards at the Banco
Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP) meet the requirements of the safeguards policy.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements
Peru maintains a unified, managed floating exchange rate. On November 5, 2008, the average of
interbank buying and selling rates was 3.07 Nuevos Soles per U.S. dollar. The exchange system is
free of restrictions, except for those maintained solely for the preservation of national or
international security, and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
Decision No. 144-(52/51). Those restrictions are maintain pursuant to UN Security Council
Resolutions 1267 (October 15, 1999) and 1373 (September 28, 2001). The central government
maintains external payments arrears to unguaranteed suppliers, some of whom are in discussions

3
with the government, while the rest have not been located. Peru has maintained a clearing
arrangement with Malaysia since 1991.

ANNEX II. PERU: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Bank Group strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is defined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on December 19, 2006. The strategy supports the government’s
developmental goals with emphasis on inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The agenda
includes programs addressing fiscal, national competitiveness, infrastructure and socialsector needs. The country strategy underscores partnerships, flexibility and results orientation
in public expenditure. The CPS projects financial assistance of up to US$3.5 billion between
July 2007 and June 2011 and envisages a flexible lending program that will include a
combination of two fast disbursing loans and three investment projects per fiscal year. The
strategy includes development policy lending operations in the fiscal, social, and
environmental sectors. The Bank is currently preparing a Progress Report for the CPS. While
this Progress Report takes into account the current financial crisis and adapts the Program
accordingly, the overall medium term vision continues to be relevant for Peru.
FY09 pipeline comprises five operations for a total of $1,405 million. It includes three DPLsDDOs in the fiscal, environmental, and social sectors for $1,370 million and two investment
lending operations for $35 million. The program for FY10–FY11 is being discussed with the
government in the context of the Country Strategy Progress Report, the global financial
crisis, and Peru's new financing needs.
In addition, the Bank has an extensive program of analytical and advisory activities for
FY09, including both economic and sector work and nonreimbursable technical assistance.
The economic and sector work covers areas such as public expenditure, labor markets,
infrastructure, gas development strategy, decentralization, social sectors, and housing and
municipal financing. Several multi-year nonlending technical assistance are currently in
progress, covering areas such as decentralization, governance and governability
enhancement, poverty monitoring, and performance informed budgeting. Additional
nonlending technical assistance in education and nutrition are planned for delivery in FY10.
Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
•

Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization. Fund staff has taken the lead in assisting in
the design of tax reform. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB, staff has worked on
drafting laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has also
focused on the design and implementation of decentralization of the social sectors and
pro-poor spending policies.

•

Financial Sector. A joint FSAP was completed in May 2001. Follow up technical
assistance to implement FSAP recommendations has been given by both institutions.
A joint FSAP update was completed in June 2005.

5
•

Public Sector Management. Bank-Fund collaboration has focused in the area of
results based budgeting, the implementation of a Treasury Single Account and
modernization of budget processes, institutions and information systems.

•

Customs Administration Modernization: A needs assessment mission was undertaken
together with the IMF to develop an action plan for modernizing customs
administration. The joint team presented a technical report to SUNAT.

•

Reform of the National Public Investment System (SNIP). The Bank has been working
in close collaboration with the authorities in reducing the institutional bottlenecks of
the public investment system. A joint WB-IADB mission took place in March 2007 to
revise current government procurement regulations. The Bank is also providing
technical assistance in the design of the framework law for Public-Private
Partnerships as well as in the implementation of FONIPREL.

ANNEX III. PERU: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Country Strategy
The Country Strategy for 2007–2011 continues the thrust of Bank assistance in areas relating
to competitiveness, social development, and modernization of the State, and reflects wideranging discussions of policies with the Government and with Peruvian society to identify
the constraints the country faces in achieving its development objectives.
The IDB supports Peru’s development agenda by deepening the country’s sustainable
economic growth and generating greater opportunities for the majority of Peruvians, through
efforts grouped into the following three strategic pillars: (i) strengthening Peru’s participation
in the global economy and enhancing competitiveness; (ii) promoting social development
and economic inclusion; and (iii) deepening the reform of the State and improving public
sector management.
Lending
As of November 30, 2008, the Bank’s portfolio of active, public sector operations consisted
of 25 loans for a total amount of US$833.8 million, of which US$197.7 million (23.7%) had
been disbursed. The public sector lending program for 2008 comprises a policy based loan
for US$130.0 million, an investment loan for US$25.0 million already approved and an
investment loan for US$ 15.00 million pending approval.
IDB’s Structured Corporate Finance Department’s portfolio in execution consists of eight Aloans for a total amount of US$799.6 million, and five credit guarantee operations for
US$165 million. These operations are focused primarily in the financial and natural gas
sectors. Private sector lending for 2008 includes two projects for US$75.0 million, which
have been already approved.
To assist Government efforts to de-dollarize the public sector debt, the Bank successfully
converted US$131.0 million of previously disbursed loans into local currency.
Considering recent financial market developments, the Government has requested to modify
18 loan contracts, converting their interest rates from variable LIBOR-based to fixed rates.
This change would capture currently available low long term rate, and a unique opportunity
to reduce volatility and debt service payments. This process is in its final step.

ANNEX IV. PERU: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for policy formulation,
surveillance, and program monitoring. Certain shortcomings occur in the datasets for national
accounts, prices and the external sector. Peru subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) in August 1996, and a data ROSC was prepared and published in 2003.
Real Sector and Prices
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of estimates are limited by the use of an
outdated base year for national accounts compilation and lags with the implementation of
methodological recommendations stemming from the System of National Accounts 1993. The
National Statistics Office (INEI), in consultation with international experts and STA, have
developed an action plan to update the base year to 2007 and address various other shortcomings
with data sources and statistical techniques to produce annual and quarterly national accounts; the
timeframe for implementation is 2008–11.
Prices Statistics: The national consumer price index (CPI) is affected by different consumer
basket coverage among its regional components. However, a number of new initiatives are
underway to address such methodological weakness. A new national Household Expenditure
Survey is scheduled for completion by April 2009, and will permit updating the base year for the
compilation of the CPI as well as more robust estimates of household final consumption for
national accounts’ purposes.
The wholesale price index (WPI) also has problems of limited coverage which should be
expanded to include mining, oil and gas extraction, electricity and water, public transportation,
and communication.
As with the CPI, the WPI is currently compiled with outdated weights derived from the 1994
input-output table and other reports and publications of relevant line ministries.
Labor market statistics: The authorities monitor labor market developments using four
indicators: open unemployment, underemployment, employment, and remuneration. The quality
of these indicators has improved over recent years. Nevertheless, wage data come with a
relatively long delay; the nationwide unemployment and underemployment situation is surveyed
only once a year; and labor productivity data are published only at the time of adjustments of
electricity and telecommunications tariffs.
Fiscal Sector
Government finance statistics (GFS) for general government are compiled using the analytical
framework of the GFS Manual 1986. For the consolidated central government, revenues are
compiled on a cash basis, while expenditures are compiled on an accrual basis. The authorities
have sent to the Fund information on the components of consolidated central government
expenditures by function. The coverage of published national budget data is narrower than the
fiscal statistics prepared for program purposes. The authorities have recently prepared a plan to

9
migrate to the GFS Manual 2001. In 2008, the authorities have aligned budgetary classifications
to the GFSM 2001 framework. Also, some activities have been started to align the Chart of
Account to the international standards. The authorities report annual GFS data using the GFSM
2001 presentational framework for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY) and monthly data for the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary Sector
The central bank (BCRP) compiles and publishes the analytical accounts of the central bank,
depository corporations, and financial corporations broadly in line with the methodology
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main discrepancies being
the exclusion of the deposits of other financial corporations, state and local governments, and
public nonfinancial corporations from the definition of broad money. At the request of the
authorities, a mission visited the country in January 2007 to assist with the migration to the new
standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF. The mission finalized
the SRF for the central bank, recommending improvements in the classification and sectorization
of some accounts. A follow-up mission took place in September 2008 to complete the work on
the SRF for other depository corporations and other financial corporations. The BCRP is
currently in the process of revising historical data on the basis of the report forms developed by
the mission.
External Sector
Despite recent improvements, external statistics continue to be affected by shortcomings. These
include: the lack of coverage of assets held abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; lack
of separate identification of liabilities to affiliated enterprises; and not recording on an accrual
basis some external debt transactions.

The BCRP has been reporting since August 2001 weekly data on international reserves in
accordance with the Operational Guidelines for Data Template on International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the full amount
of the liquidity requirements in the reserve template both under official reserve assets and as
a contingent net drain (as specified in Section III of the Data Template).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 30, 2009

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Minister of Finance Valdivieso was replaced by former Minister Carranza, who
has pledged policy continuity. Minister Carranza indicated that he will ensure the
implementation of the government’s anti-crisis plan, particularly by seeking a steady pace of
public investment spending in line with projections assumed for 2009.
3.
In line with projections, signs of an economic slowdown are emerging. Real GDP
growth decelerated to 5.1 percent in November (y/y)—the lowest rate recorded in 2008—due
to temporary factors related to the APEC meetings (less number of working days) and a
suspension of operations by some local firms. Excluding these factors, the growth rate stood
at 7 percent (y/y) for the month, compared with 9.5 percent during the first 11 months of the
year.
4.
Financial market conditions have remained stable. With some US$0.5 billion in
central bank securities held by non-residents falling due in January, pressures in the foreign
exchange rate market in recent days have been met by central bank intervention for about
US$440 million, helping to contain the depreciation of the Nuevo Sol to around 1 percent
since end-2008. The interbank market has also been stable, as interbank interest rates in
domestic currency have remained unchanged from end-year levels, while dollar-denominated
rates have dropped below 1 percent, resembling the trend of the U.S. policy rate.
5.
At its January meeting, the central bank maintained its policy interest rate
unchanged at 6.5 percent, while reducing minimum reserve requirements by 1 percent,
to 6.5 percent. The central bank reiterated that it continues to monitor closely the path of
domestic demand and the global economic conditions, and their prospective impact on
inflation. It also reiterated its commitment to ensuring the gradual convergence of the
inflation rate to its target range, while providing adequate liquidity levels.
6.
There has been progress on key pending items of the structural agenda under
the program. In particular, the methodological manual on assessing tax incentives (end-June
2008 benchmark) was published on January 16, 2009.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Peru
On January 30, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Peru. 1
Background
Peru has enjoyed an impressive economic performance against the backdrop of a favorable
external environment in recent years. Led by consumption and investment, real GDP is
estimated to have grown above 9 percent in 2008, marking the country’s longest expansion on
record (Table 1). On the back of high food and fuel prices, headline inflation reached
6.7 percent in 2008, exceeding the 1–3 percent target range, but remaining one of the lowest
by regional standards.
The sound policy framework put in place in recent years and the build up of a solid
international reserves position have contributed to reduce vulnerabilities significantly, lower
poverty, and enhance the business environment. The strong fiscal surpluses achieved in
recent years are the backbone of this success, as they have supported a significant reduction
in public debt, improved maturity structure, and the build up of important fiscal buffers. A sound
monetary policy, entrenched on an inflation targeting framework, has also been instrumental in
helping to maintain macroeconomic stability and reduce dollarization. Structural reforms have
reduced fiscal and financial vulnerabilities, while reforms to open new trade destinations, lower

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
informality, streamline procedures, and improve the business climate have helped improve
long-term growth prospects and support poverty reduction.
These achievements have placed Peru on a strong position to weather the expected
deterioration in external conditions. Building on Peru’s strong fundamentals, including a
resilient financial system, several measures have been appropriately implemented by the
authorities that would help to limit spillovers, preserve adequate liquidity conditions in the
domestic markets, and bolster domestic confidence. As a result, orderly liquidity conditions in
the financial system have been preserved, and despite some increase in deposit dollarization
between September and November 2008, preliminary data to December suggests that it has
renewed its downward trend of recent years.
The authorities have been implementing reforms to further strengthen the financial system.
Large official reserves—currently at around US$30 billion—and strong financial soundness
indicators, along with the banks’ limited financial reliance on external funding have helped
preserve the system’s stability. The authorities have recently introduced prudential
measures—including more restrictive rules for consumer credit; new dynamic provisioning
made effective last December, and strengthened banks’ minimum capital requirements as
Basel II is gradually implemented.
On the fiscal area, the authorities have announced several measures to shield the economy
from the global crisis and enhance confidence. These include measures to maintain a program
of public investment and support construction, as well as to support micro and small
enterprises, exporters, and social programs. To further boost confidence, the authorities have
also lined up access to contingent credit lines from official creditors.
As a result, the near term domestic economic outlook still remains favorable, but with risks on
the downside. The pace of economic growth is expected to decelerate to 6 percent in 2009,
reflecting the global slowdown, lower terms of trade, and tighter financial conditions that would
affect net exports and private investment. With the global price disinflation underway, inflation
would decelerate toward the 1–3 percent target range. A more severe and prolonged global
slowdown could also extend the downside risks into 2010. Nevertheless, Peru’s medium-term
prospects are favorable and require preserving prudent macroeconomic policies and dealing
with long-standing structural challenges.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They praised the Peruvian
authorities for their sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms, which—supported by favorable external conditions—have fostered the country’s
longest economic expansion. Sustained fiscal surpluses, supported by a prudent conduct of
monetary policy, have been the backbone of this success, while important structural reforms
have enhanced the resilience and depth of the financial system and capital markets and
improved the business environment. These policies have yielded an impressive economic
performance with robust economic growth, relatively low inflation, reduced vulnerabilities, and
important gains in poverty alleviation.

3
Despite the adverse impact of the global economic downturn and financial crisis, a soft landing
for Peru’s economy seems likely, owing to its strong fundamentals and the authorities’ sound
policy framework. Nevertheless, with downside risks increasing, Directors endorsed as timely
and appropriate the authorities’ preparedness plan, and welcomed as well the authorities’
commitment to make further advances in tackling structural challenges. If the global slowdown
were to prove more severe and prolonged than expected, Directors concurred with the
authorities’ intention to implement prudent countercyclical measures.
Directors supported the authorities’ target of a neutral fiscal stance in 2009, geared to allowing
automatic stabilizers to operate fully and phasing public investment execution evenly, while
boosting resources for subnational governments to increase their investment. Directors
emphasized the importance of broadening Peru’s tax base and proceeding with the reform of
tax exemptions planned for March 2009. They welcomed the recent issuance of the
methodological guidelines for assessing tax exemptions.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the institutional framework for fiscal
policy, most notably by gradually developing a structural fiscal rule to enhance the credibility of
fiscal policy. Reforms to minimize fiscal risks, including from Public-Private Partnerships, will
be important, as will their proper fiscal accounting. Other key priorities are aligning the
expenditure limits for subnational governments with the Fiscal Responsibility and
Transparency Law and the Decentralization Law, fully implementing the Treasury Single
Account, and reforming the Fuel Stabilization Fund to make its price-band adjustment
mechanism automatic.
Directors welcomed the efforts to make further advances on poverty reduction, by improving
the effectiveness and targeting of social programs, and strengthening large social programs.
They also supported the authorities’ plans to tackle the challenges posed by existing regional
disparities.
Directors considered that Peru’s inflation targeting framework should remain focused on
preserving low and stable inflation. They welcomed the central bank’s commitment to ensure a
gradual convergence to the inflation target range in 2009, while providing adequate liquidity to
support domestic demand. In this context, Directors supported the authorities’ intention to
continue to monitor closely the path of domestic demand, inflation, and inflation expectations,
and to adjust policies as warranted. Delinking the appointment of the central bank’s president
and board members from the presidential cycle would further bolster the credibility of the
inflation-targeting framework.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate is broadly aligned
with fundamentals. Peru’s exchange rate policy has appropriately balanced exchange rate
flexibility and dollarization risks. Directors supported the authorities’ foreign exchange
intervention, which has reduced exchange rate volatility and increased official reserves. They

4
generally agreed that Peru’s improved fundamentals provide scope for greater exchange rate
flexibility but considered that such a transition should await more stable external conditions.
Directors commended the progress made in strengthening the financial system. Continuing
steady implementation of Basel II, as well as enactment of minimum capital requirements for
microfinance institutions, remain key priorities. The authorities have taken important steps by
establishing new procyclical provisioning rules and tightening prudential regulations on
consumer loans. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to enhance their crisis
preparedness, underscoring the need to strengthen the framework for providing adequate
liquidity to all financial entities and to gradually recapitalize the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Directors congratulated the authorities on Peru’s highly successful Stand-By Arrangement with
the Fund and welcomed warmly Peru’s inclusion in the Fund’s Financial Transaction Plan.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth and Final Review Under Peru's Stand-By
Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
and final review of Peru's economic performance under a 25-month Stand-By Arrangement
in the amount equivalent to SDR 172.4 million (about US$257.2 million). The arrangement,
which was approved on January 26, 2007 (see Press Release No. 07/15), is being treated by
the Peruvian authorities as precautionary.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:
“Peru has been enjoying its longest expansion on record, one of the lowest inflation rates in
the region, declining vulnerabilities, and poverty reduction. These achievements owe much to
the authorities’ strong commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and steady
implementation of reforms.
“Despite the adverse impact of the global economic downturn and financial crisis, a soft
landing for Peru’s economy seems likely, owing to its strong fundamentals and the
authorities’ sound policy framework. Nevertheless, with downside risks increasing, the
authorities’ “anti-crisis” preparedness plan is timely and appropriate, as is their commitment
to make further advances in tackling structural challenges. Were the downside external risks
to intensify, carefully paced countercyclical policies could be contemplated, in line with the
authorities’ anti-crisis plan.
“The authorities have targeted a broadly neutral fiscal stance, geared to allowing the
automatic stabilizers to operate fully and phasing public investment execution evenly. It will
be important to enhance the fiscal framework and strengthen the tax base, including by
establishing a fiscal rule to formalize the prudent fiscal policy of recent years.
“Monetary policy will remain focused on achieving a gradual convergence to the inflation
target range, while ensuring adequate liquidity in the financial system. Peru’s exchange rate
policy has appropriately balanced exchange rate flexibility and dollarization risks. Going

2

forward, Peru’s improved fundamentals provide scope for allowing greater flexibility, which
should await more stable external conditions.
“Significant progress has been made in further strengthening the financial system and
enhancing the framework for crisis preparedness. The authorities have taken important steps
to establish new procyclical provisioning rules and tighten prudential regulations on
consumer loans. There is scope to further enhance the framework for liquidity provision to
the financial system, including by gradually recapitalizing the Deposit Insurance Fund.
To strengthen poverty reduction, the authorities are assessing their existing programs,
improving targeting, and linking expenditure to efficiency. A review of reforms to tackle
decisively the existing regional disparities would reinforce these efforts.
“Directors congratulated the authorities on Peru’s highly successful Stand-By Arrangement
with the Fund,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Messrs. Pablo A. Pereira, Executive Director for Peru
and Oscar Hendrick, Advisor
January 30, 2009

INTRODUCTION
1.
On behalf of our Peruvian authorities, we would like to convey our appreciation to
Mr. Cerisola and his team for a constructive and candid policy dialogue during the Article IV
Consultation and final review of the precautionary Stand-By Arrangement. They would also
like to express their gratitude to the Executive Board and Management for their support and
quality advice during close to 20 years of continued Fund-supported programs. The staff
report and selected issues paper provide an in-depth analysis of the strong economic
performance of the Peruvian economy and the challenges ahead. Our authorities are in broad
agreement with the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations. We are pleased to
inform the Board that Peru does not intend to seek an additional arrangement with the Fund.
2.
The resilience of the Peruvian economy has been successfully tested once again.
Despite the lingering effects of the worst financial crisis in recent history and adverse
external shocks, Peru’s economic growth has been among the highest in the world and
inflation remains among the lowest in the region. All end-September 2008 performance
criteria were met with ample margins and most structural benchmarks have also been met.
Given the strong performance under the Stand-By Arrangement, the authorities request
completion of the fourth and final review. They consent to the publication of the staff report.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
The Peruvian economy continues to perform well, supported by strong economic
fundamentals and the authorities’ commitment to sound macroeconomic policies.
Consolidating the longest economic expansion on record, real GDP growth is expected to
have reached 9.1 percent in 2008, the highest since 1994, with almost every economic
activity showing a good pace, in particular the construction and commerce sectors. While
private consumption is broadly growing at the same pace as GDP, private investment
continues to grow for a third consecutive year, above 20 percent in real terms. The strong
economic growth has contributed to a further reduction in the unemployment rate to 8.4
percent, while the poverty rate has continued to decline to 39.3 percent, reflecting the
improvement in the standard of living of the population. The external position remains solid
with a level of net international reserves equivalent to more than four times the short-term
external debt on a residual maturity basis. The consolidated fiscal sector had a surplus for
the third consecutive year, about 2.0 percent of GDP in 2008, while public debt declined
further to 24.0 percent of GDP.
4.
The Central Bank’s anti-inflationary stance has limited the pass-through from
significant increases in international food and oil prices into domestic inflation. In 2008,

2
mostly driven by higher international food and oil prices. The monetary authority reinforced
its anti-inflationary stance to ensure a gradual return to inflation and inflation expectations to
the target range. Accordingly, the Central Bank increased the policy interest rate several
times by an accumulated 200 bps, from 4.5 percent in June 2007 to 6.5 percent in September
2008. These decisions were complemented by increases in reserve requirements on
obligations in both domestic and foreign currency. The authorities are committed to taking
additional actions if required and will continue to closely monitor the evolution of
international prices and domestic demand.
5.
The Free Trade Agreement with the United States will come into effect shortly and
similar arrangements with China, the European Union, and other countries are underway.
Presidents George W. Bush and Alan Garcia put the trade deal into effect on February 1,
2009, concluding a long process of trade negotiations and good will. The free trade
agreement makes the special access to the U.S. market currently enjoyed under the Andean
Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act permanent. The current two-way trade is about
US$ 10.9 billion annually. The free trade agreement is expected to encourage higher export
growth and diversification, as well as accelerate reforms that will further enhance the
investment climate in Peru, already benefiting from foreign direct investment at historic
highs. During the 2008 APEC Summit, important progress was made towards the free trade
agreements with China.
6.
Looking forward, the outlook for the Peruvian economy remains favorable, despite
the heightened risks stemming from the global economic slowdown. Real GDP growth is
expected to reach 6.0 percent in 2009, one of the highest in the world according to the latest
revised WEO. Inflation is expected to decline below 3.0 percent, returning to the Central
Bank’s target range. The consolidated public sector balance will be in surplus, albeit at a
lower level than previous years to allow for the automatic stabilizers to operate in full. The
financial system has not been affected by the global financial crisis, as underscored by very
strong financial soundness indicators, including bank liquidity and capital adequacy ratios.
The authorities concur with the staff’s assessment that the current level of official reserves
provides an important buffer to preserve economic growth, external stability, and poverty
alleviation.
7.
Nonetheless, to protect the hard-earned gains, the government has announced an
“anti-crisis” plan to avoid the risk of a sudden and sharp slowdown of economic activity.
The main objective of the plan is to achieve a “soft landing” by maintaining the growth
momentum—within long-term sustainable levels—and ensuring an adequate liquidity level
in the financial system. The Ministry of Finance has already taken actions, extending the
execution of public investment projects budgeted in 2008 through March 2009 and increasing
resources to the Fund for Regional and Local Public Investment. The Central Bank, in
coordination with the Ministry of Finance and the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance
(SBS), is evaluating policies to strengthen the framework for providing adequate liquidity to
all financial entities. Additionally, actions to strengthen the prudential and regulatory

3
framework have already been implemented. The authorities are confident that the fiscal
savings allocated to finance the anti-crisis plan, equivalent to 2.5 percent of GDP, should be
adequate. However, should the crisis be worse than envisaged, they are ready to take
additional actions to stimulate the economy. If the fiscal savings are not enough, the
government will access available financing from multilateral organizations.
TAKING STOCK OF THE LAST TWO DECADES
8.
Peru continues to be a success story, but it is fair and important to recognize that
many challenges remain ahead. It has taken almost two decades of continued
implementation of sound economic policies—despite temporary setbacks—and a strong
political commitment to modernize the country and improve the standard of living of the
population. Peru’s strong macroeconomic performance was underpinned by wide-ranging
structural reforms to improve the functioning of markets, foster private sector participation,
and modernize the role of the state. In the early 1990s, Peru was one of the first emerging
countries to undertake a simultaneous trade and capital account liberalization, accompanied
by a flexible exchange rate regime and a deep reform of the financial system. Among several
important transformations aimed at enhancing external competitiveness and investor
confidence, Peru modernized the civil service, reformed the labor market, strengthened the
rule of Law, and revamped the judiciary system. Our authorities remain committed to
prudent financial policies to preserve the hard-earned macroeconomic stability and a further
deepening of structural reforms to sustain growth and entrench poverty reduction.
9.
In the 1990s, while most other financially-dollarized economies chose an exchange
rate anchor, Peru was the only highly-dollarized country that enforced an independent
monetary policy. The strategy was based on (i) legal and effective Central Bank autonomy;
(ii) enhanced monetary policy credibility through an annual inflation target—in place since
1994 and currently 2 percent, the lowest in the region; (iii) policies to address financial
dollarization risks, including high reserve requirements for foreign currency deposits,
preemptive reserve requirements on dollar liabilities, and foreign exchange intervention to
smooth excessive exchange rate volatility without affecting the trend.
10.
In the course of the current decade, inflation has been 2.3 percent on average, one
of the lowest in the region. The low inflation has helped to regain confidence in the
domestic currency, which has been reflected in a clearly voluntary dedollarization process.
Thus, dollarization has decreased from 71 percent in 2000 to 46 percent in 2008. In addition,
Peru and Mexico’s nominal bonds in domestic currency have the longest maturities in the
region (up to 30 years) and provide a benchmark for private sector issuances. Access to
financial markets has been enhanced by the investment grade rating received from Fitch and
Standard & Poor’s last year.
POLICY ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES GOING FORWARD

4
A.

Surviving the Worst Global Economic Crisis Since the Great Depression

11.
Financial sector contagion has been limited. Initially, Peru’s sovereign spread
increased to 620 bps in late October 2008, but in December 2008 the sovereign yield curve
returned to the “pre-crisis” level. The Central Bank’s decisive actions to limit market and
exchange rate volatility included: (i) easing reserve requirements—previously increased to
contain speculative capital inflows; (ii) the placement of repos and swaps in nuevos soles and
U.S. dollars; and (iii) the use of international reserves accumulated during the first half of the
year. The Central Bank held the policy rate unchanged during this period. In 2009,
economic growth will be driven by a still strong domestic demand, which will compensate
for the substantial expected decline in external demand.
B.

Policies to Face Current and Prospective Challenges

12.
The authorities’ main priority in the short term is to maintain the growth
momentum and help the economy to transition in an orderly fashion to a lower level of
economic activity. To this end, monetary policy will continue to ensure the gradual return to
the inflation target range in 2009 and it will only ease reserve requirements and reduce the
policy rate when clear evidence of a declining trend in prices is in place. Fiscal policy will
be aimed at achieving a neutral fiscal stance for the year as a whole, but the balance between
achieving a soft landing and addressing infrastructure and social needs would be biased
towards the second goal. As clearly indicated in the Debt Sustainability Analysis, public
debt is on a solid declining path, the fiscal position is strong, and government deposits
amounted to 7 percent of GDP by end-December 2008. This provides a strong buffer to
manage different levels of “fiscal stimulus”, as needed, without resorting to public debt.

Strengthening and closely monitoring the Financial System remains a priority.
The authorities have permanently updated prudential regulations and the regulatory
framework and the banks have learned to be conservative and prudent in their financing and
lending activities. The banking system has a relatively low dependence of external credit
lines, higher liquidity, and lower ratios of non-performing loans and a high level of
provisions. The SBS has recently updated credit risks and exchange risk stress tests and the
system remains resilient to most foreseeable shocks, even under extreme adverse
assumptions. The SBS has recently begun to tighten lending standards (effective as of
January 2009); issued more restrictive rules for granting credit card loans; introduced
provisioning requirements for all consumer loans; and established procyclical provisioning
(effective as of December 1, 2008). Foreign banks account for about half of total assets.
They are in a solid position and continue to rely mostly on domestic funding. No banks pose
any systemic risks.

The Fund Program and Future Fund Relations

14.
Peru has maintained a long relationship with the Fund under “program mode”.
Peru has benefited significantly from Fund advice and the “seal of approval” from Fund-

5
supported programs, and it has also one of the best records of compliance with original
program targets. The other side of the coin is that after almost two decades of continuing in
program mode, it requires a certain creativity from the staff and the authorities to envisage
every year for almost two consecutive decades, new structural reforms and suitable
benchmarks. Perhaps Peru was one of the cases that inspired the need for streamlined
conditionality and Management’s recommendation to distinguish desirable from essential
structural conditionality. It is also worth mentioning that in all these years, all arrangements
with the Fund were precautionary, with the exception of the initial Right Accumulation
Program back in 1991.
15.
The current Stand-By Arrangement was completed with flying colors, but a few
structural benchmarks were missing. On January 16, 2009, legislation was passed for the
issuance of methodological guidelines to assess tax exemptions. The authorities remain
committed to delivering on the remaining benchmarks as soon as it is feasible. Regarding the
Single Treasury Account (STA), it is worth mentioning that more than 85 percent of public
sector transactions are already in the STA and a higher percentage is managed in a
centralized manner by the Treasury, although it is not formally recorded in the TSA. Finally,
regarding the benchmark to reconcile subnational government spending limits with those for
the central government—the difference is only one percentage point, as indicated by the
staff—, the authorities now believe that it would be better to address this issue within a
comprehensive review of the decentralization process; and that this is perhaps not the right
time for submitting such a proposal to Congress.
16.
Looking ahead, Peru will maintain a close dialogue with the Fund and it will
continue to engage in the policy discussions and institutional changes through the relevant
internal channels and other international fora. The authorities would like to share their
experience with other countries, help shape future Fund conditionality and lending activities,
and contribute to the Fund’s operational budget. Taking into account Peru’s strong external
position, it has been included for the upcoming February–April 2009 Financial Transaction
Plan.
