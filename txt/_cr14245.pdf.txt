STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth remains rapid, but has moderated from the 7¼ percent recorded
in 2013. Remittances and accommodative monetary and financial conditions remain the
primary growth drivers, despite volatile capital flows, slowing activity in the region and
severe natural disasters. Inflation has picked up to over 4 percent, while the current
account remains in surplus. Local financial markets were moderately impacted by the
Fed’s “taper talk and action,” weakening the peso and equity prices. Credit growth has
quickened, especially to construction.
Potential growth has risen to about 6‒6¼ percent. However, persistent weakness in the
business climate is a risk to sustained growth and hinders job creation. Foreign
ownership restrictions, inadequate infrastructure and high doing-business costs have
held back overall investment and employment. Along with frequent natural disasters,
this has kept poverty elevated, thereby sustaining outward migration.
Outlook and risks. Normalizing financial conditions are forecast to ease growth to
6‒6½ percent over the medium term, while keeping inflation within the band and
moderating the current account surplus. Abrupt changes in global financial conditions
and a sharp growth slowdown in EMs are among the external growth risks. On the
domestic front, excessive flow of real and financial resources to the property sector
could increase volatility of asset prices and GDP growth over the longer run.
Policy recommendations. A more restrictive policy stance is needed to preserve macrofinancial stability, with rebalancing of the mix to allow higher public investment
spending, while implementing reforms to sustain vibrant growth and make it more
inclusive:


Absorbing liquidity and raising official interest rates would address second-round
inflation effects and potential overheating and financial stability risks. Allowing the
exchange rate to adjust more fully to structural inflows, while smoothing the effect
of cyclical flows, would limit further sustained reserve buildup.



Addressing specific risks from real estate and large credit exposures requires further
targeted measures and broadening the BSP’s mandate to include financial stability.
This would help prevent diversion of systemic risk to shadow banking and
strengthen tools to manage risks from deepening cross-border financial integration.



Raising the fiscal deficit from below 1½ percent of GDP in 2013 to 2 percent of GDP
in 2014 to accommodate reconstruction spending should be accompanied by tighter
monetary and financial conditions. Mobilizing sizable additional stable revenue
would ensure room for structural spending priorities while preserving fiscal
prudence.



Improving the investment climate by relaxing foreign ownership limits, reducing red
tape, limiting tax holidays, and reducing labor and product market rigidities would
enhance competition, support PPP execution and create employment opportunities
within the Philippines.

CONTEXT
1.

Against unsettled global capital markets, the Philippines delivered another impressive
macroeconomic performance in 2013. Despite volatile capital flows, slowing activity in the
region and a series of calamitous natural disasters, growth accelerated last year, supported by
accommodative monetary and financial conditions and growing remittances. Potential growth
has also risen, led by improved productivity and faster capital accumulation. Recognizing the
progress made in strengthening external and fiscal positions and adopting sound policy
frameworks, the three major rating agencies elevated the Philippines to investment grade
in 2013, with a further upgrade by one agency in early 2014.

2.

Nonetheless, persistent weaknesses in the business climate remain a risk to sustained
growth and kept unemployment elevated. Structural rigidities may now be imposing speed
limits on non-inflationary GDP growth despite progress in improving competitiveness rankings
and public sector transparency. In addition, job creation has not kept pace with the rapidly
growing labor force, and structural under- and unemployment rates remain relatively high. As a
result, poverty remains widespread and a large share of the population is vulnerable to falling
into poverty as a result of natural disasters and other shocks (Box 1). Weak labor market and
welfare prospects are continuing to sustain outward migration and inward remittances. In
addition, foreign ownership restrictions and a weak investment climate combined with ample
liquidity is supporting demand for financial assets and real estate and construction activities.

3.

Strong popular support provides space for the government to accelerate its economic
and social reform agenda. More than half way into his single six-year term, President Aquino
continues to enjoy high approval ratings in part reflecting his administration’s pledge to improve
governance and make growth more inclusive. The historic peace agreement between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), signed in March 2014 and the
corresponding legislation is awaiting ratification by Congress, offers the prospect of significantly
improving the welfare of the people of Mindanao, one of the poorest regions of the country. In
response to typhoon Yolanda, the government has committed to “build back better” to
strengthen resilience to natural disasters. Nonetheless, the government has acknowledged that
more needs to be done in the critical areas of poverty reduction, implementing vital
infrastructure, reducing business costs and executing agrarian reform, and has pledged to
deliver rapid and palpable results.1 The next presidential election is scheduled for mid-2016.

4.

In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended the
authorities’ prudent policies that delivered strong macroeconomic outcomes and set the
stage for favorable growth prospects. However, they also noted potential risks from global
uncertainties, volatile capital inflows, bank’s increasing exposure to some sectors, and the
possibility

of stretched asset prices. They therefore stressed the importance of continued prudent
macroeconomic policies while stepping up reforms to bolster resilience, sustain high growth,
and reduce poverty. Over the past year, the authorities have continued to make progress on
several of these fronts, tailored to reflect the change in global capital flows.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
5.

GDP expanded by a rapid 7¼ percent in 2013, bringing average growth for the past
four years to 6⅓ percent (Figures 1 and 2). Consumption and investment were the primary
growth drivers, supported by remittances and accommodative monetary and financial
conditions, while the external sector remained a drag on growth owing to subdued goods
exports (Box 2). On the supply side, services, manufacturing and—through mid 2013—
construction propelled output, with agriculture remaining broadly flat. In view of its occurrence
late in the year, typhoon Yolanda is thought to have shaved only ¼ percentage point off
annual 2013 growth, but with a somewhat greater impact likely this year. Growth eased in
Q1:2014 (q/q) partly on other temporary factors (weak export demand by several advanced
countries and a slowdown in residential construction as a large number of condominium units
are coming on stream), and increasingly binding capacity constraints (in electricity generation
due to maintenance shutdowns and adverse weather, and in road infrastructure from the main
port).

6.

Inflation has picked up since late 2013 and the current account surplus increased.
Inflation lay below the bottom of the target band (4±1 percent) for much of last year despite
high capacity utilization and a modest positive output gap. This reflected benign global price
developments, reinforced by peso appreciation during H1:2013.2 However, inflation rose to
4 percent late in the year on pass through of the weaker peso, typhoon-related disruptions to
food production, increases in rice prices and higher electricity prices due to maintenance
shutdowns, and reached 4½ percent in May. These supply-side pressures are likely to be larger
and more persistent in the context of accommodative policies and a regionally centralized wage
bargaining framework. The current account surplus increased to 3½ percent of GDP in 2013
(from below 3 percent the previous year) on a narrowing trade deficit.

7.

Philippine financial markets were moderately impacted by the announcement and
subsequent implementation of tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve. During
May 2013-January 2014, portfolio rebalancing resulted in capital outflows and caused the peso
to depreciate by a cumulative 9 percent, equity prices to decline by 17 percent, and long term
interest rates to rise by 50‒150 basis points (Figures 3‒5 and Box 3). In addition, official reserves
declined moderately, but remain high relative to the Fund’s reserve adequacy benchmark. While
more restrained than in several other emerging markets, these financial market movements

Global common factors—strongly associated with world commodity prices, the U.S. dollar nominal effective
exchange rate, and the “great moderation” of inflation—are found to account for about 60 percent of inflation
variability in the Philippines (see Chapter 1 of the accompanying selected issues).

helped unwind some of the previous sharp increases in equity prices and the exchange rate that
occurred in recent years partly in response to accommodative financial policies. More recently,
the resumption of financial inflows has caused prices to recover some of their previous losses.
Staff Position
8.

Growth is forecast to remain strong, albeit easing on the assumption of tighter
domestic financial conditions.



Under the baseline scenario of tighter funding conditions and lending standards, growth is
expected to moderate in 2014 to 6¼ percent—although rising on a sequential quarterly basis in
response to strengthening activity in advanced economies and stepped up reconstruction
spending.3 With potential growth having edged up to around 6¼ percent (Box 4), staff expects
the small positive output gap will stabilize this year. Second-round effects from recent supply
shocks and exchange rate depreciation are expected to offset subdued external prices, bringing
end-2014 inflation to 4 percent. The current account surplus is forecast to narrow marginally this
year on a pickup in imports for reconstruction.



Thereafter, and without further structural reforms, growth is projected to converge to 6 percent
to unwind the positive output gap. Persistent structural inflows from abroad—though more
subdued than in recent years—are expected to gradually return the real exchange rate to its
strengthening trend. The resulting increase in imports—supported also by larger infrastructure
investments—will narrow the current account surplus and relieve pressure on domestic capacity
constraints. This would help temper inflation, but likely keep it above the midpoint of the new
lower target band (3±1 percent) to be adopted from January 2015.

9.

Risks to this baseline growth outlook stem from both external and domestic sources,
and are tilted to the downside (Appendix 1). While a faster pick up in advanced economies
would support Philippine growth, exiting rapidly from exceptionally loose monetary policies
abroad—possibly in response to growing financial market distortions—could heighten volatility
in global financial markets, impacting domestic credit conditions and those corporates and
households that are over leveraged. A sharp slowdown in China or emerging markets more
broadly, or a major geopolitical incident that disrupts regional or global trade, as well as
commodity and financial flows, would also adversely impact the Philippines. On the domestic
front, excessive flow of real and financial resources to the property sector could boost near term
growth but lead to increased volatility of asset prices and GDP growth over longer horizons.
Natural disasters also pose a risk to economic activity.

The Consensus Forecast in June has GDP growth averaging 6.3 percent for 2014, with a range of 5.9‒7.3 percent.

Authorities’ Views
10.

Despite a buffeting by global and domestic stresses, growth in 2013 remained resilient
owing to strong policy frameworks and payoff from earlier reforms. Diversified growth
drivers, a strong external position, a sound financial system, and prudent fiscal and debt
management allowed the economy to ride out the turbulence in global financial markets.
Looking ahead, ongoing improvements in production efficiency are expected to support a
higher path for potential and actual growth while also bringing about lower inflation. GDP
growth is projected to increase from 6.5−7.5 percent in 2014 to 7.5−8.5 percent in 2016 while
inflation is expected to ease to 3±1percent, and the current account to remain in surplus.

11.

Although the economy is expected to continue to perform strongly, the authorities
were cognizant of risks—particularly on the global front—that could heighten volatility.
Uncertainty about future policy steps in advanced economies could trigger renewed financial
market turbulence. Slower growth in Asia could reduce intra-Asian trade that, until now, has
compensated for previous weakness in exports to advanced economies. Political risks could
affect international commodity prices and capital markets, and weaken growth prospects. On
the domestic side, the threat of natural disasters is ever present, and the authorities remain alert
to potential risks to financial stability, including in real estate, and will continue to respond
proactively, as needed.

PRESERVING STABILITY AMID STRUCTURAL AND
CYCLICAL FLOWS
A. External Sector Assessment
Staff Position
12.

Notwithstanding volatility in financial flows, the external sector strengthened
during 2013. Responding to a shift in interest rate differentials, some previously accumulated
capital flows reversed during mid 2013-early 2014. This selling pressure was accommodated by a
combination of peso depreciation and drawdown of reserves. However, the overall balance of
payments remained positive for the year on the rising current account surplus.

13.

In recent years, the Philippines’ external sector facilitated reserve accumulation by the
official sector. Tending to lean against the wind of inflows has helped build a large reserve
buffer against future external shocks and smoothed adjustment to a stronger equilibrium real
exchange rate resulting from sustained remittances and other structural current account inflows.
In the process, the nominal exchange rate has tended to move broadly in line with those of
regional trade partners, and the reserve position is now stronger than warranted for
precautionary purposes. While the EBA methodology places the gap between the current
account and its norm at near 7 percent of GDP for 2013, extensions to these methods to account

for exposure to natural disasters and remittance income reduce the gap to around 3 percent of
GDP (of which 0.5 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, reflect policy gaps in the rest of the
world and in the Philippines) (Appendix 2). From a multilateral perspective, this suggests the
external sector was moderately stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals in 2013,
consistent with moderate currency undervaluation.
Authorities’ Views
14.

The exchange rate regime continues to be market-determined and the change in
reserves level remains consistent with the objective of smoothing excessive volatility in
the foreign exchange market. Policies allowed the peso to appreciate over the past decade
consistent with sustained structural inflows, which enabled reserves to reach a comfortable level.
In late 2013 to early 2014, reserves showed a moderate drop as a result of foreign exchange
operations and government debt servicing. Going forward, the REER is expected to move in line
with structural flows and reserves may accumulate at a slower pace than in previous years as
higher global interest rates moderate capital inflows.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy4
Background
15.

Short-term market interest rates remain at exceptionally low levels. Domestic interest
rates have been compressed by loose monetary policies abroad and ample domestic liquidity
partly reflecting the BSP’s decision to restrict nonbanks’ direct access to its Special Deposit
Account (SDA)—one of its main sterilization instruments. This released some 5 percent of GDP in
liquidity in late 2013, although two recent increases in reserve requirements (RRs) (by
1 percentage point each in April and May) absorbed part of the net injection.5 The 3-month Tbill rate is currently 1.1 percent, well below the policy (reverse repo) interest rate (3.5 percent)
and the SDA rate (2 percent), and considerably negative in real terms. Credit growth by universal
and commercial banks accelerated to an annual rate of almost 21 percent in April.

Staff Position

Policymakers adeptly steered the Philippine economy through turbulent financial
conditions brought by unconventional monetary policies in advanced countries, but
domestic monetary and financial conditions are now too accommodative. The BSP’s policies
since the GFC have generally delivered low inflation, helped moderate capital inflows, and offset

This section reflects policy actions and public statements that occurred after the mission.

5

The restriction on SDA access affected some 11 percent of GDP in assets, although the net liquidity released—after
flow back through deposits placed with banks (which are subject to RR) and trusts—was less than half that amount.
The increase in RR in March and May absorbed about 1 percentage point of GDP in liquidity. RRs are now 20 percent
for universal and commercial banks, and 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for thrift or rural banks (which
comprise 10 percent of banking sector assets). RRs for rural banks were adjusted in March only.

the restrictive fiscal stance in 2013 (Box 5). However, the liquidity overhang from past forex
accumulation has been exacerbated by the recent restriction on direct access to the SDA,
reducing the intensity of sterilization. As a result, the domestic impact of the tighter
U.S. financial conditions since mid-2013 has been muted, especially for short-term interest rates.
The drawdown of official reserves in response cyclical outflows and the increase in RRs earlier
this year were therefore welcome. Nonetheless, liquidity remains excessive, with real market
interest rates remaining very low or negative (Figure 6).
17.

The economy is well positioned to absorb a gradual tightening of monetary policy.
Upfront measures to withdraw liquidity and raise real interest rates would help prevent second
round inflation effects and address potential overheating and financial stability risks. Doing so
would also create policy space to accommodate fiscal spending for post typhoon reconstruction
and infrastructure upgrading (see below).



Sterilization and official interest rates. Absorbing excess liquidity by further increasing RRs—
which are levied only on banks, and are already high—could have the unintended effect of
encouraging financial intermediation to shift to nonbanks,6 while also lowering the effective
return on SDA placements for those funds channeled through banks, which are subject to RRs.
Instead, the BSP should raise the SDA and policy rates in order to attract additional funds to BSP
facilities and hence pull up market interest rates.7 In addition, the BSP could resume forex swaps,
while the Treasury could overfund the fiscal deficit in the local debt market with proceeds kept
at the BSP in the Treasury Single Account or make government securities available to the BSP for
repo operations.8 Moreover, approving the draft revisions to the BSP Charter that allows the BSP
to issue its own bills and ensures a minimum level of capital would increase the BSP’s policy
space.



Exchange rate and reserves. With official reserves more than adequate to respond to shocks, the
exchange rate should appreciate more fully in response to sustained structural balance of
payments inflows (including remittances and FDI) (Figure 7). On the other hand, smoothing the
exchange rate effect—and sterilizing the liquidity impact—of cyclical capital flows (including
portfolio and currency and deposit flows) is appropriate because the domestic investor base
remains small relative to the potential scale of volatile capital flows.9

6

While RRs on rural and thrift banks are much lower, these institutions are likely close substitutes to informal,
unregulated intermediation.
7

The effectiveness of the policy rate is however limited by the small amount of repo-able securities held by the BSP.

8

On the other hand, if outflow pressures resume, unsterilized sales of official reserves would help reduce liquidity,
while preventing an outflow-depreciation feedback loop.
9

This implies dampening exchange rate variability at intermediate frequencies corresponding to capital flow cycles.
However, retaining variability at higher frequencies is useful to discourage carry trade inflows.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

Authorities’ Views
18.

In recent years, large and volatile capital inflows have augmented current
account-related inflows, complicating the task of liquidity management. The BSP adopted a
series of measures to moderate inflows, while also relying on a range of sterilization instruments.
Restricting nonbanks’ direct access to the SDA since late 2013 was intended to encourage some
funds placed therein to migrate toward productive investment and align ability to access the
standing facility to international norms. However, liquidity expanded strongly due to both the
operational adjustment in the SDA facility and sustained credit growth. In early 2014, the BSP
siphoned off some liquidity by raising reserve requirements by 2 percentage points and allowing
official reserves to decline.

19.

Buoyant domestic growth prospects provide some scope for measured adjustments in
the BSP’s policy instruments in order to safeguard price and financial stability. Further
normalization of U.S. monetary and financial conditions would help drain domestic liquidity, but
changing market expectations on Fed actions could trigger some volatility. With inflation
expected to be within the target range and inflation expectations remaining well-anchored, the
BSP has continued to rely on an enhanced policy toolkit rather than the policy rate alone.
Recently, the BSP raised reserve requirements as a preemptive macroprudential measure to
guard against potential financial stability risks brought by strong growth in liquidity and credit.
Any further adjustments in policy settings will be data dependent and based on the evolving
outlook for inflation and output. Allowing the BSP to issue its own securities and ensuring a
minimum level of capital will help increase flexibility over the amount, timing, and duration of
sterilization operations.

C. Financial Sector Issues
Background
20.

Amid buoyant GDP, credit and real estate activity, financial soundness indicators
signal continued strong performance. During 2013, Philippine banks achieved robust profits,
low NPLs, and maintained capital adequacy ratios well above newly introduced Basel III
requirements (Figure 8).10 Banks are not dependent on external financing, relying mainly on
domestic deposit funding. Bank lending has accelerated since end 2013, reaching almost
21 percent in April. At around 35 percent of GDP, credit penetration of the private sector
through banks is low from a regional perspective (but in line with EMs in other regions),
although nonbank financing is also significant (Box 7). Large corporates are issuing debt

10

Minimum capital requirements in the Philippines are higher than BIS recommendations. From January 1, 2014,
Philippine banks must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 6.0 percent (BIS recommends
4.0 percent by January 1, 2014 and 4.5 percent by January 1, 2015). Including the 2.5 percent capital-conservation
buffer, the minimum required CET1 ratio is 8.5 percent (BIS recommends 7 percent). The minimum total capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) is 10.0 percent (BIS recommends 8.0 percent).

securities, enabling them to lock in fixed rate funding, lengthen maturities, and bypass bank
exposure limits on individual borrowers. Issuance has risen sharply, with the amount issued
during January-May 2014 exceeding the 2013 annual total. The pace of property price increases
quickened to 13 percent year-on-year for condominiums and 5¾ percent for office space in
Q4:2013,11 although construction activity has recently slowed (Appendix 3). Banks’ real estate
exposure amounted 21¾ percent of total loan portfolios at end 2013, and has been growing
faster than other segments. Sixty percent of real estate loans are to commercial entities
(developers and construction companies) with the rest to households. Real estate developers
and their affiliated conglomerates are also active in debt and equity markets, and developers—
as well as several public agencies—provide credit directly to home buyers (thought to total
around 7½ percent of GDP, including mortgage lending by banks). Nonbank real estate lenders
tend to apply weaker credit standards than banks.

Staff Position
21.

Pockets of risk have emerged against the backdrop of prolonged loose credit
conditions. Abundant liquidity and very low short-term market rates are exacerbating the risk
that prices of property and financial assets could move ahead of fundamentals. With the
aggregate leverage ratio for listed companies at 100 percent in 2012, the rise in corporate
indebtedness needs to be watched. Moreover, the distribution of debt is skewed toward more
leveraged firms, increasing vulnerability to interest rate and refinancing risks. Targeted measures
adopted in recent years by the BSP, in its role as banking supervisor, to enhance the monitoring
and regulation of banks were appropriate.12 The Financial Stability Coordination Council,
established in early 2014, will help to bridge the gaps in financial oversight mandates across the
different member agencies. Nonetheless, financial deepening and search for yield in the context
of low interest rates and migration of credit provision to less regulated and less closely
supervised lenders raises repricing and credit quality risks and reduces transparency. Further
preemptive action is warranted:



Real estate. Compliance with existing loan-to-value (LtV) ceilings on bank mortgages (the
standard cap is 60 percent, but banks routinely offer 80 percent, including in situations where a
lower cap is applicable) should be strictly enforced. Requiring standardized contracts for
nonbank (including real estate developer) financing of property purchases, overseen by the
SEC—as regulator of nonbank financial institutions—and the BSP—as consumer finance
advocate—would strengthen credit underwriting and consumer protection standards and
improve data collection. Applying higher risk weights than the standard 50 percent for individual
and corporate borrowers with multiple mortgages should be

11

This reflects prices in high-end areas of metro Manila, which is the only available series.

12

In addition to requiring higher minimum capital standards than Basel recommendations and limiting NDF positions,
the BSP broadened the coverage of banks’ real estate activities that it monitors (although there is no explicit ceiling
on broad exposure), and banks are permitted to purchase developers’ previously issued loans to buyers (“contractto-sell” (CTS) securitization agreements) only if the loans meet minimum standards. Actual CTS purchases account for
only 1 percent of banks’ loan portfolios.

considered to discourage speculative activity. In addition, tax advantages for real estate in the
current corporate tax system—preferential treatment of real estate capital gains for firms whose
primary business activity is not related to real estate, and tax holidays for constructing low-mid
price housing—should be eliminated to discourage speculative demand and oversupply and
also help avoid overburdening macroprudential policy. Replacing tax holidays with well-targeted
subsidies for low-income buyers would improve efficiency.


Loan concentration. In view of the conglomerate structure of the economy, large bank exposures
to single borrowers can create systemic risks. Recent measures to roll back exemptions to single
borrower limits (SBLs) and tighten related conditions are welcome.13 To better manage risks
from concentrated exposures, interdependent companies within a conglomerate group should
be classified as a single borrower, consistent with the new Basel Committee guidelines for
measuring and controlling large exposures. In addition, amending the BSP Charter to allow the
BSP to request and receive information on all members of conglomerate groups affiliated with
banks would strengthen the effectiveness of supervision.



Financial stability architecture. Migration of credit outside the banking sector offers
diversification benefits, but assessment and oversight of the sector are likely complicated by
resulting data and regulatory gaps. With no entity having a legal mandate for financial stability,
tightening micro and macroprudential regulations on banks—including RRs and real estate
exposure caps—may have the unintended effect of pushing activity into segments with
less-stringent regulatory requirements, including shadow financing of real estate. Expanding the
BSP’s remit to include broad financial stability (as a secondary objective to the main goal of price
stability) would help counteract migration of risk beyond the current regulatory perimeter. This
and other needed amendments to the BSP Charter related to supervision—limited scope to
access data on all banks’ related entities, weak legal protection for supervisors in the conduct of
their duties, and the ”extraordinary due diligence” requirement on supervisors—should be
rapidly approved. The recent approval of the law allowing additional foreign bank entry into the
domestic market through subsidiaries or branches (to a maximum of 40 percent of sector
assets)—in preparation for the start of the ASEAN Economic Community—will bring a more
competitive environment and could reduce concentration exposures at individual banks.
However, managing the associated risks requires vigilant oversight and strong coordination with
home country supervisors.

Authorities’ Views
22.

The authorities remain watchful for financial stability risks that may arise from strong

Specifically, the temporary exemption to the single borrower limit (the standard limit is 25 percent of bank capital)
for purchases of oil (an additional 15 percentage points) lapsed in March 2014, and while the temporary exemption
to finance PPPs (an additional 25 percent) was kept until 2016, new provisions were added excluding affiliates of the
lending bank from the SBL exemption.

Fundamental support to real estate is provided by large unmet housing needs, sustained growth
of remittances and the business process outsourcing sector (with the latter fuelling demand for
both office and residential space), and prudent business practices of major real estate
developers. Standard indicators—price to rent ratios, occupancy rates, and bank exposures—do
not signal quantity imbalances or price bubbles in the property sector. Nonetheless, there has
been a notable increase in purchasing and renting of residences by young professionals, of
luxury condominiums by high-income expatriates, and of properties for the use of—or
investment by—Overseas Filipinos. The BSP closely monitors lending to real estate and has
required banks to carry out stress tests twice a year on the effect of a 20 percent and 50 percent
write off of various credit exposures, including real estate, on banks’ balance sheets.14 The
existing 20 percent cap on banks’ real estate exposures may be modified or new
macroprudential measures introduced based on the results of the stress tests and enhanced
monitoring by the BSP. Regarding the temporary SBL exemptions, banks’ PPP exposures are
currently very small. On foreign bank entry, scope exists to increase the number of market
participants, and this is consistent with preparations for ASEAN economic integration by 2020.
Amending the BSP Charter is one of the government’s legislative priorities.

D. Fiscal Policy
Background
23.

From a macroeconomic perspective, fiscal policy has focused in recent years on
strengthening resilience and building a fiscal buffer. Sustained primary surpluses and rapid
GDP growth caused general government debt to continue to moderate, reaching 39 percent of
GDP at end-2013. In addition, the quality of public debt in terms of maturity, repricing risk, and
currency composition has improved (Appendix 4). In 2013, the consolidated general government
account was close to balance—with a deficit of less than 1½ percent of GDP at the national
government (NG) level, well below the 2 percent target—on higher revenue collection coupled
with slow budget execution. The authorities are targeting a NG deficit of 2 percent of GDP
through 2016 (consistent with a general government deficit of about 1 percent of GDP).
For 2014, this includes 1 percentage point of GDP in post-disaster reconstruction spending, of
which one-fifth is financed by reallocating other expenditure.

Staff Position
24.

Conditioned on adopting appropriately restrictive monetary and financial policies,
raising the fiscal deficit from 2014 is warranted to accommodate reconstruction and other
priority spending. Spending bottlenecks kept fiscal policy countercyclical in 2013, partly
mitigating the accommodative monetary conditions. Scope to make room for reconstruction
spending solely by reallocating other expenditure is constrained by the low fiscal spending ratio

14

Banks are expected to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent after adjusting for the stress test results,
with universal and commercial banks required to also maintain a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

that, in turn, reflects low tax collections and previous spending bottlenecks, and the need to
protect priority social spending.15 Raising the NG deficit from below 1½ percent of GDP in 2013
to 2 percent of GDP in 2014, as budgeted, would, however, imply a stimulus on the order of
1 percent of potential GDP at a time when the output gap is already positive, and should
therefore be countered with tighter monetary and credit conditions. Keeping the NG deficit
unchanged thereafter is seen as broadly neutral and would continue to moderate the public
debt ratio to below 30 percent of GDP by 2019.
25.

Significant additional revenue is required to finance large recurrent priority spending
needs. To achieve the authorities’ ambitious—though appropriate—planned increase in
infrastructure and social spending (see below) and offset revenue loss from possible future
reductions in statutory tax rates, adjustments in tax brackets, and dissipation of cyclical revenue,
a significant increase in structural revenue is needed.16 Mobilizing the needed revenue should
rely primarily on broadening the tax base by reducing corporate income tax holidays, narrowing
the VAT gap, and adopting a new mining strategy,17 supported by further improvements in tax
administration. If adopted, the identified tax policy measures could yield 2‒3 percentage points
of GDP, sufficient to finance the envisaged doubling in infrastructure spending.

Authorities’ Views
26.

The trend decline in public debt demonstrates the government’s commitment to fiscal
prudence as it continues to generate fiscal space in support of policy priorities. Favorable
domestic funding conditions and achieving investment grade lowered government-borrowing
costs, allowing fiscal resources to be redirected to projects supportive of inclusive growth. Slow
absorption of funds by some government agencies has held back spending in recent years.
However, the increased fiscal space this generated provides the government flexibility to
increase spending in 2014. The government is also pursuing various expenditure management
reforms to sustain the higher momentum in government spending.

27.

Revenues have been boosted by enhanced tax administration, which will ensure that
positive developments in government finances will continue. To promote and sustain
macroeconomic stability, spending must be supported by adequate revenue. Hence, continuing
to improve tax administration through various revenue enhancement measures and programs,

15

Spending on conditional cash transfers is expected to increase by 0.1 percentage points of GDP in 2014.

16

Of the 1¾ percentage point increase in the revenue ratio during 2010−13, ⅓ percentage points reflects higher “sin
tax” excise rates on alcohol and tobacco, with about ¾ percentage points attributed to improved tax administration
and compliance.

th

Although the Philippines is estimated to possess the 5 largest mineral deposits in the world, valued around
US$1.4 trillion, mining accounts for only 1 percent of GDP. This reflects a moratorium on new projects during 2011 to
mid-2013 and lingering uncertainty regarding the new mining tax regime. To realize mining’s potential contribution
to GDP and public finances, a new mining strategy is needed, based on good stewardship of resources and more
equitable tax arrangements.

14

while moving forward with rationalizing fiscal incentives, developing the fiscal regime for the
mining industry and fully implementing the 2012 sin tax law are priorities.

STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION FOR QUALITY
GROWTH
Background
28.

Sustaining growth. The Philippines has advanced 28 places since 2009 (to 59th position) in
the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Rankings. However, large gaps remain in
infrastructure adequacy, government bureaucracy and red tape, and labor regulations. The
government plans to more than double its infrastructure spending to 5 percent of GDP by 2016
and established a pipeline of Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects (Box 6). According to the
World Bank, foreign ownership limits in the Philippines are among the most restrictive in East
Asia, consistent with its very low FDI stock.18 The high statutory corporate income tax rate
(30 percent) combined with widespread income tax holidays creates inefficiencies and
disproportionately benefits incumbents. Limited competition in key industries also serves to
discourage investment.

29.

Increasing inclusiveness. The incidence of poverty fell to 25 percent in mid 2013 from
28 percent in 2012, the first sizable decline in a decade, although the series of natural disasters
in late 2013 may have partly reversed this progress.19 In the labor market, employment grew
only half as fast as GDP in 2013—well below the rate needed to absorb the nearly one million
labor force entrants each year—although the unemployment rate declined to 7 percent in
April 2014, nearly ½ percentage point lower than a year earlier.20 The underemployment rate,
although moderating to 18¼ percent in April, remains elevated. Agriculture, which provides
some 31 percent of employment, has stagnated on high transport costs and unclear property
rights stemming from land reform for small-scale farmers, which have discouraged sectoral
investment and resulted in low productivity and employment. Public social assistance has
expanded significantly in recent years through conditional cash transfers (CCTs, Box 8) and

18

The Constitution explicitly restricts foreign ownership and management in a number of sectors. For natural
resources, public utilities, and educational institutions, corporations must be at least 60 percent owned by Filipinos.
Advertising is restricted to corporations 70 percent owned by Filipinos, while mass media and all professions are
open only to Filipinos. In addition to the constitutional restrictions, the Foreign Investment Act gives the Philippine
president the authority to impose foreign ownership restrictions in other sectors through the bi-annual Foreign
Investment Negative List. The latest order, issued in October 2012, expanded the number of restricted sectors and
activities. Since 2000, only large retailers and casinos have seen reductions in foreign ownership restrictions.
19

Based on the national definition of poverty. On the World Bank’s US$2 per day threshold (in purchasing power
terms), some 41 percent of the population was below the poverty line in 2009, compared to 29 percent under the
national definition (Figure 9).
20

Employment gains over the past year were mainly in retail and wholesale trade and construction. Nonetheless,
recent growth has been less employment intensive than previously, leading to some 500,000 missing jobs as of 2013
and still high structural unemployment (Chapter 2 of the accompanying selected issues).

universal health insurance coverage (with the latter financed by higher excise taxes on tobacco
and alcohol since 2013.

Staff Position
30.

Continuing to improve the business climate would help maintain the economy’s
growth momentum and broaden its sectoral underpinnings. Recent improvements in fiscal
transparency and public financial management have helped to increase the efficiency of public
spending and instill better governance, which should help catalyze private sector activity (Box 9).
Deeper integration through the ASEAN Economic Community 2015 and other prospective
multilateral trade agreements (RCEP, TPP) will intensify regional competition in product markets
and for investment. Scaling back generous perpetual income tax holidays that favor incumbents,
relaxing limits on foreign ownership, approving a comprehensive Competition Law that
establishes an independent fair trade commission, and further improving the investment
climate—including by cutting red tape, which raises the level and unpredictability of business
costs—would help realize the potential benefits these arrangements can bring in terms of new
sources of growth and employment. Reducing the infrastructure backlog in transport and
electricity is critical, but removing operational bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty, which are
impeding the execution of public projects and PPPs, is also essential.

31.

Sustained job rich growth is needed to help break the cycle of poverty and outward
labor flows. Increased public spending on CCTs, universal health coverage for the poor and
public education are helping to better social outcomes. However, creating stable jobs is the one
of the most effective ways to achieve permanent poverty reduction. In addition to improving the
overall business climate (as discussed above), faster growth in labor intensive sectors—agro
business and activities of micro, small, and medium sized firms—is needed to absorb the large
pool of less skilled workers, many of whom are underemployed. Granting individual ownership
titles to small land parcels would allow land to be used as collateral to back business loans, while
building farm-to-market roads and increasing competition on inter island shipping would lower
transport costs. Reducing red tape and labor market rigidities (including high firing costs and
strict limits on apprenticeships and fixed-term contracts), which disproportionately burden
SMEs, would support business expansion and job creation. Small-scale entrepreneurs would also
benefit from greater access to formal credit services, where intermediation costs are lower.21
Boosting resilience to natural disasters through “build back better” programs and low cost
insurance schemes would reduce the risk that households fall back into poverty when a natural
disaster strikes. Improving prospects for domestic employment would reduce incentives for
working abroad, and the concomitant social hardships and challenges for macroeconomic
management from large remittances in the absence of compensating productivity gains.

21

See Chapter 3 of the accompanying selected issues.

Authorities’ Views
32.

The authorities remain committed to achieving rapid, socially inclusive economic
growth. The President’s good governance agenda has proven to be an effective reform platform
for delivering significant improvements in government efficiency and transparency, as noted by
the World Economic Forum, the IFC, and in the IMF’s Fiscal Transparency Assessment. Further
boosting public spending on social programs and infrastructure are planned, in line with
available revenue, with PPPs serving to mobilize private sector resources for infrastructure
development. To reap the benefits of ASEAN integration, further improvements to the
investment environment will be directed toward relaxing those foreign ownership limits that do
not require amending the constitution, rationalizing tax incentives, and institutionalizing
transparency and governance reforms to ensure their irreversibility.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.

The Philippine economy continued to perform robustly in 2013. Strong macroeconomic
fundamentals and financial sector buffers, together with the authorities’ flexible policy response
to evolving external conditions, cushioned the impact of volatile capital flows. However,
domestic monetary and financial conditions are now very accommodative. Notable progress was
also achieved in lowering the poverty rate, although the incidence of poverty and under- and
unemployment remain elevated.

34.

Macroeconomic prospects are expected to remain favorable going forward.
Reconstruction from super typhoon Yolanda, infrastructure spending and remittance-driven
private consumption will support rapid GDP growth, but the pace is likely to ease somewhat on
more restrictive financing conditions that would help to temper inflation, narrow the positive
output gap, and enhance financial stability. The current account surplus is forecast to decline
gradually, with the real effective exchange rate moving in line with structural flows.

35.

This favorable outlook could be buffeted by external and domestic events. Abrupt exit
from exceptionally loose monetary policies abroad, a sharp slowdown in China or other
emerging markets, or a major geopolitical incident could impact global or regional trade and
capital flows and adversely affect the Philippine economy. On the domestic front, rapid credit
growth or a disproportionate flow of resources to the property sector could boost short-term
growth but heighten volatility thereafter, impacting over-leveraged households and corporates.

36.

The challenge is to deliver high quality growth. Better realizing the Philippines’ potential
for rapid, sustained and more inclusive growth calls for further reducing bottlenecks to
investment and formal sector employment that may be discouraging broad based business
activities. A more diversified production structure would strengthen resilience to economic
shocks, which unduly impact the poor. Favorable demographics are a missed opportunity if the
economy cannot effectively absorb the growing working age population. Better domestic job
opportunities would reduce poverty, thereby curtailing outward migration and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

PHILIPPINES

accompanying social hardships and sustained remittance inflows that can complicate
macroeconomic management in the absence of compensating productivity gains.
37.

The economy is well positioned for a more restrictive policy setting, together with a
needed rebalancing of the policy mix towards an expansionary fiscal policy. The large
buildup of reserves in recent years by leaning against the wind of sustained inflows suggests the
external sector is moderately stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals.
Incomplete sterilization and exceptionally loose monetary policies in advanced economies
compressed domestic interest rates to low levels. A tighter overall policy stance is now needed
to maintain macrofinancial stability, with a rebalancing of the policy mix in order to
accommodate fiscal spending for post typhoon reconstruction and infrastructure upgrading.

38.

Continuing to proactively tighten monetary conditions would address both potential
inflation and generalized financial stability risks. With market interest rates well below the
policy rate, the BSP’s decisions to withdraw liquidity by drawing down reserves and raising
reserve requirements earlier this year were appropriate. Additional tightening of monetary and
financial conditions is needed with a focus on measures that would not encourage a further shift
in financial intermediation to nonbanks, including by raising official interest rates. Providing the
BSP with suitable instruments to undertake sterilization would improve the effectiveness of
monetary policy. With official reserves more than adequate, the exchange rate should adjust
more fully to structural balance of payments flows, while symmetrically smoothing the effect of
cyclical capital flows.

39.

Additional targeted action is needed to contain specific risks to the financial system.
Early adoption of Basel III capital requirements, monitoring a broader definition of banks’ real
estate exposure, standardizing “contract to sell” financing arrangements for developers, and
establishing the Financial Stability Coordination Council were appropriate preemptive responses
to deepening financial intermediation. Taking further measures is advised to contain risks in the
property sector and to improve oversight and better manage risks from large exposures.
Therefore, the recently-announced bank stress tests for real estate exposure are commendable.
Widening the BSP’s mandate to include financial stability would help prevent diversion of
systemic risk to the shadow-banking sector and strengthen powers for managing risks
associated with greater cross border financial integration.

40.

Continuing to focus on mobilizing stable sources of revenue would ensure room for
structural spending priorities while preserving fiscal prudence. Increasing the national
government deficit to 2 percent of GDP in 2014 and maintaining it thereafter is appropriate to
continue to build fiscal buffers and moderate the debt ratio. To achieve sustainable and inclusive
economic growth, larger public spending is needed for disaster remediation, infrastructure
upgrading and to support improved social outcomes. Meeting these spending demands
requires a sizable tax effort, which should focus mainly on broadening the tax base by reducing
exemptions and allowances and adopting a new mining strategy, supported by improvements in
tax administration.

41.

Further reforms to attract investment and create new employment would help sustain
vibrant economic growth and make it more inclusive. Relaxing limits on foreign ownership,
reducing red tape, and limiting tax holidays that tend to favor incumbents and distort the tax
system would increase market contestability, support execution of PPPs, and better position the
Philippines to benefit from the growth and employment opportunities of deeper regional
integration. Increasing job creation in agriculture and in micro and small firms calls for
establishing clear property rights for small-scale farms, expanding access to formal credit, and
reducing labor market rigidities.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Philippines: Natural Disaster Risks and Addressing Their Social and Economic Consequences
Disaster risk: The Philippines ranked third highest in the 2012 World
Risk Index, which measures exposure to natural hazards and the capacity
1/
to cope and adapt to these events. Island states and archipelago
countries were found to be most at risk given their susceptibility to
cyclones, floods, and sea-level rise, especially in countries with weak
economic and social development. The Pacific Rim—where the
Philippines is located—is also exposed to earthquakes. In fact, a World
Bank study finds that half the Philippines’ land area, and 80 percent of its
population, is vulnerable to natural disasters (World Bank, 2008).
According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters,
225 significant natural disasters were recorded in the Philippines
2/
during 2000−12. Tropical storms and floods were the most frequent
events, as well as the most damaging in terms of lives lost and affected
population.
The private sector has typically borne 90 percent of the damage and
losses from natural disasters in the Philippines, according to the Global
3/
Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. Property loss and
population displacement disrupt employment patterns, often for
prolonged periods. Poorer segments of the population tend to be the
most affected, leading to a sustained increase in localized poverty rates.

Typhoon Yolanda, the strongest storm ever to make landfall and with a
storm surge of up to 7 meters, struck the central Philippines on

killed, 1,785 remain missing, 4.1 million people were displaced, and
4/
1.1 million houses were damaged or destroyed. All told, 14 million
people (more than 14 percent of the population) were impacted by the storm.

Prior to the storm, the affected region accounted for 17½ percent of GDP and included 31 percent of the population
(29 million people). The area is intensive in agriculture (27 percent of national output), with a smaller share of countrywide
industry and services. Average household income in 2012 was 75 percent of the national average, and more than half of all
households were heavily dependent on income from agriculture and remittances. Poverty rates in the region—ranging
between 29 percent and 41 percent—were well above the national average of 22 percent.
The official estimate of the typhoon-related damage and loss amounts to US$13 billion (about 5 percent of GDP), including
destroyed physical assets and near-term foregone income. As with previous disasters, the private sector is thought to have
incurred about 90 percent of the cost. Private losses were uninsured. Preliminary estimates suggest that the impact on
economic activity at the national level was fairly limited, reflecting the relatively lower incomes and weaker economic
dynamism of the affected regions.
Fiscal response: The government’s Reconstruction Assistance on Yolanda (RAY) plan from December 2013 is intended to
guide the public sector’s recovery and reconstruction response. Based on the principle of building back better, economic
and social conditions are to be restored or improved compared with pre-typhoon levels, and disaster resilience is to be
upgraded. The plan envisages close coordination between government agencies, local government units, international
donors, civil society, and the private sector. The government has earmarked some ₱ 120 billion (1 percent of GDP) for
reconstruction spending in 2014. In addition, a Multi-donor Trust Fund will be established to coordinate the deployment of
foreign grants. For the longer term, the government is considering to establish a Climate Change and Disaster Resiliency
Fund to reduce vulnerability and economic losses associated with future natural disasters.

Box 2. What is Driving Philippines’ Growth?
While growth in many EMs has recently slowed, in the Philippines, growth has remained resilient. To what extent does this
divergent growth path reflect domestic factors—such as policy responses and structural reforms—and how much can be
attributed to external developments in major economies— including unconventional monetary policies (UMPs), and shifts in
foreign demand and commodity prices? This box examines this question using a structural VAR developed for Emerging Market
Economies (EMEs) in the April 2014 World Economic Outlook. External effects are measured by: (i) a U.S. block (real GDP growth,
inflation, 10-year treasury bond yield); (ii) a China block (real GDP growth); (iii) a block for financial and trade prices (composite
EMBI Global and country-specific terms of trade); and (iv) a country-specific domestic block (real GDP growth, inflation, real
exchange rate change against the U.S. dollar, short-term interest rate). Identification is established on the assumption that
external variables are unaffected by domestic variables within a given quarter.
For the Philippines, the model finds that since the GFC: (i) the explanatory power of external factors has gradually waned (giving
a greater role to internal factors, which are obtained residually); (ii) China’s contribution has generally been smaller than that of
other external factors, although typically of the same sign; and (iii) contributions from external and internal factors have generally
been of the same sign for much of the post GFC period, but recently, they have moved in opposite directions, with external
factors creating a small drag on growth, reflecting the China slowdown. For other EMEs, the growth pattern and its
decomposition were similar to the Philippines’ during 2009−10. Thereafter, however, external factors dominated, dragging down
growth.

Historical Decomposition of Real GDP Growth

Why have internal factors tended to play a more prominent role
in Philippine GDP growth recently, in contrast to other EMEs? Part
of the explanation may be due to the fact that the Philippines is
relatively less open to trade and financial flows than most other
EMEs. In fact, external growth contributions around the start of
the GFC were smaller in the Philippines than in other EMEs. Also,
actual (and potential) growth is thought to have risen in recent
years in response to ongoing structural reforms.
In addition, domestic interest rates are also likely to have played a
role. This can be seen by decomposing the domestic 3-month
T-bill rate using the same structural VAR model as above. External
contributions to domestic interest rates are found to have turned
increasingly negative in recent years as activity in major
economies slowed, world commodity prices moderated, UMPs
were introduced, and EMEs’ interest spreads narrowed. However,
internal factors also played a large dampening role since 2011.
This likely reflects the impact of sizable structural current account
inflows that—being only partly sterilized—further loosened
domestic monetary and financial conditions and, in turn, provided additional support for GDP growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

PHILIPPINES

Box 3. Philippines: Financial Flows
As a share of GDP, net financial flows into the Philippines have moved broadly in line with the emerging market
average during the past two decades. However, financial
flows were above average prior to the Asian Financial Crisis,
peaking at 12¼ percent of GDP in 1996, then moderating
during the 2000s, and rebounding briefly in the aftermath of
the global financial crisis (GFC). Net financial flows were near
zero in 2013.
Underlying this pattern of net flows are larger—and
opposing—gross flows by residents and nonresidents.
Specifically, nonresidents lend to Philippine residents (i.e.,
residents are incurring liabilities) while residents
simultaneously place assets abroad, and vice versa. This
offsetting pattern of gross capital flows may reflect portfolio
diversification by residents in the presence of relatively
shallow domestic capital markets, as noted in the WEO
(October 2013). It is also likely to reflect placement abroad
by residents of collateral needed to secure external loans
and round tripping by domestic banks in response to
restrictions on shifting forex funding between banks’ peso
and foreign currency banking units. However, this “normal”
offsetting pattern was interrupted during the extreme risk
aversion at the height of the GFC, when asset and liability
flows were reinforcing, implying that both residents and
nonresidents exited, in contrast to the home bias behavior
evident in other EMs at that time.
Cumulative financial flow data since 2005 indicate that
banks initially experienced financial outflows (reflecting
placement of assets abroad), but then gradually drew down
those assets beginning in early 2010 to reach a small net
external liability position in 2012. Banks cut their external
borrowing immediately following the Fed’s taper talk in
Q2:2013. Government liabilities picked up in the two years
following the GFC (coinciding with the temporary fiscal
stimulus), but these have stabilized since 2011. Liabilities of
other sectors to nonresidents also ticked up since the GFC.
On the other hand, cumulative net FDI flows are marginally negative, indicating that residents’ outward FDI
exceeds nonresidents’ inward FDI.

Box 4. Philippines: What is Happening to Potential Growth?
Previously dubbed the “sick man of Asia” for its relatively slow growth in previous decades, the Philippines recorded
among the fastest growth in Asia during the past two years. Rapid growth occurred alongside strong macroeconomic
outcomes and a focus on good governance that earned the
Philippines an investment grade credit rating in 2013, reduced risk
premia and buoyed consumer and investor confidence. At the same
time, global and domestic financing conditions were
accommodative. Does the recent growth performance reflect
increased potential or is it due to cyclical factors? The answer to
this question is critical for designing appropriate macroeconomic
policies and for identifying structural policies that can help sustain
the growth takeoff.
Several approaches are used to estimate potential growth.
Three widely-used approaches are applied here. Although each is
subject to uncertainty, the fact that a similar picture emerges from
each—namely, that potential growth in the Philippines has
increased from around 4−5 percent in the 2000s to about
6−6½ percent by 2013—suggests the results are robust.



Univariate filtering. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) approach is
commonly used to decompose output into cycle and trend
components. However, the financial cycle—which tends to
occur at lower frequencies than business cycles and may not
be associated with inflation—can also impact GDP growth.
Extending the HP filter to incorporate information about the
financial cycle (e.g., real credit, property prices) yields a
finance-neutral estimate of potential output (Borio and
others, 2013). Applying this approach shows that potential
growth rose more in the Philippines in 2013 than the other
ASEAN-5, even controlling for increase in cyclical growth.
Nonetheless, the cyclical component of growth was around
1 percent of GDP.



Production function. A simple growth accounting framework based on a production function is used to decompose
potential output into its determinants—human capital
augmented-labor, capital, and a residual (interpreted as total
factor productivity, TFP). The results suggest that potential
growth has risen to about 6−6¼ in 2013 led by an increase in
TFP and capital accumulation.



Multivariate time-series. A multivariate filter is constructed
that leverages information from output, inflation,
unemployment, capacity utilization and expectations of
inflation and growth (from Consensus Forecasts) to infer
potential growth, both historically and in real time. The results
show a rising trend in potential growth to 6−6½ percent by
end-2013.

Unlike other Emerging Market countries, which have tended show a
declining trend in potential growth (see Box 2 and WEO October 2013, Box 1.2), potential growth in the Philippines has
recently risen. With a low investment rate and an expected demographic dividend, there is scope to further raise potential
growth through capital deepening and higher employment, as well as sustaining the trend rise in TFP, provided further
progress is made on improving the business climate.

Box 5. Philippines: Recent Monetary and Liquidity Policy Measures
During the past several years, the BSP deployed a range of policy tools to discourage speculative
activity, strengthen liquidity management, and lower sterilization costs:



Prohibited (since end 2013) external funds and direct placements by nonbanks in the SDA—a
short-term sterilization facility with a balance that peaked around US$40 billion (16 percent of GDP)
in early 2013—and gradually lowered the remuneration rate to 2 percent (since April 2013), below
the 3½ percent policy rate;



Ceased to remunerate (since April 2012) and raised the rate of required reserves (now at 20 percent
for universal and commercial banks as of May 2014);



Increased capital charges (in January 2012) and introduced limits on banks’ nondeliverable forward
(NDF) positions (in March 2013);



Gradually curtailed (beginning in late 2010) its forex forward book (counterpart to one leg of banks’
forward positions, used for hedging); and



Together with the Treasury, implemented the Treasury Single Account (since late 2013),
consolidating national government cash resources into an account at the BSP.

Box 6. Philippines: Status of Public-Private Partnership Projects
To help close the Philippines’ large infrastructure gap, in 2010 the government launched a series of
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
The projects span various sectors, with

largest share. Over the past year, the
pipeline of PPPs was expanded
considerably from 22 to 57 projects, with a
total identified cost of 9 percent of 2013
GDP, although numerous projects have yet
to be priced. Issues arising in the planning,
bidding, and implementation stages have
slowed progress considerably, however.
Seven projects with a total value of
62.6 billion pesos have been awarded to
private contractors, and are at various
stages of execution, although none was

completed by end 2013. In this context,
proposed amendments to the Build-Operate-Transfer law that give the national government additional
powers in the case of PPPs of national importance to facilitate land acquisition for these projects could
relieve some regulatory uncertainty for investors and accelerate project execution. Public resources to
meet contingent fiscal liabilities arising from PPPs were increased in the 2014 Budget.

Box 7. Philippines: A Cross-Country Perspective on Bank Credit Penetration
After contracting sharply in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis, the GDP ratio of bank credit to the
private sector in the Philippines has risen steadily since mid-2006, reaching 35 percent of GDP in 2013. Lending
by banks has been growing at an annual rate of 10−20 percent in recent years.
The Philippines’ bank credit ratio (BCR) is low relative to many EMs in Asia and Europe, but similar to that in
major Latin American EMs and Indonesia. However, conditioned on per capita income, the Philippines’ (and
Indonesia’s) BCR appears relatively high. Unlike many other EMs, households account for a small share of banks’
loan portfolios (7 percent of GDP and 15¾ percent of total bank loans).

While domestic bank loans still dominate, other
sources of formal credit (bonds, external loans) are
gaining in importance, and total debt of the nonbank
private sector has risen steadily to around 55 percent
of GDP. The vast majority of this debt is extended to
corporates. On average, leverage of listed companies
is low at 100 percent in 2012. However, debt is
unevenly distributed across firms, and companies with
leverage ratios above 200 percent account for about
one-third of total corporate debt.
Informal credit activity is also thought to be sizable.
About 10 percent of households include an overseas
Filipino worker who sends back remittances. While a large part of these inflows is channeled to banks and other
formal savings vehicles, a sizable part is deployed in the informal sector. Survey results indicate that 39 percent
of the adult population obtained a loan from friends or family during the previous year, compared to 11 percent
for a bank loan. Nonbank borrowing is considerably more prevalent in the Philippines than in other EMs.

Box 8. Philippines: Conditional Cash Transfer Program
The Philippines’ Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program provides modest cash transfers to poor
households in exchange for recipients’ compliance with certain basic education and health requirements.

1/

The program, which began as a pilot in 2007, has grown rapidly, and at end 2013 covered 3.9 million
households, or 75 percent of all households identified as poor by the national targeting scheme. With
growth of close to 70 percent per annum during 2010−13, the budget expenditure reached nearly
2/

0.4 percent of GDP by 2013.

While the Philippines’ CCT is relatively recent
compared with Latin American countries, where
programs were initiated in the 1990s, coverage is
now the third largest in the world (behind Brazil and
Mexico). Together with universal health insurance,
the CCT program is a cornerstone of the Philippine
authorities’ social protection efforts. The design of
the CCT program was modeled on the Latin
American programs, although assistance to children
is provided for a longer period (from birth to age 14)
than in the Latin American programs (Reyes and
others, 2013).
Studies have found generally good compliance and positive impacts from the program. The World Bank
(2013) concludes the program is meeting its objective of improving school attendance and health
outcomes for younger children, although there was no significant impact on school enrollment among
older children aged 12−14 years.
The authorities are further expanding the program in 2014. Coverage is targeted to expand to 4.3 million
households and the program is to be extended to children up to 18 years of age. In support of these goals,
the CCT allocation in the 2014 budget is 42 percent higher than in the 2013 budget.
__________________________________
1/ To be eligible, households must reside in poor areas, be classified as poor, have a pregnant woman or at least one
child of eligible age, and be willing to commit to meeting program conditions. Conditions are: (i) pregnant women
must avail of pre- and post-natal care and be attended during childbirth by a trained health professional, (ii) parents
must attend Family Development Sessions (FDS), (iii) 0−5 year old children must receive regular preventive health
checkups and vaccines, (iv) 6−14 years old children must receive deworming pills twice a year, and (v) all child
beneficiaries (0−18 years old) must enroll in school and maintain a class attendance of at least 85 percent per month.
Benefitting households receive ₱500 per month for health and nutrition expenses, and ₱300 per child for educational
expenses, up to three children. Starting 2014, they will receive ₱500 per older child up to 18 years of age.

Box 9. Philippines: Progress in Fiscal Transparency
Improving fiscal transparency has been a priority in the Philippines in recent years. The public financial management (PFM)
reform strategy is a key plank in support of the Philippines governance reform agenda. The Philippines has also played a
leading role in international fiscal transparency initiatives, such as the Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency (GIFT).
The authorities’ reform efforts are beginning to bear fruit, as recognized by the IMF’s Fiscal Transparency Evaluation in
early 2014 that reached a broadly favorable conclusion. The evaluation assessed the Philippines’ PFM practices against the
draft Fiscal Transparency Code covering the three pillars of fiscal reporting, fiscal forecasting and budgeting, and fiscal risk
analysis and management.
Fiscal reporting is relatively comprehensive, frequent and
timely. Comparability of fiscal data against the original
budget is difficult, however, reflecting fragmentation of
agencies involved. Fiscal forecasting and budgeting is
generally good, with several recent improvements,
especially regarding fiscal policy objectives, performance
orientation, public participation, and the
comprehensiveness and orderliness of the budget.
However, budget credibility is undermined by the
complexity and large flexibility of the annual budget
framework. Fiscal risk analysis and management is
relatively strong, as shown by the publication of a
comprehensive fiscal risk statement with a relatively
comprehensive collation of risks that could affect public
finances. However, improvements are needed in a few
areas, especially to capture risks from guarantees and
PPPs, assess the scope of tax expenditures, and introduce
a longer-term perspective in the fiscal sustainability
analysis. The evaluation reveals two crosscutting issues
spanning across the three pillars: (i) the fragmentation of
responsibilities for fiscal management in the public
sector, and (ii) the complexity and flexibility of the budget
system, which complicates fiscal reporting. The evaluation
proposed twelve priority recommendations to address
existing gaps.
Since then, progress in fiscal transparency has continued. The authorities are rolling out technological innovations to speed
up budget release and procurement transactions, improve information flows and strengthen transparency and
accountability. The Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS), which enables timely and
more comprehensive monitoring of budget execution and agency utilization of funds, is currently being developed with a
plan to pilot in 2015 and full implementation in 2016. The authorities also adopted the Treasury Single Account in 2014 for
central government deposits that will be progressively expanded to the wider public sector. Philippines also recently
introduced public websites to track expenditures of public calamity-related resources and to monitor foreign aid receipts.
In fiscal risk management, the authorities intend to strengthen disclosure and management of contingent liabilities,
including PPPs. Finally, the 2014 budget introduced performance-informed budgeting.



Adopt countercyclical
macroprudential policies
(e.g., countercyclical capital charge
on RE or general provisioning
requirement on new RE loans).
Undertake some forex intervention
to avert a vicious depreciationoutflows cycle that would stoke
inflation, but a weaker exchange
rate would be appropriate.
Ensure banks have adequate capital
buffers and do not exceed standard
ceilings on exposures to a single
borrower (defined to include all
affiliated entities).



If China’s growth slowdown is
persistent, the equilibrium real
exchange rate will likely decline. In
addition, the Philippines should
implement structural reforms to
improve its business environment
to spur new sources of growth.



Strictly enforce existing
macroprudential policies and
tighten further.
Ensure adequate bank capital to
absorb credit losses.
Expand the BSP’s mandate to
include financial stability, allowing
it to oversee all nonbank credit
provision.









Proactive rollback by the BSP of
banks’ single borrower limit
(defined to encompass all affiliated
entities), underpinned by credible
agreements between banks and the
conglomerate.
In case of default, rapidly
recapitalize banks to prevent
disruptive credit contraction.
Avoid regulatory forbearance and
fiscal transfers to the affected
conglomerate.
Enhance the BSP’s bank supervisory
capacity by allowing it to collect
information on all bank-affiliated
entities.

Appendix 2. Philippines—External Sector Assessment
Current Account
1.

The Philippines’s current account balance (CAB) has been in surplus during most of
the 2000s, supported by strong worker remittances and dynamic service exports (Figure 2.1).
After running deficits during most of the 1990s, the CAB moved into surplus in 2003, peaking at
5.7 percent of GDP in 2006. This reflected growing worker remittances, a narrowing trade deficit,
as well as higher net service exports. Since the global financial crisis, the CAB has been on a
moderating trend, but rose again by 0.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to 3.5 percent of GDP on a
stronger trade balance.
Figure 2.1. Philippines: Current Account Balance

2.

The strengthening of the CAB since the mid-1990s reflects mainly a sustained fall in the
investment-to-GDP ratio since the Asian financial crisis. Gross capital formation declined from
above 25 percent of GDP in the pre-Asian crisis period to below 20 percent of GDP since the
mid 2000s. National saving also increased, but to a smaller extent (by about 1 percent of GDP on
average). Since the global financial crisis, the smaller CAB reflects the faster decline in saving
than investment, although in 2013 both rose, with saving rising faster.

3.

Relative to GDP, the Philippines’ CAB was similar to that of other emerging market
economies (EMEs) during the 1990s, but has been stronger than most peers in the 2000s
(Figure 2.2). This reflects mainly changes in the Philippines’ investment behavior, which before
the Asian financial crisis was higher than the median for Latin American and other EMEs, but
dipped below most others during the 2000s. However, relative to the median Asian EME, the
Philippines has always had a lower investment ratio. On the other hand, the Philippine national
saving ratio has increased only marginally over time, and has consistently been somewhat
higher than the ratios in Latin America and other regions, but lower than for Asian EMEs.

Effective Exchange Rate
4.

After declining continuously since the Asian financial crisis, the Philippines’ real effective
exchange rate (REER) has been on an upward trend since 2004 (Figure 2.3). The post Asian crisis
real depreciation was mostly due to a fall in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). The
early part of the post 2004 real appreciation was also associated with nominal appreciation, but
since 2007 the real appreciation has been fully due to the inflation differential between the
Philippines and its trading partners, with the NEER remaining stable. The Philippines’ post-Asian
crisis real depreciation was stronger than in Malaysia and Thailand. However, this was reversed
since 2004, when the Philippine peso appreciated faster in real terms (46 percent on average in
the Philippines, against 21 and 9 percent, respectively in Thailand and Malaysia).

Reserve Accumulation, Reserve Adequacy and Net International Investment Position
5.

The Philippines has accumulated sizable international reserves since the Asian financial crisis,
and especially since the global financial crisis (Figure 2.4). The BoP surplus reflects mainly current
flows, although net financial inflows contributed to reserve accumulation on occasion (2000,
and 2010−12). As a result, the stock of foreign reserves has risen markedly since the Asian
financial crisis (by 11 percentage points of GDP since 1997). Reserve accumulation accelerated in
the aftermath of the global financial crisis, but slowed in 2013 due to financial outflows. At
end 2013, reserves stood at 31 percent of GDP, and 2.7 times the Fund’s EM reserve adequacy
metric (against the benchmark of 1 to 1½ times). Reserves were also 3½ times short-term
external debt on a residual maturity basis and more than 12 months of imports of goods and
services. This suggests the Philippines holds more reserves than is warranted to meet normal
expected contingencies.
Figure 2.4. Philippines: Balance of Payments and International Reserves

6.

The net international investment position (NIIP) has improved considerably on net foreign
asset buildup by the private and public sectors, which mirrors sustained current account
surpluses. The Philippines’ NIIP stood at -49 percent of GDP in 2001 and rose to −14 percent of
GDP at end 2012. About three-quarters of the increase reflects a decline in liabilities (mostly
other investment and to some extent direct investment). The remaining part is due to increased
foreign assets, mostly official reserves. As of end-2012, reserve assets accounted for 70 percent
of total external assets (US$120 billion), while liabilities from portfolio investment and other
investment accounted for 47 and 35 percent of total external liabilities (US$154 billion),
respectively.

External Balance Assessment (EBA)
7.

The IMF assesses the external sector of its member countries using the External Balance
Assessment (EBA) methodology. EBA comprises three approaches for assessing the CAB and
REER compared to their norms based on the country’s fundamentals and desired policies
(Table 2.1 and Figure 2.5).

2/ The CAB gap is defined as the difference between the actual CAB and the CAB norm.
3/ A negative REER gap indicates undervaluation. The REER gap for the external sustainability approach
corresponds to the current account gap, divided by the semi-elasticity of the current account with
respect to the REER (estimated at 0.16 for the Philippines).



The EBA’s Current Account Regression approach suggests that a current account deficit—rather
than a surplus—is appropriate for the Philippines. This reflects the Philippines’ fast growing
population, low per capita income, and strong growth prospects relative to its peers, despite
sizable institutional risk.1 The gap between the fitted and the actual CAB first opened in 2001,
and has since widened, reaching 6.3 percent of GDP in 2013. The gap rises to 6.9 percent of GDP
when deviations of domestic and foreign policies from their desired levels are taken into
account, although most of the policy deviations are due to the rest of the world.



The External Sustainability approach suggests that the Philippines’ medium-term CAB is slightly
larger than the CAB needed to stabilize the NFA-to-GDP ratio.



The EBA’s REER approach suggests that the REER was mildly stronger than warranted by
fundamentals and desired policies in 2013.

Institutional/political risk is found to reduce the Philippines’ predicted CAB by 2 percentage points of GDP.

and Real Effective Exchange Rate

Technical factors suggest that in the Philippine case, more weight should be given to the
current account regression approach than to the other two approaches. The EBA REER
regression cannot capture the effect on the REER of the rise in permanent income from
remittances and other current earnings. Moreover, the model relies heavily on comparing
current with past levels of the REER, making the result sensitive to the sample period used and
less informative for countries with large swings in the REER.1 The External Sustainability
approach does not assess the appropriateness of the level of the NFA that is being stabilized. In
the Philippine case, arguably a more negative NFA position and a lower CAB would be
consistent with the country’s stage of development and population dynamics.

Extensions to EBA and Other Considerations
9.

The EBA current account regression approach does not take account of several specific
factors relevant for the Philippines’ CAB:



Risk of natural disasters: Natural disasters represent a significant uninsurable risk for the
Philippines, especially the private sector. This could lead to higher precautionary saving and
lower investment (owing to reduced risk-adjusted returns). While on occasion post-disaster
reconstruction spending might be expected to boost investment spending, in practice, such
effects have been limited.



Worker remittances: The strengthening in the Philippines’ CAB coincided with an increase in
remittances from overseas workers. As a result, Philippine gross national income is now

1

Because the REER is an index of relative prices, making cross-country comparisons is infeasible, thus country
dummies are included in the regression. This ensures that the residuals sum to zero for each country over the sample
period. With the actual REER having been on an upward trend in recent years, the fixed effect leads to an under
prediction of recent REER appreciation. Therefore, the REER model result of overvaluation may in large part be a
consequence of the methodology, rather than a reflection of fundamental economic considerations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

PHILIPPINES

some 15 percent above GDP.1 This increase in income may have pushed up the equilibrium real
exchange rate by raising prices of nontraded goods and services, thereby weakening the trade
balance (and the CAB excluding remittances) relative to the counterfactual (see Appendix II of
the 2013 SR). On the other hand, spending from remittances could be lower than from other
types of income if remittance income is perceived to be more uncertain. To the extent that
individual foreign workers perceive a high idiosyncratic risk that their work contracts may not be
renewed, the saving rate out of remittances may be higher than from other types of income.
This would tend to raise the CAB.


Income inequality and target savers: The Philippines’ high-income inequality may boost the
saving rate as high-income households tend to have a lower propensity to consume. The lack of
access to formal banking services by a large share of the population may also increase the
saving rate because of the need to pre-finance the purchase housing or durable goods.



Impediments to investment: As noted above, the strengthening of the Philippines’ CAB since
the Asian crisis coincided with a marked decline in the investment ratio. Balance sheet repair and
rebuilding financial wealth in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis could have depressed
investment on a persistent basis.2 A weak business environment and inadequate infrastructure—
above and beyond that already captured in the EBA CA regression through the
institutional/political risk variable—could also depress investment.

GNI versus GDP
10.

Using gross national income, rather than GDP, to evaluate the current account in EBA leads
to a smaller gap between the current account and its norm. While GNI is similar to GDP for most
countries, GNI is nearly 15 percent larger than GDP in the Philippines owing to worker
remittances that supplement residents’ domestically-generated income. GNI is a better measure
of income, and hence the basis for saving-investment decisions, implying that the CAB should
be scaled by GNI rather than GDP.3 In addition, some of the explanatory variables in EBA should

1

While official data indicate that in 2013 remittances were equivalent to 9¼ percent of GDP, survey based data
indicate that unregistered remittances are about 50 percent larger than those coming through official channels and
captured in official statistics. Therefore, in calculating GNI, staff assumes that total remittances are 1½ times the
officially reported amount (i.e., 15 percent of GDP). This GNI concept differs from the one used by the National
Statistics Office, which assumes all overseas foreign workers are residents, and includes all their income earned
abroad in GNI, resulting in GNI exceeding GDP by about 20 percent in 2013. However, this would tend to overstate
the amount of resources available to people residing in the Philippines because many OFWs have long standing ties
to their host countries and consume much of their income abroad.
2

For example, the World Economic Outlook (Chapter 4, October 2009) finds a significant and persistent fall in
investment after banking crises. Investment falls by 30 percent relative to pre-crisis trend even seven years after the
crisis. Chapter 3 of the April 2014 World Economic Outlook finds that, after financial crisis, the investment rate falls by
about 3 percentage points of GDP relative to pre-crisis trends.
3

We assume that underreporting of remittances is offset by underreporting of net imports, implying that the current
account is correctly measured. This accords with anecdotal reports of customs underreporting and the findings of
Global Financial Integrity’s “Illicit Financial Flows to and from the Philippines: A Study in Dynamic Simulation,
1960‒2011” (February 2014), which finds that underreporting of net trade in 2011 (correcting for entrepot trade with
Hong Kong SAR) amounted to 8 percent of GDP.

PHILIPPINES

also be rescaled using GNI, including the gap in income per capita, net foreign assets to GDP,
public health spending to GDP, cyclically adjusted fiscal balance to GDP, change in foreign
reserves to GDP, and credit to private sector to GDP.1 Rescaling the CAB and the relevant
explanatory variables with GNI instead of GDP reduces the estimated current account gap by
1.5 percentage points to 5.4 percent (Table 2.2).

Role of Natural Disasters and Remittances
11.

Cross-country empirical analysis suggests that precautionary saving due to exposure to
natural disasters has a significant impact on the CAB, but worker remittances do not (Table 2.3).
To analyze the impact of these variables on the CAB requires going beyond the EBA country
sample, which does not include many small countries that are highly exposed to natural
disasters or receive large amounts (relative to GDP) of worker remittances. Instead, a CGER-type
macro-balance methodology is used.2 Extending the CGER-type model by adding the Country
Risk Index from the 2013 World Risk Report as an explanatory variable produces a significant
result at the 10 percent level in the restricted model (Table 2.3, Column D), indicating that
exposure to natural disasters raises the CAB for high-risk countries.3

1

Because EBA is estimated on a large set of countries for which GDP is close to GNI, the estimated EBA coefficients
remain valid.
2

Based on ”Exchange Rate Assessments: Tools for Advanced, Emerging, and Developing Economies” by Francis Vitek
(2014). The model covers 184 countries with annual data between 1973 and 2012. This paper already includes gross
worker remittance inflows as one of the determinants of the CAB (Table 1, Column A), but it is not statistically
significant, and thus is excluded from the restricted model (Table 1, Column B).
3

See United Nations University, WorldRiskReport 2012. When the Country Risk Index is added to the EBA current
account regression, the coefficient is not statistically significant and has the wrong sign. When gross remittance
inflows are added to the EBA current account regression, the coefficient is statistically significant and of the correct
sign. However, these results are largely driven by the Philippines. When a dummy for remittances to the Philippines is
added, the variable is no longer statistically significant. Similarly, when net remittance inflows are considered, instead
of gross remittances, the variable is not statistically significant independent of whether the Philippines is included in
the regression or not. However, the EBA country sample is not appropriate for assessing the effect of remittances or
exposure to natural disasters because most countries in the sample are not affected by these phenomenon.

12.

For the Philippines—with the third highest global risk ranking—these empirical results
suggest that the CAB is raised by 3½ percentage points of GDP relative to peers on account of
the country’s risk of natural disasters.1 The
world risk index consists of two parts—
exposure and vulnerability—and the
Philippines scores high on both components.
High exposure reflects the Philippines’
geography, while high vulnerability is due to
its low level of development, poor
infrastructure and building standards, and
lagging coping and adaptive capacities.
Vulnerability to natural disasters is therefore
amenable to improvement. Reducing
vulnerability to the level of Malaysia (while
keeping exposure unchanged) would lower the predicted CAB by about 1 percentage point of
GDP (i.e., a net increase of 2½ percent of GDP relative to the cross-country average), while
reducing vulnerability to the level of Japan would lower the CAB by about 2 percentage points
of GDP (i.e., a net increase of 1½ percent of GDP).

13.

Because these estimates of the impact of natural disasters on the CAB are obtained outside
of EBA, we err on the conservative side and assume the impact of high exposure and
vulnerability to natural disasters on the Philippine current account is 2½ percent of GDP. This

1

This corresponds to the difference between the Philippines’ world risk index and the cross-country mean value for
2013 times the coefficient on this variable shown in Table 3, Column D (i.e., 0.2*0.187).

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

corresponds to the midpoint between the estimate at the current levels of exposure and
vulnerability (3½ percent of GDP) and the best case scenario in which exposure is reduced to the
level of Japan (1½ percent of GDP).
14.

While cross-country empirical analysis suggests that worker remittances do not have a
significant impact on the CAB (Table 2.3, columns A and C), Vitek (2014) finds they are
associated with a significantly more appreciated REER. Taken together, these results suggest that
the stronger REER brought by remittances weakens the trade balance, with the decline in the
trade balance fully offsetting the amount of remittance inflows, and thus leaving the CAB
unchanged. The Philippines, where the increase in worker remittances was accompanied by a
stronger CAB, is an exception to this general pattern. In fact, among countries receiving worker
remittances of 5 percent of GDP or more, only the Philippines and Nigeria had a current account
surplus in 2012 (Figure 2.6).

Overall Assessment

Several nonstandard factors are thought to have strengthened the Philippines’ current
account balance. These include heightened exposure to natural disaster risk, understating
national income by using GDP, lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis on saving and
investment behavior, elevated income inequality, limited access to credit by much of the
population, risk of contract nonrenewal for foreign workers, and a weak investment climate.
While reliable quantification of impacts is problematic, their total contribution could approach
4 percentage points of GDP. This would reduce the current account gap to about 3 percent of
GDP (Table 2.4).

Staff is of the view that the external sector is moderately stronger than warranted by
medium-term fundamentals and desired policies, implying moderate currency undervaluation.
With official reserves now more than adequate for precautionary purposes, sustained gradual
real appreciation and stepped up imports of investment goods over the medium term are
expected to narrow the current account gap and bring the external sector toward its
multilaterally consistent equilibrium.

Appendix 3. Philippines—Developments in Real Estate
1.

Real activity. Accounting for 12 percent of aggregate output, the construction, real estate
and ownership of dwellings sectors have been important drivers of GDP growth in recent years,
contributing 1.1 percentage points in 2013, although down from 1.4 percentage points in 2012.
Private construction activity declined by 6 percent (y/y) in Q1:2014, pulling down GDP growth by
0.4 percentage point. The slowdown in residential construction is also evident from the drop in
the number of licenses issued by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board to developers
allowing them to sell residential properties. According to Colliers International, this slowdown
reflects the expected completion of a large number of mid- and high-cost condominium
buildings this year, and construction activity will rebound once the existing properties have been
sold. License-to-sell data also indicate that construction activity is shifting toward socialized and
low-cost housing, which provide tax exemptions to developers.

2.

Property prices. In Q4:2013, prices of mid- and high-end condominiums in upscale areas of
metro Manila (only available price series) rose by 13 percent, y/y, similar to growth rates that
prevailed prior to the GFC. However, in real terms, condo prices remain below their peak that
prevailed prior to the Asian financial crisis. This likely reflects in part the large supply increase in
this market segment in recent years. In fact, according to the official Philippine Housing Industry
Plan for 2012‒30, supply of units in the mid­ and high­cost segments of the housing market is
adequate, while the low-end of the market is characterized by severe shortages. Despite the
recent price increases, residential price-to-rent ratios have remained relatively stable at around
14 percent.

3.

Real estate financing. A variety of financing sources is available to residential buyers and
property developers:



Households tap loans from banks and nonbank government financial institutions, developer
financing, and also pay using own resources (especially in the case of overseas Filipino workers
which are thought to account for 20 percent of buyers from major developers). Household real
estate debt amounted to just over 7½ percent of GDP in 2012, with government nonbank
lenders providing half the total. Residential RE loans from banks are used mainly to purchase
high-end properties, and the growth rate of these loans has recently slowed sharply.



Property developers and construction
companies rely on financing from banks,
installment payments from buyers, and
accessing capital markets. Loans to this
segment account for 45 percent of banks’ RE
loans, which in turn account for 18 percent of
banks’ total loan portfolios. The growth rate
of construction loans remains rapid, albeit
from a low base. Receivables from buyers
amount to only 1½ percent of GDP. Real
estate firms and their affiliated holding
companies are also major issuers of debt securities and equity offerings.

4.

Cross-country comparisons. Cumulative increases in real house prices in the Philippines are
modest compared to many other countries. Within Asia, real price increases during 2010‒13
were considerably smaller than in India, Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan POC, and Malaysia. Philippines’
cumulative real house price increases in recent years are very modest compared with price
developments in European countries during the previous decade. The Philippines’ price-to-rent
ratio declined modestly since 2010, and does not signal price misalignment.

58

5.

The share of total construction activity in
GDP in the Philippines has tended to be
relatively high, and inched up in recent
years, surpassing shares in numerous
Asia-Pacific countries, except Australia,
India, Indonesia, China and Japan. However,
the share of construction in GDP in the
Philippines is well below shares in most
European countries during the previous
decade, and even more recently, with the
exception of Ireland. While it is reasonable
to expect a negative relationship between
property price developments and construction activity, the evidence is weak based on the
sample used here in the absence of a broad set of control variables.

Appendix 4. Philippines—Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.

The composition of public debt has improved significantly, reflecting the authorities’ efforts
in prudent debt management:



The average maturity of debt has increased sharply. For peso-denominated central government
debt, the share with maturity of 10 years or longer has risen from 10 percent in 2009 to
42 percent in 2013. With some 90 percent of net general government financing needs having
been met by issuing debt with maturities of 10 years or longer in 2013, maturity extension is set
to continue.



Foreign currency denominated debt has fallen below one-half of the total general government
debt, and its share is projected to continue to decrease.



The ratio of public debt with floating interest rates is also low, at around 7.5 percent.



The authorities are diversifying the investor base, including by issuing retail bonds, and with
maturities of up to 25 years.

2.

The three major rating agencies elevated the Philippines to investment grade status
during 2013, with a further upgrade by one agency in early 2014.

3.

Public debt in the Philippines is sustainable. The baseline scenario projects that the general
government debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to moderate from about 39 percent in 2013 to
about 27 percent of GDP in 2019. Primary surpluses are the main reason for the expected
decrease. The authorities’ commitment to a 2 percent of GDP headline deficit at the national
government level over the medium term implies an average annual primary surplus of over
1 percent of GDP at the general government level. This exceeds the debt stabilizing primary
deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP, based on the assumption of 6 percent real GDP growth, and
3.5 percent inflation in the medium term. Moreover, the growth-interest rate differential will also
contribute to debt reduction, with robust real GDP growth offsetting gradually rising interest
rates. Gross financing needs will remain moderate at around 4−6 percent of GDP throughout the
projection period, although representing a relatively high one-third of general government tax
revenue.

4.

Alternative scenarios reveal that the baseline scenario is conservative. The Philippines
achieved a large scale public debt reduction during the past decade, supported by primary
surpluses, high output growth, and exchange rate appreciation. The historical scenario, in which
real GDP growth, real interest rates, and primary balances are set to 2004−2013 averages, would
lead to more rapid reduction in debt and gross financing needs than in the baseline scenario.
Keeping constant the primary surplus at the level projected for 2014 (1.9 percent of GDP) would
also lead to a lower path for the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs than in the
baseline scenario.

5.

The outlook for economy-wide external debt also remains positive. In recent years, external
debt has steadily declined from close to 80 percent of GDP in 2001 to below 30 percent of GDP
at end2013. Under staff’s baseline scenario, external debt as a ratio to GDP is expected to
continue falling over the medium term due to sustained current account surpluses, strong GDP
growth, and continued peso appreciation. Moreover, debt dynamics appear resilient to various
shocks: one-half standard deviation shocks to interest rates, growth, and the current account
lead to only modest deteriorations in external debt ratios over the medium term. However,
exchange rate volatility remains a vulnerability as a one-time real depreciation of 30 percent
in 2014 would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio by 12 percentage points.

Exchange Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating, while the de facto exchange
arrangement is classified as floating. The value of the Philippine peso is determined in the interbank
foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes in the spot and forward markets in order to
smooth undue short-term volatility in the exchange rate and to strategically build forex reserves.
The Philippines maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and

restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions except
for exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons and notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
Philippines is on the standard 12˗month cycle. The 2013 Article IV consultation was held on
March 29, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 13/102).
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC)
Participation:
MCM: A FSAP was conducted during the fourth quarter of 2001; FSAP missions visited Manila in
October and November–December 2001. The final version of the report was discussed with the
authorities in June 2002. The associated FSSA was discussed by the Executive Board together with
the Article IV staff report in September 2002. The FSAP report was published in March 2004. The
FSAP update mission took place in November 2009, and the report was published in April 2010.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Manila in September 2001. The ROSC report
was discussed by the Executive Board in September 2002 together with the Article IV staff report,
and published in October 2002. The update to the ROSC report was published in June 2004. In
addition, a pilot Fiscal Transparency Evaluation mission took place in February 2014.
STA: A ROSC Data Module mission was conducted in September 2003, and the report was published
in August 2004.
Technical Assistance
The Philippines is an intensive user of IMF technical assistance (TA), particularly in fiscal and financial
areas. Improvements have been made in all areas, but the translation of recommendations into law
has lagged, except for the reform of excises on tobacco and alcohol and the revision to the BSP
Charter for financial supervision, which is currently being discussed in parliament.
In the fiscal area, FAD has executed a TA project financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation
to improve the basic functions of tax administration by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, in line with
recommendations made by FAD TA missions in 2005, 2008, and 2009. The project provided for a
resident tax administration advisor and an extensive program of short-term expert visits. Seeking a
pro-growth and equitable tax system, TA on tax policy in 2013 and early 2014 aimed to improve
revenue yield, rationalize tax expenditures and reform natural resource-based taxation. FAD TA
missions on tax policy provided advice that constituted the basis for the reform of excises on
tobacco and alcoholic beverages implemented in early 2013. In the area of tax administration
reform, progress has been made in the redesign of processes in the core functional areas of audit,

PHILIPPINES

arrears management and, large taxpayer service. A series of TA missions on tax administration,
arrears collections, compliance strategy and VAT audit took place in 2013 and early 2014.
TA on public financial management (PFM) seeks to establish effective and efficient Budget and
Treasury Management. In line with past PFM advice, the government introduced a Treasury Single
Account and is reviewing its cash management and planning. It now produces a midyear report on
the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook and midyear budget execution. In addition, the revenue and
expenditure from off budget accounts are now presented in budget documents. TA on PFM has also
expanded to cover the two main fiscal institutions.
On the legal area, LEG provided TA to the Philippines on Central Banking Legislation in 2012, and
provided advice on the amendment to the Philippines’ Central Banking Law in November 2013. In
April 2013, LEG also provided TA on Implementation of Targeted Financial Sanctions Obligations
under UN Security Council Resolutions Relation to Terrorism Financing.
MCM TA activities in the Philippines seek to develop and implement a risk-focused supervisory
approach in keeping with the Basel Core Principles and other key international supervisory practices.
In terms of outcomes, the authorities adopted Basel II in 2005, and began implementing Pillar 2
(Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)/supervisory review of capital adequacy)
in 2011. In 2010–11, a more concerted effort was made to enhance enforcement and clear a backlog
of problematic institutions; the policy on cease & desist orders (CDO) was approved in August 2011,
and this was followed by the issuance of internal procedural guidance in October 2011. Another key
outcome has been the implementation of the supervisory core training initiative that began in
late 2010. More than ten committees have developed content for new courses, with initial rollout of
the courses in 2011. In 2013, the implementation of the overall program deepened in supervisory
capacity building. The in-house training initiative is now self-sustaining and the quality of the
supervisory reports has shown considerable improvement. A series of TA missions on banking
supervision and training took place in 2013 and early 2014. In addition, a TA mission on liquidity
management and forecasting took place in February 2013, and two missions on supervisory
enforcement took place in August 2013 and February 2014.
A series of STA TA missions on Government Finance Statistics took place in 2012 and 2013 to assist
the authorities in compiling and disseminating government finance statistics in accordance with
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. Additionally, during 2012 STA provided TA to the
Philippines in the areas of Balance of Payments Statistics, Data Dissemination Standards, National
Accounts, and producer and consumer price indices.
Resident Representative
A Resident Representative has been stationed in Manila since January 1984. Mr. Shanaka Jayanath
Peiris has been the Resident Representative for the Philippines since September 2012.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(As of April 23, 2014)
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams for the Philippines exchanged views to coordinate the teams’
work during 2014 through the resident representative’s office and headquarters missions. The teams
agreed on the Philippines’ main macroeconomic challenges to navigate the uncertain global
environment to maintain macroeconomic stability, create policy space to meet future potential
shocks, and build the foundations for faster and more inclusive growth. Based on this shared
assessment, the teams identified three structural reform areas as macro-critical, in view of their
central role in achieving sustained inclusive growth: (1) raising investment, including public sector
capital spending; (2) strengthening public finance and social safety nets; and (3) the financial sector.
Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country teams during
January 2014˗December 2014, along with their expected deliverables, and the division of labor.
The Key Areas with Joint Programs
Strengthening Public Finance
The continued focus on mobilizing fiscal revenue help fund spending in support of sustained and
inclusive growth, while strengthening the resilience to shocks. The Fund and the Bank have a long
standing program of support for strengthening public finance and involve close coordination in
support of tax administration reforms in the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs; tax
policy reform including fiscal incentives rationalization and monitoring of the sin tax
implementation; management of fiscal risks; debt management strategy; strengthening the fiscal
unit in the Department of Finance (focused on assessing and strengthening customs and BIR
performance); and support for the Bureau of Treasury’s lead role in implementation of a Single
Treasury Account (TSA).
Financial Sector
A joint Bank/Fund Financial System Stability Assessment took place in 2009, following up on the
initial joint FSAP in 2002. Following the FSAP recommendations, the Fund has focused on technical
assistance in bank supervision. The Bank has taken the lead in the nonbank financial sector. Joint
areas of interest are banking sector soundness, and capital market development.
Broad agreement among the two teams emerged on the key issues and challenges, and on the
division of tasks to tackle these. It was agreed that further details on collaboration, as necessary,
would be agreed at the technical level as work progresses. The teams have the following requests
for information and collaboration from their counterparts:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in World Bank’s discussions with the
government on financing of infrastructure, PPPs, and implementation of the development policy
loan. Review and sharing of analytical work, in particular the Philippine Development Report
(PDR) series, would be welcome, in addition to follow up from the 2010 FSAP, and on work
related to the reform of social safety nets, public expenditure reviews, and public financial
management.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects and to coordinate closely the technical assistance work, especially in
areas such as tax policy and administration, where the Bank has an existing program in place, as
well as in public expenditure analysis and management, where extensive Bank work is ongoing.

ADB’s private sector operations in Philippines began in 1986. As of December 2013, cumulative
approvals in 27 projects amounted to $792.2 million. ADB’s private sector operations in Philippines
included financing for power plants and investments in banks and private equity funds. In 2008, a
$200 million loan was approved and disbursed for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and operation of
the existing 600-megawatt Masinloc coal-fired thermal power plant in Zambales province by
Masinloc Power Partners Co. Ltd. In 2009, a $120 million loan was approved for KEPCO SPC Power
Corporation for the construction, operation and maintenance of a new coal fired power plant in the
Visayas region using circulating fluidized bed technology. In 2012, an equity investment of
$25 million was approved for Philippine Investment Alliance for Infrastructure Fund.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: As part of a World Bank-funded project, Improving the Quality and Usefulness of the Philippine
System o f National Accounts, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) rebased the national accounts
from 1985 to 2000. Continuing improvements include ongoing efforts to fully implement the System of National
Accounts, 2008. Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national accounts. These
include the coverage of the GDP and the statistical discrepancies in the GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides. The authorities are working on improving (i) the accuracy of the GDP volume measures; (ii) the
coverage of the public corporations sector; (iii) the accuracy of the quarterly GDP data; and (iv) the adoption of
benchmark techniques to reconcile quarterly and annual national accounts estimates. The NSCB is currently
participating in the IMF Statistics Department’s Project on the Implementation of the System of National Accounts and
the International Comparison Program, funded by the Government of Japan. This three-year technical assistance
project provides assistance to improve the quality of the national accounts and price statistics.
Price statistics: In July 2011, the National Statistics Office introduced a rebased consumer price index (CPI). The
updated CPI is compiled using weights based on the 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Data from
the 2008 Commodity and Outlet Survey were used to augment the provincial market baskets. One important
methodological change implemented in the updated CPI is the adoption of the internationally recommended
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the classification of all items. As noted in the above
section, assistance will be provided to improve the quality of price statistics in Philippines.
External sector statistics: Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics. In 2005, the
Central Bank of Philippines (BSP) created a Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate on
compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. Since
deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional channels
that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The authorities have introduced new data
sources, including the Cross Border Transactions Survey and administrative-based reporting systems to address
coverage issues, but challenges remain. The Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about
70−75 percent of foreign exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict banking
secrecy rules.
Monetary and financial statistics: Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the
Fund’s methodology.
Government finance statistics: Provision of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Major areas for
improvement include detailed data for levels of the public sector beyond the national government as well as
transition of fiscal data reporting to the GFSM 2001 format. Fiscal Transparency ROSCs were conducted in 2002
and 2004.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Philippines subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS) in August 1996.

A data ROSC was published in
August 2004.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Philippines

On July 8, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Philippines and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
The Philippine economy has continued to perform robustly. GDP grew by 7¼ percent in 2013,
supported by strong remittances from overseas workers and accommodative monetary and
financial conditions. Due to its occurrence late in the year, super-typhoon Yolanda’s impact
on 2013 growth was limited, but a somewhat greater effect is likely in 2014. Growth is expected
to ease in 2014 also in response to normalizing domestic financial conditions. Growth already
slowed in the first quarter of 2014, in part due to temporary factors. Inflation remained below the
bottom of the target band (4±1 percent) for much of last year, but picked up since late 2013 and
is currently around 4½ percent because of pass through of the weaker peso, typhoon-related
disruptions to food production, increases in rice prices and higher electricity prices. The current
account surplus rose to 3½ percent of GDP in 2013 on a narrowing trade deficit. Risks to the
growth outlook are tilted to the downside, and could stem from both domestic and external
sources.
Strong GDP growth in recent years has translated into improved social conditions. Growth has
become less employment intensive, but still reduced the elevated under- and unemployment
rates. Poverty incidence, although declining, remains high, and a large share of the population
remains vulnerable to falling into poverty as a result of natural disasters and other shocks.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are
no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event of a parallel program review is being
completed, it is also completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.

On the policy front, domestic interest rates have been compressed by loose monetary policies
abroad and ample domestic liquidity, partly reflecting the BSP’s decision to restrict nonbanks’
direct access to its Special Deposit Account (SDA)—one of its main sterilization instruments.
Raising banks’ reserve requirements by 2 percentage points earlier this year helped absorb part
of the earlier net injection. Monetary and financial conditions have also been tightened by the
more recent increase in the SDA rate by ¼ percentage point. In the banking system, financial
soundness indicators signal continued strong performance, and capital adequacy ratios stand well
above newly-introduced Basel III requirements. Bank credit growth recently accelerated to
21 percent and loan exposure to real estate has risen.
The level of public debt has moderated to 39 percent of GDP, alongside improvements in the
maturity and currency composition. For 2014, the budget is targeting a deficit of 2 percent of
GDP—up from the 1.4 percent of GDP achieved in 2013—that will accommodate post-disaster
reconstruction spending. The government aims to double public infrastructure spending to
5 percent of GDP by 2016, financed by additional tax revenue, while keeping the deficit
unchanged.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with the Philippines, Executive directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The Philippine economy continued to perform robustly in 2013. Strong macroeconomic
fundamentals and financial sector buffers, together with the authorities’ flexible policy response
to evolving external conditions, cushioned the impact of volatile capital flows. However,
domestic monetary and financial conditions are now very accommodative. Notable progress was
also achieved in lowering the poverty rate, although the incidence of poverty and under- and
unemployment remain elevated.
Macroeconomic prospects are expected to remain favorable going forward. Reconstruction from
super typhoon Yolanda, infrastructure spending and remittance-driven private consumption will
support rapid GDP growth, but the pace is likely to ease somewhat on more restrictive financing
conditions that would help to temper inflation, narrow the positive output gap, and enhance
financial stability. The current account surplus is forecast to decline gradually, with the real
effective exchange rate moving in line with structural flows.
This favorable outlook could be buffeted by external and domestic events. Abrupt exit from
exceptionally loose monetary policies abroad, a sharp slowdown in China or other emerging
markets, or a major geopolitical incident could impact global or regional trade and capital flows
and adversely affect the Philippine economy. On the domestic front, rapid credit growth or a
disproportionate flow of resources to the property sector could boost short-term growth but
heighten volatility thereafter, impacting over-leveraged households and corporates.

3
The challenge is to deliver high-quality growth. Better realizing the Philippines’ potential for
rapid, sustained and more inclusive growth calls for further reducing bottlenecks to investment
and formal sector employment that may be discouraging broad-based business activities. A more
diversified production structure would strengthen resilience to economic shocks, which unduly
impact the poor. Favorable demographics are a missed opportunity if the economy cannot
effectively absorb the growing working-age population. Better domestic job opportunities would
reduce poverty, thereby curtailing outward migration and the accompanying social hardships and
sustained remittance inflows that can complicate macroeconomic management in the absence of
compensating productivity gains.
The economy is well positioned for a more restrictive policy setting, together with a needed
rebalancing of the policy mix towards an expansionary fiscal policy. The large buildup of
reserves in recent years by leaning against the wind of sustained inflows suggests the external
sector is moderately stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals. Incomplete
sterilization and exceptionally loose monetary policies in advanced economies compressed
domestic interest rates to low levels. A tighter overall policy stance is now needed to maintain
macrofinancial stability, with a rebalancing of the policy mix in order to accommodate fiscal
spending for post-typhoon reconstruction and infrastructure upgrading.
Continuing to proactively tighten monetary conditions would address both potential inflation and
generalized financial stability risks. With market interest rates well below the policy rate, the
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) decisions to withdraw liquidity by drawing down reserves
and raising reserve requirements earlier this year were appropriate. Additional tightening of
monetary and financial conditions is needed with a focus on measures that would not encourage
a further shift in financial intermediation to nonbanks, including by raising official interest rates.
Providing the BSP with suitable instruments to undertake sterilization would improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy. With official reserves more than adequate, the exchange rate
should adjust more fully to structural balance of payments flows, while symmetrically smoothing
the effect of cyclical capital flows.
Additional targeted action is needed to contain specific risks to the financial system. Early
adoption of Basel III capital requirements, monitoring a broader definition of banks’ real estate
exposure, standardizing “contract to sell” financing arrangements for developers, and
establishing the Financial Stability Coordination Council were appropriate preemptive responses
to deepening financial intermediation. Taking further measures is advised to contain risks in the
property sector and to improve oversight and better manage risks from large exposures.
Therefore, the recently-announced bank stress tests for real estate exposure are commendable.
Widening the BSP’s mandate to include financial stability would help prevent diversion of
systemic risk to the shadow-banking sector and strengthen powers for managing risks associated
with greater cross-border financial integration.
Continuing to focus on mobilizing stable sources of revenue would ensure room for structural
spending priorities while preserving fiscal prudence. Increasing the national government deficit

4
to 2 percent of GDP in 2014 and maintaining it thereafter is appropriate to continue to build
fiscal buffers and moderate the debt ratio. To achieve sustainable and inclusive economic
growth, larger public spending is needed for disaster remediation, infrastructure upgrading and to
support improved social outcomes. Meeting these spending demands requires a sizable tax effort,
which should focus mainly on broadening the tax base by reducing exemptions and allowances
and adopting a new mining strategy, supported by improvements in tax administration.
Further reforms to attract investment and create new employment would help sustain vibrant
economic growth and make it more inclusive. Relaxing limits on foreign ownership, reducing
red tape, and limiting tax holidays that tend to favor incumbents and distort the tax system would
increase market contestability, support execution of public-private partnerships and better
position the Philippines to benefit from the growth and employment opportunities of deeper
regional integration. Increasing job creation in agriculture and in micro and small firms calls for
establishing clear property rights for small-scale farms, expanding access to formal credit, and
reducing labor market rigidities.
