STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Following a six-month political stalemate, the largest two parties reached an
agreement in December to form a grand coalition, which enjoys a comfortable majority
in parliament. The remittances-fueled growth is set to continue in the near term, but
deep challenges remain in view of Kosovo’s narrow export and productive base, low
employment ratios, and incomes that are among the lowest in Europe.
Fiscal Policy: Following very generous pre-electoral promises, gradual fiscal adjustment
is required to preserve the credibility of the fiscal rule and safeguard low public debt
levels. Measures should focus on arresting the rapid growth in unproductive current
spending, so as to reduce the deficit while creating space for priority areas such as
infrastructure, education, and health.
Financial Sector: The banking sector has remained well-capitalized, liquid, and
profitable. Good progress has been made in enhancing banking supervision as well as
the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) framework. Given low credit penetration, the
main challenge is to harness available liquidity so that banks can further support
investment and growth: this will require improvements in the weak judiciary, as well as
tackling the sizable informal economy.
Structural Issues: The key structural challenge is to address the large wage and nonwage competitiveness gap. Gradually deflating high public sector wages will help with
the former. As for the latter, the focus should be on tackling the large skills gap by
enhancing educational quality—particularly vocational training—and complementing de
jure improvements in the business environment with de facto progress. Upgrading
energy infrastructure, including a new power plant, is important to avert a future energy
crisis.
Previous IMF advice: Implementation of Fund advice remained strong throughout the
Stand-By Arrangement, which expired in December 2013. However, measures contrary
to the spirit of the arrangement were taken immediately after the program’s expiry. This
is the first Article IV consultation since July 2013.

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

CONTEXT, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Kosovo enters 2015 with a stable government. A six-month political stalemate following
the inconclusive June 2014 elections ended with the formation of a grand coalition. The government
holds a comfortable majority in parliament, and past experience has shown that such coalitions can
be stable and conducive to effective policy-making.
2.
Since the 2013 Article IV consultation, some progress has been made in normalizing
international relations. At present, the Republic of Kosovo has been recognized by 108 UN
member states and 23 EU member states. Under the EU-sponsored dialogue, there has been
progress in normalizing relations with Serbia. However, lack of full international recognition remains
an obstacle to greater political integration and economic development. Kosovo is a potential EU
candidate and a Stabilization Association Agreement (SAA)—the first step toward official
candidature—could be signed this year or next.
3.
Despite political uncertainty last year, economic performance has remained resilient. In
2014, GDP growth is estimated at about 2¾ percent, somewhat lower than in 2013 but still near
Kosovo’s five-year average of 3.5 percent (the highest in the Western Balkans). Steady remittances
helped, as witnessed by consumption growing at close to 4 percent. This year, growth in Germany—
the main Diaspora country—the full-year impact of large wage increases granted before last year’s
elections (see below), and a ramp up in highway construction should again support growth of circa
3 percent, despite a gradual, multi-year pullback from the donor sector as Kosovo graduates from
acute nation-building needs. As in other countries in the region, low energy prices and ties to
developments in the euro area have pushed inflation into negative territory (-0.3 percent y/y in
March). Modest inflation is expected for the year as a whole, at best.

The trade and current accounts remain in large deficit, but financing is stable and
reserves are ample. Given the narrow productive base, most consumption and investment goods
are imported, fueling a very high trade deficit (about 30 percent of GDP). Financing sources are
relatively stable and generally non-debt creating, with the main contribution coming from
remittances, official transfers, and FDI—the last is also largely associated with the Diaspora. Gross

international reserves of some 18 percent of GDP are ample relative to a conservative variant of the
Fund’s adequacy metric, which suggests reserve buffers equivalent to 12 percent of GDP (Annex II).
5.
Medium-term growth prospects appear insufficient to significantly lift incomes and
improve labor outcomes. Barring reforms, medium-term economic growth will remain dependent
on the same remittance-based model and would not be expected to exceed the recent 3.5 percent
average. With income per capita of €3,000, one of the lowest in Europe, higher growth is needed to
accelerate convergence towards the Western Balkans average. Higher growth would also be needed
to generate jobs in the context of very high unemployment (30 percent), very low employment
(40 percent), and fast population growth.
6.

Risks to the short-term outlook remain evenly balanced (Annex III).



Upside risk in the next 12 months: stronger impact on consumption from last year’s public wage
increase. The impact on consumption of the large wage increase last year, which has been
modest so far, could surprise positively now that uncertainty related to the political stalemate is
resolved.



Downside risks in the next 12 months: renewed emigration and possible disruptions to electricity
supply. A recent emigration wave, facilitated by easier border entry into Serbia and reflective of
a lack of hope among segments of the population, has now calmed down but could begin anew,
as it unpredictably did six months ago. Separately, further breakdowns in the two old power
plants would result in new electricity cuts and possibly higher tariffs to pay for imports.



In the medium term, the risk of a “new mediocre” in Europe would affect Kosovo via lower
remittances from Diaspora countries as well as lower exports. On the upside, implementation of
the government’s ambitious structural reform agenda could lift potential growth above the
baseline.



Exposure to regional risks. Intensification of Russia/Ukraine tensions will not have any direct
impact, but may affect Kosovo indirectly via the Diaspora residing in high-income European
countries. Similar indirect channels would apply with regards to developments in Greece.

Authorities’ views
7.
The authorities broadly shared this assessment. In their view, growth could reach
4 percent this year, although they view any differences with staff’s forecast at this stage as within the
range of uncertainty. They also agreed with the risks presented, although they are more sanguine
about positive confidence effects in the short term coming from implementation of their reform
agenda. They also see upside risks in the near term from the euro area, given euro depreciation,
lower oil prices, and the impact from ECB’s quantitative easing. Looking towards the medium term,
they remain concerned by modest growth prospects, agreeing that higher medium-term growth is
needed to meaningfully lift incomes and provide jobs for many in society. In fact, they see

addressing infrastructure impediments and boosting the productive and export capacity of the
economy as the number one economic challenge and priority facing the country.

REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Public Finances
8.
The budget situation has deteriorated. Before the June elections, the government
awarded a 25 percent increase in public sector wages and social pensions, promised new benefits
for war veterans and prisoners of war, and signed a generous collective agreement on labor
relations. Combined, these measures have triggered a sharp increase in current spending, and the
authorities managed to contain last year’s fiscal deficit excluding PAK spending at 2.4 percent of
GDP1 only thanks to a 2 percent of GDP under-spending of the capital budget.
9.
Staff warned that this year’s deficit will be significantly higher than budgeted. Given
the long time needed to form the new government, parliament decided to approve a “technical”
budget that had been prepared by the caretaking administration several months prior. The problem
is that this budget relies on overly optimistic revenue assumptions. Assuming more realistic revenue
outcomes, and given the full year effect of the pre-electoral promises together with the expected
ramp up in spending on the new route to Macedonia,2 the deficit could reach 3.5 percent of GDP
this year. In fact, the deficit would have been higher were it not for recent decisions to increase
excise rates on a number of goods and to hold off on filling some open vacancies in the public
sector, both of which staff support.
10.
Fiscal deficits are expected to remain elevated in the medium term. Under the baseline
scenario, the deficit is projected to steadily increase and reach 4.7 percent of GDP in 2020. This is
because there are a number of one-off revenues that are expected to taper off after 2016, while net
interest payments may increase as debt is accumulated. Under this baseline, public debt would
steadily creep up to over 30 percent of GDP by 2020 (Annex IV). Moreover, this baseline scenario
includes a number of risks (possibly up to 1−1½ percent of GDP), including potentially higher-thanbudgeted costs of implementing the collective agreement, uncertainty over the final bill of the war
veterans package, erosion in tax bases from trade agreements and, last but not least, the possibility
that the transformation of Kosovo’s Security Forces into Armed Forces would trigger additional
spending.

1

This is GDP as forecasted in the 2014 budget, which is what counts for the fiscal rule. The outturn was above the
fiscal rule’s 2 percent limit but within the ex-post margin allowed by the rule. Note that the deficit was slightly higher
when measured in percent GDP as forecasted by Fund staff.
2

The road connecting Pristina with the Albania border was finalized in 2013 at a cost of some 20 percent of GDP.
Usage so far has been below predictions. Construction on the road connecting Pristina to the Macedonia border
started in 2014 and is expected to be completed in 2017–18, at a cost of some 12 percent of GDP. This road is
thought to be more economically useful, given that much of Kosovo’s trade happens with Skopje.

11.
Beyond deficits, staff drew attention to the worsened composition of the budget.
Given large pre-electoral packages before the 2011 and 2014 elections, current spending is
expected to increase by 4.3 percentage points of GDP in 2010–15, mostly due to the wage bill
(2.7 percentage point of GDP) and pensions (1.7 percentage points of GDP). Since independence,
public sector wages have more than doubled, vastly outpacing productivity, private sector wages, or
public wages in other Western Balkan countries. To accommodate this sharp increase in current
spending, capital spending has been substantially cut over the same period (4 percentage point of
GDP), despite Kosovo’s urgent development needs. Moreover, education spending has remained
low compared to peers and is in fact on a declining path.

The main elements of the fiscal rule are: (i) the headline deficit excluding both spending of the privatization agency
as well as spending from own source revenues carried-forward shall not exceed 2 percent of GDP (as forecasted in
the budget); (ii) any excessive deficit should be corrected within the next 3 years, so that the average deficit over the
four-year period equals 2 percent; and (iii) provided Treasury cash balances including funds for bank emergency
liquidity assistance are above 4.5 percent of GDP, the government may use privatization funds to finance capital
projects above the 2 percent deficit ceiling.

continued freeze of public wages and benefits in 2015–164) while preserving the budget for priority
areas such as infrastructure, education, and health. Given Kosovo’s generally low tax rates, staff also
saw merit in a uniform increase in the VAT rate. Instead, the government is planning to introduce
differentiated VAT rates as well as zero rate exemptions on some goods: these are not only
distortionary, they also mean a missed opportunity to raise needed tax revenue.
13.
More broadly, staff recommended the introduction of a rules-based framework to
guide public wage decisions. A rule that caps growth in the public wage bill relative to some welldefined macro-indicator(s) could be a useful complement to the fiscal rule, helping to prevent the
large discretionary jumps in wages seen in recent years. Staff analysis (Box 1 and Annex III) shows
that such a rule would have delivered significantly more modest and sustainable increases than
those actually observed. While such rules have disadvantages, notably their rigidity and potential
pro-cyclicality, staff argued that these are outweighed by the positives in a country like Kosovo. At
the same time, staff argued that a public wage rule should not be seen as a substitute for the long
delayed reform of the civil service.
14.
Sources of funding should be diversified by tapping international markets. The shallow
domestic market could be stretched if it were to finance a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP this year. In
this context, staff recommended that, in addition to gradual fiscal adjustment, Kosovo seek external
market financing. While Kosovo has never borrowed from external markets, and would thus need to
go through the process of obtaining a credit rating, the country’s still low public debt should serve it
in good stead, notably given significant global liquidity. External funding could in fact help not only
to finance the deficit, but to rebuild fiscal buffers to bring them back to prudent levels.5

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment. They agreed that, on current
policies, the 2015 deficit is likely to be around 3½ percent of GDP, and that there are risks that could
drive the deficit even higher. In addition, they shared the view that the composition of the budget
has worsened significantly. To redress unsustainable trends in public wages, the authorities are
considering a reform of public wage determination processes along the lines recommended by staff.
On VAT, the authorities felt that lower rates and exemptions on some products are needed to
stimulate investment in growth sectors. Should the need for additional revenue arise, they would
consider raising the main rate to 19 percent.

4

The 2015 budget already freezes wages/benefits in nominal terms. A renewed freeze in 2016 would be justified
considering the 25 percent jump in 2014. Of note, the equally large increases in public wages in 2011 were followed
by nominal freezes in both 2012 and 2013, under Fund-supported programs.

Reserves for pure fiscal financing are currently below levels staff would consider prudent (see Annex II).

Box 1. Wage and Indexation Mechanism6
In Kosovo, increases in public sector wages have been excessively large for political reasons, resulting
in adverse economic consequences. In this context, a rule that caps growth of the public sector wage bill
relative to some transparent macroeconomic indicator could have significant advantages. In Kosovo’s case,
there are at least four possibilities for rules-based mechanisms: (i) wages could be tied to inflation to
account for changes in cost of living; (ii) wages could be tied to real GDP as an imperfect proxy of labor
productivity; (iii) wages could be tied to nominal GDP growth as a proxy for changes in the cost of living and
labor productivity; and (iv) wages could be changed based on the current formula used for the adjustment
of the minimum salary.7

16.
At the same time, they felt the fiscal rule does not give enough recognition to
Kosovo’s development needs. The authorities expressed their strong commitment to macro-fiscal
stability, pointing to the freeze in wages at 2014 levels and the recent increase in excise taxes. More
generally, they committed to finding additional savings, so as to bring deficits back in line with the
fiscal rule. However, they feel the fiscal rule’s 2 percent deficit ceiling is too tight for a country like
Kosovo with high development needs and very low public debt. In addition, they see provisions in
the fiscal rule that allow for privatization proceeds to finance capital spending above the 2 percent
deficit ceiling provided cash buffers are prudent as being of limited use. This is because they
inherited a deficit above 2 percent as well as low cash buffers, so the clause cannot be activated.
More generally, usable privatization receipts are now slightly above 1 percent of GDP, not enough to
finance needed development projects. In this context, they expressed interest in working together
with the Fund to expand the investment clause in the fiscal rule, so as to allow for IFI-financed
growth-enhancing projects alongside those financed with (limited) privatization receipts.
17.
The authorities welcomed advice to broaden financing sources. They concurred that
Kosovo’s low public debt levels should help it obtain market financing on reasonable terms, and will

seek advice on how to proceed along these lines. However, they saw significant untapped potential
from IFI financing, and are initiating discussions with the various IFIs to deepen cooperation.

B. Financial Sector
18.
The banking sector remains healthy. Kosovo banks are generally well-capitalized, liquid,
and profitable. The system’s capital adequacy ratio (18.2 percent) is among the highest in the region,
with all banks, both domestic and foreign, above the regulatory minimum. Banks’ aggregate liquid
assets cover roughly 41 percent of short-term liabilities, a key consideration in a euroized economy.
Profitability has improved and is adequate despite only moderate economic growth. In 2014, all
banks were profitable, with overall return on equity of about 20 percent. NPLs are somewhat
elevated at 8.4 percent of total loans but stable and fully provisioned.
19.
Staff welcomed progress made on strengthening banking supervision. In particular, the
CBK has moved steadily toward risk-based supervision, a key recommendation of the 2012 FSAP
(Annex VI).8 With help from Fund technical assistance, the CBK has strengthened the depth of its offsite monitoring and analysis, developed an on-site examination model, and tested the new
framework at two systemic banks, with plans to roll the new framework out to all banks by the end
of 2015. Still, staff recommended that the CBK continue to train its supervisors and deepen its
analytic and supervisory capacity, including by further refining supervision manuals and procedures,
extending supervision to cover risks on a consolidated basis as applicable, and assessing prudential
ratios. Separately, bank supervision will also benefit from memoranda of understanding for the
exchange of information signed with home supervisors, a key step given that Kosovo’s banking
sector is 90 percent foreign-owned by assets.
20.
The authorities have also made efforts to

comfort from parent banks stating that parents
would work with their subsidiaries in the event of a
crisis. In addition, the draft ELA regulation that would govern conditions, processes, and modalities
of any emergency assistance provided to banks is generally in line with best practice.

8

In addition, the authorities are working on a new draft legislation to make AML/CFT issues a component of CBK
supervision.

21.
Despite these gains, more is needed to bolster Kosovo’ crisis management framework.
A Crisis Prevention Council (CPC) comprised of the CBK Governor, Finance Minister, and the Chair of
the Parliament Budget Committee has been recently established to discuss financial stability issues
in Kosovo and to ensure better coordination in the event of crisis. These are important steps, but
staff called for full operationalization of the CPC. In particular, the council should have formal
meetings at regular intervals, rather than meet informally and on an ad-hoc basis as is the case now.
In addition, the council should include the Deposit Insurance Fund of Kosovo (DIFK).
22.
The main challenge facing the financial system is better access to credit to support
growth. Despite banks’ healthy liquidity ratios, Kosovo has the lowest level of credit penetration
(33 percent credit-to-GDP) in the Western

spreads (currently about 850 bps) and high
collateral requirements. In this context, banks are overly focused on short-term trade financing and
personal loans to government employees rather than loans to private enterprises than could help to
grow a more dynamic economy.
23.
Tackling this challenge will require a multi-pronged effort. Recent improvements to
collateral recovery enforcement through the introduction of private bailiffs should help and are
welcome, as are plans to develop more effective NPL recovery and write-off procedures. However,
with the current backlog of bank cases stretching up to five years, more work is needed to make
court proceedings more efficient, specialized, and timely. Efforts are ongoing, but they are at their
early stages and will take time to bear fruit. In addition, legal system improvements are needed to
provide more confidence in the rule of law in Kosovo (discussed below). A still-developing
microfinance sector could also more efficiently support credit to households and SMEs.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities shared the staff assessment on the health of the banks, and
appreciated Fund advice and technical assistance in improving CBK supervision and the ELA
framework. They expect the draft regulation on the latter to be passed soon. The CBK considers its
transition to risk-based supervision a success and that its new staffing level is sufficient. The
authorities agree on the need to further develop their macroprudential oversight capacity and have
plans to do so, but see the CPC’s current informal setup as sufficient to exchange views and, if
necessary, coordinate between Kosovo’s financial authorities.

25.
The CBK agreed that bank lending needs to deepen to support Kosovo’s development.
In this vein, they saw the constraints squarely on the side of high informality levels and a slow
judiciary, rather than on the banks’ side. They expect the introduction of private bailiffs to have a
positive effect in the clearing of bad loans, and hence in giving banks confidence to lend more
freely. In their view, private bailiffs were needed because the process of reforming the judiciary from
within, to which they are committed, will naturally take time to bear fruit.

C. External Sustainability, Competitiveness, and Structural Reform
26.
The limited progress in raising incomes and improving labor market outcomes is
disappointing. With GDP per capita currently at €3,000, the income gap with the EU remains very
large and is closing slowly, while that with EU candidate countries has widened. In addition,
labor market outcomes are among the most disappointing in Europe, with unemployment at
30 percent despite extremely low labor participation, particularly among women and the young. In
these conditions, it is perhaps unsurprising that so many have emigrated to EU countries in recent
months.

data (Figure 4): in Kosovo, more than 80 percent
of FDI is directed towards non-tradables, manufacturing accounts for less than 12 percent of GDP,
and the trade deficit last year exceeded 30 percent of GDP. All in all, staff believes Kosovo suffers

from a significant real exchange rate overvaluation, on the order of 15–20 percent (text box). In this
context, wage restraint in the public sector is important: with the general government providing one
in four jobs in the formal sector, containing wage costs will have a direct positive impact on overall
competitiveness. The fact that the public sector now offers both greater job security and higher
wages than the private sector makes it very hard for firms to attract talent.
28.
A credible energy pricing policy can help address energy constraints that have become
a growing impediment on development. Kosovo currently relies on two old and unreliable
electricity power plants, and the system is operating with no redundancy. Electricity imports can help
fill temporary gaps, which is why the planned transmission line to/from Albania is important.
However, imports are not a long-term fix given their higher cost and constraints in the country-tocountry transmission lines. Hence, the country is faced with the urgent need to build a new power
plant. With no space in the budget to accommodate its construction (estimated cost: 20 percent of
GDP), credible commitments that future tariffs will be set at high enough levels to satisfy the return
on investment are critical to attract foreign private investment.
29.
To raise medium-term prospects, the weak business environment and rule of law will
need to be bolstered. The World Bank’s overall Doing Business Indicator, which is now close to the
Western Balkans average, has improved in several

this context, staff was encouraged by the adoption

will be in the implementation of the law, and the
ability to prosecute those who break it.
Improvements in the AML/CFT framework, notably by further strengthening the Financial
Intelligence Unit, which has increased its activity, will also help combat corruption. The anticorruption and AML/CFT assessments conducted as part of the Project against Economic Crime in
Kosovo (PECK) are welcome and the authorities are encouraged to undergo a comprehensive
AML/CFT assessment against the revised 2012 FATF standard.

Box 2. External Sector Assessment
Given lack of competitiveness, a narrow export base, and concomitant dependence on imports, the
trade and current account deficits are expected to remain at a high level. The narrow export base and
large imports, including energy and machineries, are key drivers of the large trade imbalances (a deficit
exceeding 30 percent of GDP). Over the medium term, the current account deficit is expected to narrow
slightly on account of lower import growth and growing remittance inflows, but will remain high at
10.5 percent of GDP in 2020.
The assessment of the real exchange rate points to significant overvaluation. The two CGER
methodologies used in Kosovo’s case, the macroeconomic balance the external sustainability, find very
similar results, even if these should be interpreted with caution given limited data availability.1 In the
medium term, the results of the above-mentioned methodologies can be summarized as follows:


The macroeconomic balance approach points to an overvalued real exchange rate of 15 percent.


The external stability approach also indicates an overvaluation of about 18 percent, assuming a
stabilizing medium-term positive net foreign liabilities position in the range of 3 percent of GDP.

Of note, the current account norm estimated for Albania, the closest comparator, is very close to
that found here for Kosovo.
Other indicators support the view of a significant competitiveness gap. In particular, wages in the public
sector now exceed those in the private sector, making it very hard for the latter to attract the talent it needs
to compete. Similarly, the fact that some much FDI is driven not by foreign investors but by the Kosovar
Diaspora gives it a clear non-tradable bias: more than 80 percent of FDI is currently going to lowproductivity non-tradables such as construction and domestic services, rather than to potentially higherproductivity tradables. The fact that exports have been falling as a share of GDP (despite their low absolute
level) is, in itself, a clear and direct indication that Kosovo has a competitiveness problem.

30.
Raising access and quality of education is another urgent priority, particularly in light
of low employment. Currently, Kosovo spends less on education than its peers, and a
disproportionately large share of the spending goes to wages. While there is a quality deficit at all
educational levels, consensus among experts puts the focus on improving access to and quality in
pre-primary and primary education. Similarly, curricula in vocational programs are seen as unaligned to market needs, and the programs disconnected from the business world.

Authorities views
31.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment. They currently lack estimates
of real exchange rate overvaluation, and felt these were very useful to benchmark the
competitiveness gap. In this light, they concurred that public sector wage restraint is needed not just
for fiscal sustainability but for competitiveness purposes.
32.
The authorities are confident of progress in the energy sector. In their view, the
transmission line to Albania will bring significant benefits, as Kosovo and Albania are not
synchronized in terms of peak energy needs and hence are natural “partners” for an electricity
market. At the same time, they acknowledged that electricity imports are not a full substitute for the
new power plant, and that the bidding for this plant is facing some hurdles. Nonetheless, they are
working very closely with the World Bank and are confident of a breakthrough in negotiations.
33.
Tackling corruption is one of their key priorities. They see the new procurement law as a
major step forward, as the government is the number one purchaser and economic actor in the
country. Current work to improve the debarment process for those who break procurement laws will
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

aid in the implementation, and work is ongoing to implement e-procurement. Finally, they admitted
to gaps in their judiciary, but felt that tremendous progress had been achieved in the seven years
since independence in close cooperation with the EU’s rule of law mission.

OTHER ISSUES
34.
Data is adequate for supervision purposes, but the national accounts and activity
indicators should be improved. Fiscal and financial sector data is timely and of good quality. Real
sector data needs to be improved in terms of coverage, quality, and timeliness, though it remains
adequate for surveillance issues. A recent STA diagnostic mission has provided recommendations in
this regard.
35.
There are no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, or measures that would give rise to multiple currency practices. The authorities
are considering whether to accept the obligations under Article VIII, but have yet to reach a decision.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
While steady remittances have kept growth going despite external and domestic
headwinds, addressing Kosovo’s competitiveness gap within a strong policy framework
remains critically important for robust future growth. Recent growth performance has been
better than some of Kosovo’s neighbors, helped by steady remittances from the Kosovo Diaspora
which has supported both consumption as well as domestic investment. However, without strong
reform efforts, medium-term growth prospects are likely to remain below what the economy needs
to generate enough jobs and raise the income standards of the population.
37.
A gradual fiscal adjustment focused on deflating current spending is needed to
contain the growing deficit and preserve the credibility of the fiscal rule. Policies went off-track
following expiration of the successful Stand-By Arrangement in December 2013. In the run-up to the
June 2014 elections, the authorities significantly increased public wages and benefits and met the
fiscal rule only with deep cuts in much-needed capital spending. This year, the full year effect of
these large commitments, together with higher spending on road infrastructure, are expected to
push the budget deficit to about 3½ percent of GDP. While recognizing Kosovo’s development
needs, gradual fiscal adjustment is needed to preserve the credibility of the fiscal rule and safeguard
low public debt. But just as fiscal adjustment is important, so is the quality of this adjustment. Any
consolidation should target unproductive current spending and leave space open for spending on
things that Kosovo urgently needs, such as development projects, education, and health services. As
such, the decision in the 2015 budget to keep public sector wages at 2014 levels was appropriate
and should be carried forward. Recently approved increases in excise taxes are also welcome, as they
bolster the state’s resources to face higher obligations in a relatively non-distortionary manner.
Additional measures may be needed this year and next; a proper VAT reform and other tax
measures that yield a meaningful increase in revenues could be an important option.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

38.
In this context, a clear rule that limits public sector wage growth relative to specific
macroeconomic indicators would be a useful complement to the fiscal rule. Such a rule would
help to prevent repeated discretionary jumps in public sector wages that have exceeded productivity
gains and diverted funds from priority items. Moreover, growth in Kosovo should ultimately come
from the private sector. Limiting public sector wages would enable private companies to compete
on more equal terms when it comes to attracting skilled workers.
39.
Kosovo’s banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, reducing financial risks.
Non-performing loans are stable at just above 8 percent and well provisioned. The authorities have
recently taken appropriate measures to improve bank supervision, strengthen the emergency
liquidity assistance framework (including by seeking letters of comfort from parents of foreign
subsidiaries), and coordinate with foreign supervisors. Incipient efforts to oversee macroprudential
policy are steps in the right direction and should be deepened.
40.
Further efforts are needed to remove impediments to bank lending. Due to the
economy’s high levels of informality and an inefficient legal system, interest rate spreads are high
(although they have been declining) and banks apply high collateral requirements. The authorities
are taking steps to address some of these problems: establishing timelines for writing off bad loans,
planning a bankruptcy law, and initiating a strategy to lower informality. But these initiatives are in
their early stages and will take time. The authorities should also improve the capacity of the court
system to deal with financial cases and clearing court backlogs. The introduction of private bailiffs is
a move in the right direction.
41.
Raising the productive and export capacity of the economy requires decisive
implementation of structural reforms. This is key if the country is to gradually narrow the income
gap and provide jobs for one of the youngest populations in Europe. Specifically, the country needs
to tackle its significant wage and non-wage competitiveness gap. For the former, wage restraint in
the public sector will help. For the latter, a multi-pronged effort will be required:


Attend to Kosovo’s aging energy infrastructure. In the years ahead, the old power plants may not
be able to provide a reliable and predictable supply of electricity to the private sector,
presenting a key obstacle to development. For the project to have any chance of success, the
authorities will need to credibly commit to setting tariffs at cost-recovery levels once the new
plant is completed.



Reducing skills mismatches. The authorities should expand access to pre-primary education and
improve the quality of education across all levels, with a particular focus on vocational training.



Continue to improve governance and the business environment. This means strengthening the
rule of law and applying the same standards to everyone. Much of Kosovo’s de jure legal
institutional framework has improved in recent years, but implementation has lagged and
perceptions of corruption remain. The new public procurement law is a solid step in the right
direction, but the test will be in its implementation and the prosecution of those who break it.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

Strengthening and mobilizing the AML/CFT framework can complement efforts to investigate
and prosecute corruption.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of Kosovo
take place on a 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Containing the Public Wage Bill and Transfers in Kosovo
Past Increases in the Public Wage Bill
Significant increases of public wages before elections are a repeated occurrence in Kosovo.
Prior to the 2011 elections, the government raised base wages by 50 percent, resulting in an
increase of the total wage bill of around 27 percent. In 2014, again prior to elections, the
government implemented across-the-board salary increases of 25 percent. In addition, social
pensions were increased by 25 percent. In part because of these measures, current spending is
projected to grow by close to 4 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2015 on an annualized basis.
In Kosovo, the political incentives of governments to increase wages in pre-election periods
are especially strong. First, given that the central and local governments provide almost a quarter
of all formal jobs, a large share of voters directly benefit from wage increases. Second, there are
many voters that benefit indirectly. With unemployment rates exceeding 30 percent and relatively
low labor market participation rates (around 60 percent of the working age population is
economically inactive), the employment-to-working age population ratio is only 28 percent. This
suggests that in Kosovo, one or even several voters depend on the income of each employee in the
public sector.
To a lesser extent, increased hiring in pre-election periods has also pushed up the wage bill.
Between January 2010 and November 2014, the increase in overall employment by the central and
local governments amounted to around 5,100 staff, with 85 percent of this increase hired during the
11 months prior to the 2010 and 2014 elections. In fairness, the increase partly reflects the creation
of new institutions and the transfer of competencies to the authorities.
Increases in the public wage bill undermine long-run growth prospects and policy credibility.
First, spending on public wages narrows fiscal space as it comes at the expense of growth-friendly
spending. Second, public wage increases spillover to the private sector, further undermining
competitiveness. Third, high public wages make it hard for the private sector to attract talent, as the
government offers both greater job security and, currently, slightly higher wages. Finally, unchecked
public wage bill increases put compliance with the fiscal rule and the authorities’ credibility at risk.

Policy Options to Contain Wage Increases in the Future
In principle, two complementary institutional remedies may prevent significant wage
increases in Kosovo. First, budgetary procedures could be changed to make it harder for the

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

government to increase public wages by executive fiat. Second, a rules-based framework could
determine ceilings for public sector wage increases. Ideally, both remedies would be combined.
The law on public financial management and accountability could be modified to wrestle
wage decisions away from the government and entrust them to parliament. The law allows for
reallocation of spending within certain limits during the fiscal year and without approval of the
parliament.1 In principle, such provisions are useful, if overspending in one area due to unforeseen
and external circumstances can be financed by unforeseen under-spending in other areas. However,
this regulation has been abused; in 2014, the government used such reallocations to accommodate
higher than budgeted wage increases. The law could be amended so that reallocations for wages,
salaries and benefits are not allowed without Assembly approval. This would make any public sector
wage increase more ‘democratic’ and transparent. The drawback is that, prior to elections, parties
are unlikely to oppose large wage increases in parliament. In other words, this mechanism might not
prevent large pre-election relaxations, although it would force a parliamentary debate and vote.
With respect to rules-based frameworks, other countries have applied wage caps and
indexation. Several mechanisms are summarized in Table 1. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, public
sector wages are tied to lagged economy-wide wages, whereas Moldova applies a simple CPI-based
index for low public sector wages. However, there is no obvious model for Kosovo: in an ideal world,
public sector wage growth would be tied to public sector labor productivity—which Kosovo is
impossible to measure due to data constraints—while still taking into account private sector wages.

Description
Allocations for public wages are based on a standard model that adjusts the
budget by an index that measures the general price increases and pay increases
in the wider labor market and deducts a standardized efficiency dividend
amounting to 1.25 percent of the wage bill of most government agencies.

Indexed to CPI and real GDP growth.
Indexed to adjusted CPI (excludes cigarettes, alcohol, and fuel prices).
Indexed to economy-wide wages from two years before.
Only for judges, indexation to average earning from two years before.
Indexed to CPI, suspended in 2007 and reintroduced in 2010.
Monthly indexation. Salaries up to two minimum wages are indexed to CPI.
Indexed to basic food basket, with the basket revised every two years.

Wage indexation has, however, a number of disadvantages. First, wage indexation limits the
ability of the government to use fiscal policy for macroeconomic management. For instance, under
inflation indexation, the public sector wage bill increases at a time when fiscal restraint may be
needed. Second, indexation may potentially lock in undesirable public sector wage levels and
structures, reducing the public sector’s capacity to address these inefficiencies.
While recognizing these drawbacks, rules-based mechanisms have a big advantage: to
prevent the ‘explosion’ of the public sector wage bill. Despite data limitations in Kosovo, there
are at least four possibilities for rulesbased mechanisms in Kosovo. Wages
could be tied to: (i) inflation to
account for changes in cost of living;
(ii) real growth as an imperfect proxy
of labor productivity; (iii) nominal
growth as a proxy for changes in the
cost of living and labor productivity;
else (iv) wages could be changed
based on the formula used for the

minimum wage in Kosovo. These
mechanisms provide a cap on wage increases, but do not imply automatic wage increases. Had the
rules been in place over 2009–14, any of these mechanisms would have implied significantly lower
growth of the public wage bill than was actually observed. Applying the rule governing minimum
wages to public sector wages would have implied the lowest increase of the public sector wage bill,
as wage increases would have only occurred in one year.

Conclusions
In Kosovo, public sector wage increases in the recent past have been excessively large,
entailing adverse economic consequences. Amending the law on public financial management to
require parliamentary approval for wage (and benefits) decisions could help to prevent this.
Implementation would be easier than a more complex and time-consuming rules-based framework.
This option would also strengthen the budget process. However, requiring parliamentary approval
without a rules-based framework makes large wage increases more difficult but far from impossible.
By contrast, a rules-based framework provides detailed prescriptions for adjustments of
public wages and should be considered in Kosovo. Any rules-based mechanism that is feasible in
practice has severe drawbacks; in a setting with moderate wage increases, such mechanisms should

therefore be refrained from. However, in Kosovo, where public sector wage increases have been very
large, the benefits of preventing similar occurrences in the future outweigh these drawbacks. Similar
rules-based frameworks could be used to cap spending on social assistance.

Annex II. Liquidity Buffers and Reserve Adequacy in a Euroized
Country
Considering Kosovo is a unilaterally euroized economy, we look at reserves for BOP purposes and also
at reserves for fiscal financing and for bank emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). Kosovo has sufficient
reserves to deal with bank liquidity and overall BOP shocks, but not fiscal financing shocks.

A target for Kosovo’s fiscal reserves should relate to revenue and spending levels. A useful rule
of thumb for the minimum size of fiscal reserves is one month of spending. In Kosovo, this would
imply a buffer of around €150 million (2.7 percent of GDP) for spending, including debt service. Such
a buffer would allow the government to finance itself for about 5 months without debt issuance.
This appears sufficient to guard against shocks in the relatively new domestic debt market.
Permanently maintaining higher fiscal reserves than suggested by the rule of thumb to guard
against surprises would be unnecessarily costly.
Actual fiscal reserves are significantly below the benchmark of €150 million. Excluding funds
earmarked for bank ELA which are not usable by the government, end-2014 fiscal reserves were just
€55 million. This exceeded day-to-day working balances (€50 million) by only a small margin.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

B.

Bank ELA Reserves

The CBK’s ability to provide liquidity assistance is constrained. The CBK cannot print money to
provide ELA and its capacity to lower required reserves (currently set at 10 percent of deposits) to
inject liquidity is limited and there may be banks whose liquidity needs exceed the reduction in their
required reserves and would have difficulty getting external funding. The CBK would need to borrow
from liquid banks in the system, from abroad, or use the reserves that have been designated for ELA
to provide that liquidity support. However, the first two options are not fully under the CBK’s control
and so its ability to provide liquidity support is dependent on its ELA reserves.
The banks are currently very liquid, which militate against risks. The first line of defense against
liquidity shocks are banks’ own liquid assets, which in Kosovo currently average around 48 percent
of short-term liabilities (38 percent for domestic banks). This is quite high compared to other “fully
dollarized” countries, where liquid assets to liabilities for the system range from 26 percent in
Ecuador to 36 percent in El Salvador. While banks may become less liquid in the future, it should be
noted that Kosovo imposes a high minimum liquid asset ratio of 25 percent.
At this stage, ELA reserves appear more than adequate. ELA reserves are comprised of CBK
capital and the Treasury’s deposit in the special reserve fund (SRF) for ELA and amounts to around
€99 million.1 For the two domestic banks, own liquid assets and ELA funds are near or above
100 percent of deposits of each bank, and they cover close to 80 percent of the combined deposits
of both banks. Hence the ELA buffer would be more than sufficient to withstand a very severe
funding shock in the domestic banks. Moreover, ELA reserves plus banks’ own buffers now cover
more than 50 percent of total deposits in any of the large foreign subsidiaries. This is
notwithstanding the fact that these subsidiaries would be expected to receive support from their
parents when liquidity needs arise, and to this end the central bank is commendably seeking letters
of comfort from the parents.

1

Withdrawals of 20 percent of term deposits and 40 percent of demand deposits would be considered a very severe
funding shock (Schmieder et al, 2013). Currently, such withdrawals would imply a decline of 30 percent of domestic
banks’ combined deposits.

Coverage of existing ELA funds will decline over time. The funds available for ELA are essentially
fixed in nominal terms and so ELA coverage of deposits
will decline as banks’ liabilities grow over time. For this
reason, the 2012 FSAP recommended that banks
contribute funds for ELA, in line with deposit growth.
While this is not an immediate concern, the authorities
should consider how they might bolster deposit
coverage in the medium term. This could be in the form
of a fee or premium, or a liquid asset contribution.
However, the former would tax banks’ profits while the

latter would potentially impose an opportunity cost on already liquid banks.
Because of this, the central bank could consider in the future pooling a portion of required
reserves. This would allow it to increase the funds under its control for ELA without increasing the
contribution from the government or taxing already liquid banks. In case of a liquidity shock, there
may be some banks that have excess funds but are unwilling to lend to illiquid banks. In such a case,
the CBK could pool a portion of banks’ required reserves and on-lend to solvent banks in need of
liquidity assistance. Pooling even 1 percentage point of banks’ 10 percent required reserve ratio
would increase ELA liquidity coverage from 38 percent to 45 percent of domestic banks’ combined
deposits. This would cover 75 percent of the largest domestic bank’s deposits and 112 percent of
the other domestic bank.2

2

Assuming the bank had been at the minimum required liquidity ratio, funds under control of the CBK would be
sufficient to cover 100 percent of the largest domestic bank’s short-term liabilities.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

To deal with extreme systemic shocks affecting all banks, however, the CBK would need to
consider a larger fund or external support. In the extreme case that all banks need liquidity
support—for instance, a euro area-wide shock that prevents parent banks from supporting
subsidiaries in Kosovo occurring at the same time as a domestic liquidity shock—there is little or no
scope for pooling funds from within the banking system. As a “fourth line of defense” (after banks’
own liquidity, parent bank support, and ELA reserves), the CBK would need either a larger
contribution from the government, external support, or have established an ex-ante fund (or
secured a contingent credit line) via fees or premiums.

C.

International Reserve Adequacy (RA)

A country’s RA has usually been assessed by the capacity to prevent and mitigate external
shocks. RA metrics usually encompass risks resulting from shocks to the current and capital
accounts. The former consists of shocks to external demand or terms of trade while the latter
includes external liabilities shocks or capital flight. The following components of the balance of
payments might be considered as sources of risk:


Export revenues (X) are a good approximation of potential losses arising from a negative external
demand or terms of trade shock. Other external financing inflows, such as remittance, foreign
aid or FDI might also reflect drains resulting from a deterioration in the external environment.



External short-term debt (STD) and other external medium and long-term liabilities (OPL)
indicate losses associated with the ability of foreigners to liquidate positions during periods of
stress.



Liquid domestic assets—measured by M2—capture losses from domestic capital outflows.

Despite the absence of currency risk, euroized economies like Kosovo still need to deal with
pressure stemming from financial obligations and external shocks. This is particularly true when
shocks might require liquidity that cannot be domestically generated. Moreover, euroized
economies might also want to preserve buffers to mitigate the impact of external shocks on
domestic absorption.

Therefore, traditional RA metrics may still be used as a benchmark for these countries. The
main formula for pegs/dollarized economies in the latest Fund guidance on assessing reserve
adequacy3 is as follows:
RA = 10%X + 30%STD + 20%OPL + 10%M24

(1).

Export revenue. Potential export losses can be substantial. Kosovo’s reliance on remittances



suggests that the RA metric should be supplemented by this source of risk. Therefore, a
10 percent weight on total export-related plus remittances (R)5 is used in this note.
Short-term debt and other liabilities. Drains resulting from short-term debt and other liabilities



have been important during past stress episodes. A euroized economy might also need liquidity
buffers to cope with financial obligations to non-residents and mitigate the risk of liquidity and
funding shocks. Therefore, short-term external private debt6 supplements the amount of shortterm external public debt amortization in the RA metrics with an unchanged 30 percent weight. A
20 percent weight on other external liabilities7 is used as in the traditional metric.
Domestic liquid assets. To account for the risk of domestic capital outflows, total deposits (D) are



included in the RA metric. However, given that in a dollarized economy the central bank has no
lender of last resort capabilities, we increase the weight from 10 percent to 20 percent here.
The adjusted RA metric for Kosovo shows that gross international reserves are adequate. Our
alternative, more conservative metric:

3

See IMF Policy Paper, “Assessing Reserve Adequacy—Specific Proposals.”

4

The metric is a simple sum of potential losses based on countries with fixed exchange rate regime
experiences during the past stress episodes. Weights correspond to the value of an extreme (10th percentile)
drain during the stress events.
5

A 10 percent weight might seem excessive given the stability of remittance inflow. It would allow, however, to
capture additional risks stemming from informal remittance inflows.

6

Short-term external private debt covers short-term financial liabilities of deposit-taking corporations and
other sectors reported in the international investment positions (IIP) statistics. Short-term external public debt
consists exclusively of the next year amortization.

7

Other external liabilities include medium and long-term financial (debt and equity) liabilities of general
government and other sectors on the remaining maturity reported in the IIP statistics.

RA = 10%(X+R) + 30%STD + 20%OPL + 20%D

(2),

puts Kosovo’s projected reserve needs at about 12 percent of GDP at end-2014. Therefore, gross
international reserves of about 18 percent of GDP (149 percent of the metric) remain comfortable.

D.

Conclusion

Kosovo appears to have sufficient reserves to deal with bank liquidity and overall BOP shocks,
but not shocks to fiscal financing. The government should over-finance the deficit as much as
markets will allow, to rebuild cash buffers to safe levels. Maintaining prudent ELA and BOP buffers
requires continued effort, but this could also have the benefit of reducing the probability or severity
of domestic and external shocks on output and welfare.

1/ The adequate level of reserves for ELA is calculated as the funds needed in case of a very severe bank run (i.e.,
40 percent of demand and savings deposits, and 20 percent of time deposits) on both domestic banks
simultaneously, assuming banks are at their minimum liquidity ratio of 25 percent of short-term deposits. Data are as
of December 2014.
2/ This definition of reserves corresponds to total official reserve assets reported to GDSS. It is the sum of foreign
exchange assets plus SDRs plus the reserve position at the IMF minus the deposits of the privatization agency and
pension funds, which are not under the control of the CBK or government.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly.

Safeguards Assessments
The latest safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo (CBK) was
completed in June 2012. It concluded that the majority of previous safeguards recommendations
had been implemented. In particular, Audit Committee oversight has been strengthened and the
Internal Audit Department has taken important steps towards full compliance with international
standards.
Exchange Arrangements
Kosovo does not issue a currency of its own, but uses the euro as legal means of payment. Kosovo is
not part of the euro area and the CBK is not part of the European System of Central Banks. There are
no restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, or measures that
would give rise to multiple currency practices. Kosovo is an Article XIV member. The authorities are
considering whether to accept the obligations under Article VIII, but have yet to reach a decision.
Previous Article IV Consultation
Kosovo was on a 24-month cycle during the previous Stand-By Arrangement. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded on July 23, 2013. Going forward, it is expected that Kosovo will be on a
12-month cycle.
FSAP and ROSC Participation
An FSAP mission was conducted during September 19–October 2, 2012. The FSSA included the
ROSC for compliance with Basel Core Principles. Kosovo has not had a data or a fiscal transparency

Technical Assistance

September 2008, to Kosovo. Technical assistance has centered on the Fund’s core competencies,

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance and for program monitoring. Performance
criteria can be tested with accuracy. However, the statistical system still suffers from considerable
shortages of financial and human resources.
National Accounts: Improvements have been made to the national accounts, but significant
weaknesses remain. The quality and timeliness of annual nominal and real GDP data based on
the expenditure approach has been improved and data is now published in an excel format on
the web-site of the Kosovo Statistical Agency, but with a large lag. GDP data based on the
production approach are available, but publication lags are long. Quarterly GDP data have begun
to be published but improvements in methodology are required. Kosovo needs to improve
existing and develop additional high-frequency (monthly) indicators, with priority given to
indicators relevant to Kosovo’s economy such as wholesale and retail trade data and services.
Labor Markets: Reliable labor force data is challenging given the large share of the informal
economy. A household survey was first undertaken in early 2012 and has been published
semiannually since, most recently in November 2014.
Consumer Price Index: A monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been produced since 2002
and is published on a monthly basis (with a lag of 13 days). The index uses a Classification of
Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)-compatible item classification with 352
elementary aggregates. A new index was introduced in December 2014, with new weights largely
based on National Accounts data aimed at bringing the CPI more in line with the European
Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). It targets all products and services purchased by all
households (resident and non-resident) in Kosovo. HICPs are available from January 2015
onward, with CPI available from May 2002 through November 2014.
Government Finance Statistics: Monthly reports on budget execution of the general
government (central government and municipalities) on a cash basis are provided five weeks
after the end of each month. However, budget classification is not consistent with GFSM 2001
because: (i) data is on cash basis, not accrual; (ii) lending for policy purposes (similar to subsidies)
is included after calculating the primary balance; (iii) capital transfers should be included in
current expenditure instead of capital expenditure; (iv) memorandum of understanding (MOU)
should be properly classified depending on their final purpose; (v) annual budget documents
should specify both current and capital spending related to individual projects. Monitoring of
domestic arrears should be strengthened.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO

Financial Sector Data: Depository corporations (commercial banks and central bank) statistics
starting as of December 2000 are published on monthly basis (with a lag of 25 days). Other
financial corporations’ statistics, starting as of June 2004, are published on quarterly basis (with a
lag of 35 days). Data are broadly consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM), 2000. Due to difficulties with obtaining adequate source data needed for
estimation of Euro currency in circulation, the CBK ceased compiling monetary aggregates in
2006. Financial soundness indicators are compiled according to the Compilation Guide on
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI), 2007, and available through STA FSI (starting with July 2010
data). Staff and other resources are currently sufficient.
External Sector Statistics: CBK provides quarterly balance of payments data. Recently, CBK has
revised its BOP data reflecting improvements in measurement of exports of services, remittances,
and currency in circulation among other items. These revisions are now reflected in the data we
report. Moreover, CBK has recently discontinued publishing trade data, which is now the
responsibility of the Statistical Office of Kosovo (SOK). The latter data is available on a monthly
basis. In October 2012, Kosovo started reporting quarterly IIP data to STA. Overall, the accuracy,
periodicity, and timeliness of balance of payments statistics have improved due to authorities’
efforts and with technical assistance from STA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 21, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Kosovo
On May 20, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Kosovo.
Growth in Kosovo has proven relatively resilient and stronger than in its Western Balkan
neighbors, averaging slightly more than 3 percent over the last five years. Steady remittances
from the Diaspora living in Advanced Europe continue to be a key driver of growth, supporting
as they have private consumption and investment. Nonetheless, medium-term growth prospects
of some 3½ percent per year, while reasonable, are not strong enough to steadily lift incomes
towards regional standards, or to create enough jobs in a country with very high unemployment.
Kosovo continues to enjoy a low public debt, and last year’s deficit complied with the fiscal
rule’s limit. However, promises made in the run up to the general elections could push this year’s
deficit above the limit. Moreover, the composition of the budget has worsened considerably, with
unproductive current spending crowding out spending on infrastructure, education, and health.
Kosovo’s banks remain liquid, well capitalized, and profitable. NPL ratios are slightly elevated
at 8.4 percent, but are stable and fully provisioned. The central bank has made commendable
progress in strengthening bank supervision as well as the framework for emergency liquidity
assistance. However, there are obstacles to the provision of credit, despite high levels of liquidity
in the banks. In particular, inefficient court proceedings on bank cases contribute to high interest
margins and high collateral requirements. High levels of informality also deter credit provision
via the concomitant lack of reliable financial statements.
Kosovo’s productive and export capacity is low at present owing to the country’s significant
wage and non-wage competitiveness gap. The former is related to unsustainable wage pressures
in the public sector, which make it difficult for the private sector to attract talent. The latter

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

involves a looming energy deficit, limited access to and quality of education and vocational
training, and remaining issues in the business environment, including perceptions of corruption.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the resilient performance of Kosovo’s economy, driven by private
consumption and investment on the back of strong remittances. Meanwhile, low energy prices
and developments in the euro area have kept inflation low. Directors noted, however, that the
growing fiscal deficit and competitiveness gap weigh on medium-term prospects for growth,
employment, and income convergence with neighboring countries. They stressed that strong
policy action, including fiscal adjustment and broad based structural reforms, is critical to
address these challenges in the period ahead.
Directors called on the authorities to preserve fiscal credibility and gradually strengthen buffers.
Following last year’s large wage and benefit increases, they welcomed the initial steps taken this
year to contain fiscal overruns. Directors agreed that additional measures would be needed to
bring the 2015 deficit closer to the ceiling under the fiscal rule. They saw scope for further
mobilizing revenues, particularly the value added tax. Directors also recommended improving
the composition of the budget by containing increases in unproductive current spending, so as to
create space for spending in priority areas such as infrastructure, education, and health care.
They welcomed the authorities’ plan to develop a rules based mechanism for public wage setting
consistent with productivity gains, and pointed to the benefits of a broader reform of the civil
service. Directors also saw merit in revisiting the investment clause in the fiscal rule to allow for
externally financed development projects, while preserving Kosovo’s good debt position.
Directors noted that Kosovo’s banking sector is generally healthy and well capitalized. They
commended the authorities for the progress in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory
framework, especially the adoption of risk based supervision. Continued efforts are necessary to
further enhance the frameworks for emergency liquidity assistance, macroprudential policies,
and crisis management. Directors also saw a need to improve access to credit and facilitate
financial intermediation, supported by a more efficient judicial system.
Directors underscored that raising potential growth and improving labor participation and
productivity remain key priorities for the country. They called on the authorities to expedite
structural reforms in several areas to boost competitiveness and help spur private sector
development and job creation. Specifically, Directors encouraged further steps to modernize
energy infrastructure, address high labor costs, and improve education. Enhanced efforts are also

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

needed to strengthen governance and the business environment more broadly. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to remain closely engaged with the Fund, including through
a possible new arrangement to help anchor their ambitious policy and reform agenda.

Statement by Ibrahim Halil Canakci, Executive Director for Kosovo
and Mentor Mehmedi, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 20, 2015
The Kosovar authorities thank staff for their cooperation and constructive discussions during
the 2015 Article IV consultation mission in Prishtina. They highly value the ongoing policy
dialogue with the Fund and note that the Fund’s policy analysis and advice are very useful in
shaping their policy agenda. They broadly agree with staff’s assessment and the main
challenges facing the Kosovar economy.
After six months of a political stalemate following the June 2014 parliamentary elections, a
grand coalition was formed, comprising the two largest political parties plus minorities. The
current reform-oriented government holds a comfortable majority in parliament and is
committed to effective policymaking. A key objective of the government’s policy strategy
for 2015–2017 is fostering private sector-induced growth, by maintaining and further
strengthening macro-financial stability, improving the business environment, and
accelerating structural reforms.
Since the 2013 Article IV consultation, there have been encouraging developments in the
relations with the European Union (EU). On April 30, 2015, the European Commission
adopted the proposal for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU
and Kosovo. The agreement, which is expected to come into effect in 2016, is the first
contractual arrangement between the EU and Kosovo, and represents an important step in
Kosovo’s path towards EU membership. The SAA will serve as a platform for economic,
political, and administrative reforms while opening up EU markets to Kosovo’s companies
and products. Concrete results have also been achieved in normalizing the relations with
Serbia under the EU-sponsored dialogue, which began in 2013.
Economic developments and outlook
Kosovo continues to be the highest growth performer in the Western Balkans, with a fiveyear average growth rate of over 3.5 percent. Despite the uncertain political situation last
year, the economy is estimated to have grown by 3 percent in 2014 on the back of increased
consumption and steady remittances. The authorities are more optimistic than staff regarding
the outlook. They expect growth to accelerate to 3.8 percent this year, driven mainly by
consumption, remittances, and increased investments, and then to further increase to
4.4 percent annually during 2016–2018. They also project a significant growth in exports of
goods as well as import substitution, following the rising activity in the agriculture sector.
Low inflation will continue throughout 2015, largely owing to imported disinflation from the
EU and low energy prices. Inflation is expected to hover around 0.2 percent this year, while
gradually climbing to 0.5 percent in 2016.

2
In the medium term, a strong banking sector, remittances, public investments, improved
competitiveness, and foreign direct investment (FDI) will be important pillars for Kosovo’s
strong growth performance.
Indeed, there are important upside risks to the baseline scenario, specifically those related to
certain large-scale investment projects. Last month, the government signed an agreement
with a French-led consortium for the development of the Brezovica Resort project, a yearround ski vacation destination. The agreement envisions a phased investment of
EUR 409 million (approximately 8 percent of GDP), with an initial investment of
EUR 165 million during the first three years. Overall, the project is expected to create over
3,000 jobs while transforming this ski resort into the largest in the Western Balkans. At the
same time, the tendering process for the development of new energy production capacities
and the construction of a new thermo-power plant (600 MW) is under way (the investment of
the new power plant is estimated at 20 percent of GDP). Additionally, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development has agreed in principle to finance the rehabilitation of the
railway that links Kosovo to Serbia and FYR Macedonia (approximately 2 percent of GDP).
There are encouraging signs of an increase in domestic production and some import
substitution. Further import substitution and the diversification of exports could reduce the
large and persistent trade deficit which stands at 32 percent of GDP.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain committed to safeguarding macro-fiscal stability. The medium-term
fiscal objectives are designed to preserve the credibility of the fiscal rule, which sets an
overall ceiling on the general government deficit at 2 percent of GDP, and the low level of
public debt.
The authorities acknowledge that the 2015 budget relies on optimistic revenue projections,
and have already taken the necessary measures to generate fiscal savings and address fiscal
risks. Aside from the fiscal measures already taken such as an increase in the excise tax on
tobacco, alcohol, vehicles, and heavy oil, the authorities are willing to work with the Fund to
find additional fiscal measures (both on the revenue and spending sides) that would bring the
deficit closer to 2 percent and preserve the credibility of the fiscal rule. An increase in the
VAT rate, the introduction of a differentiated rate, and other modifications to the VAT
system has already been approved by the government. On the spending side, the authorities
have decided to maintain public sector wages in the 2015 budget at 2014 levels, in nominal
terms, and also intend to carry this forward to 2016, in order to decrease public sector wages
as a percentage of GDP, and hence contribute to an improved competitiveness and
attractiveness of the private sector.
Further consolidation efforts which are targeted at unproductive current spending are being
considered to improve the budget structure and create more space for growth-enhancing
expenditures, such as infrastructure development projects. The authorities concur with staff

3
on the need to address unsustainable upward trends in public wages that have outpaced
productivity. The government is in the process of drafting a legal framework (law on
salaries) which will govern the level of wages, salaries, and allowances for all public sector
employees. The reform is intended to establish a rules-based mechanism which links the
country’s wages to its productivity dynamics and to preserve the competitiveness of the
overall economy. The reform of public wage determination processes will be done in
consultation with the IMF.
Tax administration—an area in which the Fund has provided technical assistance to the
authorities—is being improved in order to broaden the tax base, encourage formality, and
boost revenues. The Tax Administration of Kosovo (TAK) is preparing a new corporate
strategy, while the IT system is being revamped and compliance is being strengthened. At the
same time, the Customs Administration is modernizing its revenue collection system in
accordance with the Customs EU Blueprint Guide. In their efforts to fight the informal
economy and seek efficiency gains, the authorities also plan to merge the revenue-collecting
agencies in the medium term.
Taking into consideration that Kosovo has one of the lowest levels of public debt in Europe
(10.4 percent of GDP) and faces significant development needs, the authorities consider the
fiscal rule’s provision on capital spending as too tight and constraining development. While
the provision in the fiscal rule allows for privatization proceeds to finance capital spending
above the 2 percent deficit ceiling, contingent upon prudent cash buffers, this provision is of
limited use, as usable privatization receipts are very low at less than 1 percent of GDP and
expected to decrease further. Therefore, they are insufficient to finance the necessary
development projects. At the current juncture, the authorities look forward to working with
the Fund to expand the investment clause in the fiscal rule in order to allow for IFI-financed
projects, alongside those funded with limited privatization receipts. In view of Kosovo’s
large infrastructure and social needs, IFI-financed projects would provide the desirable
impetus for growth and job creation.
Financial Sector
The Kosovar banking sector (which is dominated by banks with foreign capital) remains
stable, sound, and profitable. Kosovar banks follow a traditional banking model, are wellcapitalized (18.2 percent capital adequacy ratio) and continue to be some of the most
profitable in the region, with a 23.2 percent return on equity. Bank lending is predominantly
financed by domestic deposits with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 73.4 percent.
Banks continue to have excess liquidity. Banks’ aggregate liquid assets cover almost
45 percent of short-term liabilities, a key consideration in a euroized economy such as
Kosovo. Non-performing loans are stable at 8.3 percent of total loans and are well
provisioned at 116 percent. Credit growth is accelerating but remains moderate given the
need for the financial sector to support growth. During 2014, lending increased by

4
4.2 percent compared to 2013. Similarly, deposits grew by 3.6 percent. While the interest rate
on loans, both to households and financial corporations, has dropped considerably to single
digits, interest rate spreads still remain high.
The authorities concur with staff that high levels of liquidity in the banks can be better
utilized to support growth and increase access to finance. In particular, they agree that court
proceedings on bank cases need to be made more efficient and predictable, so that banks can
lend without imposing high interest margins and applying high collateral requirements (over
200 percent). The authorities have taken several measures to increase the efficiency of the
court system and reduce the backlog in executing court cases. A private bailiff service is fully
functional, and further legal reforms aimed at addressing issues such as streamlining
commercial court processes and reducing high collateral requirements are being
implemented. Write-off procedures for non-performing loans (NPLs) are also being revisited
to make the NPL recovery process more effective. The Central Bank of the Republic of
Kosovo (CBK) has requested the Fund’s assistance in this regard.
The CBK has made great progress in strengthening the regulatory framework on banking
supervision and oversight. A full-fledged risk-based supervision framework is in place and
on-site examinations are being executed. The authorities have implemented most of the 2012
FSAP recommendations. The CBK has drafted a new legal framework for Emergency
Liquidity Assistance which is in line with best practice and governs the conditions,
processes, and modalities of any emergency assistance provided to banks. As rightly noted
by staff, the CBK has also requested letters of comfort from parent banks of local
subsidiaries. With the aim of enhancing the collaboration with foreign bank supervisors,
formal agreements of cooperation have been signed with the German and Turkish authorities
(the origin of most foreign banks) and discussions with the Austrian supervisory authorities
have been initiated.
The Kosovar authorities remain committed to further developing the macroprudential toolkit
and strengthening the crisis management framework.
Structural Reforms
Structural reforms remain essential to raise potential growth, boost productivity, and improve
the flexibility and competitiveness of the Kosovar economy. Among the top priorities are
tackling the energy constraints, reforming the labor market and education, and fostering a
business-enabling environment. The National Economic Reform Program (NERP) which
provides the blueprint for structural reforms aimed at boosting growth and jobs was
submitted to the European Commission in January, and its implementation will be monitored
by the Prime Minister’s office.
Although Kosovo has one of the most significant deposits of lignite coal in Europe and has
sufficient resources to power itself, it continues to face consistent energy shortages. The two
existing power plants are old and unreliable, and the production capacity is inadequate to

5
meet current demand. With the support from the World Bank, the authorities have embarked
on a broad range of reforms aimed at addressing the energy problem, thus removing one of
the impediments to growth. The tendering process for building a new thermo-power plant
(600 MW) is under way. An international consortium has been selected and is expected to
submit its financial proposal to the Inter-Ministerial Committee in May. The construction of
the new power plant, which will comply with the EU’s Industrial Emmissions Directive,
could begin in 18 months, creating 10,000 temporary jobs during the construction phase and
500 permanent positions once the power plant begins operations. In addition, a 400 kilovolt
transmission line between Kosovo and Albania, funded by the German development bank
KfW, is under construction, and will produce cost savings while enhancing the reliability of
the regional energy network.
The authorities acknowledge that improvements in the labor market reforms, complemented
by reforms in education are crucial in view of the high unemployment and low labor
participation rates. Further efforts are being made to better match the educational system and
the labor market needs, especially by modifying the curricula framework for pre-university
education. At the same time, the authorities intend to expand the vocational educational
system complemented by active labor market policies.
The Kosovar business environment rates relatively well in a regional context. In the last three
years, Kosovo has moved up over 40 positions in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report,
and is now ranked 75th. While improvements have been made in starting a business and
dealing with construction permits, further reforms are required in tackling constraints in
getting electricity, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency to attract FDI and boost
investment.
Lastly, with the aim of improving governance and increasing the efficiency of public
spending, the authorities have drafted a new public sector procurement law, in accordance
with international best practice. The new legislation, which will be followed by the
implementation of the e-procurement, planned for next year, will increase the efficiency in
public sector spending while eliminating discretion and reducing corruption.
Other remarks
The authorities recognize that while the country stands in a solid fiscal and financial position,
a possible program with the IMF would further strengthen Kosovo’s macro-economic
framework, boost the credibility of its policies, and enhance the trust and confidence of
investors in the economy. In this vein, the Kosovar authorities have requested that the IMF
send a mission team to Kosovo to begin negotiations on a possible program arrangement.
