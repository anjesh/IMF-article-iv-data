STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 8, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: The key issue facing Congo is how to use oil and mineral resources effectively
in support of inclusive growth. Economic conditions are supportive—macroeconomic
stability is in place, the terms of trade are favorable, and the external position is strong.
External risks are mitigated by membership in CEMAC, under which all members
benefit from the French convertibility guarantee, and large fiscal buffers. Yet, growth
has not been inclusive. Over half of the population lives in poverty and a labor skills
mismatch results in high unemployment and underemployment, especially among
youth. The difficult business climate holds back diversification. On March 4, 2012 a
munitions depot exploded in Brazzaville causing death and destruction; near-term
policies focus on reconstruction and addressing the humanitarian crisis.
Strengthening fiscal policy: The medium-term orientation of fiscal policy aims to
scale up investment expenditure to close the infrastructure gap while saving a portion
of oil revenue. This approach is broadly sound, but leaves development and savings
objectives vulnerable to oil prices, and needs to be accompanied by strong measures
to raise expenditure quality. Implementing a fiscal anchor could help reduce
procyclicality of spending.
Raising the inclusiveness of growth: Inclusive growth is multidimensional and
coordinated policies are required to address weaknesses in the fiscal framework, the
business climate, financial sector development and the labor market. The new National
Development Plan 2012–2016 is consistent with raising inclusiveness, and plans are in
place to improve the business climate and increase the financial sector’s role in
development. Effective implementation is critical to creating a stable environment
governed by the rule of law. Labor policies need to improve the quality of education
and increase technical training.
Data issues: Despite intensive technical assistance, data continues to suffer
shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.

Box 1. Republic of Congo—Financial Sector Developments
The Congolese financial sector is one of the least developed in Africa. However, increased confidence
in the strength of the economy, the recent acceleration in growth, improved infrastructure, and
ample liquidity have laid the ground for sustained financial deepening.
The financial sector in Congo is underdeveloped. Banking sector assets account for 21 percent

aid the use of collateral are expected to facilitate access to
banking services.
The number of banks increased from six in 2010 to nine institutions in 2012. The financial
sector is dominated by universal banks which are mostly privately owned subsidiaries of foreign
institutions. Microfinance institutions, pension funds and insurance play a very limited role in
providing financial services.
The banking system appears to be sound, and exposure to Euro area distress, limited. The
ratio of the nonperforming loans to deposits is low at about 1.1 percent despite robust credit
growth. Credit to the private sector picked up strongly in 2011 reflecting increasing demand in the
construction, transportation, telecomm and hotel sectors. While the majority of loans are very
short term, a shift toward medium-term credit has recently been observed. Yet, the diversity of
financial services provided is limited and focuses on loans to enterprises in the real sector.

Compliance by Congolese banks with CEMAC prudential ratios is broadly satisfactory,
although the limit on lending to a single borrower is routinely violated. The undiversified economy
provides few credit-worthy large borrowers and leads to a concentration of risks. Increasing
banking activity associated with a pickup in non-oil growth would require strengthening of
staffing and oversight capability of the regional regulator, COBAC.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Republic of Congo—Fiscal Developments and the 2012 Budget
Fiscal performance was sustained under the three-year ECF arrangement (2008–11). The original
2012 budget showed a reversal of gains in non-oil revenue collection and current expenditure
rationalization, while the additional spending in the supplemental budget further heightens concerns
about implementation and absorptive capacity, and poses potential risks to macrostability.
In 2011 the authorities began scaling up public investment, financed in part by fiscal space
created by measures to improve non-oil revenue collection. Sustained high oil prices contributed
to an overall double-digit surplus, with the widening of the non-oil basic primary deficit (NOBPD)
reflecting the government’s general policy of using own-financing for investment.
The original 2012 budget continued to emphasize investment, while showing a reversal of
trends in non-oil revenue collection and non-wage current expenditure rationalization. The share
of social spending was programmed to decline slightly, despite an increase of 26 percent in nonwage current expenditure. The budget also contained 8 percent of non-oil GDP in net lending to
state-owned enterprises.
The 2012 supplemental budget contains nearly 25 percentage points of non-oil GDP in
additional spending. Four

over the longer term.

Box 3. Republic of Congo—External Stability and Competitiveness
An external stability analysis based on methodologies tailored to resource rich countries suggests that the
real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with medium term fundamentals. However,
competitiveness is weak, hindered by a large infrastructure gap, complex trade regime, challenging business
climate, low labor productivity and a labor skills mismatch (for more on labor, see Annex I) .
Model Based Exchange Rate Assessment
Since the 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc, the REER for Congo has appreciated, broadly tracking
movements in the Euro. Application of the external stability (ES) approach contained in Bems and
Carvalho-Filho (2009) points to a slight overvaluation of the currency. Depending on the allocation rule
employed, the level of overvaluation is estimated between 1 and 12 percent, with large confidence
intervals surrounding the estimates. However, when the growth-enhancing productivity of importintensive public investment is taken into account, the REER appears broadly in line with medium term
fundamentals, consistent with the finding for the CEMAC region as a whole. These results are highly
sensitive to a large range of assumptions and do not include the one-off foreign investment in the
mining sector starting in 2015 ($6–8 billion in investment 2015–17; large scale iron production is
expected to begin in late 2017, lasting about 30 years).

The underlying current account is different from Table 1. It has been adjusted
to exclude the huge one-off foreign investment in the mining sector in 2015-17.

Competitiveness
Competitiveness is multidimensional. Congo’s Doing Business
ranking (181 of 183) suggests there is significant room for
improvement in the business climate, especially in the ease of
paying taxes, border trade, and starting a business. The tax
regime is particularly nontransparent, unpredictable and complex;
the trade regime is also highly complex. Low labor productivity
brought on by the rigid labor market dominated by skills
mismatch, lack of technical expertise, and low mobility renders
goods uncompetitive.

B. Strengthening fiscal policy—anchors and expenditure quality
The absence of a hard budget constraint has led to complacency regarding non-oil revenue collection
and rising current expenditure, reinforcing oil dependence. At the same time, low capacity hinders the
ability of government to effectively scale up investment to meet development needs. Implementing a
simple fiscal rule would help anchor policy, while redoubling efforts to improve expenditure quality.

Steps are being taken to strengthen

expenditure quality. Under the umbrella of
the recently adopted results-based
management model, ministries are held
accountable for achieving agreed quarterly
and annual goals, as laid out in the
institutional framework for monitoring and
evaluation contained in the NDP. In this
context, public investment projects over
$2 million have been devolved to line
ministries and they are working toward a
functional classification of expenditure to
eliminate duplication of responsibilities.

Specific measures have also been

taken to further strengthen the expenditure

implementing the procurement code.
However, challenges remain in the areas of

The key is for all control measures to be used
to their full potential in all ministries. There
was broad agreement that implementing a
public expenditure tracking system could help
identify key weaknesses driving high leakage
of funds, especially in social spending.
Discussions are ongoing with the World Bank
and Unicef on moving these initiatives forward,

C. Fostering inclusive growth
By its nature, the natural resource sector is not inclusive—growth is often volatile, production is capital
intensive and rents are not widely distributed. In order to make growth more inclusive the government
must efficiently transform oil income into growth-enhancing capital and social expenditure, while
implementing policies to improve the business climate, financial sector and labor market. This should
be supported by gains in institution building, governance and transparency.

ANNEX II. ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE 2012
SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET
Government policy drives inflation dynamics in Congo mainly through two channels: (i) controlled
prices, which hinder the pass-through from international to domestic prices, and (ii) the predominant
role of government expenditure in domestic activity. The inflationary impact of a large increase in
government spending is estimated to last about 12 quarters with a peak reached after 5 quarters.
Limited supply response due to the undiversified economy and infrastructure bottlenecks—especially in
transportation—is likely to amplify inflationary pressures in the near-term.

ANNEX III. AN APPROACH TO ANCHORING FISCAL POLICY
Traditional methods for anchoring fiscal policy are ill-suited to resource-rich countries with
development needs. Models based on the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH models) are particularly
inappropriate in that they aim to smooth consumption, and therefore cannot capture the growthenhancing benefits of the near-term scaling up of investment. External stability and debt sustainability
analyses also have limitations in anchoring fiscal policy when net debt is negative and assets are
projected to climb. This raises the question of how to anchor fiscal policy.
In such a case, fiscal policy can be anchored by implementing a simple oil revenue rule to pin down
budgetary revenue and basing capital expenditure on an assessment of an adequate capital spending
envelope over the scaling up period taking into account absorptive and implementation capacity. The
revenue and expenditure paths can then be calibrated to ensure consistency with a fiscal sustainability
framework based on total net wealth (financial and physical).

be computed by adjusting non-oil revenues by
the ratio of potential to actual output. Total
budgetary revenues are then defined as the
sum of oil price-based oil revenues and
structural non-oil revenues. Given the
dominance of oil sector in GDP and national
revenues, adding a structural revenue rule for
non-oil revenues in Congo does not have a
significant impact in the estimated annual
flows to the stabilization fund. Hence, for the
sake of simplicity, the implementation of an oil
price rule is recommended.
6.

Value-at-risk modeling is used to

estimate the optimal size of a local currency

the potential volatility of oil prices, and in turn,
the contribution of oil revenues to the budget.
This type of modeling is often considered

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7.

The initial stabilization buffer should

be large enough to ensure that, given an oil
price-based budget rule, the buffer would not
be fully depleted over a period of three years
with a high degree of confidence. This aims to
avoid the high cost of adjustment in the event
that the buffer was fully depleted. The
minimum required size of the stabilization
buffer is estimated based on the oil production
profile and fiscal regime as well as stochastic
simulation of future oil prices.
8.

Assuming the 8-year moving average

price rule recommended above, the estimated
minimum size of the stabilization buffer for
Congo is around 1,005 billion CFA
(approximately 48 percent of non-oil GDP).

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
to 2010. Annual data on employment in
the central government are available from
the MoF, but are not consistent with data
from the civil service roster of the Ministry
of the Civil Service. As part of the structural
reforms undertaken in the context of the
post-conflict program, the government
completed an audit of public service
employees, but the two civil service’s
databases are yet to be unified.

(As of May 30, 2012)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for
Surveillance




46

General: Data provision has shortcomings,
but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The incomplete reporting of fiscal
financing, and limited statistical coverage
and long delays in the provision of
national accounts and balance of
payments statistics are particularly
problematic. Since the occurrence of
governance problems at the Bank of
Central African States (BEAC), timely
delivery of financial sector data has been
hampered. Poor coordination among
different governmental agencies is also an
issue. Technical assistance has resulted in
some progress but there is still a need to
consolidate these gains and further
strengthen statistical capacities.

National Accounts: National accounts
data is weak, with inconsistencies both
internally and with balance of payments
statistics. The Directorate General of
Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF) provides Fund missions with a
breakdown of GDP by expenditures and
sectors, both in nominal and real terms. In
the context of moving to the SNA93
system of accounts, the DGS completed
the national accounts estimates for 2005
(the new base year) and for 2006–07, with
the assistance of a resident statistical
expert and AFRITAC Central. The
authorities are currently working with the
AFRITAC Central to revise national
accounts’ estimates back to 2000 and up

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Price statistics: Movements in the prices
of commodities consumed by households
are recorded for the capital city of
Brazzaville and for Pointe Noire, the
second largest city. Data are compiled on a
monthly basis. Starting August 2010, the
authorities introduced a new CPI measure
with new weights and a new composition
of the basket of goods and service. This
new CPI is harmonized with that of other
countries in the Central African Economic
and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
However, implementation of the new CPI
suffers from severe deficiencies, given the
fixed nature of the products followed,
especially in the fast-moving telecoms
sector.



Government finance statistics (GFS):
Progress is underway to increase the
comprehensiveness of the data through
the adoption of systematic compilation
practices and steps have been taken to
computerize expenditure chain accounting.
However, the recording of fiscal financing
in the official TOFE is incomplete and
results in large, unexplained statistical
discrepancies. The Caisse Congolaise
d’Amortissement (CCA) produces data on
the outstanding stock of external public

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

debt, including arrears and their
composition, together with detailed
projections on debt service due. These
data are provided to Fund missions.
However, the debt stock data cannot
readily be reconciled with flow data in the
balance of payments or the fiscal accounts,
as a result of weak collaboration between
the CCA and public works and the CCA
and the BEAC. The CCA also produces
domestic debt data. Concerns still exist
with regard to the reconciliation of fiscal
and monetary statistics. There is no
centralized, comprehensive database on
the operations of public enterprises.
However, some information has been
made available to Fund missions by
individual enterprises. TOFE compilers do
not have access to relevant financial
statements of the Société Nationale des
Pétroles Congolais (SNPC), which carries
out several operations on behalf of the
government (notably in the oil sector).



Monetary statistics: BEAC regularly
reports monetary, interest rate, and
exchange rate statistics for publication in
IFS. In 2007, the BEAC started a project to
migrate monetary statistics of member
countries of the CEMAC to the
methodology in the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). As part
of this project, a regional workshop was
organized by the BEAC in December 2007
to finalize the mapping of source data
from commercial banks to the MFSM
concepts and framework. STA participated
in this workshop to provide guidance and
advice. Submission of data by the BEAC
using the standardized report forms is
pending. Following governance issues
occurred in 2009 at the BEAC data delivery

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

on financial system indicators has been
hampered. The accuracy of national
monetary statistics may be affected by
large cross-border movements of BEAC
issued banknotes among CEMAC member
countries. However, the Republic of Congo
is moderately affected by such
movements: 10 percent of banknotes
issued in the Republic of Congo by the
BEAC national directorate circulate in
Cameroon and 2 percent in Gabon, while
currency in circulation in the Republic of
Congo includes 0.9 percent of banknotes
from Cameroon and 1.9 percent from
Gabon. The magnitude of banknote
movements between the Republic of
Congo and CEMAC member countries
other than Cameroon and Gabon is very
small.


Balance of payments: Although BEAC
produces balance of payments data, delays
occur and data suffers from significant
inconsistencies with other datasets. The
opacity surrounding certain transactions in
the oil sector introduces an extra layer of
imprecision. In addition, net investment
flows are overestimated by significant
unrecorded disinvestment operations that
are part of the tax regime arrangements
obtained by nonresident oil-drilling
companies. Balance of payments data for
1995 through 2005 are published in the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics
(IFS), and STA is working with the
authorities in updating the data series. In
February 2007, a follow-up STA balance of
payments statistics mission made a
number of recommendations aimed at
improving institutional arrangements for
balance of payments statistics compilation
and validation. Progress in this regard has

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
Republic of Congo
On June 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Republic of Congo.1
Background
Economic performance strengthened in 2011. While production in maturing oil fields
declined, non-oil growth accelerated, buoyed by strong activity in the construction,
telecommunications and transport sectors. The scaling up of public investment provided a
further boost to activity through improvements to the road system, which facilitated
transport of goods between the port and the capital city. Inflation declined to below the
Central African Economic and Monerary Community (CEMAC) convergence criteria of
3 percent as supply bottlenecks eased and school tuition fees were eliminated.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The external position remained strong, with the sustained large fiscal surplus raising official
foreign assets. At end 2011, net external debt turned negative, with assets exceeding debt
by about 30 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Despite high oil prices, the current
account registered only a small surplus reflecting high imports associated with the scaling
up of public investment and strong profit remittances by oil companies. The terms of trade
improved, but the real effective exchange rate moved sideways, ending the year broadly
unchanged.
The overall fiscal cash balance registered a double-digit surplus, despite the significant
scaling up of investment. Revenue was supported by high oil prices and improvements in
non-oil revenue collection, while additional fiscal space was provided through
rationalization of current expenditure. However, these efforts were insufficient to offset the
higher capital spending, and as a result, the 2011 basic non-oil primary deficit (BNOPD)
widened by over ten percentage points of non-oil GDP.
In March 2012, a munitions depot exploded in Brazzaville causing widespread destruction
and loss of life. Reconstruction efforts are underway, and a very large supplemental budget
was approved in April. Despite the high import content, the additional spending is expected
to boost growth, while the low level of economic diversification and limited domestic
capacity for a supply response will push inflation higher. The overall fiscal cash balance is
expected to remain in surplus, but the BNOPD would deteriorate significantly, to over
70 percent of non-oil GDP. Higher imports would reduce the current account surplus to
near balance.
Beyond 2012, the outlook is favorable. Public investment is laying a foundation of basic
infrastructure and the government has started to implement their action plan to improve the
business climate. Non-oil growth is expected to remain robust as economic diversification
moves forward, with new investments beginning over the medium term in mining and
agroindustry.
As production in mature oil fields continues to taper off, the current account will remain in
slight surplus before turning sharply negative in 2015–17 reflecting imported investment

goods related to a huge mine expected to come on stream in late 2017. External risks
appear manageable, as inward spillovers from a worsening of the situation in Europe are
relatively limited due to weak trade and financial linkages. The risk of a large negative
shock to the oil price is partially attenuated by ample regional reserve holdings and sizable
fiscal buffers held offshore. Domestic risks surround uncertainties regarding the ability of
public investment and structural reform to raise future growth and deliver poverty reduction.
Maintaining reform momentum for strong policy implementation will help mitigate these
risks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for achieving macroeconomic stability.
Despite robust growth, poverty nevertheless remains widespread and unemployment is
high. Directors urged the authorities to use the favorable environment to pursue ambitious
reforms in order to broaden the economic base and make growth more inclusive.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy appropriately focuses on scaling up investment, while
saving a portion of oil revenue. They recognized the pressing capital expenditure needs,
especially in response to the devastating arms depot explosion in Brazzaville, but
underscored the importance of project prioritization to ensure that the level of investment is
consistent with absorptive and implementation capacity. Directors emphasized that
improving public financial management is critical to enhancing expenditure quality. They
welcomed efforts to strengthen accountability through adoption of a results-based
management framework and expenditure control measures. Directors also called for efforts
to contain non-priority current spending and increase non-oil revenue collection. They saw
merit in a simple fiscal rule to help anchor spending and savings objectives.
Directors welcomed the new National Development Plan. They noted that unlocking the
country’s sizable economic potential requires coordinated efforts to improve the business
climate, develop the financial sector, and address the labor skills mismatch and high youth
unemployment. Directors emphasized the importance of creating a stable business
environment governed by the rule of law and adequate investor protection. They urged a

cautious approach to the use of special economic zones given the risks these entail in
creating a dual tax system. Directors also encouraged the authorities to conduct a skills
assessment to inform labor policies and to work with the private sector regarding training
needs.
Directors noted that Congo’s membership in CEMAC and the region’s common fixed
exchange rate regime has anchored macroeconomic stability. They urged the authorities to
comply with all CEMAC obligations, including the repatriation and reserve pooling
requirements. In addition, Directors encouraged timely compliance with the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative and stronger efforts to improve national accounts and
balance-of-payments data.

Statement by Mr. Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director of the Republic of Congo
June 27, 2012
On behalf of my Congolese authorities, I would like to express their appreciation to staff for the fruitful
discussions held in Brazzaville under the 2012 Article IV consultation. The staff report presents a candid
analysis of the economy, the progress achieved and the daunting challenges ahead. My authorities
welcome the report’s focus on policies to preserve macroeconomic stability and to keep advancing
towards higher and sustainable growth. The authorities broadly agree with the staff's assessment and
are grateful for their useful recommendations.
In spite of high growth rates driven by the oil sector, efforts to reduce poverty and raise employment
over the years have been challenging. The emphasis in this year’s Article IV report on “making growth
more inclusive” is therefore timely. The authorities share many of the analyses in the report and agree in
particular that an appropriate sequencing of policies and reforms along with a better coordination in
their implementation is key to enhancing growth inclusiveness. They also concur that promoting jobintensive growth requires a multi-pronged approach, and share the view that to diversify the economy
away from oil which as stressed in the report is not inclusive by nature, it is essential to improve the
business climate. Reforming the education system—in line with the needs of a more vibrant economy—,
is also crucial to reducing labor skills mismatch.
In addition to the sound policies highlighted in the report, the authorities believe that their current
efforts to scale up infrastructure investment and close the country’s wide infrastructure gap are critical
to improving growth inclusiveness. They are convinced that within the broader framework of the 20112016 National Development Plan and the current PRSP, improving the country’s infrastructure will help
accelerate the diversification of the economy, increase Congo’s growth potential, and stimulate
employment. They agree, however, that careful planning of infrastructure build up is needed and that
the project implementation requires the use of quality control measures, as rightly stressed by staff in
the report.
On this year’s supplemental budget, they would like to emphasize that:
-

The supplemental budget is primarily a response to the tragic explosion inside a military depot

in Brazzaville in March which cost hundreds of lives, led to thousands of displaced, and destroyed a vast
neighborhood of the capital;
-

This tragic event, which deeply affected the population, led to numerous claims on the

government (social, military etc.). As such, the supplemental budget is—either directly or indirectly—

linked to the tragedy, as the authorities sought to address its immediate and potential consequences on
the Congolese population and the country.
Macroeconomic Performance and Risks
Overall, macroeconomic performance remains strong driven by the non-oil sector, in a context of
domestic and external stability, and a rapid buildup of foreign exchange reserves. Congo’s economic
outlook continues to be favorable, further buoyed by recent important discoveries in the mining sector,
notably iron ore.
The authorities agree that higher inflation is a risk, and acknowledge the concerns expressed by staff. In
particular, the projected increase in broad money, and the country’s limited supply capacity, due notably
to transport bottlenecks, could exacerbate inflationary risks.
However, while the economy could experience some degree of inflation, there are a number of
mitigating factors to a sharp rise in overall prices. First, as a member of the zone Franc, the monetary
authorities will remain vigilant and will continue to closely monitor any potential rapid deterioration of
the inflation outlook. Although monetary policy is set at the regional level, the BEAC takes into
consideration member countries’ public finances when determining the amount of central bank
refinancing to be provided to domestic commercial banks, as a means of achieving price stability in the
region. In this regard, while consumer prices are projected to increase by 5.1 percent this year (period
average)—compared to last year’s 1.8 inflation rate—, prices in 2012 will revert to the approximate
levels of the preceding three years. Furthermore, many of the investment projects underway—either by
design or because they are capital intensive—are likely to have a limited impact on the country’s narrow
production capacity as a large share of the inputs needed for the investments will be imported, not
purchased locally. This will therefore lessen the potential pressures on domestic prices from higher
capital spending.
Fiscal Challenges
It is currently projected that the authorities’ supplemental budget will “lift budget spending to over
120 percent of non-oil GDP”. The authorities emphasize however that while capital investment is being
scaled up they will continue to adopt prudent policies on public sector wages, domestic and
international debt, and national savings.

56

Thus, the increase in the overall budget envelope for this year (supplemental budget included) is driven
mainly by capital spending—essential for raising the country’s growth potential—, and not current
spending. In this regard, despite a substantial increase in domestic revenues (including oil), the
authorities have refrained from raising public sector wages or hiring additional staff, thereby containing
the increase in current expenditures. In addition, debt remains in check, as higher fiscal revenues—
which have risen to almost 140% of non-oil GDP i.e. more than total expenditures—are financing the
increase in spending. Also, despite higher capital spending, the authorities have continued to save part
of their high oil revenues. Thus, while gross investment as a share of GDP is projected to reach
33.6 percent this year (from 25.3 percent last year), gross saving will also increase to 33.8 percent (from
26.1 percent last year).
On the issue of capacity, the authorities noted the concerns expressed by staff in the report that while
total expenditures are expected to rise above 120 percent of non-oil GDP, this increase will happen
“without commensurate increase in staffing or capacity”.
While the authorities remain committed to carrying out public investment “in line with absorptive and
implementation capacity and using quality control measures”, they also insist that at present, the size of
the supplemental budget remains a broad estimate based on a preliminary assessment made
immediately after the March tragedy as they sought to react rapidly to the event. While waiting for the
results of the report by the high level committee studying reconstruction needs, they believe that it is
unlikely that the full supplemental budget will be executed due in part to absorptive capacity issues.
Structural Reforms and the Investment Climate
The authorities are determined to improve the business climate as they are aware that progress in this
area is key to a successful diversification of the economy and the promotion of a sustainable private
sector led growth. They would like to highlight that improving the business climate is at the core of the
2011-2016 National Development Plan. An action plan to that effect is currently being implemented. As
required under the plan, a Council for Public-Private Dialogue was created to formalize exchanges of
views between the government and the private sector and to facilitate a better understanding of mutual
concerns. Also on this matter, the authorities are confident that the creation of Special Economic Zones,
modeled on the successful experiences of Mauritius and Singapore will contribute to further improving
the business climate and economic diversification.

57

Finally, on compliance with the reserve pooling requirement, the authorities indicate that the issue is
being addressed at the regional level, and that a high level working group has been set up to offer
proposals and modalities to strengthen compliance by all members of the CEMAC.
