IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Denmark

On June 22, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Denmark.1
Economic performance has been relatively weak for an extended period, notably on account of
low productivity growth that has lagged peers. Recently, a trend decline in oil and gas production
has also started to weigh on output. Moreover, Denmark was hard hit by the 2008/09 global
crisis, which coincided with the puncture of a local housing bubble. The initial recovery was
interrupted by renewed weakness in 2012–13, broadly following developments in the
neighboring euro area to which the Danish economy is closely tied. A moderate recovery
resumed from 2014.
The outlook is for a gradual further recovery. Supported by low interest rates and oil prices,
private consumption will continue to be the main driver for growth in the short term. However,
investment is also projected to pick up, reflecting the diminishing impact of firm deleveraging
and the strong recovery in the housing market. Export growth is likely to remain low, in line with
the weak external environment. On these trends, the economy is forecast to grow by 1.3 percent
in 2016 and 1.6 percent in 2017. Inflation is expected to remain subdued in 2016, reflecting
lower oil prices, but then rise steadily, reaching 2 percent in the outer years reflecting a
tightening labor market and a closing output gap.
Risks are tilted to the downside. A sharper than expected slowdown in Europe or in emerging
markets could derail the recovery given Denmark’s deep integration in the world economy. Also,
in view of exceptionally high household debt and a high share of adjustable rate mortgages,
volatility in global financial conditions leading to a spike in market interest rates could abruptly

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

raise households’ debt service and depress consumption. The disruption of trade and financial
flows that would likely accompany a “Brexit” compounds these risks. Domestically, an
unchecked continuation of rapid house price increases would heighten the risk of a correction
over the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment2
Noting the extended period of relatively weak growth and the considerable downside risks to the
outlook, Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to build on a strong track record of
sound policies to help sustain the economic recovery, reduce financial sector vulnerabilities, and
raise growth prospects.
Considering Denmark’s moderate public debt level and the absence of an independent monetary
policy, Directors broadly supported plans for a gradual fiscal consolidation while allowing
flexibility for fiscal policy to act as the main stabilizer of cyclical fluctuations. They emphasized
that if downside risks materialize automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate and
short-term fiscal support would be warranted. Conversely, they considered that a faster fiscal
tightening may be needed if the recovery gathered pace faster than expected. Directors agreed
that monetary policy should continue to focus on maintaining the exchange rate peg.
Directors noted that rapid price increases in segments of the housing market together with high
household indebtedness could pose macroeconomic and financial stability risks. They therefore
welcomed the recent measures that are expected to restrain mortgage lending, and the
strengthened risk management guidance for lenders. However, Directors believed more should
be done to mitigate medium-term risks, and encouraged the authorities to strengthen the
macroprudential toolbox and to consider introducing debt-to-income limits as well as reducing
the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments. They also encouraged efforts to alleviate
supply constraints and ease tight rental market regulations. Directors called on the authorities to
end the procyclical valuation freezes for land and property taxes.
Directors commended the authorities for the good follow up on the 2014 FSAP advice, and
encouraged implementation of the remaining recommendations. In particular, they suggested
measures to strengthen the operational independence of the financial supervisor (DFSA). Given
the interconnectedness of the Nordic banking system, Directors welcomed the ongoing efforts to
enhance regional cooperation on financial stability issues and underscored the importance of
reaching strong agreements on information sharing, cross-border supervision, depositor
protection, and resolution arrangements.

Directors welcomed the government’s growth package, including plans to devise a new strategy
for selected network sectors and to liberalize the Planning Act. They also encouraged reforms to
strengthen competition and increase firm productivity, including by reducing product market
regulation particularly in retail trade and some network sectors.
Directors welcomed the new tripartite agreement on integration of migrants, but stressed that
implementation will need to be closely monitored. They urged the authorities to consider lifting
restrictions on accepting regular work while asylum requests are being processed and starting
integration programs earlier for asylum seekers whose requests have a high probability of
success.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 31, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy continues to grow slowly and with a significant output gap. The
outlook is for a continued recovery but risks are tilted to the downside. Negative interest
rates are boosting house prices which, if sustained, could increase the vulnerability of
already highly indebted households. Given moderate public debt, there is fiscal space to
support the recovery if needed. Banks remain sound and profitable.
Policy recommendations: Economic policies should sustain the recovery, contain risks,
and raise potential growth. In particular:


Fiscal policy. The planned fiscal tightening is appropriate, but the uncertain outlook
calls for nimble policies. If downside risks materialize, automatic stabilizers should
operate and additional fiscal support will be called for.



Housing policies. Rapid house price increases call for early policy action—including
loosening housing supply restrictions, eliminating adverse tax incentives, and
developing and timely implementing well-targeted macroprudential tools.



Financial sector policy. Nordea’s plan to convert its subsidiaries into branches calls
for strong agreements among the Nordic authorities on information sharing, crossborder supervision, depositor protection, and resolution arrangements.



Refugees. Lifting restrictions on accepting regular work while asylum requests are
being processed and starting integration programs earlier for asylum applicants with
a high probability of success would promote better and faster integration.



Productivity. Closing the regulation gap with the European frontier in retail trade
and some network sectors would strengthen competition and raise firm productivity.

CONTEXT
1.
Denmark has a longstanding track-record of sound economic and social policies. It
consistently scores high in international comparisons of the business climate and competitiveness,
and education levels are high. In addition, the flexible labor market model and extensive active labor
market policies have fostered comparatively high employment in recent decades. Meanwhile,
income inequality is the lowest in the OECD (Box 1).
2.
But economic performance has been relatively weak for an extended period. Denmark
has underperformed in recent decades, notably on

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economy continues to grow slowly. After
recording 1.3 percent growth in 2014, the economy grew
by 1.2 percent in 2015, driven mostly by private
consumption on the back of rising employment and real
incomes (Figure 1, Table 1). However, relatively strong
performance in the first half of the year was partly
undone by flagging exports in the second half of the year.
Staff estimates that an output gap of about -1 percent of
GDP remains, but uncertainty surrounding this
assessment is large. Meanwhile, headline inflation has
stayed low at 0.5 percent on average in 2015. This reflects
partly the impact of falling food and energy prices, with
core inflation at 1.2 percent. Unemployment continued its
gradual decline, reaching 6.2 percent at end 2015.
4.
Fueled partly by negative interest rates, house
prices have been on the rise. Following speculative
pressures on the exchange rate in early 2015, Danmarks
Nationalbank (DN) lowered its deposit policy rate—which
first broke through the zero bound in 2012—deeper into
negative territory (Box 2). In the resulting environment of

historically low mortgage rates, real house prices rose over 6 percent in 2015 (Figure 2). Prices rose
particularly rapidly in segments of the market (e.g., flats, which were up 11 percent) and in the big
cities (with prices in Copenhagen up 14 percent) where economic activity has been strongest and
housing supply most constrained. Continuation of the recent trend would bring prices for flats and
in Copenhagen back to the peak of the previous boom in about one year’s time. Meanwhile, a
27 percent rise in the stock market in 2015—over six times the gain of the EURO Stoxx index—
suggests other assets may have experienced tailwinds from low interest rates as well.
5.
The current account surplus has reached a historically high level (Figure 3, Tables 2
and 3). Denmark has consistently run current account

surpluses in recent decades, mostly reflecting structurally

assesses that the exchange rate remains broadly
consistent with fundamentals (Box 3).
6.
The underlying fiscal position improved
moderately in 2015 (Tables 4 and 5). The headline
fiscal balance has seen large swings in recent years and
fell to a 2.1 percent of GDP deficit in 2015 as a large
share of the impact of massive one-off revenues
related to changes in pensions taxation—which had
brought the fiscal balance temporarily into surplus in
2014—wore off. Abstracting from the impact of these
one-offs, however, the structural balance improved, on
staff’s estimates, by about ¼ percent to -1.1 percent of
potential GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio, at around
45 percent of GDP, remains well below the Stability and
Growth Pact benchmark.

OUTLOOKS AND RISKS
8.
The baseline outlook is for a gradual further recovery. Supported by low interest rates
and oil prices, private consumption continues to be the main driver for growth in the short term.
However, investment is also projected to pick up, reflecting the diminishing impact of firm
deleveraging and the strong recovery in the housing market. Export growth is likely to remain low, in
line with the weak external environment. On these trends, the economy is forecast to grow by
1.3 percent in 2016 and 1.6 percent in 2017, and the output gap is expected to close in 2019.
Inflation will remain subdued in 2016, reflecting lower oil prices, but is forecast to rise steadily,
reaching 2 percent in the outer years reflecting a tightening labor market and closing output gap.
9.
But risks are tilted to the downside (Annex 1). A sharper than expected slowdown in
Europe or in emerging markets could derail the modest recovery, given Denmark’s deep integration
in the world economy. Also, in view of exceptionally high household gross debt (260 percent of
disposable income) and a high share of adjustable rate mortgages, volatility in global financial
conditions leading to a spike in market interest rates could abruptly raise households’ debt service
and depress consumption. The disruption of trade and financial flows that are likely to accompany a
“Brexit” would compound these risks. There is also potential for spillovers from Nordic neighbors
(e.g., if Sweden’s housing market were to cool), given the interconnectedness of the regional
banking system. Domestically, an unchecked continuation of rapid house price increases would
heighten the risk of a correction in the medium term, with knock-on effects on consumption.
Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s outlook and risk assessment. On
Brexit—in addition to a likely large negative impact on trade—the authorities noted the possibility
of sizable capital inflows as Denmark could find itself on the receiving end of safe haven flows, as
during the euro crisis. Regarding domestic risks, the authorities agreed that rising housing prices
and the high level of household debt bear close watching. However, they believed that for the
moment house price developments largely reflected underlying fundamentals, including rising
disposable incomes, ongoing urbanization, and low interest rates. They also stressed that, in contrast
to past booms, overall household debt levels have recently not been rising. The authorities noted a
smaller-than-estimated output gap (i.e., lower potential output) as a key risk factor).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Policies should sustain the recovery, contain risks, and raise potential growth. Fiscal
consolidation should be tuned to minimize short-term risks to the recovery, while product market
liberalization and better integration of refugees would help raise potential output over the mediumterm. Enhancing the flexibility of housing supply and reducing adverse tax incentives, paired with
appropriate and timely macroprudential measures, would reduce medium-term housing risks.

A. Macroeconomic Policy
12.
Monetary policy is anchored on a peg to the euro. DN conducts foreign exchange
interventions and sets policy interest rates with the objective of maintaining the peg. These policies
have taken the DN’s certificates of deposit (CD)
policy rate into negative territory for most of
the period since 2012. Following strong
appreciation pressures in early 2015, however,
the policy rate was lowered further to an
unprecedented -0.75 percent, creating a sizable
spread with the ECB policy rate. In recent
months, reflecting the substantial easing of
pressures, DN has allowed the spread with the
ECB to gradually narrow again: in January, it
raised the CD rate to -0.65 percent and it left
this rate unchanged when the ECB further
reduced policy rates in January and March.
13.
Staff suggested that a normalization of rates should continue as exchange rate
pressures allowed. Should a further lowering of ECB policy rates, or a change in market conditions,
necessitate a renewed reduction in Danish policy rates, the DN could seek to mitigate the impact on
banks by raising the limits for the current account (i.e., tiering) as it did in early 2015.
14.
The authorities have planned for a gradual fiscal consolidation. The fiscal stance in
Denmark is difficult to assess owing to large one-off measures that have caused wide swings in the
headline balance in recent years and continue to impact the balance in 2016. Also, the authorities’
estimates of the structural balance differ substantially from staff’s, including on account of different
assessments of output and employment gaps. On the authorities’ estimates, the structural deficit
was 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015 (compared to the staff estimate of 1.1 percent and an EC estimate of
1.8 percent). The government’s medium-term fiscal plan is to eliminate the structural deficit by 2020.
The envisaged consolidation largely reflects the lagged impact of past labor market reforms (¶27),
which are expected to yield a gradual reduction in benefits and increases in labor participation. No
additional discretionary measures are envisaged except for possible cuts in public consumption as
needed to offset higher-than-budgeted costs related to refugee inflows. For 2016, the authorities
project a ¼ percent tightening, which, on their count, will bring the structural deficit to 0.4 percent
of GDP—thereby complying with the budget law, which mandates that it may not exceed ½ percent
of GDP in the budget proposal for any given year. Meanwhile, reflecting the volatile path of one-off
revenues, the headline deficit is forecast to peak at 2.3 percent in 2016—well below the SGP deficit
limit—and to decline thereafter.
15.
The planned fiscal tightening is appropriate, but uncertainties surrounding the
outlook call for nimble policies. Considering that Denmark’s moderate level of public debt leaves
room for maneuver (Annex 2), and in the absence of an independent monetary policy, staff noted

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

that fiscal policy should continue to act as the main stabilizer of cyclical fluctuations. Thus, if
downside risks materialize automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate. In addition, shortterm fiscal support would be called for—for instance via higher productive public investment or by
not offsetting further refugee-related spending with cuts elsewhere in the budget. Conversely, a
faster fiscal tightening may be needed if the recovery were to gather pace faster than expected.
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities believe macroeconomic policies are adequate for the circumstances.
On monetary policy, the DN emphasized that maintaining the peg was the single policy objective.
The DN also underscored that it had demonstrated it had both the necessary tools and the resolve
to safeguard the peg. Looking forward, the DN noted that in their assessment the lower bound for
interest rates had not yet been reached and that policy rates could be lowered further if needed. The
overall impact of negative rates on the broader economy had been manageable thus far. On fiscal
policy, the authorities emphasized the presence of large automatic stabilizers, but also
acknowledged the need for flexible policies if risks to the economic outlook materialized.

B. Financial Sector
17.
The financial sector is large and interconnected. Total system assets are over
650 percent of GDP, with the banking sector accounting for two-thirds of this amount. The large size
reflects a high degree of domestic interconnectedness. Household assets and liabilities are among
the highest in the world, with pension assets amounting to about 140 percent of GDP. Institutional
investors, in turn, hold large amounts of covered bonds (150 percent of GDP) which are a key
funding source for the banks. Bank lending to households is at 130 percent of GDP. The banking
system also has important linkages with Nordic neighbors, with Danske Bank being a large regional
player and with Sweden-based Nordea the third-largest bank in the domestic market.

Housing Sector Policies
18.
The return of tight conditions in segments of the housing market calls for vigilance.
With structural impediments holding back housing supply and procyclical housing taxes and
favorable credit conditions pushing up demand, house prices have been rising rapidly. In large cities
early signs of overvaluation are starting to reappear.1 While household debt has not seen
commensurate growth, it remains at a high level and household-level data suggests that first-time
home buyers take out very sizable loans relative to their income. A potential future bout of renewed
house price adjustments could, through its negative effects on household balance sheets, have a
substantial impact on the real economy with knock-on effects on banks.
19.
The authorities have taken welcome measures to restrain mortgage lending. In
particular, in 2015, the financial supervisor (DFSA) introduced a “Supervisory Diamond” for

1

mortgage-credit institutions. This includes guidance to limit lending growth, large exposures,
reliance on short-term funding, and borrowers’ interest rate risk, and to promote loan amortization
even though the new measures will come into effect only during 2018–20. A minimum down
payment requirement of five percent for new mortgages was also introduced. In addition, the recent
establishment of “Seven Best Practices” for lenders in areas with rapid house price increases should
strengthen banks’ risk management practices.

20.
But a new tax measure risks amplifying the house price cycle. A new freeze on land tax
valuations for tax purposes was introduced in 2016—analogous to the freeze on real estate
valuations that has been in effect since 2002. The measure will further increase the procyclical
impact of taxes on house prices as the freezes imply that the rate of taxation falls when property and
land prices rise.
21.
More is needed to mitigate medium-term risks. Noting that early action would help the
authorities stay ahead of the curve, staff urged coherent action across several policy areas.


2

Supply policies. More could be done to alleviate regional supply constraints which have a
significant impact on price levels in some markets.2 For instance zoning regulations and spatial
planning could be made more responsive to housing demand conditions—especially in urban
areas. Easing the strict regulations in the rental markets could also help alleviate housing
pressures by facilitating a more efficient use of the existing housing stock.

Selected Issues Chapter “House Prices in Denmark’s Cities: the Role of Supply.”



Tax policies. The procyclical valuation freezes for land and property taxes should be ended.



Macroprudential policies. As noted in the 2014 FSAP recommendations, there is scope for
additional macroprudential instruments.3 The early preparation of an adequate macroprudential
“toolbox” is key to ensure that measures can be implemented without delay when needed.
Specifically, staff suggested considering limits on the overall debt-to-income ratio, which would
help keep household debt and debt service capacity in check, especially in a context where
house prices rise faster than incomes. In addition, it recommended raising the new minimum
down payment requirement to at least 10 percent to increase households’ buffer in case of
adverse house price shocks. These measures would complement the existing MCI supervisory
diamond as they help protect households and the economy more broadly, and address risks
from loans by commercial banks. If regional markets continue to diverge, consideration could be
given to applying policies with different stringency across regions. Such policies could target
high-risk areas—e.g., Copenhagen—without hampering the nascent recovery in other regions.

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities are monitoring the housing market and household debt closely. On the
supply side, they concurred that zoning regulations and planning constrained housing supply.
However, they noted that these regulations served multiple objectives, including safeguarding the
quality of housing and living conditions. The political appetite to loosen restrictions was believed to
be low. The authorities acknowledged the procyclical impact of housing tax freezes, but they
pointed to flaws and inequities in the current property assessment system, which had necessitated
its effective suspension. The government is working on a new valuation system, with new valuations
expected to be available in 2019. While additional macroprudential measures were not planned at
this juncture, the Danish Systemic Risk Council had urged caution in relation to low interest rates
and house price developments, and the DFSA stressed its readiness and the ability of the Danish
political system to act swiftly when needed. The DFSA believed that regional differentiation of future
measures—similar to its “seven best practices”—could help their acceptability and would avoid
criticism that overly strict regulations stifled growth.

Other Financial Sector Issues
23.
Good progress has been made on the recommendations of the 2014 FSAP (Annex 3).
With the implementation of EU regulations, the DFSA has implemented several changes to
regulatory and supervisory practices, including those related to CRD IV/CRR and Solvency II. Also,
with the transposition into Danish law of the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the
resolution regime is being strengthened. The DFSA has further indicated it will increase the
frequency of on-site inspections for smaller banks and insurance companies. The supervisory
diamond for MCIs and the seven best practices also address several FSAP recommendations.

Selected Issues Chapter “Macroprudential Policy in Denmark.”

DENMARK

24.
Staff welcomed the progress and urged follow up on remaining FSAP advice. This
includes in particular—in addition to the recommendations for macroprudential policy discussed
above—further efforts to strengthen the operational independence of the DFSA, including by
lengthening the terms of board members and introducing strict fit and proper appointment criteria.
An internal audit function should also be established within the DFSA to ensure integrity and
consistency of supervisory work. The DFSA should continue to have adequate resources to execute
its expanded set of tasks, including regarding the supervision of the pension and insurance sectors.
25.
Regional coordination on financial stability issues should deepen. Given the high
interconnectedness of the Nordic banking sector, deeper cooperation with other Nordic supervisors
remains critical. The issue is particularly pertinent in the context of advanced plans by Nordea to
convert its Nordic subsidiaries into branches—including its commercial banking operations in
Denmark (Nordea’s mortgage credit arm will remain a subsidiary to facilitate the local issuance of
covered bonds). In response to Nordea’s plans, the regional supervisors and governments have
started work on updated agreements to guide the treatment of systemically important branches.
Staff welcomed this work and underscored that agreement will be needed on information sharing,
cross-border supervision, depositor protection, and resolution arrangements.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities agreed that strong regional coordination is key. They thought it would
be particularly important that a level playing field was secured for all banks operating in the
respective national markets and that the oversight of systemically important branches would be
closely coordinated with host supervisors. On the operational independence of the DFSA, the
authorities underscored that the DFSA Board was strong and independent and that there was no
history of political interference. They also believed it was too soon after the establishment of the
board to discuss changes to its setup. Work on an internal audit or control function in the DFSA is
underway, though the precise modalities are yet to be decided.

C. Structural Reforms
27.
Labor market institutions are strong and key reforms were adopted in recent years.
In 2010, the maximum duration of unemployment benefits was shortened from four to two years
and eligibility requirements were tightened. A large pension reform in 2011 increased the statutory
retirement rate from 65 to 67 (effective 2019–22) and indexed the retirement age to life expectancy
(effective 2025). And in 2015 more flexible rules were introduced to re-qualify for unemployment
benefits, to strengthen incentives to accept work. Under a 2016 reform package, the total amount of
benefits that a household can receive has been capped, and the government plans to use related
savings to lower taxes for low-income households later this year—a plan that staff fully supports.

The refugee crisis has highlighted the challenges of integration and prompted policy
action. Denmark saw a significant uptick in asylum requests in 2015—though more modest than in

“apprentice terms” at a reduced wage for a limited two-year period, qualify for subsidized
employment, and receive 20 weeks of vocational and language training. The package also provides
incentives for companies to provide employment under the new schemes.
29.
The new integration agreement marks important progress, but more measures
should be considered. Staff strongly welcomed the new reforms and noted that implementation
needs to be closely monitored to ensure effectiveness. It also encouraged the authorities to consider
additional measures, including lifting restrictions on accepting regular work while asylum requests
are being processed and starting the new integration program earlier for asylum seekers whose
requests have a high probability of success. Such measures would help limit the loss of skills and
employability associated with prolonged spells of inactivity.
30.
Labor productivity growth has been lagging peers for an extended period. Growth in
total factor productivity (TFP) has been particularly weak. Slow productivity growth has presented a
bit of a puzzle as the business environment in Denmark appears more favorable than in many other

31.
Easing regulation in network and retail sectors could raise productivity. Staff
presented new firm-level evidence that suggests that closing the product market regulation gap
between Denmark and the European frontier in some network sectors such as passenger rail and
postal services could strengthen competition and significantly increase firm TFP, including through
its downstream effects on the broader economy.4 There would be similar substantial productivity
gains from relaxing regulation of retail services—including by lifting strict store size restrictions,
especially for very large stores (so called hypermarkets).
Authorities’ views
32.
Integrating refugees and raising productivity are high on the authorities’ agenda, but
subject to constraints. The authorities agreed that allowing asylum seekers to take up work earlier
would limit skills losses and could improve their success on the labor market. However, they noted
that uncertainty about the composition and level of skills of asylum seekers made the 50 percent
employment goal a challenge. Authorities generally agreed that enhanced competition in some
network sectors and retail trade would generate productivity gains. The government was preparing
proposals for revisions to the Planning Act, which would, among other things, relax store-size and
location restrictions albeit not for hypermarkets, which were seen as a potential threat to
commercial activity in the inner cities. The government is also developing a new strategy to improve
efficiency in selected network sectors.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Chronically slow growth challenges longstanding achievements. A strong track record
of sound policies notwithstanding, economic performance has been weak for an extended period
with productivity growth lagging that of peers. A moderate recovery is continuing and a gradual
further strengthening of the economy is expected. However, this baseline outlook is subject to
considerable downside risks, including from house prices which are fueled by negative interest rates.
Strong policies are needed to help sustain the recovery, contain risks, and raise potential growth.
34.
The envisaged fiscal tightening is appropriate, but the uncertain outlook calls for
flexibility. Considering Denmark’s still moderate level of public debt and the absence of an
independent monetary policy, fiscal policy should continue to act as the main stabilizer of cyclical
fluctuations. Thus, if downside risks materialize automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate
and short-term fiscal support would be called for. Conversely, a faster fiscal tightening may be
needed if the recovery were to gather pace faster than expected.
35.
Monetary policy should continue to focus on maintaining the peg. A normalization of
rates should continue if market conditions and exchange rate pressures allow.

36.
Rapid price increases in segments of the housing market call for vigilance and action.
The introduction of the Supervisory Diamond for mortgage banks and the five percent cash down
payment requirement for house purchases, as well as the new risk management guidance for
mortgage lenders are welcome steps. However, more should be done to stay ahead of the curve.
Development of an adequate macroprudential toolbox is key and the authorities should for instance
consider debt-to-income limits to keep household debt and debt service capacity in check. More
fundamentally, improving zoning regulations would help alleviate supply constraints, while easing
tight rental market regulations would facilitate more efficient use of the existing housing stock. The
procyclical valuation freezes for land and property taxes should be ended.
37.
Follow up on the 2014 FSAP advice has been good, though further work remains. The
operational independence of the DFSA should be bolstered by lengthening board members’ terms
and introducing strict fit and proper appointment criteria. Given the close links in the Nordic
banking system and the issues raised by Nordea branchification, the efforts to strengthen regional
cooperation on financial stability issues are welcome. Reaching strong agreements on information
sharing, cross-border supervision, depositor protection, and resolution arrangements will be critical.
38.
The refugee crisis highlights the challenge of better integrating migrants. The new
tripartite agreement on integration is welcome, though implementation will need to be closely
monitored. To avoid the loss of skills and employability associated with long periods of inactivity,
the authorities should also consider lifting restrictions on accepting regular work while asylum
requests are being processed and starting the new integration program earlier for asylum seekers
whose requests have a high probability of success.
39.
Reducing product market regulation could raise productivity and potential growth.
Closing the regulation gap with the European frontier in retail trade and some network sectors
would strengthen competition and increase firm productivity, including through downstream effects
on the broader economy. The government’s plans to devise a new strategy for selected network
sectors and liberalize the Planning Act are thus welcome and a bold approach is recommended.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Denmark be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Income Inequality in Denmark
Income inequality in Denmark is the lowest in the OECD. The commonly used Gini coefficient measure,
at around 0.25, indicates a very high level of equality in the country, which has been fairly consistent over
the years. The Hoover Index, an alternative measure, also indicates a high level of income equality. This
measure, also known as the Robin Hood Index, calculates the portion of the total income of the community
that would have to be redistributed (i.e. taken from the richer half of the population and given to the poorer
half) in order to achieve income uniformity.

Wage Dispersion

Substantial income redistribution is also key.
Specifically, the tax system (with total tax revenues at
50 percent of GDP in 2014, also the highest in OECD)
and expansive social safety net (including free
education and health care as well as subsidized child
care) have been effective in redistributing income. To
illustrate, the Gini coefficient measured at the
disposable income level after taxes and benefits
(referenced above) is much lower than the marketlevel income coefficient measured before taxes and
transfers. This gap suggests a relatively strong
redistribution, which is considerable also compared to
other OECD peers.

Low inequality is partly driven by wage
compression. Denmark has relatively low dispersion
of wages across sectors and industries, an outcome
that is influenced by the collective bargaining system.
Furthermore, the wage bargaining system, in the
absence of a statutory minimum wage, implies a high
effective minimum wage which further contributes to
high compression.

Box 1. Income Inequality in Denmark (continued)
A high degree of gender equality may also contribute. A recent IMF study finds that gender inequality is
associated strongly with income inequality (Gonzales

equality to better economic performance (e.g., Ostry
and others, 2014). And Pickett and Wilkinson (2009) argue that more equal societies tend to do better in
terms of social wealth and health. They are also likely to have higher education levels, which is a key
beneficial factor for long-term growth performance. On the downside, low wage dispersion can hamper
employment, especially at the lower-skills end of the labor market. Wage compression across regions and
industries can also disincentivize labor mobility and efficient resource reallocation.
In Denmark income equality is considered an intrinsic value. The Danish authorities generally do not see
equality as primarily conducive to economic growth (they hypothesized that the empirical relationship found
in recent studies breaks down at high levels of equality). Rather they note the challenge of boosting growth
while preserving the achieved high level of equality. With equality being highly valued by society, in
Denmark new policy proposals are routinely tested for their expected impact on inequality, with estimated
sizable negative impacts often substantially reducing the political feasibility of proposed measures. There is
a sense that this entails efficiency losses, but it is seen as price often worth paying for an equal society. The
authorities also believe that the extensive social safety net allows for Denmark’s relatively flexible hiring and
firing rules (the so called flexicurity model) and thereby contributes to a strong labor market performance.

appreciation—curiously, mostly Danish pension funds—

Box 3. External Sector Assessment
Denmark’s current account remains in surplus. Over the past decade, the surplus has averaged 5 percent
of GDP. Reflecting this, the net international investment position (NIIP) has continued to improve, reaching
47 percent of GDP in 2014 (Table 3). The financial account reflects mostly large net foreign investments from
the banking sector (about 9 percent of GDP in 2015). Portfolio investment has been volatile, but on net
averages around zero in recent years. As appreciation pressures have eased, international reserves have
returned broadly to the 2014 level.
Staff assesses that the external position and the krone are broadly consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policies. The Danish krone is pegged to the euro. In 2015, it depreciated by about 3.5 percent in
real effective terms to a level that is broadly in line with the average over the past 25 years. The staff’s
assessment is informed by EBA estimates and Denmark-specific factors.
External Balance Assessment (EBA) estimates are mixed. The current account (CA) model suggest the
krone is substantially undervalued implied by the large current account gap, while the REER index and level
models indicate the krone is close to the norm and only moderately undervalued. Taking the EBA analyses
together, the average REER gap is assessed to be less than 10 percent in 2015.
Some factors contributing to Denmark’s strong external position are not fully captured in EBA.
Denmark’s persistent current account surpluses have been mostly driven by large savings for retirement.
Merchanting trade (trade in goods that do not physically cross the border of the merchant’s resident
country) is also important and has been shown to cause persistently larger current account balances. Finally,
the specialization of Danish firms in sectors such as design and pharmaceuticals, which have benefited from
high price increases, contributes to export performance. Staff assesses that these structural factors would
significantly raise the current account norm in the EBA CA approach, implying a smaller CA gap.

Negative rates were introduced in Denmark in 2012 to discourage capital inflows and hold the peg. In
July 2012, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) entered uncharted waters as it steered one of its policy rates
into negative territory, after facing sizeable capital inflows related to strains in the euro area. It thus became
the first among European central banks to break through the “zero lower bound.” The DN’s certificates of
deposit (CD) rate was initially set at -0.2 percent and raised to -0.1 percent in early 2013. After briefly exiting
negative rates in April 2014, the DN broke through the zero bound again in September (-0.05 percent) when
the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a negative rate on its deposit facility. In early 2015, the DN
implemented a series of deeper cuts, bringing the CD rate to a low of -0.75 percent (see Box 2).
Almost four years into negative rates, credit institutions in Denmark remain resilient. The earnings of
banks have increased since negative rates were first introduced, despite persistently subdued demand for
new loans. The strong profitability owes to rising fee income and historically low impairment charges which
partly reflect improved debt-servicing capacity in the low interest rate environment. Meanwhile, there has
been no evidence of cash hoarding among corporates or households.

Given their different funding structures, the impact on banks and mortgage credit institutions (MCIs)
can be expected to differ somewhat. MCIs—which provide 65 percent of all lending to households in
Denmark—have a different business model compared to banks. While banks raise funding through deposits
and wholesale instruments, and invest in loans and securities, MCIs operate under the balance principle—
funding their mortgage loans with issuance of covered bonds—and do not accept deposits.

Despite downward stickiness of deposit rates, bank margins
have remained remarkably steady. Whereas interest rates on
new deposits used to decline in line with the policy rate before
the negative rate era, they have remained around zero since, with
only large corporates and institutional clients facing negative
rates. Pass-through to lending rates has been similarly
incomplete. As a result, overall bank lending-deposit margins
have remained broadly stable at 1.5 percent since 2012—about
the historical average. The impact on the overall bank net interest
margin was further reduced by lower costs of market funding
(representing about 30 percent of bank liabilities).

Box 4. Four Years Into Negative Interest Rates (continued)
The impact on MCIs has been even more limited and
demand for covered bonds remains strong. Because of
their business model that relies on covered bond issuance
to finance mortgage loans, MCIs realize a set fee over
yields in the covered bond market. Additional income from
raised fees and stronger refinancing activity has also
contributed to solid margins.

Annex I. Risk Assessment Matrix1
Potential Deviations from Baseline
Source of Risks and
Relative Likelihood
(High, medium, or low)
Medium
Tighter or more
volatile global
financial conditions:

Medium/ High
Structurally weak
growth in key
advanced and
emerging economies

Low
A drop in confidence
in covered bonds

Medium
Failure to effectively
address housing risks

Expected Impact if Risk is Realized
(High, medium, or low)
Medium
Higher interest rates would burden
households—as the majority of
mortgages have variable interest rates—
and dampen consumption, thereby
slowing or reversing the recovery.

Policy response

Allow automatic stabilizers to
operate and delay further fiscal
consolidation.
Reduce vulnerabilities of the
financial sector by expanding the
macroprudential toolkit.

Medium
Given Denmark’s geographically
dispersed exports, slower growth in
advanced economies or emerging
markets for an extended period would
weaken exports and lower domestic
demand, which in turn would have a
negative effect on growth.
High
This risk could lead to a reassessment of
household credit quality and depress
consumption through higher interest
rates and lower house prices.

Allow automatic stabilizers to
operate and delay further fiscal
consolidation.

High
A new boom/bust cycle in the housing
market would compromise the balance
sheets of highly-indebted Danish
households, with severe knock-on effects
on consumption and the economy.

Continue vigilant financial
supervisory oversight and use
macroprudential and tax policies
in a consistent manner to
discourage further build-up of
housing debt.

Move ahead with structural
reforms to improve
competitiveness.
Use regulatory policies to
encourage longer bond maturities
and increase buffers in loans with
interest-only periods, e.g., by
reducing the loan-to-value ceiling.

Address bottlenecks in rental
market and zoning policies.
High
British voters elect to
leave the EU

High
British voters elect to leave the EU in their
June 23rd referendum, with subsequent
renegotiation of cross-border trade,
financial, and migration relationships. A
period of elevated financial volatility and
heightened uncertainty could ensue, with
potential contagion. The economic
performance of affected countries could
also diminish in the long run due to
increased barriers. Support for
eurosceptic parties and resistance to
economic integration may also increase.

Ensure robust contingency
planning for operational risks that
may arise in the event of
heightened market volatility.
Re-double efforts to secure the
benefits of economic integration
and cooperation across Europe.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern
as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term”
and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within one year and three years, respectively.

Annex III. FSAP Update: Status of Main Recommendations
The authorities have made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2014 FSAP.
Specifically, the DFSA has introduced new guidance in the form of a “Supervisory Diamond for
mortgage credit institutions” (MCIs), which will become effective between 2018 and 2020 and
consists of 5 indicators with corresponding limits on the risks of the institutions. Also, home buyers
are now required to make a down payment of at least five percent when purchasing a home, while
commercial properties need to generate a positive cash flow to be eligible for bank financing. The
DFSA also issued a separate guideline of “seven best practices” for banks and MCIs to ensure caution
in housing lending in areas with large price increases (e.g., Copenhagen and Aarhus). The best
practices entered into effect in January 2016 and institutions are expected to follow them according
to a "comply or explain” mechanism.
Recommendations and Authority
Responsible for Implementation
Mortgage finance
Reduce refinancing risk by putting
into place regulatory policies to
encourage longer bond maturities.

Priority1/

Status

Short
term

One indicator from the new Supervisory Diamond for MCIs introduces a
limit on short term funding and will enter into force from 2020: The share
of lending that is refinanced should be less than 12.5 percent of total
lending per quarter and lower than 25 percent of total lending per year.
Earlier legislation in March 2014 also requires contingent maturity
extension for new mortgage bonds in stress situations. The extension
takes effect if a refinancing auction fails, or if the interest rate on
mortgage bonds with an original maturity of less than two years rises by
more than five percentage points within one year.

Limit impact of the eventual
normalization of interest rates by
ensuring that the credit
risk is adequately taken into account
in loan pricing and approvals.

Short
term

Increase buffers in loans with
interest-only (IO) periods by
lowering LTV caps for such loans,
requiring amortization to a lower
ceiling, and/or by imposing higher
capital charges or credit loss
provisions until IO periods expire.
Prudential supervision
Reduce the length of examination
cycles for banks and insurance
companies, which will require
additional supervisory resources.

Short
term

Short
term

One indicator from the Supervisory Diamond for MCIs, coming into force
from 2018, limits the share of loans where the LTV exceeds 75 percent of
the lending limit for MCIs and where interest rate is fixed for less than
two years to less than 25 percent of the total loan portfolio.
Further, two of the seven best practices for banks and MCIs address the
eventual normalization of interest rates. First, when granting adjustable
rate loans for housing, banks must assess clients’ payment ability under a
scenario of higher interest rates. Second, when granting loans for buying
shares in cooperative housing associations, banks should stress test the
relevant association’s debt under a scenario of higher interest rates.
One indicator from the Supervisory Diamond for MCIs, entering into
force from 2020, caps the share of IO lending (no amortization) in the
LTV band above 75 percent of the lending limit for MCIs at 10 percent of
total lending.

The DFSA has been granted additional resources from 2016 to increase
the number of on-site inspections of banks and insurance companies.
The examination cycles for the 18 smallest and least risky banks will be
shortened from a maximum interval of six years to a maximum of four
years, with the annual cycles for systemically important institutions
unchanged.
For insurance companies, the examination cycles will be reduced from a
maximum interval of six years to a maximum of four years, except for the
largest eight companies for which cycles will be reduced to a maximum
of two years.
The DFSA is also planning to introduce short focused on-site inspections
for banks to complement the existing full scale on-site inspections.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Annex III. FSAP Update: Status of Main Recommendations
(continued)
Ensure operational independence of
the DFSA by establishing a set of
supervisory imperatives wholly
within the authority of the Director
General and by lengthening the
terms of the Board members and
establishing a formal vetting
process.
Bank supervision
Broaden reporting of information on
operational and market risk.
Ensure systematic review of Pillar III
disclosures.
Insurance supervision
Enhance the supervision of conduct
of business, fraud, and AML/CFT.

Medium
term

No action has been taken.

Short
term
Medium
term

The DFSA has compiled new reporting templates for market risk and
operational risk, which will complement existing routine reporting.
Starting in 2016, the DFSA has introduced an obligation for supervisors
to review the banks’ Pillar III disclosures annually.

Short
term

A report, published by the public prosecutor in 2015 and compiled
together with the DFSA and the Danish Insurance Association assesses
the risk of money laundering, including in life insurance companies and
pension funds. The report will serve as a guideline for the life insurance
and pensions sector.

Establish a solvency level below
which companies may not operate.

Short
term

Require risk, compliance, internal
audit, and actuarial functions in all
insurers and better integrate
qualitative assessments of
governance and management with
off-site analysis.
Macroprudential policy
Develop new instruments capable of
addressing time-varying systemic
risk, such as limits on loan-to-value
(LTV) and debt service to income
(DSTI) ratios.

Medium
term

Expand the range of analytical tools
used to identify and monitor
systemic risk.

Medium
term

Short
term

In 2016 the DFSA will carry out an off-site inspection of all institutions in
the form of a self-assessment scheme. Based on the self assessments the
DFSA will decide on appropriate on-site and off-site follow-up.
The Financial Business Act has been amended, effective January 1, 2016,
such that the largest Danish insurance companies must meet new
solvency levels.
This recommendation was addressed with the implementation of the
Solvency II Directive.

DFSA has launched various initiatives including (i) a 5 percent down
payment requirement for housing purchase from November 2015; (ii)
new benchmarks for interest rate risk and the share of IO lending in the
LTV band above 75 percent of the lending limit for MCIs as part of the
Supervisory Diamond for MCIs; and (iii) stress tests to assess payment
capacity under the assumption of interest rate hikes, potential price
corrections, or decreasing sales activities in the housing market as part of
the credit granting process.
The DN has developed several new tools for identifying and monitoring
of systemic risks, which are published in its “Financial Stability Reports.”
The Systemic Risk Council has also developed composite indicators to
monitor the build-up of systemic risk from different angles in six
monitoring areas.

The transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)
into Danish Law and adoption of special legislation for mortgage banks
in June 2015 set early resolution triggers and an ex-ante financed
resolution fund. The Financial Stability Company (the resolution authority
together with the DFSA) has now new resolution tools and early
intervention powers to manage SIFIs without adverse impact on financial
stability or need for public funds.

Work on resolution plans and resolvability assessments is in progress and
expected to be finished by end-2016. Resolution plans will be updated
yearly.
The Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD) has been implemented
in Denmark since June 2015, including the requirement to set up a
Deposit Guarantee Fund. In accordance with minimum requirements, the
target level of the Danish Fund is 0.8 percent of covered deposits. There
is now only offsetting in specific circumstances in accordance with the
DGSD. The DGS can also only contribute to the resolution of an
institution in accordance with the No Creditor Worse Off principle. With
the implementation of the BRRD in June 2015, depositor preference has
been introduced in Denmark.
The DFSA and DN have an ongoing dialogue on stress testing, including
via DN participation in the DFSA's annual stress test meetings with banks.
DN and DFSA also collaborate on the scenarios for stress-testing
purposes.
The DFSA is developing a macro prudential stress testing framework for
the Danish insurance sector, which is expected to be finalized in 2016.
Analyses were conducted as part of DN’s Financial Stability Report (2nd
half 2014) and at the Systemic Risk Council (March 2016). A work
program for further analysis of the pension and insurance sector is being
developed in the DN. The focus will be on ways in which the large
insurance and pension sectors can amplify or give rise to systemic risks,
consequences of the low interest rate environment, and the increasing
share of alternative investments and direct lending, and the increase in
household indebtedness.

Exchange Arrangements: Denmark participates in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II
(ERMII) with a central rate at DKr 746.038 per 100 euro. The standard width of the fluctuation band
in ERM II is +/-15 percent. However, due to its high degree of convergence, Denmark has entered
into an agreement with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro area member states on a
narrower fluctuation band of +/- 2.25 percent. This means that the krone can only fluctuate between
DKr 762.824 per 100 euro and DKr 729.252 per 100 euro.
Denmark has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, apart from those imposed solely for the preservation of national or international
security, as notified to the Fund by the National Bank of Denmark in accordance with Executive
Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
December 5, 2014. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 14/331) was published with Press
Release No. 14/558 (December 9, 2014).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The country has a full range of statistical publications,
many of which are on the internet. The quality and timeliness of the economic database are
generally very good. The country subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.
Metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
National Accounts: Denmark adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in
September 2014. The transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) requires a revision of national accounts
data. New data sources are also incorporated in the new estimates which were published in midSeptember 2014. Historical data are revised going back to 1966.
Government Finance Statistics: Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics data
is based on the ESA 2010 methodology, which includes revisions of the general government deficit
and debt levels from 1995 onwards. Revised data series was published in October 2014.
External Statistics: Starting in 2014, external sector statistics are compiled according to the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) and in accordance
with legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics are
based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and reporting
monetary data.

Statement by Thomas Ostros, Executive Director for Denmark,
and Anne Marcussen, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 22, 2016
On behalf of the Danish authorities, we would like to thank staff for candid and
constructive policy discussions in Copenhagen during the Article IV mission. The
authorities appreciate staff’s high quality report and analytical work, addressing topical
issues for the Danish economy. They broadly concur with staff's assessment and will
carefully consider the recommendations.
The output gap continues to narrow and employment is strengthening
The Danish economy is now in its third year of recovery. Measured by GDP growth, the
pace is not high, but employment is growing quite strongly, along with nominal gross
value added in manufacturing, business services, and the construction sector. For the first
time in several years, growth last year was mainly driven by domestic demand. Looking
ahead, the conditions for continued growth in domestic demand are in place, in particular
owing to rising real wages, employment, and housing prices. Export growth is also
expected to accelerate in 2016 and 2017, supported by a gradually improving external
environment.
The relatively moderate pace of GDP growth partly reflects a drag from declining North
Sea oil and gas production. However, as in many other countries, productivity growth
seems very low for this stage of the cycle, whereas employment growth has been robust.
While unemployment is already low, there is still some room for a further increase in
employment in the coming years, due to a substantial increase in structural employment
owing to recent years' reform efforts. Nevertheless, the continuation of robust
employment growth will result in a gradual closing of the output gap and the employment
gap, and labor market conditions are expected to tighten over the next couple of years.
As noted by staff, the risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside. Denmark is a
small open economy and an unexpected slowing of the global economy would lower
growth in Denmark, not only directly through weaker exports, but also through the
impact on the spending of consumers and businesses. However, the risks related to global
financial conditions and a possible spike in the interest-rate burden facing Danish
households are perhaps less clear than suggested by staff. In our assessment, large
increases in interest rates are unlikely in the near term in view of the outlook for stillaccommodative monetary policy, in particular in the euro area, as well as the significant
current account surplus and increasing net international wealth of the Danish economy.
Furthermore, overall household debt levels have not been rising lately and balance sheets
are generally assessed to be robust, with households also holding substantial assets.
Gradual tightening of the fiscal policy will lead to structural balance in 2020
The narrowing of the output gap implies that accommodative fiscal policy should be
gradually rolled back. Since the monetary policy stance is expected to remain very

2
supportive throughout the forecast period, this in itself increases the need for tightening
fiscal policy to support a sustained recovery.
Fiscal policy is planned mainly on the basis of the structural budget balance, with a
planned adjustment from a structural deficit of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2015 to a deficit of
0.4 per cent of GDP in 2016 and 2017. With the planned fiscal policy for 2016, there is a
small margin to the deficit limit of 0.5 percent of GDP in the Budget Law. The mediumterm target is still to achieve at least structural balance by 2020, which is aligned with the
overall objective of fiscal sustainability.
Fiscal space will therefore be tight in the coming years, both in a historical context and
relative to population trends. In part, this is due to the marked decline in Denmark’s oil
and gas-related revenues. Furthermore, support, training programs, welfare services, etc.
for newly-arrived refugees increase spending pressures. Meanwhile, public investments
remain close to the historically high levels during the economic crisis. On both the public
consumption and investment side, the current expenditure levels remain higher than
before the financial crisis, despite some downward adjustment in recent years.
After the summer, the Danish Government will present a new medium-term economic
plan (“2025 plan”), which will provide the framework for fiscal policy towards 2025.
Continued structural reforms supporting growth potential are key
Significant structural reforms have been implemented since 2008, raising productive
potential by more than 5 percent by 2020. We are now seeing clear effects of reform
efforts. As an example, a reform from 2011, which increases the age of eligibility for
early retirement from 60 years to 62, is now clearly increasing the labor market
participation rate of each cohort.
With respect to productivity growth, several initiatives have been implemented and the
Government has put forward a growth package with over one hundred initiatives that
focuses on both productivity and on strengthening growth in all parts of Denmark. The
package includes initiatives to liberalise the Planning Act, and the Government has
recently reached political agreement in Parliament to ease restrictions, in particular to
increase the upper boundaries on shop sizes. Furthermore, there is ongoing work in
relation to increasing productivity in the utility sector where the staff report has identified
potential.
Increasing the growth potential of the Danish economy remains a clear priority for
economic policy. The Government’s forthcoming 2025 plan to deal with the challenges
facing the Danish economy will lay out further reform proposals to increase both labor
market participation and productivity.

Increasing house prices reflect fundamentals, but are closely monitored by the
authorities
The authorities assess that the recent developments in the housing market, including the
rapid price increases in the largest cities, should be seen in light of developments in
fundamentals, e.g. low mortgage rates, rising disposable incomes, and urbanization.
However, price developments in the Copenhagen area need to be monitored closely. The
freeze of housing taxes, in place since 2002, and the recent freeze of land taxes in 2016
are acknowledged by the authorities to increase the procyclicality of house price
fluctuations.
The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) has recently introduced a 5 percent
down payment requirement, as well as 7 best practices for mortgaging of homes in
geographical areas with high price levels and high price increases compared with the rest
of the country. At present, the 7 best practices apply to the two largest cities and are
expected to mitigate further price increases in these geographical areas.
The authorities would like to stress that the aim of recent measures is not to restrain
mortgage lending, as stated in the staff report, but to ensure robustness of borrowers and
credit institutions. The supervisory diamond addresses what the Danish FSA considers to
be mortgage-credit activities with a higher risk profile. The benchmarks in the diamond
have been set so they, on the one hand, counteract excessive risk assumption and, on the
other hand, make it possible for resilient institutions to carry out profitable activities
within the benchmarks and offer the credit required to undertakings and households.
The Danish authorities are not currently planning to introduce new macroprudential
measures. However, developments in the housing markets will be monitored closely,
especially in Copenhagen. The suggestion from the IMF regarding an early preparation of
an adequate macroprudential "toolbox", in order to ensure that measures can be
implemented without delay when needed, is relevant to consider. Macroprudential
measures such as limits on loan-to-value and debt-to-income may contribute to
dampening a build-up of systemic financial risks.
