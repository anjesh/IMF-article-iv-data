EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. The Dominican economy improved markedly under the PRGF-supported program that
ended in 2006. Dominica was struck by Hurricane Dean in August 2007 resulting in damage of nearly
20 percent of GDP, reduced economic activity, higher inflation, and a weaker external current account.
The Executive Board approved a request for ENDA on February 4, 2008 for 25 percent of quota.
External competitiveness. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals The recent rise in the external current account deficit mainly reflects the effects of the
hurricane and higher commodity prices, and is almost fully financed by nondebt-creating flows.
Key policy issues. The key policy challenges facing the authorities are to restore growth in a less
favorable global environment, possibly including lower tourist arrivals; consolidate fiscal stability given
the high public debt and reduce vulnerabilities. While macroeconomic policy has been well oriented, it is
important to maintain the reform momentum.
•

Fiscal policy is appropriately focused on reducing high public debt. The authorities may need to
consider delaying implementation of planned income tax reform while maintaining the integrity of
the VAT, to return to the primary surplus target following a temporary easing of the fiscal stance in
FY 2008/09 to accommodate the current commodity price shocks.

•

Further diversification of the economy, including the development of the tourist industry,
would be key to enhancing growth prospects. Plans for developing the tourist sector, including
improving air access and roads to tourist attractions, are well advanced and should be financed with a
view maintaining the sustainability of public debt.

•

Structural reforms are key to improving competitiveness and reducing vulnerabilities. The
authorities rightly emphasize improving the business climate, strengthening regulation and
supervision of the financial sector, and improving disaster preparedness.

Fund Relations. Dominica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 and
maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 2, 2007. The staff
report and summing up of the Executive Directors’ discussions and policy recommendations are available
at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=21345.0.

I. INTRODUCTION 1
1.
Dominica is extremely vulnerable to exogenous shocks, and recent economic
policy has been aimed at creating buffers against such events. The economy is
susceptible to a variety of natural disasters, and is ranked 12th on the list of 111 countries
on the Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank’s composite vulnerability index. The
economy is also sensitive to external economic developments such as the global
slowdown after September 11, 2001. The crisis in 2002 was also precipitated, however,
by lax fiscal policy, as inefficiencies in the tax system magnified the revenue impact of
weaker activity. In contrast, the current slowdown finds the economy with slightly more
fiscal room to maneuver due to a lower debt burden and greater flexibility from structural
reforms.
2.
The authorities implemented bold measures under the PRGF-supported
program that ended in 2006, but additional steps are necessary to increase the
country’s resilience. Measures taken under the program helped stabilize the fiscal
position and thereby placed debt ratios firmly on a declining path. Reform of indirect
taxes has improved revenue performance. Since the expiration of the PRGF arrangement,
the thrust of the authorities’ policies has been consistent with Fund advice. Further efforts
are needed, however, to achieve a more comfortable debt level, and thus create room to
deal with natural disasters and eventually provide scope for countercyclical policies. It is
also important to continue reducing vulnerabilities in the financial system to increase
resilience to external shocks, and to continue working with other stakeholders to improve
the catastrophic risk insurance facility.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Dominica was struck by Hurricane Dean in August 2007, causing damage
estimated at almost 20 percent of GDP (Box 1). The agricultural sector, one of the
major sources of foreign exchange earnings, took the brunt of the damage. Economic
growth is estimated to have slowed to around 1½ percent in 2007 from a pre-hurricane
forecast of 3 percent, while the loss in export earnings in 2007 is estimated at 2½ percent
of GDP (Figure 1 and Table 1). Inflation reached 5½ percent in December 2007,
reflecting significant increases in food prices and the pass-through of higher petroleum
prices. The donor community has responded by providing disaster relief grants to help
1

The Article IV discussions were held in Roseau during May 19–28, 2008. The staff team comprised
Messrs. Samuel (Head), Dehesa (both WHD) and Ms. Yang (FIN). The mission was joined by staff of the
ECCB and Caribbean Development Bank. Y. Alvarez (OED) participated in the final meeting. The team
met with Prime Minister Skerrit, the Cabinet, and senior government officials, as well as representatives of
the private sector and labor unions.

4
address immediate humanitarian needs, and to undertake repair and reconstruction of
essential infrastructure. However, given the severity of structural damage, the
reconstruction process will require considerable resources, and is likely to be limited by
implementation capacity.
4.
Fiscal performance remained strong in FY 2007/08 despite hurricane-related
increases in expenditure. Robust revenue performance in VAT and import duties, due in
part to the surge in imports related to reconstruction, helped partially compensate for
revenue forgone from the introduction of the income tax reform in January 2008 and the
reduction in the excise tax on fuel used for electricity generation (Figure 2 and Table 2).
Higher revenue has offset the increase in expenditure after Hurricane Dean. Outlays on
goods and services related to rehabilitation increased following Hurricane Dean while
grants financed the enlarged capital investment, enabling the achievement of a primary
fiscal surplus of 3 percent of GDP. The first phase of a multiyear personal income tax
reform was implemented in January 2008, which is projected to result in revenue losses
of about ½ percent of GDP in 2007/08, and 1½ percent of GDP annually over the medium
term (Box 2).
5.
The achievement of satisfactory primary surpluses in recent years has kept
the public debt on a firmly downward path following the 2005 debt restructuring.
The public debt/GDP ratio declined to below 95 percent of GDP in 2007. The authorities
have continued to make good-faith efforts to negotiate agreements with hold-out
creditors. An agreement that preserves equality of treatment for all debtors is being
finalized with one of the remaining creditors, and payments continue to be made into the
escrow account established under the debt restructuring agreement.
6.
The current account deficit is estimated to have widened by almost 6 percent
of GDP in 2007 to 23½ percent of GDP. As a result of the hurricane, exports are
estimated to have declined by 1 percent of GDP, while imports have risen by 2½ percent
of GDP, reflecting reconstruction activities (Figure 3 and Table 3). The deterioration in
the current account was exacerbated by lower tourist receipts, as well as the rising
petroleum and imported food bill.
7.
Private sector credit growth slowed in 2007 following a rapid expansion in
2006. As a disaster-related surge in remittances led to a lower demand for credit, and
external grants increased the liquidity of the banking system, banks placed more assets
abroad. Net foreign assets of the banking system increased by EC$50 million to over
EC$300 million during 2007 (Figure 4 and Table 4). The banking system appears
profitable and well-capitalized—although the ratio of capital to risk weighted assets has
been declining, it is still over 16 percent compared with the ECCU minimum requirement
of 8 percent (Table 5). The regulation of the nonbank financial sector is uneven despite
recent efforts to improve oversight. In particular, credit unions and insurance companies

8.
The Growth and Social Protection Strategy (GSPS), developed alongside the
PRGF-supported program, is being revised to amplify the structural reform agenda.
The emphasis is on reducing the cost of doing business, including improving the
efficiency of the energy sector. Recent structural reforms have helped improve the
business climate, resulting in steady improvement in the World Bank Index of Doing
Business. Nevertheless, private investment is limited by infrastructure constraints,
combined with inefficient contract enforcement and land registration processes. Delivery
of fuel under the PetroCaribe agreement began in February with the opening of the
Venezuelan-constructed oil terminal, and steps are being taken to explore Dominica’s
geothermal potential.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Dominica is grappling with the challenges facing the entire ECCU—slower
growth and a spike in inflation triggered by external shocks and a weakened global
environment. Accordingly, policy discussions focused on the growth outlook, fiscal
policy, and structural reforms to improve competitiveness and reduce vulnerabilities. In
particular, the discussions dealt with: (i) risks to the growth outlook posed by the
weakening global economy and rising commodity prices; (ii) maintaining fiscal stability;
and (iii) continuing the reform momentum to enhance private sector growth and further
reduce financial sector and weather-related vulnerabilities. There was broad agreement on
the staff’s recommendations and the policy implications.

6
A. Outlook and Risks
10.
The economy is expected to rebound in 2008, but is unlikely to regain prehurricane growth for some time. The spillover effects of the slowdown in the U.S.
economy are expected to be partly offset by domestic factors. 2 Growth is projected at
2½ percent in 2008, supported by reconstruction efforts and recovery in agriculture.
Inflation is expected to reach 6½ percent at end-2008, and then to moderate gradually in
line with WEO projections of international food and petroleum prices. The external
current account deficit is projected to rise another 5 percent of GDP in 2008, as exports
are projected to fall by 2 percent of GDP, reflecting the full-year impact of the hurricane
and the loss of export income due to the closure of a toothpaste factory in the last quarter
in 2007. Meanwhile, imports would continue to rise due to reconstruction efforts
(Table 6). The large current account deficit would be financed mainly by FDI and public
sector grants. Domestic consumption and investment would be supported by remittance
flows and abundant liquidity in the banking system.

Over the medium term, growth prospects are largely dependent on global
economic developments, with support being provided by a scale-up in domestic
expenditure. The baseline medium-term scenario envisages that growth would be
sustained at around 3 percent from 2010 on, in line with pre-hurricane trends. Growth
would be supported by continuing policy reform to reduce the cost of doing business,
further diversification of the economy into tourism, and maintenance of strong foreign

direct investment to increase capacity in that sector.3 Under the baseline scenario, and
assuming maintenance of the authorities’ fiscal targets, public debt will decline to the
ECCB benchmark of 60 percent of GDP by 2014, well ahead of the 2020 target date.

prediction.
13.
The recent increase in the external current account deficit mainly reflects the
effects of the hurricane and the rise in food and energy prices. Over the medium term,
with firm implementation of the authorities’ policies, the external current account deficit
would moderate to about 19 percent of GDP despite the waning banana sector, as
reconstruction efforts wind down and efforts to diversify into tourism take hold. 6

sector, and is likely to be moderated by the nature of new tourism investments, which are

4

The consultation was complemented by the Executive Board discussion of the Staff Report for the 2007
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union Discussion on Common Policies of Member Countries, the report for
which covers common regional issues related to monetary and exchange rate issues and banking system
supervision (see IMF Country Report No. 08/94).

5

A time series model linking the REER to measures of the ECCU region’s fundamentals (productivity
differentials, terms of trade, government consumption, and net foreign assets) indicates that there is little
evidence of overvaluation of the EC dollar. See Pineda and Cashin (2008), “Assessing Exchange
Rate Competitiveness in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,” in ECCU: Selected Issues, IMF Country
Report No. 08/96.

sharp increase as the industry reaches a critical mass.

focused on individually-owned villas. Nevertheless, the current account will remain
elevated, reflecting projected FDI and grant-financed imports. This level appears to be
consistent with the long-run equilibrium external current account deficit of 20 percent of
GDP, after factoring in the role of FDI and grants—both nondebt-creating flows (Box 3).
The authorities’ fiscal targets and the projected path for external debt appear consistent
with maintaining the stability of the currency union. The government’s sustained efforts
to lower the cost of doing business and enhance infrastructure (that facilitates air and sea
access as well as access to tourism sites) would improve competitiveness and boost
export growth with higher value added. 7 Nevertheless, the high external current account
deficit poses risks that need to be carefully monitored, and accompanied by efforts at
continued fiscal consolidation.
14.
Key downside risks to this scenario are related to further weakness in the
global economic outlook; underlying fragilities in Dominica’s fiscal situation; and
the economy’s susceptibility to natural disasters. They underscore the need to avoid
slippage in fiscal targets.
•
Higher oil prices and a worsening outlook for the U.S. economy, whose
performance strongly affects tourism and remittances, remain significant external risks,
and could widen further the external current account deficit in the near term.
•
Dominica’s public capital expenditure is largely grant financed, for which
there is significant uncertainty. A decline in external aid could lead to additional
borrowing, which even at concessional rates would slow the decline in public debt.
B. Fiscal Policy
15.
Staff supported the authorities’ policy to reduce public debt gradually by
maintaining a primary fiscal surplus. The authorities stressed their commitment made
at the time of the ENDA request to achieve a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP in
2007/08 and over the medium term, while indicating their intention to proceed with the
planned income tax reform. The fiscal performance in FY 2007/08 is on course to achieve
this target, even with the implementation of the first phase of the income tax reform in
January 2008, due to strong revenue performance. However, the budget for FY 2008/09
envisages a temporary decline in the primary surplus to about 2½ percent of GDP,
reflecting the authorities’ response to hardships caused by rising fuel and food prices,
implementation of the second phase of the income tax reform and less robust revenue
performance as post-hurricane reconstruction projects wind down. Expenditure is

9
projected to fall by 3½ percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a decline in capital expenditure.
Official external grants are projected to decline by 2 percent of GDP in FY 2008/09.
16.
The authorities remain committed to carrying through the planned income
tax reform given strong revenue growth from indirect tax reform. They plan to
implement the second phase of the reform in January 2009. This, together with other
pressing needs, could generate fiscal pressures under the baseline scenario, particularly if
there is a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the U.S. In that event, staff stressed the
need for contingency measures, including flexible implementation of the reform to
protect the fiscal targets. 8 To further strengthen the revenue position, the mission
recommended that the authorities also consider making accelerated depreciation the
preferred method of granting tax incentives, and broadening the income tax base by
phasing out mortgage deductions and taxing interest on bank deposits (as recommended
by FAD). The authorities viewed the income tax reform as part of the strategy to mitigate
the effects of food price shocks, while defending the mortgage allowance as part of the
government’s policy to provide affordable housing.
17.
Control of wage growth has contributed to the decline of current expenditure
in relation to GDP. The government’s wage bill has declined by 5 percentage points of
GDP to less than 12 percent of GDP since 2002. Multiyear wage negotiations have been
concluded with two of the three public sector labor unions, resulting in modest wage
increases, while pending issues with the third union focus on nonsalary items. However,
given higher food prices, the unions have signaled that they expect an improved offer in
negotiations for 2009/10. The mission and the authorities agreed on the importance of
limiting wage increases to affordable levels, not only to protect the fiscal targets, but also
to prevent second-round increases in inflation, especially when neither monetary nor
exchange rate policy can be used for this purpose. The authorities also remain committed
to managing public sector employment to maintain the wage bill close to the indicative
medium-term target of (12¼) percent of GDP established in the authorities’ program
under the PRGF arrangement. 9
18.
Higher food prices pose challenges for the authorities given the high levels of
poverty (Box 4). The authorities have lowered the excise tax on fuel for electricity
8

The preliminary outturn of the indirect tax reform introduced in March 2006 has surpassed the original
estimates by an amount sufficient to cover the revenue forgone by the income tax reform (see also IMF Country
Report No. 07/322). Medium-term fiscal projections already incorporate the projected revenue losses from
the income tax reform.

10
generation (revenue loss of 0.5 percent of GDP), and the state-owned export and import
marketing company has absorbed some price increases for basic food stuffs by reducing
its other activities. They have also reduced the common external tariff (CET) on a limited
number of essential food items as part of the CARICOM initiative to address the
international food price shock (0.2 percent of GDP), and eliminated the customs service
charge on selected petroleum products. The range of food items on which the CET was
lowered is small because the benefit is difficult to target and the price reduction might not
reach the intended population because of the country’s monopolistic distribution system.
The potential long-term revenue loss of these reductions in tax rates is a concern, given
that they may prove difficult to reverse. The mission recommended strengthening existing
mechanisms to deliver targeted transfers to the poor. The authorities noted that a modest
increase in such assistance was already incorporated in the FY 2007/08 budget (0.1
percent of GDP), and agreed to try to speed up World Bank-assisted efforts to improve
mechanisms to better target assistance to the poor.
19.
The mission recommended moving gradually to a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF) to help manage the effects of recent aid inflows. In recent years,
the government has taken steps to diversify its trade and economic cooperation linkages,
especially with China and Venezuela, which has resulted in increased (but uncertain) aid
flows (Box 5). This includes assistance under the PetroCaribe and Bolivarian Alternative
for the America’s (ALBA) agreement with Venezuela. An MTEF would give greater
predictability to government expenditure, reduce economic volatility, and help prevent an
appreciation in the REER associated with aid-financed spending beyond the economy’s
absorptive capacity. The mission also recommended improving the framework for
executing and monitoring grant-financed projects. This would be aided by early approval
of the pending Finance Administration Act, which would enhance recording and
accountability in government finances. Regarding financing under the PetroCaribe and
ALBA agreements, staff and the authorities agreed that such financing should be
consistent with the overall public expenditure and debt strategy, and preserve the passthrough of changes in international oil prices. The authorities indicated that they propose
to save the bulk of the concessional financing for fuel consumption under the PetroCaribe
initiative. 10 They plan to set up an investment fund, possibly at the ECCB, and restrict
their spending on social projects from this source to the net return derived from the
investment fund. Arrangements are also being made to incorporate the governmentowned petroleum trading company and ensure that its activities are clearly reflected in the
government accounts.
10

Under the PetroCaribe Agreement, the state-owned petroleum trading company is required to pay
between 40–50 percent of the value oil imports (depending on the oil price) within 90 days and the rest is
payable over 25 years at very concessional interest rates.

sensitive to changes in the growth rate, the primary surplus, aid flows and interest rates.
Under the baseline scenario with annual growth assumed at 3 percent over the medium
term and achievement of the authorities’ fiscal target, debt would reach the ECCB target
of 60 percent of GDP by 2014. A scenario in which growth is halved in 2009–11 and the
primary surplus slips to 1½ percent of GDP would delay achievement of the ECCB target
by two years.
C. Enhancing Competitiveness and Reducing Vulnerabilities
21.
The authorities explained that their agenda for structural reforms focuses on
enhancing private sector growth and reducing vulnerabilities. After addressing the
immediate priorities following Hurricane Dean, the government has refocused its
attention on the reform agenda, and has revised and updated its Growth and Social
Protection Strategy (GSPS). The main priorities for reform will remain: (i) maintaining
prudent fiscal policies; (ii) enhancing the investment climate for private sector
development; and (iii) strengthening oversight of, and resilience in, the financial sector.
Efforts are also being made to reduce Dominica’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
22.
Regarding enhancing competitiveness, the authorities emphasized that
improving the investment climate would be key to expanding the role of the private
sector in raising and sustaining economic growth. The authorities and staff concurred
that reducing the cost of doing business and increasing productivity are essential in
overcoming constraints to production.
•
Improving energy policies. The authorities are moving ahead on several fronts to
reduce the cost of energy. They have signed the PetroCaribe Agreement with Venezuela,

12
which would help reduce the cost of fuel for electricity generation. 11 They have also
signed a European Union funded multipartite agreement (€ 1½ million) to help develop
Dominica’s geothermal energy resources to serve domestic demand as well as the
neighboring French territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique. This project could
significantly reduce dependence on imported oil, lower the cost of energy (a major
expense for hotels), and increase exports.
•
Streamlining business processes. The authorities have progressively streamlined
business procedures, including establishing (with the aid of the World Bank) specialized
one-stop agencies for investment and tourism promotion. They have also requested
technical assistance from LEG in drafting legislative changes to facilitate foreclosures.
These efforts have resulted in steady improvements in Dominica’s ranking on the World
Bank’s index of doing business.
23.
The authorities concurred with staff on the necessity to increase financial
sector resilience, and are pressing to pass associated legislation before end-2008. The
government and the ECCB have progressively strengthened the regulatory framework of
the banking sector. While some efforts have been made to strengthen oversight of the
nonbank financial sector, these institutions remain largely unregulated. They indicated
that they were moving to strengthen supervisory capabilities for nonbanks, but were
constrained by the shortage of human capital. The staff urged the authorities to press
ahead with the enactment and implementation of pending Financial Services Unit (FSU)
Act and other enabling legislation to create a unified regulatory framework for nonbanks,
and stressed the importance of strengthening the FSU in the Ministry of Finance by
providing adequate resources to staff the institution effectively. Stepped-up oversight of
the credit union sector, which has total assets equivalent to 45 percent of GDP and
amount to about a third of bank deposits, is a high priority; and further efforts are needed
to strengthen the balance sheet of the AID bank and clarify responsibility for its
supervision.
24.
Natural disaster mitigation measures are being strengthened. The lessons
from Hurricane Dean and the earthquake in November have provided an opportunity for
the authorities to reassess their disaster preparedness plans. The government is
reinforcing sea and river defenses to reduce risks of flooding and improving coordination
among disaster relief agencies. The recent reduction in Dominica’s premium for disaster
insurance charged by the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) is

welcome; however, given the peculiar circumstances of the member countries, the
efficacy of the parameters of the insurance scheme still remains to be assessed. 12
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Dominica is recovering rapidly from the effects of Hurricane Dean. With
assistance from the international community, the authorities moved quickly to address the
immediate post-hurricane priorities, and are now returning their focus on medium-term
challenges. These include restoring growth to pre-hurricane levels even as the global
economy weakens, maintaining fiscal stability to help lower high public debt, and
sustaining the momentum of structural reform to enhance competitiveness and reduce
vulnerabilities.
26.
The economic flexibility accorded by recent reforms has facilitated the
rebound in economic activity in 2008, but rising commodity prices have created
challenges for economic policy. The economy’s prospects are conditioned on
developments in the global economy given the close growth relationship with the U.S., as
well as the continued implementation of the GSPS agenda. Further diversification of the
economy into tourism and structural reforms are needed, particularly measures to reduce
the cost of doing business, to achieve above-trend output growth. However, higher fuel
prices could dampen prospects for growth in the tourism sector as airlines reduce flights
and raise airfares to the region. The significant rise in food and fuel prices has also
created hardship among the most vulnerable groups in the society. The implementation of
temporary, targeted food and energy subsidies for the poor, while maintaining the flexible
fuel pricing regime would help ease the adjustment of the most vulnerable segments of
the population and, more generally, the economy to higher international commodity
prices.
27.
Fiscal policy is rightly oriented toward reducing the still-high public debt
ratios, and enhancing infrastructure to boost private sector growth. The staff
supports the authorities’ intention to continue targeting primary fiscal surpluses of 3
percent of GDP over the medium term, with a temporary reduction in FY 2008/09.
Determined implementation of such a fiscal policy would help achieve the ECCB’s target
for public debt ratios well ahead of the 2020 target. To secure the fiscal target in the event
of a sharper-than expected or more-prolonged global slowdown, the authorities may need
to consider a more extended phasing-in of the planned income tax reform. To enhance the

In January, the CCRIF announced a 10 percent reduction in premiums for member states, and the
minimum attachment point available for hurricane policies was decreased from coverage of 1 in 20 year
events to 1 in 15 year events. However, during last year, several countries suffered significant damage due
to hurricanes, but wind speeds were insufficient to trigger payouts under the scheme.

14
tax system further, it would be important to shift to accelerated depreciation as the
preferred mode for granting tax incentives, and broaden the base of the personal income
tax.
28.
Dominica’s real exchange rate appears to be consistent with macroeconomic
fundamentals. The recent hurricane-related run up in the external current account deficit
is expected to be reversed over the medium term, but it will nevertheless remain elevated.
Existing economic policies yield a projected external debt profile that appears to be
consistent with the common currency arrangement.
29.
Passage of the Financial Services Act would provide a promising basis for
strengthening the regulation and supervision of nonbank financial institutions. To
complement the law, it would be critical that the authorities move quickly to build
capacity in the Financial Services Unit so that it can effectively regulate and supervise
nonbanks, particularly credit unions and insurance companies.
30.
Implementing the structural reform agenda is key to enhancing the
competitiveness of the economy. The authorities are cognizant to the challenge of
competitiveness, and have been focusing on reducing the cost of doing business and
easing infrastructure constraints, with some success. Looking ahead, the envisaged fiscal
consolidation and productivity-enhancing reforms would be essential to improving
competitiveness and ensuring the stability of the currency union arrangement.
31.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Dominica: Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance
Dominica was struck by Hurricane Dean in August 2007, which caused damage
estimated at nearly 20 percent of GDP and loss of life. The agriculture sector was
most severely affected, and damage to the housing stock and infrastructure was also
considerable. The international donor community provided assistance to help in disaster
relief and rehabilitation of essential infrastructure. The Executive Board approved a
request for Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance (ENDA) in the amount of
SDR 2.05 million on February 4, 2008.
In the letter of intent, the government committed to maintaining a primary surplus of
3 percent of GDP despite the effects of the hurricane. They proposed to limit additional
spending to 2½ percent of GDP after reallocation of expenditure already in the FY 2007/08
budget. The implementation of the planned income tax reform was expected to proceed, but
the schedule could be varied to protect the primary surplus target and pressures to reduce
VAT rates arising from inflation concerns would be resisted. Structural reforms aimed at
fostering private sector growth and poverty reduction would proceed as planned.

1/ Adjusted for FY 2006/07 outturn and implementation capacity.
2/ Deflated by GDP projected at the time of the ENDA request.

Fiscal performance has been in line with expectations at the time of the ENDA request.
The surplus projected for the end of the fiscal year is expected to be about 3 percent of GDP
as increased revenue from VAT and import duties have offset the revenue forgone by
lowering the excise duty on fuel for electricity generation. Expenditure increases have been
limited to about 2 percent of GDP. The first phase of the income tax reform was implemented
on schedule in January 2008, while VAT rates were kept unchanged.
Looking ahead, the authorities have revised the GSPS to update their reform agenda
and have sought the support of the international donor community for their policies.
They have retained the medium-term fiscal targets but would need to keep open the option to
vary the pace of implementation of the income tax reform to protect these targets.

Box 2. Dominica: Income Tax Reform
The authorities announced in the Budget address for FY 2007/08 a far-reaching
income tax reform to reward effort, increase competitiveness, and reduce the tax
burden. The income tax reform builds upon the rise in revenue that resulted from the
introduction of the VAT and excise duty regime in March 2006.The three main features of
the income tax reform are: an increase in the personal allowance; a reclassification of tax
brackets, and a reduction in tax rates in each of the three income brackets.

surplus of 3 percent of GDP that
guides the authorities’ growth and debt sustainability strategy. The income tax reform is
being introduced in stages starting in January 2008. The pace of implementation of the tax
reform remains flexible to protect the primary surplus target of 3 percent of GDP. The
annualized tax revenue foregone due to the income tax reform amounts to about 0.9 percent
of GDP for FY 2007/08 rising to the 1.4–1.7 percent range over the medium term. The bulk
of the fiscal cost comes from increasing the exempted threshold.

Box 3. Dominica: Assessment of External Stability
Estimates of Dominica’s external current account norms were obtained using two
methods. The 2007 underlying current account deficit, which excludes temporary effects
on loss of exports and increased imports due to Hurricane Dean is estimated at around
21 percent of GDP. The equilibrium current account deficit (the current account ‘norm’) is
also estimated at around

misalignment of the real exchange rate.
Staff estimates show that a large equilibrium current account deficit is a phenomenon
observed in all ECCU countries. The deficit in Dominica is mostly driven by imports,
which represent nearly 50 percent of GDP, a large portion of which is related to the FDI
and grant-financed projects. Assuming an import content of 90 percent, the table shows
that FDI and grants together explain a significant part of current account deficit. Excluding
the FDI- and grant-related imports, the current account deficit declines to 6 percent of
GDP in 2007 and to 4½ percent of GDP over the medium term.

Box 4. Dominica: Inflation Developments and Policy Response
Inflation in Dominica, as in other ECCU, Latin America and other Caribbean countries,
accelerated significantly in 2007. Twelve-month inflation reached 5½ percent at end 2007
from 1.6 percent a year earlier; food inflation rose to 8.4 percent and fuel to 24.1 percent. The
joint contribution of food and fuel price increases amounted to about three quarters of the
overall end-year inflation in 2007. In March 2008, inflation accelerated further to 7.7 percent
driven by the recent run-up in commodity prices.
In Dominica, as in other ECCU countries, “food and beverages” carries the largest weight
in the CPI basket (33 percent), while fuel accounts for 6 percent. Rising food prices pose an
acute challenge to Dominica due to the high incidence of poverty. Almost 40 percent of the
population falls in the category of poor or very poor and half of the total expenditure in the
lowest two quintiles of the population is devoted to food. However ECCU countries differ in
their energy regulatory and tax regime. Dominica moved to flexible fuel pricing in 2003 while
prices remain administered in the rest of the ECCU except for Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis,
which both adopted flexible pricing regimes in late 2006.
The price pressures have been mostly driven by developments in the external
environment, including the depreciation of the EC dollar against other currencies.
Domestic demand appears to have a lesser role as the economy grew below trend in 2007 due to
the adverse impact of Hurricane Dean. However supply disruptions in the aftermath of the
hurricane contributed to temporarily higher prices.
The appropriate policy response depends on whether price increases are deemed
permanent or transitory, and on the policy instruments available to the authorities. The
narrow policy options under the ECCU quasi-currency board regime place a greater burden on
fiscal policy. The Dominican authorities have reduced the import tariff on a limited number of
food items under the CARICOM initiative to mitigate food-price inflation, because such relief is
difficult to target. A monopolistic food distribution chain may also not pass on the benefit to
consumers, and tariffs may not be easily restored after the emergency. The government also
provided relief to the rising cost of living by cutting in half the excise on fuel used in electricity
(at a fiscal cost of about ½ of 1 percent of GDP and exempted pensioners from the income tax at
a modest fiscal cost.
The mission proposed to address the challenges arising from food inflation by
strengthening existing social protection programs, in the context of the work with the
World Bank aimed at improving the efficiency of social safety nets. The central government
current spending on social protection programs amounted to about 2½ percent of GDP in
FY 2006/07 of which broadly ½ of 1 percent of GDP was devoted to addressing basic needs.

increase in grants, helped to
keep inflation low, prior to the recent increases in food and fuel prices.
The surge in grants comes largely from new donors including China, Venezuela, and
Trinidad and Tobago. These grants are part of economic and cultural cooperation
agreements and financial assistance following Hurricane Dean. Grants from China have been
used to finance sports facilities, road improvement, river control, and schools, while those
from Venezuela have been used to develop the airport, sea defenses and government
buildings infrastructure, low-income housing, and disaster relief. Resources from Trinidad
and Tobago mainly contributed to the rehabilitation of infrastructure after Hurricane Dean.
A medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) can help better manage these
increasing aid inflows. Most of the government capital expenditure is financed by grants

VI.

Exchange rate arrangement: Dominica is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,
which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. Dominica has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), of which Dominica is a member, is subject to a full safeguards
assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was completed in July 2007, and
concluded that the ECCB continues to have appropriate control mechanisms in place, which
have strengthened since the first safeguards assessment completed in 2003. ECCB management
places emphasis on good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the bank's
transparency and accountability since the last assessment, including the publications of financial
statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment made
some recommendations to sustain the ECCB's safeguards framework going forward.

VII.

Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on July 16, 2007; the relevant documents are IMF Country Report No. 07/322 and IMF Country
Report No. 05/324. Dominica is on a 12-month cycle.

IX.

Technical assistance: In January 2007 an FAD and Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance
Center (CARTAC) mission provided technical assistance on revenue administration and tax
policy. In 2006, an MCM mission provided technical assistance in drafting an action plan for
AID Bank. In 2005, an MCM mission provided technical assistance in strengthening the
supervisory framework for AML/CFT in the nonbank sector. FAD missions have provided
technical assistance on tax policy and administration, and social security reform. The most recent
missions include: pension reform options (2005); TA on fiscal responsibility laws (2004); VAT
implementation (1999); urban property taxation (1997); and tax policy and administration, and
expenditure control (1995). Technical assistance from MFD and FAD has complemented the
assistance that has been provided by the CARTAC in Barbados. LEG has been providing
assistance with the drafting and interpretation of the VAT legislation.

X.

FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCB, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20−31, 2003. The
principal objective of the missions was to assist the authorities in assessing the development
needs and opportunities for the financial sector and identifying potential vulnerabilities of
financial institutions and markets to macroeconomic shocks, as well as the risks to
macroeconomic stability from weaknesses and shortcomings in the financial sector. A detailed
assessment of the AML/CFT regimes of Dominica was conducted in September 2003 by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). The Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on
the IMF’s external website, including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) on Banking Supervision.

Appendix II. Dominica: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 30, 2008)
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
FY06-09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened
creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities will focus on leveraging available donor
grant financing. Following the recommendations of the recently completed growth and
competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA support would focus on providing technical
and financial assistance for interventions to support the two main pillars. An indicative Base
Case lending scenario consisted of about US$51.3 million in IDA resources for the four OECS
IDA eligible countries. An OECS CAS Progress Report was presented to the Board in June
2008.
A. Projects
There are currently four active World Bank projects in Dominica for a net commitment of
approximately US$8.89 million:
The OECS E-Government for Regional Integration Program was approved by the Board on
May 27, 2008. This project consists of a US$2.4 million loan to Dominica and is designed to
promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency of public services through the delivery of
regionally integrated e-government applications that take advantage of economies of scale. The
program is structured in phases. Phase 1 focuses on cross-sectoral e-government issues, as well
as on specific applications in the public finance area (including Public Financial Management or
PFM, tax, customs and procurement), and also includes an e-government in health pilot project
(possibly together with preparatory and complementary activities in other social and productive
sectors). Subsequent phases of the program are expected to deepen the assistance provided under
Phase 1, while expanding the program to cover other sectors, in particular, health, education,
agriculture, tourism, postal, among others that may emerge during the early stages of
implementation of Phase 1.
The Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project was approved in February
2007 for US$1.45 million. The objectives of the project are to enhance the capacity of the public
sector to implement focused reforms geared at improving the public sector delivery of services as
well as creating the institutional and policy framework to facilitate private sector-led growth. The
project has the following five components: Component (1) will focus on making the public sector
more efficient and effective through support to implement the government’s public sector
modernization strategy; Component (2) will target improvement of the investment climate
through the strengthening of the institutional and regulatory framework for attracting investment

5
into Dominica; Component (3) will focus on reforming the regulatory framework for the energy
sector and support the creation of a framework for the development of alternative sources of
energy; Component (4) addresses the improvement of the existing social safety net programs;
Component (5) deals with the management of the overall project. The total project cost is US$2.6
million, of which the World Bank is providing US$1.45 million and the EU is providing
US$0.58 million of grant financing.
The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project was approved in January 2007. This is
the world’s first ever multi-country catastrophe insurance pool. The bank has approved a US$4.5
million IDA credit for Dominica to finance their contribution to the fund over three years. The
Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe insurance coverage against adverse
natural events, such as a major earthquake or hurricane. The CCRIF allows participating
countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, better-diversified portfolio, resulting in a
substantial reduction in the premium cost of 45–50 percent.
The OECS Telecommunications and ICT Development Project was approved in September,
2005 for US$541.6 thousand and aims at improving the access, quality, and use of
telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socio-economic development in the OECS. The
project has the following four components: Component (1) will strengthen the national and
regional regulatory frameworks and promote additional competition in the telecommunications
sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) by
providing them with assistances to revise the regional and national sector legislation, and develop
a modem interconnection regime; Component (2) will review current universal access policy,
create related guidelines, and provide financial support to establish a Universal Service Fund
(USF); Component (3) will improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services
through utilization of broadband infrastructure; and Component (4) will ensure management and
administration of the overall project.
B. Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to public sector capacity in the
OECS including a number of Public Expenditure Reviews, an Institutional and Organizational
Capacity Review and, in late 2007, a Country Fiduciary Assessment. The Bank also prepared an
OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness (2005), a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006),
and a regional study on Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in
the Caribbean (2007). Dominica was also included in the OECS Doing Business Report in 2007,
the first multi-country special report to be undertaken by the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (FIAS). Follow-on detailed diagnostic work for St. Lucia is expected in FY09. In
addition, an OECS Private Sector Financing Study was completed in early 2008.
Dominica will also benefit from ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities including
the following: A Caribbean Skills and Curriculum Study, a Caribbean Financial Sector and
Regulation report, a Caribbean Social Protection Strategy Review, a Trade Integration in the

6
Caribbean: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation, and Poverty Reduction report, a
CARICOM study on Managing Nurse Migration, and an OECS Tourism Backward Linkages
Study. A Regional Energy Security report is also planned for FY09.

Appendix III. Dominica: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
(As of March 31, 2008)
As at end-March 2008, CDB had approved loans totalling US$151.3 million of which
US$9.4 million are undisbursed. Total debt outstanding amounted to US$83.5 million. The
portfolio for Dominica has aged somewhat with the rate of approval of new loans also
slowing within the recent past. Among other things, this reflects the strong surge in grants
inflows particularly from bilateral sources. Nonetheless, CDB’s interventions continue to
centre on building critical road infrastructure as well as enhancing human resources
development in an effort to strengthen the country’s growth resilience and reduce poverty.
Furthermore, the Bank is supporting the country in seeking to reduce poverty amongst the
indigenous people through the approval of a Carib Territory Capacity Building project.
Major projects under implementation include:
1.

Upgrading of Ecotourism Sites—the construction of access roads and reception
centres, related infrastructure as well as site trails at five major tourism sites across
the island. US$3.1 million is approved and US$0.12 million is undisbursed.

2.

Student Loan Scheme (Seventh Loan)—to provide DAIDB with resources to continue
financing its student loan programme. US$7.0 million is approved and US$0.43
million is undisbursed.

3.

Shelter Development Project—to establish a framework for developing the shelter
sector on a sustainable basis with particular reference to low-income households.
US$2.3 million is approved and US$0.89 million is undisbursed.

4.

Carib Territory Capacity Building Project- to strengthen road infrastructure in the
Carib Reserve and to improve housing conditions. US$2.49 million is approved
without any disbursement to date.

5.

Road improvement Project - to improve safety, decrease vehicular operating costs
and improve access to tourism sites. US$5.5 million initially approved in 2005 with
an additional loan of 3.1 million approved in 2008.

Appendix IV. Dominica: Statistical Issues
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are
weaknesses in coverage, accuracy, frequency, and timeliness that continue to hamper effective
economic analysis and policy formulation. Priority should be given to compilation and
dissemination of national accounts, in particular tourism, agriculture and labor statistics. Despite
progress, significant weaknesses remain in the compilation of fiscal accounts, and the balance of
payments. Dominica participates in the General Data Dissemination System. However, the
metadata for external sector and government finance statistics have not been updated since
December 2002.
Real sector
Annual nominal GDP data are compiled using the production and the expenditure approaches.
Estimates by economic activity are compiled using production approach at 1990 prices. GDP
estimates are available about four months after the end of the year. The data are revised
frequently and are usually finalized with a two-year lag following completion of the National
Accounts Survey. There is a program to improve national accounts data primarily through the
development of the supply and use table. In late 2007 the authorities undertook a comprehensive
assessment of the GDP methodology and data, with the assistance of the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB). Revised national accounts data are not yet available to the public. A
prerequisite for ensuring the robustness of the new national accounts data would be the revision
and/or update of the base year, which is currently 1990. CPI data are compiled with a two-month
lag, with weights based on the 1997/1998 Household Expenditure Survey. There is a program to
develop export and import price indices (XMPIs), but a shortage of staff working on price
statistics limits developments in CPI methodology and the likelihood that XMPIs will be
developed in the near future. The IMF, through the operation of the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Center is currently providing technical advice on XMPI methodology to
Dominica and other countries in the region. Data on employment are limited and there are no
official data on producer prices or wages in the private sector. Results of the 2001 population
census have not yet been published.
Government finance statistics
Statistical capacity problems affect the timely production of quality government finance
statistics. In particular, the data are subject to frequent revisions stemming in part from omissions
and misclassifications. Data on central government operations are incomplete and must be
supplemented with additional information from external sources. For instance, some operations
are undertaken outside the consolidated fund. These include certain investment spending, loan
and grant receipts, and on-lending and transfers to public enterprises. As a result, capital
expenditure data, recorded by the Treasury, must be supplemented with additional donor
financing information, particularly because the public sector investment program (PSIP) data are

9
not timely. Delays in the reporting of the PSIP data reportedly stem from reporting delays from
the line ministries.
Several ongoing initiatives to strengthen expenditure management, should help minimize the
extent of this problem. There is an ongoing effort to automate the expenditure execution process.
A new automation technology installed in all line ministries in 2005 should allow all local
purchase orders (LPOs) to be electronically generated and tracked. Commitments are charged
against a specific budget allocation once the LPOs are generated. All ministries and suppliers of
goods and services are compelled to use the new system. Only limited financing data are
available. Although progress has been made in improving the measurement of the government's
debt, there are concerns that there is still some under-recording of government commitments.
The authorities do not provide consolidated nonfinancial public sector data. Data for the rest of
the public sector—Dominica Social Security and the public enterprises—must be obtained
directly from each entity during Fund Article IV consultation missions.
No government finance data are reported to STA for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis based
on a standardized report form since July 2006. In April 2007 a data ROSC mission assessed the
monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS, and the Data Quality Assessment Framework
(DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the institutional coverage of the other depository
corporations is incomplete, as data for mortgage companies, finance companies, building
societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are excluded. Also, accrued interest
is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities, and valuation
adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source data for the commercial banks do
not provide the disaggregation recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Close coordination between the ECCB and the single regulatory unit (which supervises financial
corporations other than those licensed under the Banking Act) is crucial.
Balance of payments statistics
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis but do not contain
sufficient detail to enable publication of the full classification used in the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Data reported to STA are improving in timeliness, but still suffer
from relatively numerous and large errors and omissions. Enhanced data resources and better
compilation procedures are needed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of balance of
payments statistics. The authorities should make efforts to compile quarterly balance of payments
statistics and the annual international investment position statement.

10
External debt
The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed external loans
that provides detailed and reasonably current information on disbursements, debt service, and
debt stocks. The Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two
databases are not consolidated, requiring further adjustments to measure the total debt stock. In
addition, information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) should be available to the
compilation agencies at least on a monthly basis, in order to allow production of timely debt
stock data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
DOMINICA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with World Bank Staff
July 11, 2008
The analysis shows that despite the adverse impact of Hurricane Dean in August 2007,
Dominica has steadily improved its debt sustainability outlook due to the authorities’ firm
commitment to sound fiscal policies. Nevertheless, the outlook still presents large risks
related to a possible further weakening of global economic outlook, the dependence on aid
flows to finance capital expenditure, and vulnerability to natural disasters.
I. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Staff has prepared a baseline scenario whose main parameters are consistent with the
authorities’ updated Growth and Social Protection Strategy (GSPS). The main assumptions

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2008–2028)
•

Real growth is projected at 3 percent of GDP over the projection period after a two-year period of
slightly lower growth related to the current global slowdown. 1 Growth would be supported by
continuing policy reform to reduce the cost of doing business and strong FDI flows to expand capacity
in the tourism sector. Inflation is projected to remain low (1.5 percent per year) after the international
food and fuel price shocks are assimilated.

•

Primary balance of the central government remains at 3 percent of GDP from 2009 in line with the
GSPS and previous DSA. Public enterprises run an overall deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP, following the
average observed during the 1999–2006 period.

•

External grants decline to 7 percent of GDP after the aid surge observed in the last two fiscal years
(FY 2006/07–07/08). Projected aid is larger than the historical level but still consistent with the
authorities’ initiatives to improve aid management and recent economic cooperation agreements. To
assess the impact of uncertain grants, we undertake a stress test below.

•

Annual disbursements of external concessional debt are assumed to be 1.5 percent of GDP through
2013 in line with previous DSAs, and decline afterwards to 0.5 percent of GDP as financing needs
diminish 2. The financing terms are similar to those of existing external debt. New domestic debt is
projected to be available at an interest rate of 7 percent (as in previous DSA).

•

PetroCaribe financing is excluded from the DSA because no information is yet available to asses the
scope of this initiative in Dominica. However, the omission of PetroCaribe operations will not
significantly distort the debt outlook given the authorities’ commitment to save the bulk of the
concessional financing for fuel consumption.

•

The current account deficit is assumed to remain high during 2008–13, then gradually fall to a level
almost fully financed by aid flows and FDI. While exports of goods are projected to grow in line with
GDP, tourism receipts are projected to grow vigorously as the transition from bananas to tourism
progresses given that Dominica’s tourism is still at its early development stage and it plans to attract
more high-end stay-over tourists.

•

FDI is assumed to remain at its 2006–07 level of 8 percent of GDP.

1

A revision in the national accounts statistics for the 2000–2006 period led to a higher nominal GDP by about
3 percent compared with nominal GDP estimates reported in the 2007 Article IV consultation.

2

Previous DSA assumed annual disbursements of external concessional debt to be 1.5 percent of GDP over the
whole projection period. Due to Dominica’s improved debt sustainability over the past two years, such an
assumption is no longer valid because it over-addresses Dominica’s long-term financing needs.

3
II. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Dominica’s public debt at end-2007
3.
As of end-2007, Dominica’s public sector debt stood at 94 percent of GDP, of which
65 percent represented external debt and the remaining 35 percent was domestic debt.
Regarding the external debt, the largest share is owed to multilateral creditors (about
70 percent of GDP, with the Caribbean Development Bank holding more than half of that),
followed by the debt with bilateral and commercial creditors (about 14½ and 12 percent of
GDP, respectively). Regarding the domestic debt, the largest creditor is Dominica’s own
Social Security System (about 11½ percent of GDP). In NPV terms, public sector debt stood
at around 88.5 percent of GDP, due to the concessionality of most of the external debt
(whose NPV was around 64 percent of GDP). 3
The baseline scenario
4.
Under the baseline scenario (Table 1a), the indicators show progressive improvement
in terms of debt sustainability. However, the debt service to revenue (and grant) ratio
increases in 2008 and 2009 and remains high until 2015, which calls for maintaining fiscal
discipline in order to avoid liquidity constraints. Under this scenario, Dominica would reach
a public debt to GDP ratio of 60 percent —the ECCB benchmark—by 2014.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
Changes in growth and primary balance
5.
The key drivers of Dominica’s debt path are economic growth and the primary
surplus target. Both are subject to large exogenous shocks, such as volatility of grants (see
below) and foreign growth, in particular U.S. growth. Staff estimate that the elasticity of
growth in Dominica to economic cycles in the U.S. is slightly greater than one.
6.
The sensitivity analysis highlights two important features (Table 1b). First, the public
debt starts rising again if Dominica’s primary balance and economic growth return to their
3

The figures could change somewhat depending on the final agreement with hold-out creditors (since different
options have different hair-cuts). These final agreements, however, should not have a material impact on the
debt sustainability paths given that all the options available for restructuring have the same NPV. The
simulations in this appendix assume that hold-out creditors take the intermediate bond, which carries a hair-cut
of 20 percent. The discount rate for the NPV calculations is 5 percent.

4
average of the last ten years (a primary balance of 0.4 percent and annual growth of
1 percent), as pointed in scenario A1. Second, the public debt stays on a declining path if
Dominica can maintain the fiscal effort projected for 2008 (a primary balance of 2.4 percent,
slightly below target of 3 percent of GDP), as pointed in scenario A2.
7.
The alternative scenario A3 shows the role of sustained growth. If growth declines to
2.3 percent per year, debt initially declines but later reverts to an increasing path. This is
because fiscal expenditure is the driver of the debt trajectory. As output growth slows,
primary expenditure is projected to rise relative to the baseline scenario while tax revenues
are assumed to remain roughly constant, leading to a deterioration of the primary balance.
Figure 2 illustrates the role of economic growth and the primary balance in the debt path. As
shown in the second panel, the debt-to-GDP ratio declines even with slower economic
growth if supported by a steady fiscal policy committed to the 3 percent primary surplus
target.
Decline in aid flows
8.
External grants to the central government reached an average 8.1 percent of GDP
during the past three fiscal years, about 4 percentage points higher than the average received
during the 1990s. Figure 2 (lower panel) shows the implications of a 3 percent of GDP
reduction in aid flows from 2009. The exercise examines two alternative scenarios: (i) the
partial adjustment scenario, which assumes that government cuts public investment spending
by 1½ percent of GDP in response to the declining aid flows and finances the rest of the aid
decline with larger borrowing (the resulted increase in borrowing is assumed to raise
domestic interest rates by one percentage point). As a consequence, primary surplus declines
to 1½ percent of GDP per year. (ii) The no adjustment scenario assumes no cut in public
investment. The aid decline is financed entirely via higher borrowing, which increases
domestic interest rates by two percentage points. In both scenarios, the new borrowing is
assumed to be funded in the domestic market.
9.
As the figure illustrates, in the no adjustment scenario where the aid decline is
addressed solely by larger borrowing, public debt quickly starts rising again due to the
compounded effects of increasing debt and higher refinancing interest rates. The debt ratio
stabilizes at around 60 percent in the partial adjustment scenario.
Other shocks
10.
Other shocks include possible natural disasters, shocks to interest rates, and the
balance sheet effects of further depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major
international currencies.

5

•

Another hurricane of similar magnitude as Hurricane Dean. The sensitivity exercise
(not shown) indicated that after an initial increase, the debt ratio returns to a
downward trajectory after growth is restored and reconstruction projects are
completed 4.

•

Interest rate shocks have little impact on Dominica’s public debt because most of its
debt, including domestic debt, is contracted at fixed interest rates.

•

A further depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would
have a modest balance sheet effect given Dominica’s debt currency composition.
About 69 percent of the external debt is denominated in U.S. dollars, 21 percent in
SDRs (where the weight of the U.S. dollar is about 44 percent), and 3.2 percent is
denominated in Euro.
III. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

11.
The majority of Dominica’s external debt is owed by the public sector, as most
private sector borrowing takes place with domestic commercial banks. Therefore, the
external DSA shares similar properties as the public sector DSA.
12.
Since the debt restructuring, external debt continues to decline in the baseline
scenario (Table 1c). Similar to the public sector DSA, the indicators of debt sustainability
that do not decline continuously are those related to the share of external debt service as a
percent of exports and public sector revenues. Both indicators increase until 2009, reflecting
the initial consequence of the debt restructuring, before they start to decline. In addition, the
adverse impact of Hurricane Dean on exports and the closure of a large foreign
manufacturing toothpaste factory in late 2007 also help explain the temporary hike in the
debt service as a share of exports. The large residuals observed over the medium term result
from the fact that there is no independent estimate of private sector debt, and is excluded
from the analysis.
13.
Sensitivity tests (Table 1d) show an improved picture of Dominica’s external debt
sustainability. If key variables stay at their historical averages 5, external debt would remain
on a declining path as higher grants and FDI would result in less external debt. Higher
interest rates (Scenario A2) have little impact on the external debt paths as in the baseline
scenario Dominica faces low financing needs (see previous section).

Dominica participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), a regional insurance
pool organized by the World Bank.

The average is calculated based on past 10 years record (1998–2007).

IV. CONCLUSIONS
14.
Continuing the process of debt restructuring, Dominica has improved its debt
sustainability on the basis of economic growth and the steadfast implementation of the strong
fiscal policy outlined in the GSPS. Fiscal policy remained strong following Hurricane Dean
as stated in the authorities’ request for emergency assistance from the Fund. Public debt
projections show a declining trend similar to that reported in previous DSAs. However, the
current projection will achieve the ECCB target of 60 percent for the debt-to-GDP ratio in
2014, two years earlier than projected in the 2007 Article IV consultation DSA. In addition,
Dominica managed to reduce debt-related vulnerabilities by joining the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and introducing a pension reform.
15.
Important debt-related vulnerabilities still remain despite the significant progress
achieved: (i) public debt is still high at 94 percent of GDP; (ii) there is a bunching of
payments in 2008–11, 6 (iii) new grant flows are uncertain and volatile; and (iv) Dominica is
exposed to external shocks and weather-related vulnerabilities.
16.
The updated GSPS rightly maintains the primary surplus target of 3 percent of GDP
to achieve a more comfortable debt ratio and thus create room to deal with natural disasters
and eventually adopt some countercyclical policies.

Debt with Government of Bahamas (US$4 million) and with Government of Trinidad and Tobago
(US$10 million) are scheduled to be repaid in 2008 but are highly likely to be rolled over into 2009 in line with
past practice.

1/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ Only includes public sector external debt.
3/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ In 2005, it includes the reallocation of part of an external bond (around 4 percent of GDP) from external to domestic. It also includes a negative FDI flow reflecting extraordinary dividends
paid by a foreign company (5 percent og GDP), which were made out of an account in a foreign bank.
6/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
7/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline
level after the shock (implcitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Dominica
July 30, 2008
This statement provides information that has become available on the 2008/09 budget, which
was presented to the parliament in Dominica on July 10, 2008, since the staff report was
circulated. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The preliminary primary surplus for 2007/08 is now estimated at 1½ percent of
GDP compared with the staff’s projection of 3 percent. The divergence is related to
capital outlays in advance of forthcoming grant funding and expenditure on post-hurricane
reconstruction projects, which have exceeded the initial cost estimates. The higher overall
deficit was domestically financed mainly by reducing government deposits, and the delay in
the receipt of external assistance is unlikely to affect the baseline projection for foreign
grants.
2.
The 2008/09 budget proposes a primary surplus of the central government of
2 percent of GDP, about ½ percent of GDP below the projection in the staff report. The
medium-term primary surplus target of 3 percent of GDP, however, remains unchanged. As
illustrated in the staff report, this deviation from the medium-term target does not alter the
conclusions of the debt sustainability analysis although the public debt/GDP ratio would be
about 1½ percent of GDP higher by 2013. Key components of the 2008/09 budget include:
•

In addition to the measures to cushion the effects of the food and energy price shocks
anticipated in the staff report, the excise tax on LPG will be removed (at a cost
0.1 percent of GDP); and a minimum pension of EC$200 per month will be
guaranteed for government pensioners.

•

An ambitious, largely grant-financed public sector investment program (about
14 percent of GDP), which could be a challenge to implementation capacity, is also
incorporated in the budget.

•

Implementation of the second phase of the income tax reform in January 2009. The
exempted income threshold will be raised from EC$18,000 to EC$20,000 and the
marginal rates will be reduced by 2 percentage points. The cost of this phase of the
reform is estimated at about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008/09 and 0.9 percent of GDP in
2009/10.

3.
The Financial Services Unit (FSU) Act was also introduced in the parliament
along with the budget. The act provides for a unified regulatory and supervisory framework
for nonbank financial institutions.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
with Dominica
On July 30, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Dominica. 1
Background
Dominica’s economy has weathered well the effects of Hurricane Dean that struck
the country in August last year, causing damage estimated at about 20 percent of
GDP. Real output growth slowed to 1½ percent in 2007, after reaching a decade high
4 percent in 2006. The economy is expected to grow by 2½ percent in 2008
supported by the recovery in agriculture and reconstruction efforts. Inflation
accelerated to 5½ percent in 2007, mainly reflecting international energy and food
price increases, and is projected to rise to about 6½ percent in 2008.
Public finances remained strong during FY 2007/08 and a primary surplus of
1½ percent of GDP was achieved, despite the 50 percent reduction of the excise tax
on fuel for electricity generation and the implementation of the first phase of the
income tax reform. The creditable revenue performance was driven by VAT
collection and import duties due to the surge in imports related to reconstruction. The
scale up in capital expenditure to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure was largely
financed by external grants, while the increase in primary current expenditure was
1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities.

compensated by the increase in revenue. In parallel with the maintenance of a
primary fiscal surplus, the public debt/GDP is estimated to have declined to
95 percent of GDP at the end of the fiscal year.
The real effective exchange rate continued to decline, partly reflecting weakness in
the U.S. dollar, and remains broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals,
despite a widening in the external current account deficit to 24 percent of GDP. The
increase in the external current account deficit reflects a surge in imports related to
post-hurricane reconstruction and a rising food and fuel import bill. Higher
government grant inflows, foreign direct investment and private capital inflows
facilitated the financing of the larger current account deficit.
The banking sector experienced robust growth in deposits while credit growth
slowed following the rapid expansion in 2006, resulting in an accumulation of net
foreign assets by commercial banks. The rapid growth in deposits, due in part to
higher family remittances, has boosted liquidity levels, and the banking system’s
profitability and overall asset quality have been maintained. Meanwhile, efforts are
being made to strengthen the regulatory and prudential framework for nonbank
financial institutions which are unevenly regulated.
The authorities continue to focus on improving the business climate and reducing the
cost of doing business to enhance competitiveness given the regional currency peg.
The creation of one-stop agencies for tourism and investment promotion and
simplification of business procedures have aided Dominica’s steady advancement in
world rankings in this area.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted the strong recovery of the economy from the damage caused by
Hurricane Dean, despite the weakening external environment and the negative
effects of rising international commodity prices, given Dominica’s high dependence
on imported food and fuel.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to implement sound
economic policies while addressing the challenges arising from the oil and food price
surge, and for their medium-term agenda focused on reducing vulnerabilities,
including the reduction of public debt ratios. They welcomed efforts to improve
existing mechanisms to better target assistance to the poor and to maintain the
flexible fuel pricing regime to help ease the adjustment of the economy to higher
international commodity prices.
Directors welcomed the government’s commitment to a medium-term primary
surplus target of 3 percent of GDP, consistent with the authorities’ strategy of
gradually reducing the public debt/GDP ratio. In the event of a deeper-than-expected
global slowdown, the authorities could consider contingent measures, such as a

3
more extended phasing-in of the planned income tax reform while maintaining the
integrity of the VAT. This would facilitate a return to the medium-term primary
surplus target, following a temporary easing of the fiscal stance to accommodate the
current commodity price shocks. They also recommended modification of the tax
incentive regime and broadening the income tax base to strengthen the tax system.
Directors supported saving the bulk of the concessional financing for fuel
consumption under the PetroCaribe initiative. They welcomed the setting up of an
investment fund and restricting the spending on social projects from this source to
the net return derived from the investment fund. Given the volatility associated with
recent scaled-up aid flows, Directors called on the donors to make their
disbursements more predictable, and encouraged the authorities to develop a
framework to smooth the associated spending. Directors supported the authorities’
intention to improve budget management.
Directors supported the authorities’ strengthening of the regulation and supervision
of nonbank financial institutions, and welcomed the recent introduction of the
Financial Services Act in the parliament. Directors encouraged the authorities to
quickly build capacity in the Financial Services Unit to regulate effectively nonbanks,
particularly credit unions and insurance companies.
Directors agreed that the overall level of external competitiveness is adequate. They
considered that the real exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium, in part reflecting the
EC dollar depreciation against the currencies of trading partners. Nevertheless,
Directors noted that the high external current account deficit poses risks that need to
be carefully monitored and accompanied by efforts in the fiscal area.
Directors concurred with the authorities’ focus on implementation of the structural
reforms envisaged in Dominica’s Growth and Social Protection Strategy. They also
agreed with the high priority given to efforts to reduce the cost of doing business,
including improving the efficiency of the energy sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
