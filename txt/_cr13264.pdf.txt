STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 24, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. After growing at a 7 percent average annual rate since 2010, the economy has
slowed since the third quarter of 2012 due to political and policy uncertainty,
government under-spending, and a weakening external environment. Over the last two
years, inflation has fallen steadily, while the real and nominal effective exchange rate
have both strengthened. Despite decreasing slightly, from more than 16 percent in 2010
to 15 percent in 2012, unemployment remains high. Last October’s parliamentary
elections saw the peaceful handover of power to a new government committed to
sustaining growth and making it more inclusive. However, cohabitation of the new
government with the President has proved challenging, and political tensions may have
weakened business confidence.
Policy response to the recent slowdown. In the short term, the government needs to
overcome recent budget under-spending and allow a higher budget deficit later this
year, to the extent that revenues are lower due to the slowdown. Further monetary
loosening, coupled with measures to strengthen the transmission mechanism, also
appears warranted. Political stability together with greater clarity on government policies
would also help reduce business uncertainty.
Medium-term outlook and challenges. Over the medium term, the main challenges
are to: sustain strong economic growth and making it more equitable; reduce the
current account deficit to secure external sustainability; improve further the NBG’s
inflation targeting regime and financial supervision; and improve social outcomes and
reduce poverty and inequality.
Policies to address these challenges. The authorities’ policy agenda includes structural
reforms (agricultural reform, universal healthcare system, free trade agreements, revised
labor code, investment funds, hydropower projects) aimed at boosting growth and
sharing its benefits. Fiscal consolidation will continue but with some redirection from
capital to social spending. The authorities agreed on the need for competitiveness
improvements but questioned the case for exchange rate adjustment, emphasizing
structural reforms instead.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Context
1.
Last October’s elections saw the first peaceful and democratic transfer of power in
Georgia’s recent history. 1 The new government is committed to sustaining Georgia’s rapid growth
and to strengthening the rule of law, transparency and social inclusion. However, substantial
differences between incoming Prime Minister Ivanishvili and President Saakashvili (who will leave
office in October) have increased political tensions, with some members of the former government
charged with offences. Despite this political uncertainty, the new government has a substantial
majority, and its ability to implement social and economic reforms has not been impeded.
2.
Over the last ten years, Georgia’s economy has grown rapidly (Table 1). Economic
growth averaged 6 percent from 2005-12 despite the global financial crisis and the 2008 conflict
with Russia. Growth was driven by private investment and domestic consumption and, on the supply
side, was supported by strong physical capital accumulation and total factor productivity (TFP) gains.
Growth was broad based, and particularly strong in manufacturing, construction, transport, and
financial services. However, agricultural output has continued to decline, reflecting lack of
investment and the impact of the 2006 Russian trade embargo.
3.
However, in sustaining this rapid growth, the previous government became
increasingly interventionist. On first taking office in 2004, the previous government embraced a
libertarian/free market approach, focused on improving the business environment and reducing
corruption. Some of its reforms, such as the fight against low-level corruption, police reform,
restoration of energy supply, and the overhaul of the tax system were fundamental to Georgia’s
emergence as a functioning state. Others, such as the very liberal labor code and the limited safety
net, were less balanced and left much of the population economically vulnerable. While the strategy
at first succeeded, private investment collapsed following the financial crisis and the 2008 conflict
with Russia and failed to fully recover afterwards. The government responded by increasing public
infrastructure investment, and then in 2011 by creating a Partnership Fund to catalyze private
investment through minority public co-financing.
4.
The benefits of Georgia’s rapid growth have not been widely shared (Figure 1).
From 2003 to 2012, employment fell by 5 percent, and unemployment remains high at 15 percent.
Half the labor force is in small-scale agriculture, mostly underemployed. The previous government
did create a rudimentary social safety net with: (i) public health insurance for means-tested eligible
households, old-age pensioners, and infants; (ii) flat public pensions for all retirees; and (iii) targeted
social assistance (TSA), which supports low-income households via direct transfers. However,
pensions remain below subsistence, half the population lacks health insurance, and there are no
1

The change in government and the time necessary to form a new economic team explain the slight delay in the
Article IV consultation.

unemployment benefits. Poverty is high, with more than 30 percent of the population living below
the US$2 poverty line in 2011, and has increased slightly in recent years. Inequality is among the
largest in the region, with a Gini coefficient above 0.4 (2010). Health and education outcomes are
mixed, with educational quality lower than comparator countries.
5.
Georgia’s rapid growth resulted in high current account deficits and significant
external indebtedness (Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3). Despite tourism receipts increasing to 9
percent of GDP and remittances to 4½ percent of GDP, the current account deficit has persisted at
around 11.5 percent of GDP from 2010 to 2012, one of the highest in the region. Georgia’s trade
deficit rose above 25 percent of GDP. With relatively low national savings, the investment needed to
support high growth was also financed by capital inflows. While initially mainly FDI, in the last
couple of years their composition shifted towards less stable sources of financing, including
Eurobond issuance and increases in nonresident deposits (now 15 percent of total deposits). Net
external liabilities have risen to close to 100 percent of GDP.
6.
Most of the 2011 Article IV consultation recommendations have been implemented.
Fiscal consolidation continued as envisaged, with streamlining of public investment creating fiscal
space for increased social expenditures. The 2011 Economic Liberty Act diluted the constitutional
referendum requirement for new taxes, preserving the government’s flexibility to address
unexpected developments. The NBG has made further progress improving its inflation forecasting
and modeling capacity. In view of their further increase, the NBG also adopted measures to contain
nonresident deposits. While the 2011 Article IV recommended more exchange rate flexibility, though
the nominal effective exchange rate has been volatile, the lari-dollar exchange rate has become
increasingly stable. The NBG has responded to higher-than-expected capital inflows by purchasing
foreign currency.

B. Recent Developments
7.
Since mid-2012 the economy has slowed (Figure 4). After growing at around 7 percent
from 2010 to the first half of 2012, the economy started to level off in the third quarter of 2012,
ahead of the October general elections. Growth fell to 2.7 percent y/y (-2 percent q/q seas. adj.) in
the fourth quarter of 2012 and then to 2.4 percent y/y (+0.2 percent q/q seas. adj.) in the first
quarter of 2013. On the demand side, causes seem to be weaker private investment (likely reflecting
increased business uncertainty) and lower government spending.
8.
Inflation has fallen over time and the recent deflation is partly explained by the
economic slowdown (Figure 5). Headline inflation has fallen well below the NBG’s 6 percent
medium-term inflation target and inflation volatility remains high. After rising to almost 15 percent
in May 2011 due to higher food prices, inflation has fallen steadily (to minus 1.7 percent in
April 2013). While the nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by 10 percent from end-2010 to
end-2012, the lari-dollar rate has been increasingly stable since March 2011, remaining within a
±1 percent band between July 2012 and mid-May 2013 (Figure 5). The sharp decrease in inflation
since May 2011 reflects lower food prices, lagged effects of exchange rate appreciation, cuts in
administered energy prices and, most recently, subdued domestic demand.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GEORGIA

9.
The NBG has loosened monetary policy in response, but with little effect on credit
growth (Tables 4 and 5, and Figures 5 and 6). The NBG cut its policy rate from 8 percent in
mid 2011 to 4.25 percent in May 2013. Commercial bank lari deposit rates have fallen more or less in
line, except during a short period at end-2012 when some small banks increased rates to attract
funds. Despite the cuts in the policy rate, lending rates have barely dropped and private credit
growth has declined from around 20 percent to 12–15 percent since October 2012. In addition to
weak monetary policy transmission, this seems to reflect lower credit demand and banks’ cautious
approach to lending in response to the slowdown. The NBG has increased its foreign currency
purchases, already buying US$335 million so far this year, which has helped resist appreciation
pressures and lowered the risk of further deflation.
10.
Unexpected fiscal tightening has added to the slowdown. Although revenues were lower
than projected in the first quarter (by about GEL 100 million, 0.4 percent of GDP), the government
ran a GEL 200 million surplus. The authorities emphasized this apparent tightening was
unintentional and reflected procedural delays due to stricter procurement procedures, financial
difficulties in some construction businesses, and savings from centralized purchases.

C. Policy Agenda
11.
The new government aims to share the benefits of economic growth more widely,
focusing on social protection, job creation, and agriculture. Labor Code revisions passed by
Parliament in June are expected to enhance workers’ rights, including job security, where previously
workers could be fired at will. To support agriculture, the government has increased allocations in
the 2013 budget and established an Agriculture Fund (privately funded, but from a foundation
owned by the Prime Minister). The government plans to reorganize the Partnership Fund and also a
private-equity Fund will be created to stimulate private investment.
12.
The new government is redirecting government spending away from capital spending
and towards social expenditures (Table 3). Public investment (averaging 8 percent of GDP over
the past 5 years) is one of the highest in the region while total social expenditure (pensions, health,
and education) has been among the lowest (11 percent of GDP). The government is spending an
additional GEL 800 million (3 percent of GDP) on an annualized basis to address high private health
care costs, low educational quality, and high rates of poverty and inequality. Reform plans include
introducing universal healthcare system, raising pensions, doubling TSA allowances and expanding
school vouchers (Box 1). Despite this increase in social expenditures, the authorities remain
committed to fiscal consolidation and to meeting the 30 percent limit on spending introduced by
the Economic Liberty Act from 2014 onward. While capital spending was reduced to meet these
objectives, it would remain above 6 percent of GDP, broadly in line with comparator countries.

individuals and costs about 1 percent of GDP. Since March 2013, emergency health care has been made
free of charge for in-patient and out-patient services. From July onwards, individuals previously not covered
by state insurance programs (about half Georgia’s population, including children above the age of 6 and
adults) will benefit from non-emergency services without having to contribute to the scheme. A newly
created Social Service Agency will negotiate rates and procedures and reimburse medical providers, which
patients can choose freely. Most medical services will have a substantial co-pay (still to be decided), which
could leave a market for existing private insurance companies. Under the basic scheme, most drugs will not
be covered, but could be added in the future, together with additional medical procedures. From May 2014
onwards, the Social Service Agency will cover individuals previously covered by state programs (socially
vulnerable, pensioners, children below 6) whose insurance was operated by private companies. While
substantial savings are expected from centralized purchases and negotiations, the reform plans are
estimated to add 1 percent of GDP per year to existing health costs, making health the largest reform area.
Pension increases will narrow the gap with the subsistence minimum. Old-age pensions, a flat basic
allowance that includes a GEL 15 health insurance premium, are being increased in two stages: to GEL 125 in
April and then to GEL 150 from September. The cost is around 0.8 percent of GDP. Disability pensions rise to
GEL 150 and GEL 100 depending on the severity of the disability, and pensions for victims of political
repression rise to GEL 100. Disability pensions and pensions for work related injuries are introduced
(0.2 percent of GDP). The authorities are working on a mandatory second pillar contribution scheme.
Targeted social assistance (TSA) allowances are being doubled. Georgia’s TSA currently covers around
10 percent of the population, identified by proxy means-testing. Monthly allowances will double: starting in
July, the first household member will receive GEL 60 (US$37) and GEL 48 (US$29) for each additional
household. This will cost
0.5 percent of annual GDP.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Against the background of the slowdown and the government’s ambition for rapid
and inclusive growth, discussions focused on: the size and causes of the current slowdown, and
the appropriate policy response; the main economic risks, including reducing the current account
deficit to ensure external sustainability; structural reforms for sustained medium-term growth;
improvements to the NBG’s inflation targeting regime and financial supervision; and the likely
success of the government’s reform initiatives in improving social outcomes.

A. Understanding and Ending the Slowdown

authorities and staff accepted that some slowdown

15.
In light of the recent slowdown, staff projects that growth this year could fall to
4 percent, substantially below potential. The staff’s projection assumes strong policy actions by
the authorities (described below), that boost growth to an annualized rate of around 9 percent (seas.
adj.) for the remainder of the year. In contrast, the Ministry of Finance expects a stronger
acceleration, based on government spending recovering, higher investment once the private-equity
funds are established, and opening of the Russian market. The Ministry was also concerned that
prematurely releasing lower growth projections (which they argued were subject to considerable
uncertainty) could weaken confidence.
16.
To support recovery, staff urged the authorities to reverse the shortfalls in
government spending and allow the automatic stabilizers to work. The authorities agreed and
were confident of executing most budget spending, as several large infrastructure projects had
already started in April. Due to the slowdown, revenues are expected to underperform this year by
around 1 percent of GDP. With inflation subdued and the current account deficit falling, the mission
argued for letting the automatic fiscal stabilizers operate. Lower revenues should only be partly
offset by lower government spending, so that the deficit target might need to be increased from
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

GEORGIA

2.8 to 3.3 percent of GDP. This would keep the structural deficit in line with First and Second Review
projections. The same principles would apply to 2014, should the slowdown last longer than
currently expected and carry over to next year. The authorities were confident that, even if revenue
proved lower than budgeted, they would be able to meet the existing deficit target through
spending cuts.
17.
The mission encouraged the NBG to consider further policy rate cuts, given the
slowdown and low inflation. While inflation is about 8 percentage points below the medium-term
target, the NBG explained that half this difference reflects supply shocks to which monetary policy
should not respond (Text Table 1). Staff noted that Taylor Rule calculations suggested further scope
for rate cuts (in light of the output gap and low inflation). However, the NBG argued that its models
predict inflation will soon pick up, which would call for future interest rate increases: cutting rates
now could create unnecessary fluctuations in the policy rate. In contrast, staff was concerned that if
recovery does not materialize, the present deflation and high real interest rates might be
unnecessarily prolonged. Staff encouraged the government and the NBG to assess the severity of
the slowdown, its likely permanence, and the government’s intended policy response, so that the
NBG could better judge whether more aggressive easing of monetary policy was warranted. 2

The mission welcomed the NBG’s attempts to improve monetary transmission by steps
to encourage long-term lari lending. In light of the steep yield curve, the NBG argued that
increasing long-term lari liquidity and lowering long rates was needed. While the mission believed
there was still a case for policy rate cuts, it agreed with the NBG’s proposal for the government to
issue treasury bills and deposit the proceeds long-term with commercial banks, to encourage longterm lari lending. The NBG’s initiative to encourage flexible rate lari lending by banks, through

easing of NBG collateral standards (but in a way that protects the NBG from credit risk), should also
help.
19.
To reduce business uncertainty, the mission encouraged the government to strengthen
communication of its policies and to announce them only once the main details have been
agreed. Businesses expressed concern over the proposed Labor Code revisions, and the difficult and
drawn-out consultation process, which weakened confidence. Details of the proposed US$3 billion
private investment fund are also unclear. To reduce uncertainty, the mission urged the government
to develop detailed information about the objectives, implementation, and timetable for new policy
initiatives before public announcements. Resolving uncertainty faced by companies perceived as
“close” to the previous government could also help.

B. Policies to Ensure External Sustainability and Reduce External Risks
20.
Discussions on the medium-term outlook focused on how to lower the current account
deficit and reduce external vulnerability without unduly sacrificing growth. Over the medium
term, structural reforms are projected to sustain investment, factor productivity, and return growth
to its potential of around 6 percent. Inflation would gradually realign with the NBG’s medium-term
target (5 percent for 2015), supported by continued improvements to the inflation targeting regime
and central bank independence. To ensure external sustainability, the current account deficit needs
to gradually decline to around 6 percent of GDP, which would lower the external debt ratio to
around 70 percent of GDP by 2017. In addition to structural reforms to improve competitiveness,
this will require continued fiscal consolidation. The authorities reiterated their commitment to
gradually reduce the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2017, consistent with a modest reduction
(¼-½ percent of GDP a year) of the primary structural balance from 2014–17.
21.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve competitiveness but questioned the
magnitude of the exchange rate overvaluation. Using the CGER methodology, with a 2012
current account deficit of almost 12 percent of GDP, staff estimates the exchange rate is
approximately 15 percent overvalued, so exchange rate adjustment will likely be needed (Box 2). The
NBG questioned the policy relevance of these estimates, given the substantial appreciation
pressures currently faced, and noted the wide uncertainty bands attached to them. The authorities
were reluctant to sacrifice Georgia’s strong growth for the sake of current account deficit reduction.
22.
The authorities argued that structural reforms would be more effective than real
depreciation in reducing the trade deficit. While expanding Georgia’s traditional exports (metals
and minerals) seems challenging, structural reforms could boost exports in agriculture, hydropower,
textile and other light processing sectors, and tourism. The authorities argued that agreement on
the EU FTA and introduction of the private investment funds could encourage FDI and improve the
financing of the current account. Staff agreed on the importance of these structural reforms, but
argued that exchange rate adjustment would likely still be needed given that these reforms are
difficult and take time to implement.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

GEORGIA

23.
The authorities believed the main domestic risks were well contained. The government
argued strongly that removal of the President’s power to dismiss and install a new government had
eliminated the main political risk. Notwithstanding October’s Presidential elections, the government
was confident the current political polarization would die down, which would encourage foreign
investment. The Ministry of Finance argued that procurement delays had been largely overcome, so
there was limited risk of a spending shortfall for the year.
24.
The authorities broadly agreed with the mission’s assessment of the main risks from
external spillovers. They agreed that a decline in capital inflows, which could be triggered by
higher interest rates in advanced economies or weaker growth in emerging markets, was the major
downside risk. Conversely, the authorities noted that intensification of capital inflows (for example, if
low world interest rates were to persist) was a significant medium-term risk, as it could delay the
necessary external adjustment and lead to higher external liabilities. In view of Georgia’s limited
economic and financial linkages to the EU, the authorities were less worried by possible recession in
Europe unless sufficiently deep to affect other countries in the region. They considered that a
slowdown in neighboring Turkey (through the trade channel) or Russia (through the remittances
channel) would have greater direct impacts. The authorities also viewed the opening of the Russian
market to Georgian products as a two-sided risk, depending on whether this was delayed, or took
place more quickly and for a broader range of goods than currently assumed. They agreed with the
mission that, if these risks were to materialize, in most cases the policy response would involve
exchange rate flexibility, acceleration of structural reforms, mobilization of financing from the IMF
and other development partners, along with assessing the scope for a moderate counter-cyclical
fiscal response.

GEORGIA

Box 2. Georgia: External Stability Assessment
Georgia’s large current account deficit and external indebtedness remain sources of external
vulnerability. Improving competitiveness and reducing financing vulnerabilities are critical to ensuring
external stability over the medium term.
Despite recent depreciation, using CGER methodologies staff estimates real exchange rate
overvaluation of around 15 percent:


The macro balance (MB) approach suggests a 15 percent real depreciation is needed to close the
gap between the underlying current account deficit (10.3 percent of GDP) and its norm
(6.8 percent of GDP). A relatively “healthy” NFL position (60 percent of GDP) is used for the CA norm
calculation.1 The underlying current account is the medium-term current account deficit without policy
actions or structural changes. The potential impact of structural reforms in reducing the underlying
current account deficit is not included, given uncertainty over their magnitude.



The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach points to a smaller overvaluation, of only
5 percent. Projected medium-term improvement in the terms of trade gradually reduces estimated
ERER overvaluation from 12 percent in 2012 to 5 percent in the medium term.



The external sustainability (ES) approach suggests a substantially higher overvaluation, of about
27 percent. This approach assumes that Georgia lowers its net foreign liabilities to a relatively “healthy”
level (60 percent of GDP), which gives a much lower current account norm of 4.2 percent of GDP.

However, the results are subject to large uncertainties and are sensitive to assumptions. The estimated
CA norm (in MB) and equilibrium REER (in ERER) are based on panel regressions, which may not fit for
Georgia given transition-related structural breaks. Based on empirical studies, an NFL position at 60 percent
of GDP is assumed sustainable: however, it is very hard to estimate a “sustainable” NFL position for Georgia.
Structural reforms that improve export competitiveness would reduce the need for exchange rate
adjustment. Georgia’s weak trade performance appears to reflect both price and quality competitiveness
issues. Asymmetric bilateral trade development with the main trading partners (EU and Turkey) explains a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

GEORGIA

Box 2. Georgia: External Stability Assessment (continued)
large part of the trade deficit worsening. Bilateral regressions show that exports and imports are strongly
linked to partner and domestic demand. In contrast, the real exchange rate seems to have a significant
impact only for imports, pointing to diversification and quality issues.
Recent deterioration in the quality of external financing raises concerns about potential vulnerability.
FDI used to be the main source of external financing, before 2012 accounting for more than 50 percent of
foreign inflows. However, in 2012 only one-third of capital inflows were FDI, with SOE Eurobonds and
increased nonresident deposits providing a large part of external financing. This decline reflects uncertainties
from the election and the political transition, but also more fundamental trends. About 20 percent of the FDI
during 2006–08 was privatization-related, which is unlikely to recur. In addition, returns to FDI don't seem
very high: an annual rate of return of around 7 percent from 2007–12, compared to a 9 percent average
dollar deposit rate. Restoring business confidence and further improving the business environment are
critical for FDI recovery. The NBG decision to increase liquidity requirements for nonresident deposits, which
will become effective later this year, should also help reduce financing vulnerability.
Net foreign liabilities remain high but have long maturity . Georgia’s NFL position has been around
100 percent of GDP since 2009, but more than 85 percent of this is in the form of FDI and long-term
concessional loans borrowed by the government. However, if financing quality keeps worsening and the
current account deficit stays high, the large net external liabilities will be difficult to sustain.
Strengthening the international reserve position could provide better protection. At end-2012, official
reserves were broadly adequate, equivalent to 102 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturity,
3.7 months of imports, or 144 percent using the IMF’s composite metric. However, reserves are expected to
decrease slightly in 2013–14 due to repayments to the Fund. More active reserve accumulation, as currently
being implemented by NBG, is recommended to address these concerns and is also consistent with the
finding of overvaluation.

C. Structural Reforms to Boost Growth and Competitiveness
25.
The authorities agreed on the importance of structural reforms if Georgia is to sustain
strong growth. Demographic trends point to a declining labor force, so economic growth will need
to rely on capital accumulation but especially TFP gains (around 3–4 percent annually), which will
hinge on the following structural reforms:






Vocational training to reduce skill mismatches. Reallocation of workers away from
subsistence agriculture to higher productivity sectors could generate large TFP increases, as
could increase agricultural productivity.
Enlarging market size by increasing the Georgian products’ competitiveness and improving
access to foreign markets, including through free trade agreements.
Encouraging private savings by developing local capital markets, creating contributory
pension systems and ensuring macro-economic stability.
Strengthening property rights through an independent judiciary that fairly enforces the rule
of law, and creation of a competition agency to combat domestic monopolies.

26.
To realize Georgia’s huge economic potential in energy, the mission (working with the
World Bank) encouraged the government to focus on establishing transparent and fair “rules
of the game” (Box 3). The mission questioned recent electricity tariff reductions (negotiated
directly with distributors) as these would seem to lower distribution company profitability (unless
there is some side-benefit) and could undermine future investment in the energy sector. The
authorities emphasized that the distribution companies had agreed with the tariff cuts; investment
in the sector would not be affected as there was no room for potential entrants in distribution. The
authorities agreed that publishing the contracts would help assuage the mission’s concerns but they
would need the companies’ consent to do so. With the World Bank, the mission encouraged the
economics ministries to develop an energy policy strategy that would strengthen the regulatory
framework, including how prices are set and rules for transmission line access. This would encourage
new hydropower investment (three proposed large projects have an estimated cost of around
15 percent of GDP) and could lessen the need for issuing government guarantees. While willing to
consider developing a strategy, the Ministry of Energy did not exclude the need to issue PPA
guarantees for strategic projects (such as Nenskra, which they consider vital to Georgia’s energy
independence).

22

GEORGIA

Box 3. Georgia: Electricity Sector
The hydropower sector is of significant macroeconomic importance in Georgia. Harnessing this domestic source of
cheap energy will be critical for sustaining high growth, reducing external energy dependence, and improving the
current account balance. This requires sector reforms and investment. If attracting private investment in large
hydro projects requires government-backed power purchase agreements, they need to be structured properly to
ensure sufficient risk transfer to the private sector and

Georgia has large hydropower resources. Water flow
patterns make hydropower generation seasonal. Summer
surpluses are exported to Russia or Turkey, while winter
shortfalls are covered by electricity from gas-based
thermal stations and imports. Hydro stations generate
about 75 percent of annual output while summer exports
offset winter imports.

imports unless matched by increased hydropower
capacity. Domestic consumption has outpaced production in recent years. Electricity imports have increased,
with Georgia becoming a net electricity importer in 2012 for the first time in almost a decade. Moreover, while
higher-cost gas-based generation increased, hydro generation fell. Reversing these trends, which have
contributed to a worsening of Georgia’s current account deficit, requires fuller utilization of its hydro potential.
-500

Higher prices and large summer demand make Turkey an attractive export market. The Turkish market,
where wholesale prices are more than 30 percent higher than in Georgia, is expected to grow rapidly, about
7 percent annually. The soon to be launched high-capacity power transmission line from Georgia to Turkey will
link the countries’ grids and could boost exports of Georgian electricity.
Hydropower generation costs are set to increase over time. The average generation cost in Georgia is
currently low thanks to the fully amortized old hydropower stations. The largest, the half-century old stateowned Enguri plant, accounts for 32 percent of total generation with a very low price of less than 1 US$ cent per
kWh. In comparison, electricity generated by new hydro stations would cost approximately 6 US$ cents per kWh.
While still internationally competitive, the average generation cost is expected to increase as the share of
electricity generated by the already amortized hydropower stations declines.
Recent tariff cuts may undermine investor interest in the sector. Tariffs were cut for low-end consumers in
January and again in April, by about 25 percent. To help distribution companies offset the cost, they were
allowed to purchase more of Enguri’s cheap electricity. While agreed with distributors, the cut in tariffs went
against the inevitable upward trend in the average generation cost. This could potentially undermine trust in the
regulatory framework and discourage investment.
The sector needs investment and reforms to meet domestic demand and tap export markets. The
electricity sector underwent serious reforms in the past decade. Its liberalization, especially unbundling and
privatization of key assets, led to significant improvements in performance: losses were reduced, payment
discipline strengthened, and the reliability of electricity supply improved. Further progress will depend on the
success of reforms to strengthen the regulatory framework, make price-setting transparent and clear, improve
access to the Turkish electricity market, and develop transparent rules for transmission line access.

27.
The mission urged the government to clarify the objectives of the various investment
funds it is establishing, and to align their governance with international best practice. The
authorities have hired an independent adviser to improve governance of the Partnership Fund,
which will retain its mandate of using minority financing to catalyze commercially viable projects.
The mission urged the authorities to clarify the objectives, governance structure and size of the
Agricultural Development Fund (which is expected to disburse around 0.8 percent of GDP in 2013),
and the Private Equity Fund (planned size US$3 billion or 20 percent of GDP). It was still not clear
what market imperfections the funds were addressing. The mission encouraged the authorities to
carefully design the governance of these funds, to ensure that projects sponsored by these funds
will not receive preferential treatment, and to avoid appearances of conflicts of interest. The
authorities indicated they would provide more information on these funds soon, and ensure they
follow best practice in terms of governance.
28.
The mission welcomed the government’s focus on agriculture but encouraged the
authorities to complement greater financial support with sector reforms. The government is
improving irrigation infrastructure and trying to complete the land registry. The Agriculture Fund has
distributed vouchers to small farmers to finance seed and fertilizer purchases. Though some
vouchers may have been misused and traded, and allegations of misspending by officials led to the
Agriculture Minister’s resignation, the result has been a doubling in the area of land under
cultivation. In cooperation with commercial banks, the Fund has developed interest-subsidy lending
schemes for farmers and for investment in agro-processing.
29.
Recent revisions to the Labor Code could make growth more inclusive. An election
commitment, the revised code requires employers to pay overtime, increases severance pay (to
1–2 month’s salary), strengthens workers’ rights to challenge employer’s decisions in courts,
prohibits firing without clear reasons for dismissal, and guarantees basic working conditions. These
changes may increase employer costs (unless overtime pay is offset by a reduction in the basic
hourly wage), but should help boost employee morale and productivity and bring labor regulations
closer to commitments under the prospective Association and DCFT agreements with EU. While, on
balance, welcoming the proposed Labor Code revisions, the mission noted that delays in drafting
and the changing government position on the content had added to business uncertainty.

D. New Government’s Social Policies
30.
The new government has ambitious plans to match better economic performance with
improved social outcomes. The mission discussed these plans with the authorities, given past
problems achieving inclusive growth, and because spending on these reforms form a large part of
the 2013 budget (an extra 3 percent of GDP).
31.
The mission welcomed the government’s plans to introduce universal healthcare
system (extra 1 percent of GDP cost in the 2013 budget) but cautioned on implementation
risks. While government health spending as a share of GDP is low in Georgia, total health spending
is quite high. The mission agreed the planned health care reform could help reduce Georgia’s very
high private health costs (and so reduce the risk of individual financial distress) and improve health
outcomes. However, the proposed reforms would still leave sizeable co-payments for drugs and left
the future role for private insurers unclear. The authorities acknowledged that the speed of reform
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GEORGIA

could create implementation risks, in particular at the outset, and were cooperating closely with the
World Bank and WHO to overcome these. The authorities expected the Social Service Agency would
achieve major cost savings through centralized procedures and better control of medical services.
32.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ plans to improve educational quality and
vocational training. The government plans major reforms to address skills mismatches (promoting
tertiary education in mathematics and financing new science faculties) and lack of skills, for instance
in agriculture. The government has recently made pre-school free, but low quality and bad
infrastructure means enrollment has been poor. Teacher salaries have been increased by GEL 60–205
per month (depending on performance) to an average of GEL 413 (US$250) per month, according to
the World Bank.
33.
Because they are universal rather than targeted, proposed increases in social
expenditures might be less effective in reducing inequality. Staff acknowledged the planned
reforms and spending increases should improve health, education, and – to some extent – poverty
outcomes. However, 80 percent of the new spending is on universal transfers and so may have
limited effects on inequality. New health insurance should benefit the (lower) middle classes most,
as socially vulnerable households are already covered. Pension increases are completely universal
given the flat benefit and no contribution scheme. Instead of doubling the monthly TSA allowance,
the mission and the World Bank would have recommended broadening coverage (30 percent of the
population still lives below the US$2 poverty line). To lower inequality, the mission suggested
complementing these measures with revenue reforms – for example, by making personal income tax
more progressive.

E. Monetary and Financial Sector Reform
34.
The NBG continues to improve monetary operations and Georgia’s inflation targeting
framework. Improvements in monetary operations have seen interbank, NBG CD, and Treasury
rates more closely aligned with the policy rate over the last two years. The mission welcomed the
NBG’s efforts to improve its forecasting capabilities and to increase transparency by strengthening
its communication strategy with an upgraded inflation report and press conferences that discuss
economic forecasts and monetary policy performance. The mission recommended these events
follow a pre-announced schedule, to improve transparency and accountability, and strongly stressed
the importance of preserving the independence of the NBG.
35.
Despite these improvements, the mission also discussed possible further refinements

introduction of floating-rate lari loans by banks, and the authorities’ goal of developing the
corporate bond market and the stock market.
Despite price deflation, both sides agreed there was little benefit to lowering the inflation
target. For the medium term, staff concurred with the authorities that a relatively high target
for headline inflation might need to be retained given Balassa-Samuelson effects plus the
difficulty of hitting any specific point target given Georgia’s inflation volatility and
weaknesses in the transmission mechanism.
Despite recent stability against the dollar, the NBG reiterated its commitment to a floating
exchange rate. The mission agreed that recent foreign exchange purchases help address the
need to build reserves, resist overvaluation pressures, and avoid further deflation. The true
test would come were the lari to face depreciating pressures.

36.
The NBG reports that the financial system continues to retain comfortable levels of
capital and liquidity (Table 6 and Figure 6). As of April, the system’s capital adequacy ratio (NBG
measure) was 18 percent and the liquidity ratio 41 percent, both comfortably above minimum
requirements (of 12 and 30 percent). Even though NPLs increased at end-2012, banking sector
profitability has been stable so far in 2013, which the NBG argued was due to banks provisioning for
these ahead of time. Moreover, the NBG explained that the increase in NPLs reflected idiosyncratic
events affecting corporate loans and do not pose financial stability risks given buffers and profits in
the banking sector.
37.
The mission stressed the risks arising from nonresident deposits, which have become a
significant source of funding for banks. Dollarization, at around two-thirds of loans and deposits,
continues to pose the main risk to the financial sector. The NBG noted that an increasing fraction of
the nonresident deposits were only withdrawable at maturity. New supervisory measures (the endJune 2013 new liquidity requirement for nonresident deposits; liquidity coverage ratio adoption,
with assumed higher outflow rates for FX deposits than without taking into account currency
denomination by end-2013; and capital add-ons for FX lending risks in 2013 stress tests) should help
discourage nonresident deposits and dollarization. Staff supported the NBG’s vision to further
deepen the financial sector by developing the local corporate bond and stock markets, for which
pension reform would be helpful. These measures, together with maintaining financial sector
stability, could also help encourage private savings.
38.
The NBG has completed a self-assessment of its banking supervision framework and
will share it with staff in the coming weeks. The mission discussed with the NBG and its ADB
consultant its current transition to risk-based supervision. The NBG is currently fine tuning the
process of submission and review of bank ICAAP forms to better monitor banks’ risk analysis. The
mission expressed concern over the removal of insurance supervision from the NBG, but also over
delays in establishing a new insurance supervisory body. To maintain the quality of NBG supervision,
staff stressed the importance of maintaining competitive salaries. Staff noted the authorities’ request
for an FSAP, and hoped that it could start in the coming year.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Georgia’s economic performance has continued to be strong, despite a recent
slowdown. Real GDP growth averaged 6½ percent in 2011–12, about 1½ percentage points more
than projected at the 2011 Article IV consultation. Unemployment has fallen slightly, from more than
16 percent in 2010 to 15 percent in 2012, but remains high. Inflation has fallen steadily, reflecting
lower food prices, lagged effects of the appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate, and
cuts in administered energy prices. The exchange rate has faced appreciation pressures but has
been kept stable against the US dollar. However, political uncertainty in the run up to the
October 2012 elections, policy uncertainty, government under-spending after the elections, and a
lackluster global environment have contributed to a marked economic slowdown and the
persistence of inflation well below its medium-term target.
40.
Georgia needs to overcome a number of challenges to continue this strong
performance. In addition to making sure the recent slowdown proves only a temporary pause,
these include the need to sustain strong growth while making it more inclusive, reduce the current
account deficit to levels consistent with external sustainability, and address structural weaknesses,
including in terms of governance and rule of law.
41.
Reluctance to recognize that growth in 2013 may be lower than expected has delayed
consideration of the causes of the slowdown and the appropriate policy response. This delay
could prove costly if the slowdown turns out to be more protracted than the authorities have
expected. Earlier acknowledgement that growth may be lower, together with policy measures, would
enhance the government‘s credibility, increase business confidence, and help support growth.
42.
In the short term, more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies are needed to
support recovery. The government needs to address the causes of recent budget under-spending,
to make sure spending recovers later in the year. Given the fall in inflation and the current account
deficit, there could be scope for allowing a higher budget deficit in the near term, to the extent that
revenues are lower due to the slowdown. Further monetary loosening also appears warranted,
accompanied by measures to strengthen the transmission mechanism, including issuing treasury
bills and depositing the proceeds long-term with commercial banks, to encourage longer-term lari
lending.
43.
Greater clarity and improved communication of economic policies can reduce business
uncertainty. While many of the goals of the new government’s reforms are welcome, insufficient
detail on major policy initiatives has increased uncertainty. Combined with political tensions, this has
deterred private investment, adding to the economic slowdown. The adoption of the Labor Code
revisions removes one of the key sources of investor uncertainty, while striking a better balance
between the interests of employers and employees, to improve welfare and enhance productivity.
The government should also clarify the role and improve the governance of the different investment
funds it intends to establish, as well as the barriers to investment they are designed to overcome.

44.
Greater cooperation between the government and the central bank is also essential for
recovery. The NBG’s moves towards greater transparency, by improving the inflation report and
launching regular meetings to explain inflation developments and reasons behind interest rate
decisions, are welcome. However, further cooperation between the NBG and the Ministry of Finance,
in a way that preserves central bank independence, would make it easier to discuss the slowdown,
and to devise a coordinated monetary and fiscal policy response for recovery.
45.
Over the medium term, Georgia’s main macroeconomic challenge remains to gradually
reduce its current account deficit and foreign indebtedness. Though welcome, the recent decline
in the current account appears largely cyclical. To ensure external sustainability, and to strengthen
the economy’s resilience to external shocks, the government should aim to gradually lower the
current account deficit to around 6 percent of GDP in the medium term through continued fiscal
consolidation, higher private saving (through pension reform and deepening of local financial
markets), exchange rate adjustment, and structural reforms to improve competitiveness. Continuing
reserve accumulation is recommended given the exchange rate overvaluation. The authorities also
need to continue to take steps to reduce dollarization, both through regulatory measures and, more
permanently, by improving Georgia’s economic and political fundamentals.
46.
The government’s agenda of more inclusive growth is welcome, but increased social
expenditures might have been better targeted. Substantial increases in social and agricultural
spending should help address Georgia’s problems of relatively high poverty, inequality, and
unemployment. However, rapid introduction of universal healthcare system may run into
implementation delays, and does not seem to address the problem of high drug costs, a main cause
of risk and impoverishment. In line with World Bank recommendations, coverage of targeted social
assistance might also have been broadened.
47.
The authorities’ commitment to tackle structural impediments to growth is welcome.
Addressing skill mismatches, opening up foreign markets to Georgian products and improving their
competitiveness, strengthening property rights and the rule of law, and promoting competition
should build on the previous government’s record in improving the business environment and
fighting low level corruption. In the energy sector, the government should aim at establishing
transparent and fair rules, monitored by an independent regulator. This would lessen the need to
provide investors with guarantees.
48.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
September 28, 2010 Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles, as amended.

1/ Public sector debt includes general government debt and liabilities of NBG to IMF, and it does not include SOE's debt. It is reported on a gross basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ The external debt does not include inter-company loans.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Safeguard Assessments
An update of the January 2010 safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) was
completed in September 2011. The NBG continues to publish financial statements that comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards, and are externally audited by an international firm in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing. In response to the safeguards assessment
of 2010, the authorities implemented recommendations including the appointment of an external
audit firm for a multi year term beginning with financial year 2010.
Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
Not applicable.
Implementation of HIPC Initiative
Not applicable.
Exchange Arrangements
The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. In line with the official policy, NBG has
remained committed to improving functioning of the foreign exchange market and enhancing
exchange rate flexibility since the introduction in March 2009 of multiple-price foreign exchange
auctions. While the NBG intervenes in the foreign exchange market through the FX auctions, the NBG
does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. In
the first half of 2012, the FX purchase auctions moderated with a cumulative volume of USD 75 million.
However, since July 2012, the NBG has intensified the FX auctions both in volume and frequency and
has been active on both sides of the market, with total purchases of USD 340 million and total sales of
USD 65 million through April 2013. FX purchase auctions have been directed toward rebuilding foreign
exchange reserves; an objective of the authorities’ economic program that is supported by the IMF
SBA/SCF arrangement. With respect to intervention data, the volume sold at NBG’s FX auctions and
the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website immediately after each auction. Based on
these data, most of the activity took place since December 2012, coinciding with increased
appreciation pressures on the lari. Although FX interventions account for a small portion of annual
foreign exchange market turnover, the size of these interventions on any given day is substantial. Since
July 2012, the lari has remained stable against the U.S. dollar in a 2% band. Market supply and demand
play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the
exchange rate and the discretionary nature of the FX auctions. Therefore, as of end-April 2013, the de
facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement against the
U.S. dollar from floating, effective July 1, 2012.
The government uses the official exchange rate for budget and tax accounting purposes as well as for
all payments between the government and enterprises and other legal entities and for foreign
exchange transactions with the NBG. The official rate is defined as the average of the previous day’s
market transaction rates, and may thus differ by more than two percent from the freely determined

market rate, which had caused a multiple currency practice in the past. However, in March 2013, an
amendment was introduced to the 2010 agreement between the NBG and Treasury Service of the
Ministry of Finance on the Participation in the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System that
eliminates Georgia’s multiple currency practice. The 2013 amendment insures that foreign exchange
transactions between the government and the NBG are priced with the market exchange rate of the
day when the foreign exchange order is submitted to NBG.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of June 2013)
Since 1994, the EBRD has been active in supporting Georgia’s transformation toward a market
economy. The bank’s current country strategy for Georgia, approved in February 2010, outlines the
following main strategic directions:


Supporting stabilization and restructuring of the financial sector, strengthening risk and
portfolio management practices and increasing the share of local currency operations;



Helping rehabilitate and modernize the country’s road, energy and municipal infrastructure to
strengthen energy security and promote energy efficiency, help Georgia benefit from its
potential as a transit country, and improve efficiency and long-term financial sustainability of its
municipal services;



Provide financing to the enterprise sector with the view of supporting innovation, competition
and export potential, in particular in manufacturing and agribusiness.

As of end-May 2013, the bank signed 155 investments in Georgia with the cumulative commitment
totaling €1.8 billion. Its outstanding portfolio stood at €604 million. Almost one half of the portfolio
is in the financial sector, followed by the energy and infrastructure sectors with one fifth each and
corporate sector accounting for 13 percent. The ratio of private sector projects in the portfolio
currently stands at around 80 percent. The bank gives preference to non-sovereign operations.
Where sovereign guarantees are required, donor co-funding on a grant basis is sought.
Banks overall investment in 2012 reached €97 million with 13 projects. It was active in continuing to
support the agribusiness sector directly and through provision of credit lines to local partner banks.
The Georgian Agriculture Financing Facility (GAFF), a €40 million framework launched in 2011, made
credit lines available to local commercial banks, nonbank microfinance institutions and leasing
companies for on-lending to farmers and other agricultural entities. Additional credit lines were
extended to Bank of Georgia, VTB Bank Georgia, Bank Republic and TBC Bank, most of them were
provided in lari. The bank has also supported the enterprise sector by investing €18.2 million across
various industries.
With the Bank’s assistance, Georgia has become an electricity exporting country. The Bank played a
critical role in strengthening access to the international market through financing of the Black Sea
Transmission line, which is expected to be operational by end-2013. The Bank has been actively
pursuing viable small, medium and large renewable energy projects. The Bank has financed
Paravani, the first Independent Power Producer (IPP) in the hydroelectricity sector. In 2011, the Bank
extended USD 52 million debt financing and invested USD 5 million as equity in the company while
USD 23 million has been syndicated as a B-loan and IFC co-invested as a lender. The project is
expected to deliver energy to Turkey for nine months per year.

Georgia is part of the EBRD’s ‘Early Transition Countries’ (ETC) initiative. Launched in April 2004, the
initiative aims to increase investments in the bank’s then seven poorest countries. The initiative
builds on international efforts to address poverty in these countries. Through this initiative, the EBRD
focuses its efforts on private sector business development and selected public sector interventions.
It aims to stimulate market activity by using a streamlined approach to financing, focusing on
smaller projects, mobilizing more investment, and encouraging ongoing economic reform. The bank
accepts higher risk in the projects it finances in the ETCs, while respecting the principles of sound
banking. Since the launch of the ETC initiative, the bank’s annual business volume in Georgia has
increased five-fold.
The bank’s country strategy for the period of 2013–15 is currently under preparation and expected
to be approved in July 2013. It is expected to focus the bank on fostering private investments,
completing the restructuring and modernization of the energy sector, supporting Georgia’s
transformation into a regional economic hub, and promoting broad-based growth.
Going forward, the EBRD will also:


Continue to support the authorities’ goal of developing local capital market and reducing
dollarization by providing synthetic local currency loans and offering technical cooperation and
policy advice, particularly in the legal and regulatory area and on debt and equity capital market
infrastructure. The bank is actively engaged in promoting local currency lending and dedollarization of the Georgian banking system in cooperation with other IFIs. Georgia was one of
the first countries to undergo a joint EBRD-IMF-World Bank assessment of the economic policy,
regulatory and legal frameworks for development of the local currency capital markets, and sign
a framework agreement with the authorities on policy reforms required to support dedollarization.



Actively pursue viable renewable energy projects, while promoting energy efficiency across the
country and leading policy dialogue on improving the regulatory framework for energy
efficiency and renewable energy.



Invest in the development of the agribusiness sector and modernization of the food distribution
sector supported by intensive policy dialogue.



Support policy and regulatory developments in Georgia by providing further legal transition
assistance, including improvements to the laws on secured transactions and insolvency, reform
of concession laws, improved corporate governance, and judiciary reforms.



Maintain dialogue with the government to ensure fair and transparent implementation of tax
policies and audits as well as the independence of the judiciary in dealings with businesses.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There is some room
for improving the compilation and dissemination of price, national accounts, and external sector
statistics. Insufficient price and economic activity indicators to assess underlying inflation and output
trends partly hamper the development of an effective inflation targeting framework. To support the
authorities’ effort to improve the compilation of macroeconomic statistics, the Fund has provided a
significant amount of technical assistance (TA) (Annex I, Table1.) The data module of the Report on
the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), prepared in October 2011, indicated that since the
previous 2002 ROSC, the authorities have made significant institutional and methodological
improvements in macroeconomic statistics. Georgia graduated to the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on May 17, 2010, after participating in GDDS since 2006.

A. Real Sector Statistics
National accounts statistics follow the concepts and definitions of the System of National
Accounts 1993. Annual and quarterly GDP estimates are compiled by both the production and
expenditure approaches. Preliminary national accounts estimates are available after 85 days and
final estimates after 13 months. The 2011 data ROSC mission found serious source data deficiencies
owing to: absence of an economic census; under-reporting in the business survey and household
budget survey; shortcomings in the business register; and incomplete coverage of some activities
(trade, other community, social and personal activities). Also, a better method could be used to
benchmark quarterly national accounts (QNA) data to annual estimates. Volume measures of GDP
by the expenditure approach are not compiled. During the national accounts TA mission in
January 2013, actions on several issues were either initiated or partly implemented (benchmarking of
QNA in current and constant prices, new methodology for estimating volume of taxes on products,
compilation of unit values for imports). Although the authorities have made good progress in
addressing some of these issues, there was scope for improving the constant price estimates and
advancing the development of the system of supply and use tables.
On price statistics, the scope of the consumer price index (CPI) is limited to only urban areas while
the treatment of owner-occupied housing is conceptually imprecise. The structure of producer price
index (PPI) relies on turnover rather than output concept while product based PPIs are not compiled.
The export and import price indices are not compiled. Despite important progress achieved in the
development of agricultural price indices, inadequate funding was causing delays in
implementation. The accuracy of the CPI and PPI weights, with respect to actual household
consumption and market turnover, suffers from the same HBS and business register shortcomings
as the national accounts. The imputation methods for both CPI and PPI, while recently improved,
need to be enhanced to ensure coherent long-term treatment of seasonal goods.

B. Monetary and Financial Statistics
The NBG compiles monetary data broadly in line with the recommendations of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual 2000. Data are compiled based on STA’s Standardized Report Forms and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

GEORGIA

reported to STA on a regular and timely basis for publication in the International Financial Statistics
(IFS).

C. Government Finance Statistics
The Ministry of Finance is well advanced on a program of reform to their central and local
government budget and accounting systems to fully adopt the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards
(IPSASs), including the staged introduction of accrual recording into transactions data, and an
expansion in the range of items recorded in the balance sheet. The reform includes the
implementation of accrual accounting by 2020. The authorities’ commitment to the accounting
reform strategy is set out in Decree 101 issued by the Minister of Finance on
February 10, 2006. This decree approves the general strategy, but implementation of some of the
individual steps in the transition plan will require amendments to the law of Georgia on the budget
system (Budget System Law). Since 2008, the budget classification follows the GFSM 2001. However,
there are deficiencies in the sectorization of Legal Entities of Public Law (LEPLs) and securities are
not recorded at market value. The authorities report annual and monthly government finance
statistics (GFS) compiled on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 framework for publication in the GFS
Yearbook and IFS, respectively.

D. External Sector Statistics
The NBG began to take the responsibility in the compilation of balance of payments statistics in
January 2007. It received extensive technical assistance from STA, including the STA Resident
Statistics Advisor who, stationed in Baku, undertook six peripatetic TA missions to Georgia during
April 2007–October 2008.
Balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the definitions set out in the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) and elements of the sixth edition (BPM6). The
scope of the balance of payments statistics includes transactions of institutional units resident in
Georgia with the rest of the world. However, data do not cover the territories of Abkhazian
Autonomous Republic and Tskhinvali Region, a part of Georgian territory not controlled by the
central authorities. Source data used for compiling the balance of payments are generally adequate
and timely. However, the accuracy of the data received from the enterprises survey should be
improved. Moreover, foreign direct investment (FDI) data are subject to significant revisions and the
classification of some inflows as FDI (rather than other capital flows) has been the subject of
prolonged debates between the statistical office and the NBG. Some data sources for balance of
payments need strengthening, notably the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) and
the private nonfinancial external debt compilation program. For the balance of payments, statistical
techniques are adequate, except for the estimation of import and export of cars which should be
further improved.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 23, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Georgia
On July 10, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Georgia.1
Last October’s general elections saw the peaceful and democratic transfer of power to a new
government, for the first time in Georgia’s recent history. These elections also marked the start of a
period of cohabitation between the new government, led by Prime Minister Ivanishvili, and President
Saakashvili, who will leave office after the October 2013 presidential election. Georgia’s economic
performance continues to be strong, despite a recent slowdown. Real GDP growth averaged
6½ percent in 2011–12, about 1½ percentage points more than projected at the 2011 Article IV
consultation. Inflation has declined steadily, reflecting lower food prices, lagged effects of exchange
rate appreciation, and cuts in administered energy prices. The exchange rate has faced appreciation
pressures, but has been kept stable against the U.S. dollar. However, the economy has slowed down
markedly since mid-2012 and unemployment remains high at 15 percent, with half of the labor force
in small-scale agriculture.
Georgia’s current account deficit and external indebtedness remain high. Despite tourism receipts
increasing to 9 percent of GDP and remittances to 4½ percent of GDP, the current account deficit has
persisted at around 11½ percent of GDP from 2010 to 2012, one of the highest in the region.
Georgia’s trade deficit rose to more than 25 percent of GDP, owing to increased imports of
machinery, transport equipment, and manufactures. Georgia’s high current account deficits reflect
low national savings relative to the investment needed to support high growth. The current account
deficits have been financed by capital inflows. While initially these inflows were mainly foreign
direct investments, in recent years their composition has shifted towards less stable sources of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An
explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2

financing, including Eurobond issuance and increases in nonresident deposits (now 15 percent of
total deposits). These inflows have contributed to keeping net external liabilities close to
100 percent of GDP.
Fiscal consolidation has continued, with the fiscal deficit declining from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2010
to 3.0 percent in 2012, reflecting higher tax revenues and lower current expenditures. The 2013
budget law aims at reducing the deficit to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013, with greater emphasis on
social expenditure, while maintaining critical capital spending. Although the economic slowdown
meant revenues were lower than projected in the first quarter of 2013, the government’s overall
balance was higher than expected due to procedural delays in government spending.
In response to the sharp decline in inflation and more recently to the economic slowdown, the
National Bank of Georgia (NBG) has loosened its monetary stance. It cut its policy rate from
8 percent in mid-2011 to 4 percent in June 2013. While, at least until recently, commercial bank lari
deposit rates have fallen more or less in line, lending rates have decreased less, suggesting some
room for strengthening monetary policy transmission. The NBG has increased its foreign currency
purchases, already buying US$335 million so far this year, which has helped resist appreciation
pressures and the risk of further deflation. Despite looser monetary policy, private credit growth has
declined from around 20 percent to 12–15 percent since October 2012.
Despite the slowdown, growth could still reach 4 percent in 2013, rising to around 6 percent in 2014
and beyond, while inflation would gradually realign with NBG’s medium-term target
(5 percent for 2015), provided the authorities take strong policy action.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that heightened domestic uncertainty, government underspending, and a
difficult external environment have contributed to a marked economic slowdown. Against this
background, Directors encouraged Georgia’s policymakers to recalibrate policies to revive economic
activity, accelerate job creation, and promote lasting and equitable growth.
Directors generally concurred that supportive fiscal and monetary policies are needed in the near
term. They encouraged the government to address the causes of recent budget underspending and to
allow a higher budget deficit if revenues are undercut by the slowdown. Most Directors agreed that
further monetary easing is necessary at present and that it should be supported by measures to
strengthen policy transmission.
Directors noted that the financial system appears sound, with comfortable levels of capital and
liquidity in banks. They supported steps underway to discourage foreign-currency lending and

3

deposits, including those held by nonresidents, which pose risks to the system and undermine the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to participate again in
the Financial Stability Assessment Program.
Directors considered that improved communication of economic policies would help reduce business
uncertainty and stimulate private investment. In particular, they welcomed the greater transparency of
the inflation targeting framework and encouraged the government to clarify the role and governance
of the investment funds it intends to establish. Directors also noted that greater coordination between
the government and the central bank, while preserving central bank independence, would improve the
overall policy response.
Directors agreed that a critical medium-term priority is to bolster external stability by reducing the
current account deficit in relation to GDP. This will require continued fiscal consolidation, higher
private saving, exchange rate adjustment, and structural reforms to improve competitiveness.
Welcoming the authorities’ focus on inclusive growth, Directors supported their efforts to strengthen
and appropriately target social programs. They endorsed the authorities’ plans to lift potential growth
by addressing skill mismatches, promoting trade and competition, and boosting property rights and
the rule of law. Directors also encouraged the government to upgrade the regulatory framework for
the energy sector and safeguard the independence of the regulator.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Georgia and Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov,
Advisor to the Executive Director
July 10, 2013
The Georgian authorities would like to thank the Fund team for fruitful discussions during
the mission visit. They broadly agree with staff’s assessment of the main risks facing the
Georgian economy, especially those related to vulnerabilities stemming from external
spillovers. The authorities continue to attach great importance to making use of Fund advice.
They have implemented most of the recommendations from the 2011 Article IV consultation,
including in public financial management, monetary policy and ensuring financial stability.
The authorities value the sustained support they receive in the process of transformation and
modernization of the Georgian economy.
Following the first peaceful democratic transfer of power in recent history, the authorities are
strongly committed to sustaining rapid economic growth, and making it more socially
inclusive and broad-based. Strengthened social protection, further support of private
initiatives through the establishment of investment funds, and focus on modernizing the
agricultural sector are high on the authorities’ policy agenda. At the same time, they are
committed to preserving fiscal sustainability, pursuing prudent monetary and exchange rate
policies, maintaining financial stability, and reducing vulnerabilities in the external position.
Fiscal policy
The authorities remain committed to meeting the fiscal consolidation targets, while
reprioritizing government expenditure toward social spending and maintaining key
infrastructure projects. To make growth more inclusive the government aims at redirecting
public spending from capital investment, which as a share of GDP is one of the highest in the
region, to social expenditures, which is one of the lowest among peers.
The authorities are committed to gradually reducing the fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP
by 2017, implying a modest annual reduction of the primary structural balance by ¼ to ½
percent of GDP over the period 2014-2017. The authorities emphasize that the underexecution of the budget this year is mainly due to temporary factors related to the public
procurement procedures. This underspending is expected to disappear.
A universal health care system is being introduced. Targeted social assistance allowances
will be doubled. The government will increase investment in the quality of education. This
being said, capital spending is expected to stay above 6 percent of GDP, comparable with
regional peer countries. In order to support agriculture, an Agriculture Fund has been
established and the government has increased budget allocations to support this sector.

2
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Since November 2012 the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) has gradually cut its policy rate
from 5.5 to 4 percent in June 2013, in line with staff advice. This gradual easing of monetary
policy has been implemented in response to persistent deflationary pressures and some signs
of slowing economic activity. Nonetheless, the authorities remain cautious in light of some
indications that inflation might soon pick up with a rebound in economic growth.
The NBG has continued to improve its inflation targeting framework, increased transparency,
promoted initiatives to strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and
encouraged steps leading to further de-dollarization. The NBG has also continued to improve
its forecasting capacities and promote transparency by strengthening its communications
strategy with the introduction of an upgraded inflation report that better explains monetary
policy performance and deviations from established inflation targets.
The NBG aims at further strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism by
encouraging long-term lari lending and floating-rate lari lending by domestic banks. In
particular, together with the Ministry of Finance they are considering depositing long-term
the proceeds from new treasury bills with commercial banks in order to stimulate further
long-term lari lending. The NBG also aims at supporting floating-rate lending by easing
collateral standards. These measures should also help fulfill the authorities’ goal of further
developing the domestic corporate bond and equity market.
The central bank has resisted appreciation pressures with significant foreign exchange
purchases that have helped further build up reserves. Because of large uncertainties and
specific assumptions included in the staff’s methodology, the authorities are not fully
convinced about the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is overvalued. The authorities
reiterate their commitment in principle to a floating exchange rate regime. They emphasize
that improved cooperation between the NBG and the government is helpful and that the
institutional independence of the central bank strengthens the credibility and effectiveness of
monetary policy.
Financial system
The financial system remains profitable, adequately capitalized, and liquid. The capital
adequacy ratio further increased to 26.4 percent according to the Basel definition. Liquid
assets, excluding short-term loans, account for 28.1 percent of total assets and 51.2 percent of
client deposits. While nonperforming loans increased recently, from 3.7 percent to 4.5
percent according to the standard 90-day overdue definition, the authorities do not expect that
this small rise represents a risk for financial stability or profitability of the banking sector.

3
The authorities are fully aware of the potential risks related to recent increases in nonresident
deposits and the high level of dollarization. They continue to undertake appropriate measures
to contain these risks. In particular, new supervisory measures have tightened the liquidity
requirement for nonresident deposits. The new liquidity coverage ratio assumes higher
outflow rates for FX deposits than what it would be without taking into account currency
denomination. Together with capital add-ons for FX lending risks, these prudential measures
are expected to discourage nonresident deposits and FX lending. The NBG’s actions to
stimulate long-term and floating-rate lari lending should also help in containing risks.
The NBG has recently developed a framework for monitoring systemically important banks.
The NBG also continues to closely monitor developments in the banking system. A Basel III
draft framework has been developed and major banks are reporting Basel III capital
adequacy ratios on a monthly basis for monitoring purposes. The banks have already shown
substantial progress in submitting their first ICAAPs. The authorities have asked the Fund to
conduct an FSAP.
Structural reforms
Georgia’s current account position makes implementing a strategy to decisively improve
external competitiveness a key priority. Rather than relying on nominal exchange rate
depreciation, the government is determined to implement a broad array of structural reforms
to improve productivity and competitiveness. Making progress towards the completion of a
deep and comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU is a priority.
The revised Labor code, which has been passed by Parliament in June 2013, incorporates
comments from businesses and assures a better balance between the interests of employers
and employees to improve welfare and enhance productivity. Georgia’s competitiveness in
manufacturing will be upgraded by improving education quality in general and vocational
training to reduce skill-mismatches in particular. Investment funds with significant resources
will actively promote foreign direct investment in Georgia. The agriculture sector has
comparative advantages, particularly if its capital base and infrastructure can be improved.
The government’s policy will aim at higher productivity for the agriculture sector.
The Universal Health Care (UHC) reform was designed and launched in close consultation
with all stakeholders concerned, including the WHO, the World Bank and private insurance
companies. The program was designed based on the evidence from the Catastrophic Health
Expenditure and Utilization Survey (2010) to tackle the lead causes of impoverishment due
to healthcare related costs (hospitalization, chronic diseases and acute conditions) and to
reduce inequalities due to health conditions. Drug co-payments are already in place under
disease-specific programs (e.g. diabetes) and ongoing for emergency, oncology and
maternity services and will be expanded upon creation of stronger regulations for drug

4
utilization control. Concerns about social spending will be adequately addressed within
ongoing and planned reforms.
Hydro power sector development in particular has good prospects. To attract foreign
investment in this sector and promote regional trading, the regulatory framework will be
enhanced in cooperation with the World Bank. Developing domestic capital markets and
creating a contributory pension system will facilitate the allocation of capital from savers to
investors. Lastly, a vibrant economy, based on investment and employment creation, requires
the enforcement of the rule of law and strengthening of property rights.
