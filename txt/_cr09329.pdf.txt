TUNISIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Tunisia
Approved by Amor Tahari and Dominique Desruelle
July 30, 2009
Discussions took place during June 10–24, 2009 in Tunis. The mission comprised
Mr. Toujas-Bernaté (head) and Ms. Simard (both MCD), Ms. Valderrama (INS), and
Mr. Bayle (Banque de France expert). Mr. Tahari (MCD) and Mr. Rouai (OED)
participated in the discussions.
The mission met with Governor Baccar, Minister of Finance Kechiche, Minister of
Economic Development and International Cooperation Jouini; the ministers of
agriculture, industry, tourism and social affairs, and other government officials; and
private sector and labor representatives.
Tunisia continues its close dialogue with the Fund while retaining full ownership of its
economic program. The previous consultation was concluded on August 6, 2008. The
staff report and PIN are available at
http://www.imf.org/external/country/TUN/index.htm
The de facto exchange rate regime will be reclassified from “conventional peg to a
composite” to “floating.”
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1993. It
subscribed to SDDS in June 2001. The timeliness and coverage of macroeconomic data
are generally adequate for surveillance.
Tunisia has consistently published all documents related to the Article IV
consultations. Outreach activities included a meeting with parliamentarians; a
presentation by Mr. Tahari of MCD’s Regional Economic Outlook to the media and at
a conference of the Union of Maghreb Banks; and an interview and a press release at
the end of the mission.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Sound economic policies and structural reforms underpinned by increasing trade openness
allowed Tunisia to record higher growth in recent years and strengthen its footing to face the
current global crisis. Tunisia’s immediate challenge is to mitigate the adverse impact of a
depressed external demand. Over the medium term, its main objective remains to reduce the
still relatively high unemployment rate. Although affected by the crisis mainly through
falling exports, Tunisia is weathering its impact relatively well, thanks to resilient
remittances and tourism receipts. Growth may reach 3 percent this year if the fiscal stimulus
swiftly impacts demand. Discussions focused on short-term macroeconomic policies to
support demand while preserving medium-term financial sustainability, and reforms for
productivity gains.
Authorities’ views
•

Fiscal prudence remains a key priority of the authorities, but they will implement a
fiscal stimulus package given the exceptionally depressed external environment. They
will reevaluate it for 2010, considering a deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP as an
upper bound. They are resolutely committed to reverting to medium-term fiscal
consolidation as soon as growth firms up.

•

The authorities stand ready to further ease monetary policy to sustain demand if
necessary. They reaffirmed their objective of a freely floating exchange rate over the
medium term.

•

The authorities have taken steps to strengthen the banking sector and recognize the
need for further progress. In the context of the transition towards Basel II, they agree
that a more prospective approach to risk management is required.

Staff recommendations
The staff broadly supports the authorities’ macroeconomic policy stance and encourages
them to continue implementing reforms to enhance the economy’s resilience and improve
growth and employment. In particular:
•

The targeting of expenditure should be refined to free up more resources for fiscal
stimulus in 2010 and accelerate fiscal consolidation over the medium term.

•

Further adjustments in monetary policy should be gradual, in order to preserve its
credibility, particularly in a context of rising world prices as the recovery takes hold.

•

Continued strengthening of the banking sector is needed, and it would be desirable to
systematize and formalize stress tests to better assess its potential vulnerabilities.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Background
1.
Sound economic policies and structural reforms, underpinned by increasing
trade openness, allowed Tunisia to record higher growth and strengthen its footing to
face the current global crisis. Over the last decade, growth averaged 5 percent, real GDP
per capita increased by 46 percent, inflation was maintained at 3 percent on average, the
public debt-to-GDP ratio declined by 9 percentage points to 47½ percent of GDP, and
reserves increased from 2⅓ to 5 months of imports. The Association Agreement with the
European Union (EU), signed in 1995, was instrumental in raising trade openness and
inducing productivity gains by exposing the industrial sector to global competition. Tunisia’s
prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have improved its resilience to
economic slowdowns with lower public and external indebtedness and much higher reserves
coverage of short-term external debt.

2.
In the current severely deteriorated international environment, Tunisia’s
immediate challenge is to mitigate the adverse impact of a depressed external demand.
It is highly dependent on European countries for exports, tourism receipts, remittances and
FDI inflows. These countries are experiencing the worst recession in sixty years and their
activity is projected to strengthen more slowly than elsewhere. Thanks to its prudent policies
in the past, Tunisia has room for short-term expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to
sustain demand.

3.
Over the medium term, Tunisia’s main challenge remains to reduce the still
relatively high unemployment rate, particularly among young university graduates.
Bringing unemployment down from 14.2 percent in 2008 to the authorities’ objective of
10 percent by 2016 will require sustaining a 6 percent annual growth for several years. This
will necessitate continued structural reforms aimed at additional productivity gains, including
through further integration in the regional and global economies. Tunisia’s resilience to
shocks will be enhanced through prudent macroeconomic policies and further strengthening
of its financial sector.
B. Recent Developments
4.
Although affected by the global crisis, Tunisia is weathering its impact relatively
well. Exports fell but resilient receipts from tourism and remittances have so far
contributed to maintaining a comfortable level of reserves.
•

Real GDP growth slowed down from an average of 4.6 percent in 2008 to
0.5 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting mainly a fall in
exports of manufactured goods to EU countries. This drop was partially offset by
buoyant growth in the mining and energy sectors and in some services. Domestic
demand was sustained by investment and strong consumption fueled by salary
increases. 1

•

Inflation declined from an average of 5 percent in 2008 to 3½ percent (year-onyear) in June 2009 due to the fall in global food and fuel prices and an appropriate

As part of the 2008 triennial agreements, salaries were raised by 4.2–5.5 percent for private sector employees,
4 percent in public enterprises, and 4.7 percent for civil servants.

6
monetary policy, while price increases for other services accelerated slightly, in line
with rising salaries.
•

The current account deficit, after widening in 2008, contracted in the first
quarter of 2009. Increases in imports of raw materials and capital brought the current
account deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2008. With lower import prices contributing
to an improved trade balance and resilient tourism and remittances receipts, the
deficit declined in early 2009. Despite somewhat smaller foreign investments inflows
in early 2009, the external position remains comfortable with reserves at US$9 billion
at end-May 2009 (5.6 months of projected imports).

•

The fiscal deficit declined markedly in 2008 to 1.2 percent of GDP and the public
debt-to-GDP ratio was further reduced. Revenue increased by over 2 percentage
points of GDP from 2007, boosted by buoyant customs duties levied on higher priced
imports and strong corporate income tax receipts from high 2007 profits. Combined
with lower interest payments, this more than offset expenditure overruns on subsidies
for staple foods and petroleum products due to higher world prices. With this fiscal
consolidation, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 50 percent in 2007 to
47½ percent in 2008. In January-April 2009, the continued good revenue performance
and lower subsidies offset the wage bill increase.

•

The Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) reacted to the economic slowdown by
loosening its monetary policy in 2009. After raising it twice in 2008, the BCT
lowered its required reserves ratio from 10 percent to 7.5 percent at end-2008. It also
reduced its key policy rate from 5¼ percent to 4½ percent in February 2009, its first
such policy change in thirty months. Meanwhile, the BCT almost continuously
absorbed the abundant liquidity in the banking system mainly due to Treasury
operations and foreign reserves inflows. In the year to May 2009, the nominal

effective exchange rate depreciated by 3.4 percent, reflecting in part the dinar’s
depreciation against the Euro by 4 percent, while the real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 0.3 percent.
The Tunisian financial sector was not directly affected by the global financial
crisis. Banks rely only slightly on external financing and continued attracting strongly
growing deposits. Credit to the economy further increased in the first quarter of 2009,
particularly for services, while loans to the manufacturing sector slowed down.
Banks’ profitability increased in 2008, which contributed to a buoyant stock market. 2
This performance was also helped by stable foreign capital and the creation of two
investment funds.

•

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Tunisia was relatively insulated from international financial contagion (Box 1) but
is exposed to a slowdown in economic activity in its partner countries. Tunisia has a
capital account which is only partially open, low rollover risks, limited need for external
borrowing thanks to sizeable privatization receipts, and has been gradually strengthening its
banking sector. However, it is vulnerable to adverse shocks to its external demand and their
eventual repercussions on its domestic services sector, including the banking system. In
particular, spillover effects from European partners are relatively strong and will weigh on
Tunisia’s growth prospects in the short term. 3

Box 1. Limited Exposure to Financial Contagion
• The capital account is only partially open, which has prevented the integration of Tunisian
banks with the international financial system. External assets of Tunisian banks represent only
4 percent of their total assets while external liabilities amount to 8½ percent of total liabilities.
Several restrictions limit capital transactions in foreign currency, including an obligation for banks
to transfer their outstanding daily foreign exchange balances to the BCT and ceilings on foreign
investment by Tunisian firms, foreign borrowing by banks and foreign investment in Tunisian firms.
Foreign ownership—mostly long-term investors in prominent Tunisian holdings—accounts for
25 percent of stock market capitalization.
• Tunisia has no pressing need to borrow on international capital markets. It still disposes of
significant resources (3 percent of GDP) from the partial privatization of Tunisie Télécom in 2006,
and just concluded new lending agreements with the African Development Bank and the World
Bank amounting to US$500 millions over 2009–10.
• Low rollover and interest risks for external debt. Most external debt is contracted over the
medium and long term, owed to multilateral and bilateral official lenders with fixed interest rates,
and only a small share of external debt is maturing in the next five years.

6.
The authorities’ real GDP growth objective of 3 percent in 2009 may be reached if
downside risks do not materialize and Tunisia’s fiscal stimulus swiftly impacts demand.
In line with the projected recession of about 4 percent in partner countries, exports of goods
will decline. Based on developments during the first half of the year, tourism receipts and
remittances are projected to be only mildly affected by the crisis this year. 4 The measures
deployed by the authorities to contain the impact of the global crisis, including with the
recently adopted fiscal stimulus package and a more accommodating monetary policy, would
sustain demand. Moreover, Tunisia’s growth will likely benefit from a good cereal crop and a
sharp increase in gas production. Nevertheless, such a growth performance—about
7 percentage points higher than in partner countries—is unlikely to prevent a rise in
unemployment, and adverse developments in the next few months remain possible.
7.
The highly uncertain international environment and the possibly delayed impact
of the fiscal stimulus package represent significant downside risks to these projections.
The recession and higher unemployment in European partners may depress remittances and
tourism receipts during the remainder of the year. A slower rebound of these economies in
2010 would also limit Tunisia’s growth performance next year. Moreover, the
implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures—particularly accelerating infrastructure
investments—may be hampered by bottlenecks.
8.
The medium-term outlook is favorable, based on the projected global economic
recovery. Tunisia could take further steps to fully benefit from the global economic recovery
by pursuing structural reforms, including in the banking sector where continued
reinforcement would be beneficial. Once the crisis subsides, fiscal consolidation should bring
back the public debt-to-GDP ratio to a declining path.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions focused on short-term macroeconomic policies to minimize the impact of
the crisis on growth and unemployment while preserving macroeconomic stability and
reforms that could further foster productivity gains over the medium term.
A. Fiscal Policy
Background and staff analysis
10. Tunisia has leeway for implementing fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate the
impact of the recession in partner countries. A fiscal deficit of up to 4 percent of GDP
would still leave the public debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent (its 2007 level). Revenues
are projected to decline significantly in 2009 (by 2½ percent of GDP)—a reversal from

In particular, a drop in tourism from Europe has been offset by increases from neighboring countries.

12
2008—but savings on subsidies for petroleum products and staple foods would allow
discretionary increases in expenditures of close to 1½ percent of GDP. Given the abundant
liquidity in the banking system, the higher deficit could be financed domestically without
crowding out credit to the economy, and avoiding the need for external financing. To be most
effective, the fiscal stimulus package should:
•

Be executed rapidly so that it can impact growth this year.

•

Ensure that expenditure is well-targeted in order to maximize its impact.

•

Be extended into 2010, given the still weak global outlook anticipated for 2010.
However, maintaining budgetary expenditures in 2010 at their 2009 level may be
constrained by a revenue base weakened by the economic slowdown and the capacity
to borrow externally.

11.
The fiscal expansion in the short term should be set in a medium-term
framework where public debt would revert to a declining path once growth firms up.
Although Tunisia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio has declined in recent years, it remains near the
median of countries with similar sovereign ratings. Its experience in 2009 underscores the
importance of maintaining fiscal space to counter the impact of shocks on aggregate demand.
Two key pillars of that strategy would be to further streamline food and fuel subsidies and
implement a reform of the pension scheme to prevent a deficit in the near future.

12.
Tunisia has a relatively wide social safety net, built over the years, that should
help cushion the potential social impact of the crisis. There is no unemployment insurance
scheme, but fired workers are eligible for social assistance for up to one year. The coverage
of social security is nearly universal and Tunisia has a widespread program of subsidized
housing for the poorer segments of the population.
Authorities’ views and policy intentions
13.
Fiscal prudence remains an overarching priority of the authorities, but they
saw the need for reasonable short-term fiscal expansion given the exceptionally
depressed external environment. The authorities emphasized their prompt reaction to the
crisis through targeted support for exporting firms from end-2008, which limited the number
of layoffs. Since the impact of the global crisis could become more widespread and
prolonged, the authorities adopted in mid-2009 a fiscal stimulus package of 1.4 percent of
GDP in the supplementary budget and extended and expanded the support measures already
in place (Box 2). The authorities estimate the effect of the fiscal stimulus on growth at
½ percentage point of GDP in 2009, 5 as they are accelerating its implementation and
maximizing its impact through labor-intensive investment projects with low import content.
14.
The authorities will reevaluate the fiscal stimulus measures for 2010 based on
economic and financial developments, but consider the deficit projected in 2009 of
3.8 percent of GDP as an upper bound. Although much improved, they see Tunisia’s
capacity to weather two consecutive years of a difficult international environment as under
test. Therefore, they aim to enhance the revenue base through programs to stimulate energy
production, and to improve expenditure targeting.
15.
The authorities are resolutely committed to reverting to medium-term fiscal
consolidation as soon as growth firms up. They intend to streamline the subsidies for
petroleum products based on the price adjustment mechanism introduced in 2009, while
maintaining subsidies on staple foods. They consider the administrative costs of effectively
targeting the needier households with direct cash transfers as exceeding the cost of the
current system, for which direct controls prevent abuse. They also intend to reduce interest
on public debt by using privatization receipts for accelerated debt repayment when deemed
financially advantageous. Finally, they launched preparation for a pension reform that should
address the impact of demographic pressures.

5

Some leakage of the fiscal stimulus package may be expected, in particular for measures in support of the
offshore export sector which imports almost all inputs, and employment measures which may stimulate savings
and imports.

14

Box 2. The 2009 Supplementary Budget and Fiscal Stimulus Package
The authorities adopted in December 2008 several temporary measures to support exporting
firms affected by the crisis, including partial exemption of social security contributions, fiscal
incentives, and credit guarantees.
An allocation of TD 730 million (1.4 percent of GDP) is provided in the supplementary budget
adopted in July 2009 for additional expenditures in 2009 relative to 2008, including for
accelerated public investment projects and expanded direct support measures.
The economic recovery program includes the following additional expenditures:
1. Accelerated investment projects: 0.3 percent of GDP;
2. Maintenance (in education, health, and finance): 0.1 percent of GDP;
3. Support for employment (professional training courses, exemption of social security
contributions, and a special recruitment program): 0.2 percent of GDP;
4. Support for exports (export guarantees and other budgetary transfers to export credit and
insurance companies): 0.1 percent of GDP;
5. Support for enterprise restructuring: 0.3 percent of GDP;
6. Support for energy production (oil exploration and production of electricity): 0.2 percent of
GDP;
7. Regional development: 0.2 percent of GDP.

16.
The authorities continue to pursue social reforms. The health insurance reform
was completed in 2008 to ensure the system’s sustainability. The authorities also favor for
now active employment policies over an unemployment insurance scheme, as the latter could
reduce Tunisia’s competitiveness and attractiveness as an investment location. 6
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Background and staff analysis
17.
In the context of declining inflation and lower economic activity, a more
accommodating monetary policy helped to sustain demand. Further easing, if warranted,
would need to take place only gradually and in coordination with fiscal policy, and take into
consideration potential inflationary pressures from the rebound in commodity prices or the

abundant liquidity. A further deepening of the money market would help enhance monetary
policy transmission.
18.
The BCT continues to implement the building blocks of an inflation targeting
framework for monetary policy. It created a center devoted to the analytical underpinning
of the monetary policy framework, and has received EU technical assistance for training and
software support.
19.
Tunisia’s exchange rate remains broadly aligned with its fundamentals, and
current account developments and exchange rate policies are consistent with external
stability (Box 3). Interventions by the BCT on both sides of the foreign exchange market
have declined since 2007, except in October-November 2008 when market participants
preferred transacting through the BCT. Tunisia is expected to continue to attract foreign
capital to finance a level of investment above its domestic savings, with a sustainable current
account deficit of around 3 percent over the medium term.
Authorities’ views and policy intentions
20.
The authorities stand ready to cautiously ease monetary policy further to sustain
demand as needed. In order to deepen the money market and improve its liquidity
management tools, the BCT introduced in February 2009 two new facilities for deposits and
borrowing by banks, which resulted in more variable money market rates within the band
provided by these facilities. It sees the need for further progress, including by developing the
secondary market for Treasury bills, enhancing the role of insurance companies and issuing
debt certificates available for foreign investors.
21.
The authorities will pursue preparatory steps towards an inflation-targeting
framework. In that respect, they would welcome technical support from IMF staff for the
new center for financial and economic analysis to develop data bases and enhance practical
expertise.
22.
The authorities reaffirmed their objective of a freely floating exchange rate over
the medium term. They noted that the BCT’s interventions on foreign exchange markets
were for liquidity management purposes, and declined with the easing of restrictions on the
capital and current accounts. This trend will continue as Tunisia further liberalizes its capital
account. They also remarked the relative stability of Tunisia’s exchange rate in contrast with
other emerging economies more affected by the financial crisis.

(REER) is broadly in line with fundamentals.1

Using the CGER’s macroeconomic
balance (MB) yields a very small
undervaluation of the REER (1.2 percent).

To complement the study, a country-specific

exchange rate is determined by the labor productivity relative to trading partners (prod), the terms of trade (tt),
and the trade openness (open):

This approach suggests a small undervaluation of 3.9 percent for 2008, in line with the estimates under the
CGER approach.
This analysis suggests that the depreciation in the REER over the past five years is consistent with an
equilibrium real exchange rate depreciation driven by higher openness and a deterioration in the terms of trade
that outweigh the Balassa-Samuelson effect from increased productivity gains against trading partners.
Alternative measures of the REER (unit labor costs- and producer price index-based) point at a slight
improvement in competitiveness in recent years.

C. Financial Sector Issues
Background and staff analysis
23.
Banks soundness indicators continued to improve in 2008, but the level of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) remains relatively high requiring additional provisioning
which hampers banks profitability and development. Continuing recent trend, banking
activity, liquidity and profitability increased in 2008, the ratio of NPLs to total loans
declined, and the provisioning improved. New NPLs related to the recent credit growth
appear very small, while the stock of older NPLs did not decline significantly. The situations
of individual banks differ widely: while many of them will be able to achieve the authorities’
provisioning objective of 70 percent by end-2009, some banks will need new recapitalization.
24.
Past and international experience show that the banking system can be
vulnerable to the current economic slowdown. Tunisia’s tourism crisis in 2002 resulted in
a subsequent significant increase in NPLs, yet unresolved. In the context of the current global
crisis and its impact on Tunisia, implementing comprehensive stress tests is a priority, since
it would further shed light on potential vulnerabilities and a possible need for strengthening
measures to reduce them. Fund staff stands ready to assist in this area.

strictly observed.

3/ Prior to 2006, the average capital adequacy ratio only includes private and public banks.

18
25.
A more forward-looking approach to banking supervision could be beneficial,
including in the perspective of Basel II. The authorities’ careful attention to NPLs and
provisioning relates to already materialized credit risks. The capital adequacy ratio, which
improved slightly in 2008 but remains below its 2005 level, is a measure of banks’ capacity
to face future risks. With the implementation of Basel II, requirements for the coverage of
credit, market and operational risks will be more stringent, and may necessitate further
increases in capital adequacy ratios.
Authorities’ views and policy intentions
26.
The authorities emphasized the important steps achieved in strengthening the
banking sector and aim at further steady progress in this area. Setting clear objectives
for NPLs and provisioning ratios by end-2009 (of 15 and 70 percent, respectively)—in the
context of their long-term strategy—induced a proactive stance by all parties that resulted in
limiting new NPLs. Banks’ capacity for risk assessment improved with effective use of credit
risk databases, prudential requirements for governance and control of credit distribution were
strengthened, and action plans for troubled banks were agreed and their implementation is
closely monitored. The authorities encouraged the capping of dividend distribution and
increases in capital, and the government has always been ready to inject new capital in public
banks, as demonstrated again in early 2009. They will set new medium-term objectives to
drive additional improvements, including more resolute actions to reduce the existing stock
of NPLs. The authorities will also support improvement in banks services, including through
pooling of logistic and technical resources.
27.
The authorities consider that Tunisia’s banking system is not subject to
significant vulnerabilities. They conducted stress tests based on crisis events experienced in
the past by key sectors of the economy to assess additional provisioning needs under such
events. Under a scenario combining these shocks, the NPL ratio would not exceed its 2003
peak and the authorities are confident that the shareholders of the most affected banks (public
and private) would easily cover the recapitalization needs. They also noted that domestic
banks had very limited exposure to the sectors most affected by the global crisis so far
(offshore exporting firms).
28.
The authorities agree that a more prospective approach to risk management is
required. They indicated that preparatory work for Basel II was completed, but its
implementation is not yet fully planned. They noted that transparency of the sector improved
with the publication of key indicators by banks.

19
D. Other Issues
Background and staff analysis
29.
Tunisia continues its policy of opening up its economy. Bilateral negotiations with
the EU are under way to extend the Association Agreement to services. Tunisia is also
actively engaged in the Maghreb integration process, and signed a preferential trade
agreement with Algeria in December 2008.
30.
Tunisia is implementing policies to improve the business climate and setting up
the “Tunis Financial Harbor.” Tunisia’s procedures for starting a new business were
markedly improved last year following the implementation of the 2007 law on economic
initiative. Updating customs procedures, which resulted in fewer delays, are expected to
continue with the new Customs Code implemented since January 2009. In the context of the
Tunis Financial Harbor project, the authorities prepared a bill to harmonize the provision of
on- and off-shore financial services consistent with international standards.
Authorities’ views and policy intentions
31.
The authorities emphasized their steadfast actions aimed at gradually opening
the Tunisian economy despite the currently adverse global environment. They plan to
overhaul the environment for services in order to improve their competitiveness ahead of
their exposure to international markets.
32.
The authorities consider that significantly raising private investment is key to
producing lasting gains in productivity. They intend to further improve the business
climate and competitiveness in the context of the two new programs financed by the World
Bank and the African Development Bank. They look forward to the entry in operations of the
Enfidha airport and deep water port which will improve the logistical support to international
trade.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Tunisia has weathered the impact of the global crisis relatively well so far, but it
still faces downside risks and challenges lie ahead. Highly dependent on Europe for its
external demand and FDI, Tunisia saw its exports falling in end-2008, but tourism and
remittances have been resilient. Thanks to sound policies implemented over the years, it is
facing the crisis with strong fundamentals and has room for short-term expansionary fiscal
and monetary policies to sustain demand. The financial system was not affected by the global
crisis, but the level of NPLs remains relatively high. Growth may reach 3 percent in 2009 and
pick up gradually as the global crisis subsides, but is subject to significant downside risks
pertaining to the transmission of the recession in Europe and the speed of impact of fiscal
stimulus. This would leave unemployment at a still relatively high level, especially among
the youth.

20
34.
Staff endorses the authorities’ temporary expansionary fiscal stance to mitigate
the impact of the global crisis. To be most effective, the fiscal stimulus should be executed
rapidly, with well-targeted additional expenditures. Staff encourages the authorities to
consider extending the fiscal stimulus into 2010, given the still weak outlook anticipated in
partner countries.
35.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ steadfast resolve to revert to fiscal consolidation
once growth firms up and bring the public debt-to-GDP ratio—currently near the median of
comparable emerging economies—back to a declining trend. A key pillar should be the
reduction in subsidies, through the continued effective implementation of the new oil price
adjustment mechanism and finding a better targeted mechanism to support the poorer
segments of the population. A pension reform should also be implemented in time to avoid a
future burden on the budget.
36.
The BCT’s monetary policy stance has been appropriate, with a cautious easing
in 2009 to accommodate demand support. It should be closely coordinated with fiscal
policy to allow a timely response. Further easing, if needed, should however be envisaged
only gradually, and take into consideration potential renewed inflationary pressures and risks
of deteriorating prudential indicators of the banking system.
37.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue implementing the building blocks
for the planned inflation-targeting framework. Efforts to develop analytical and technical
underpinnings of this monetary policy framework should be intensified. Further
improvements in monetary policy transmission should be pursued as well, including by
developing the secondary market for Treasury bills, enhancing the role of insurance
companies and issuing debt certificates available for foreign investors.
38.
The exchange rate remains broadly aligned with its fundamentals and the
authorities’ policies are consistent with external stability. The exchange rate policy
should remain anchored by the authorities’ medium-term objective of a freely floating
exchange rate.
39.
Prudential indicators continued to improve, but the level of NPLs remains
relatively high. While good results were achieved in avoiding the emergence of new NPLs,
more resolute efforts to reduce the older stock should be pursued to further strengthen the
banking system’s resilience, particularly given the gradual opening of the capital account.
Individual situations of banks differ widely and will continue to require close monitoring.
The staff supports the authorities’ plans for further enhancing the quality of bank services.
40.
The regulatory and supervisory frameworks should continue to adapt to
financial sector developments. A more forward looking approach to banking supervision
will be beneficial, including in the context of future implementation of Basel II. Systematic
and comprehensive stress testing is needed to better assess the potential vulnerabilities of the
banking system and prepare appropriate contingency plans.

21
41.
The staff welcomes Tunisia’s pragmatic and steadfast approach to trade and
financial integration, despite the currently adverse global environment. Negotiations
with the EU to extend the Association Agreement to services could become a key anchor for
a gradual overhaul and liberalization of the services sectors. Tunisia’s active participation in
the regional integration effort is welcome. Trade diversion should be prevented and
geographic diversification enhanced through reduction of most-favored nation tariffs. The
staff also welcomes continued improvement in the business climate through ongoing tax and
customs administration reforms and programs supported by IFIs.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 effective
January 6, 1993, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on executing
payments and transfers on current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains
(a) a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended
prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of
existing commitments (total loans covered by these guarantees amount to about $20 million);
and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions, which are subject to notification
to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51).
Since March 1, 1994, the market rates are determined in an interbank foreign exchange
market. On July 14, 2009, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-à-vis the dollar was
$1=TD 1.13392, equivalent to SDR 1= TD 2.0811.
Article IV Consultation
Tunisia is on the 12-month cycle. The last discussions of the Article IV consultation were held
in Tunis from May 27 to June 9, 2008, and the consultation was concluded by the Executive
Board on August 6, 2008.

ANNEX II. TUNISIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of July 1, 2009)
1.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia has a total of 17 active operations and
122 closed loans, of which 10 International Development Agency (IDA) credits amounting to
$75.2 million net of cancellations. Cumulative net commitments represent $5.6 billion. Of
this total, $4.3 billion has been repaid. Net commitments for the 17 current operations
amount to about $0.9 billion.
2.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Board on June 3, 2004.
It proposes to assist the Government of Tunisia in addressing three key challenges:
(a) strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more competitive,
internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the Tunisian
economy; (b) enhance skills and employability of graduates and labor force in a knowledge
economy; and (c) improve the quality of social services through enhanced efficiency of
public expenditures. The 2007 CAS progress report noted that, while the CAS is overall on
track and remains fully relevant for Tunisia’s key development challenges, the low level of
domestic private investment constitutes a major concern, threatening growth and job
creation. The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is under preparation and is expected to
be finalized before the end of 2009. The focus areas of the Bank’s program will be
(i) Employment, Growth and Competitiveness; (ii) Sustainable Development and Climate
Change; and (iii) Quality of Service Delivery.
3.
Bank lending is a mix of long-term investments in infrastructure and social sector
financing, and development policy lending to support reforms at the sectoral and
macroeconomic reforms. Recent loan includes the Integrated Competitiveness Development
Policy Loan ($250.0 million); the Water Sector Investment II Loan ($30.6 million) and the
Energy Efficiency Loan ($55.0 million). The performance of investment projects continues
to be satisfactory. However, procurement delays cause recurrent extension of closing dates.
4.
The Bank’s current portfolio has a strong focus on supporting economic reforms in
trade integration, financial sector and private sector development and the Bank’s partnership
on trade, macroeconomic management and growth issues is excellent. The Bank is also
heavily engaged in social sector issues with a focus on strengthening the quality of services
in education and health. Challenges pertaining to climate change are being addressed by a
variety of activities in natural resource management, water, energy, urban development and
transport. Public Financial Management, Telecommunications, Rural Development and
Cultural Heritage are also being supported.
5.
Several Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and technical assistance (TA) outputs to
inform and support policy choices and reforms were produced over the last two years. These
include a study on global integration; Employment; Skills Development and Social

36
Protection, Small and Medium Enterprise Study, Water Degradation; Wastewater Strategy,
Use of Country Systems; and Health Management. Ongoing work includes a Development
Policy Review; a Small and Medium Enterprise Finance Policy Note; a Review of Energy
Management Policy; a Regional Study on the Constraints to Cross Border Investment and
Trade in the Maghreb, Competitiveness Poles, Social Safety Nets, and Energy Markets in the
Maghreb. The Bank is also supporting work on trade integration and agriculture trade policy,
Budget Management and Performance Based Budgeting, Health Services, Urban Transport,
Low-Carbon Transport Strategy and Labor Market Policies.

ANNEX III. TUNISIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(as of July 15, 2009)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real Sector Statistics: Currently disseminated quarterly real GDP estimates utilize a 1990 base year. Work to
adopt the methodology of the 1993 System of National Accounts is advanced and will update the base year to
the year 2000. Surveillance would benefit from the collection and dissemination of higher frequency data on
employment, unemployment, and wages. Tunisia utilizes a periodicity and timeliness flexibility option for the
labor market data category under the SDDS. Currently, annual employment and unemployment data are
disseminated with a timeline of seven months.

External sector statistics: Are generally adequate for surveillance, although greater detail on the financial
account would be desirable.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) June 20, 2001.

A data ROSC was published on the IMF website on
August 9, 2006.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Tunisia
On September 1, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Tunisia on a lapse of time basis. 1
Background
Sound economic policies and structural reforms underpinned by increasing trade openness
allowed Tunisia to record higher growth in recent years and strengthen its footing to face the
current global crisis. Tunisia enhanced its resilience with reduced public and external
indebtedness and a largely improved reserves position. The Tunisian economy was relatively
insulated from international financial contagion but is exposed to a slowdown in economic
activity in its partner countries, particularly in Europe.
Although affected by the current crisis, Tunisia has weathered its impact relatively well so far.
Real GDP growth slowed down from an average of 4.6 percent in 2008 to 0.5 percent in the first
quarter of 2009, reflecting mainly a fall in exports of manufactured goods to EU countries. This
drop was partially offset by buoyant growth in the mining and energy sectors and in some
services. Domestic demand was sustained by investment and strong consumption fueled by
salary increases. Inflation declined from an average of 5 percent in 2008 to 3½ percent (yearon-year) in June 2009 due to the fall in global food and fuel prices and an appropriate monetary
policy.
The current account deficit, after widening in 2008, contracted in the first quarter of 2009 thanks
to lower import prices and resilient tourism and remittances receipts. Despite somewhat smaller
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This year’s Article IV consultation was concluded on a lapse of time basis.
Under the IMF’s lapse of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations
without convening formal discussions. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be
found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

foreign investment inflows in early 2009, reserves reached US$9 billion at end-May 2009
(5.6 months of projected imports).
The fiscal deficit declined markedly in 2008 to 1.2 percent of GDP and the public debt-to-GDP
ratio was further reduced from 50 percent in 2007 to 47½ percent in 2008. Revenue was
boosted by buoyant customs duties levied on higher priced imports and strong corporate
income tax receipts from high 2007 profits. Combined with lower interest payments, this more
than offset expenditure overruns on subsidies for staple foods and petroleum products due to
higher world prices.
Banks were not directly affected by the global financial crisis since they rely only slightly on
external financing and their profitability increased in 2008, which contributed to a buoyant stock
market. Credit to the economy further increased in the first quarter of 2009. Banks’ soundness
indicators continued to improve in 2008, but the level of non performing loans (NPLs) remains
relatively high.
The authorities promptly deployed measures to contain the impact of the global crisis, including
with the recently adopted fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4 percent of GDP and a more
accommodating monetary policy by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) in 2009, with the
objective to reach a 3 percent real GDP growth this year. The medium-term outlook is favorable,
based on the projected global economic recovery.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the good performance of the Tunisian
economy in the context of the global crisis, due to strong fundamentals resulting from sound
policies implemented over the years. Directors considered that the growth outlook is favorable
but that Tunisia still faces downside risks—pertaining to the transmission of the recession in
Europe and the speed of impact of fiscal stimulus—and challenges related to the still high level
of unemployment.
Directors supported the authorities’ temporary expansionary fiscal stance to mitigate the impact
of the global crisis and recommended that the fiscal stimulus be executed rapidly and have welltargeted expenditure in order to be most effective. They encouraged the authorities to consider
extending the fiscal stimulus into 2010, given the still weak outlook anticipated in partner
countries.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ steadfast resolve to revert to fiscal consolidation once
growth firms up and bring the public debt-to-GDP ratio back to a declining trend. They noted
that a key pillar of the strategy should be the reduction in subsidies, through the continued
effective implementation of the new oil price adjustment mechanism and improved targeting of
measures to support the poorer segment of the population. They also supported a timely reform
of the pension system to avoid a future burden on the budget.

3
Directors considered that the BCT’s monetary policy stance has been appropriate, with a
cautious easing in 2009 to accommodate demand support. They recommended close
coordination with fiscal policy and a gradual approach in further monetary easing, taking into
consideration potential renewed inflationary pressures and risks of deteriorating prudential
indicators of the banking system. They encouraged the authorities to continue implementing the
building blocks for the planned inflation-targeting framework.
Directors noted that the exchange rate remains broadly aligned with its fundamentals and the
authorities policies are consistent with external stability. They encouraged the authorities to
continue anchoring the exchange rate policy to their medium-term objective of a freely floating
exchange rate.
Directors observed that prudential indicators of the banking sector continued to improve but that
the level of NPLs remains relatively high. They commended the authorities for implementing
regulations that prevented the emergence of new NPLs, but encouraged them to make more
resolute efforts to reduce the older stock in order to further strengthen the banking system’s
resilience, particularly given the gradual opening of the capital account. They recommended
continued close monitoring of individual banks and supported the authorities’ plans for further
enhancing the quality of bank services.
Directors recommended that the regulatory and supervisory frameworks continue to adapt to
financial sector developments. They favored a more forward looking approach to banking
supervision, including in the context of future implementation of Basel II. They considered that
systematic and comprehensive stress testing was needed to better assess the potential
vulnerabilities of the banking system and to prepare appropriate contingency plans.
Directors congratulated the Tunisian authorities’ for their pragmatic and steadfast approach to
trade and financial integration, despite the currently adverse global environment. They noted
that negotiations with the EU to extend the Association Agreement to services could become a
key anchor for a gradual overhaul and liberalization of the services sectors and welcomed
Tunisia’s active participation in the regional integration effort. They recommended reducing the
most-favored nation tariffs to prevent trade diversion and enhance geographic diversification.
Directors welcomed continued improvement in the business climate through ongoing tax and
customs administration reforms and programs supported by International Financial Institutions.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
