

Context. The global slowdown and severe floods adversely affected economic activity,
delayed the adoption of plans for fiscal consolidation discussed in previous consultations, and
contributed to increased bank risks. Foreign reserves have strengthened and the near-term
outlook has improved moderately, but Belize remains susceptible to downside risks. This
year’s budget included important tax revenue actions in an effort to offset some fiscal
pressures and help stabilize the large public debt position.



Focus of the consultation. With a view of enhancing the economy’s resilience to shocks,
discussions centered on the strategy to achieve debt sustainability, enhance banking system
stability, and further strengthen the external position. Discussions also covered policies to
boost growth and reduce poverty, under the authorities’ development plan.



Key recommendations. Staff recommended a gradual increase in the primary surplus to
4½ percent of GDP, mainly through wage and pension reforms, to place the public debt on a
firm downward path and reduce external financing needs. It also recommended continued
actions to strengthen the financial system and welcomed improvements in the monetary
policy framework. The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations, particularly to
strengthen the banking system. They planned to seek consensus on needed fiscal reforms, but
noted that, in the near term, social conditions strictly constrained the scope for fiscal
consolidation.



Exchange system. The exchange rate appears broadly consistent with fundamentals. The
Belize dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1976. Belize accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, section 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.



Discussions. The staff team, comprising M. Garza (Head), G. El-Masry, G. Nicholls, and
D. Rodriguez-Delgado (all WHD), visited Belize during June 21–July 1, 2010. P. McGoldrick
(OED) participated in the final discussions. The team met with Prime Minister Barrow,
Central Bank Governor Ysaguirre, Financial Secretary Waight, other senior officials, and
business, labor, political, and diplomatic representatives. Discussions on the banking system
continued during September 8-9, 2010.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Belize’s macroeconomic performance has been constrained by structural
weaknesses. Belize has been vulnerable to adverse shocks mainly because of a weak external
position, policy rigidities, and reduced access to external financing. Since 2006, growth has
remained lackluster, with sources limited mostly to petroleum extraction and tourism-related
construction, while the export base has remained relatively narrow. In 2007, debt
restructuring eased external debt service, but public debt stayed high and foreign reserves
low, which limited the policy capacity to respond to shocks.
2.
The present government, which took office in early 2008, sought to ease
vulnerabilities and strengthen growth. In the context of the 2008 and 2009 Article IV
consultations, the authorities endorsed a strategy to reduce public debt over time, through
revenue and spending actions; strengthen foreign reserves to deal with near-term risks;
reform the framework for monetary policy; and improve governance. Debt sustainability was
considered essential to regain access to external private financing and reduce roll-over risks.
3.
Despite some progress under the authorities’ strategy, deviations have emerged,
largely as a result of external shocks. Progress was registered in strengthening foreign
reserves and in the conduct of monetary policy. However, plans to attain debt sustainability
were delayed, as priority was given in 2008 to managing the impact of soaring fuel/food
prices and the effects from severe floods. The global crisis and weakened social conditions in
2009 also made it difficult to move forward with the desired fiscal adjustment.
In this context, the 2010 Article IV consultation discussions focused on policies to
improve the economy’s resilience to shocks and strengthen growth and social prospects.
4.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Belize was adversely impacted by the global downturn in 2009, but the economy
is recovering modestly in 2010.




Output stagnated in 2009, owing largely to a weakening in tourism and agriculture—
which suffered from the effects of floods in late 2008. Growth has resumed since late
2009, but remains narrow-based. Twelve-month inflation fell to minus 0.4 percent in

strengthened from the low levels seen in previous years to 3¼ months of imports at
end-2009, or 160 percent of projected external financing needs. In the more recent
period, foreign reserves have continued to rise somewhat.


The public finances weakened substantially. The fiscal balance deteriorated by
2 percentage points of GDP to a deficit of about 1.5 percent of GDP in FY09/10
(April–March), due to lower grants and higher current spending (mainly wages),
despite a decline in investment. Tax revenue was stable, as lower general sales tax
(GST) collections related to sluggish activity were offset by the effect of an increase in
the excise tax on fuel. Public debt rose to 80 percent of GDP at end-2009.

increase in NPLs has been largely
concentrated in three banks (two domestic banks and one offshore), which account for
over 40 percent of deposits in the banking system. This includes a large domestic bank,
accounting for close to one third of total banks deposits, which has been faced with a
deterioration in its loan portfolio since the beginning of this year (Appendix I).
Deposits and credit in the banking system have remained broadly stable through June
2010.



Social indicators have weakened. A poverty assessment conducted by the authorities
revealed that poverty affected 40 percent of the population in 2009, up from 33 percent
in 2000. Moreover, unemployment has remained high (after reaching 12.5 percent in
September 2009) and crime appears to have increased.
III. DISCUSSIONS ON MACROECONOMIC POLICIES

6.
The authorities’ priority is to promote a recovery in growth and reduce poverty.
Since external conditions for Belize are expected to remain sluggish (mainly affecting
tourism, export prices, and FDI) and external financing is limited, there was broad agreement
that, to attain the authorities’ objectives, priority should be placed on strengthening of the
policy framework and rebuilding macroeconomic and financial buffers to deal with shocks.

6
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
7.
Prospects have improved moderately for 2010. Staff projects output to grow by
2 percent this year, due largely to an expansion in electricity generation. Inflation would rise
to 6 percent, after the rebound in fuel prices and recent tax measures. Despite some increase in
debt payments abroad, associated with a step up in the coupon rate on external debt
restructured in 2007, the external current account deficit would narrow to under 6 percent of
GDP, reflecting lower energy and FDI-related imports. The foreign reserve position would
improve slightly.
8.
Staff prepared two scenarios to illustrate the impact of alternative policies on
macroeconomic prospects for the medium-term.


The baseline scenario assumes the continuation of present policies. This scenario
would restrain growth at 2.5 percent per year, or below historical trends, and lead to
high external financing needs, leaving the economy vulnerable to shocks. With a
primary surplus projected to remain at 1.5 percent of GDP over the medium-term,
slightly below the level budgeted for FY 2010/11, public debt would remain slightly
under 80 percent of GDP. Total external financing needs would be substantial, at
around 8.5-10 percent of GDP a year. There would be limited room in the public
finances to redirect spending to social priorities, while foreign reserves would decline
steadily to under 2 months of imports by the end of this decade (Tables 5–6, and
Appendix II).



The active scenario incorporates strengthened policies. This scenario would raise
growth to 3.5 percent over the medium-term and lower external financing needs. It is
based on sustaining a primary surplus of 4½ percent of GDP starting in 2011, an
assumed reallocation of spending toward capital and social priorities, and increased
private investment that would result from improved confidence. Under this scenario,
public debt would gradually decline to 40 percent of GDP and foreign reserves would
strengthen to 4 months of imports by the end of this decade. To this end, staff
recommended the following fiscal actions:


Expenditure: reversing the upward trend in the wage bill relative to GDP;
limiting growth in non-priority spending areas; and streamlining generous benefits
vis-à-vis contributions on the public officer’s pension scheme while introducing a
pension contribution.



Revenue: consideration could be given to raising the GST rate closer to regional
levels (15 percent) or phasing out fully the 2008 reduction in the fuel excise tax.



Social Security Board (SSB): starting to gradually implement the parametric
actions proposed in the latest actuarial report, to bring generous benefits in line

7
with contributions, with a view to attaining financial viability for the pension
scheme for private sector workers, and reducing potential fiscal costs.

GDP) and a large increase in public investment. On that basis, the primary surplus would be
kept at nearly 2 percent of GDP and the public debt position would decline slightly.
10.
Staff recommended reinforcing the budget this year, as part of a strategy of
medium-term fiscal consolidation. Staff noted that there was a risk that the authorities’
objectives would not fully materialize, and that a weak revenue performance would limit the
primary surplus to 1.5 percent of GDP. Given the important need of continuing improving
the external position, staff proposed aiming at a more active scenario, in which the primary
surplus would improve in the near-term, rising to 3 percent of GDP this fiscal year.
Achieving this target would require exercising more selectivity in the investment plan;
intensifying tax administration efforts; and enhancing controls on transfers and the wage bill,
which have risen rapidly in recent years.1 The authorities agreed that undertaking these
actions was desirable, but noted that, in their view, any associated yield should be used to
reverse the deterioration in social conditions, while keeping the fiscal deficit in line with the
budget.
11.
Staff supported the authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen tax administration
and the public financial management (PFM) over the medium term:


Tax and customs. In line with Fund’s advice, the authorities’ ongoing efforts center on
enhancing tax compliance, including through improving controls over large taxpayers;
adopting a new management and auditing system for customs (ASYCUDA); and
setting up an electronic network to track imports and allow for cross checking of tax
information.



PFM. The authorities are adopting the recommendations of a report prepared by the
European Union (EU) on public expenditure and financial accountability, which
includes steps to: introduce multi-year budgeting; develop fiscal responsibility
guidelines; implement a fiscal code of conduct; improve the Finance and Audit Act to
enhance control and accountability; and upgrade the management of the public
investment plan.

12.
There was agreement with the authorities on the desirability to achieve debt
sustainability, while increasing priority social spending over the medium term. As
discussed in previous consultations, the authorities concurred with staff that raising the
primary surplus to halve the public debt to about 40 percent of GDP by 2019 remains an
ideal target, since this would help Belize regain access to external private financing. It would

9
also help roll over the large annual amortization payments under the Superbond (2 percent of
GDP) that will start falling due in 2019.2
13.
The authorities, however, noted that an additional fiscal effort would be difficult
to deliver in the near term, given political and social conditions. They stated that
substantial yields could be obtained from administrative improvements in tax compliance and
spending control. This would allow them to meet anticipated fiscal pressures3 and maintain a
primary surplus of 1.5–2 percent of GDP in the coming years, keeping the public debt
position at current levels. They acknowledged the need for fiscal reforms (mainly on wages
and pensions), but explained that such reforms were strongly opposed by labor unions and
the business sector. However, the authorities expressed their willingness to engage various
stakeholders to develop consensus on these reforms.
C. Banking System Stability
14.
As noted, the overall health of the banking system has deteriorated, with three
banks facing financial weakness. Although the reported capital position of these three
banks exceeds the minimum required level, they suffer from high NPLs and low provisions
(Appendix I). In the largest of the three banks, NPLs doubled to 34 percent of total loans
during the first half of this year. This bank also made capital charges for assets that had been
under litigation since 2008. The remaining banks appear to be liquid and well capitalized,
with capital adequacy ratios of 25 percent on average.
15.
Discussions with the authorities centered on a strategy to enhance the regulatory
and bank resolution frameworks, and reduce credit risks. The authorities concurred that
priority needed to be given to ensuring that all banks are well capitalized. To strengthen
banking stability, MCM and LEG have been providing technical assistance on specific steps
to contain systemic risks and address shortcomings in Belize’s resolution and prudential
framework.
16.
The authorities recognized that the situation of the three banks, if not
addressed, could threaten the stability of the banking system. In response to staff’s
recommendations, they noted that these banks recognize the potential capital shortfalls
associated with their NPLs, and have agreed to submit recapitalization plans to the central
bank. Staff recommended that, as a next step, the authorities should specify the size of the
capital increase that is needed in each bank and set timelines for the implementation of their
recapitalization plans. Staff also advised the authorities to stand ready to take additional

The Superbond, which currently accounts for half the outstanding public debt, has a 12-year grace period and
a 10-year semi-annual repayment period starting in August 2019.

3

These pressures derive from a scheduled increase in the interest rate on the Superbond from 4¼ percent to
6 percent this year and to 8½ percent in 2012; a projected decline in oil revenue beyond 2012 in the absence of
new discoveries; and priority spending in infrastructure and anti-poverty programs that will result from the
development plan for 2010-13.

10
actions, if needed. The authorities agreed on the need to develop contingency measures, if the
recapitalization plans do not materialize as expected.
17.
The authorities have also intensified supervision of the overall system. In line
with Fund TA advice, the central bank has increased on-site examinations, requested more
frequent reporting from the banks, and introduced regular stress testing to supplement off-site
monitoring. Also, it has asked some banks to voluntarily raise provisions to adequately cover
for loan-loss risks,4 and required banks to strengthen their risk management and internal
control systems to limit credit risk. For the three banks, the central bank has held frequent
meetings with their management, as part of its continuous monitoring of their situation and
ongoing efforts to intensify bank oversight.
18.
Staff supported the authorities’ plan to strengthen the regulatory and bank
resolution frameworks. With Fund TA advice, the authorities plan to overhaul existing
legislation, including with a view to introducing orderly resolution procedures. Their plan is
to submit revised legislation to Parliament and seek its approval by March 2011.
19.
The authorities also intend to bring prudential rules in line with international
best practice. They have requested Fund TA to upgrade rules on loan classification and
provisioning, related lending, and balance sheet concentration over the next few months,
after consultation is conducted with the banks. This strategy should support the strengthening
plans of the three banks and help reducing credit risk in the overall banking system.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
20.
Staff welcomed improvements in the monetary policy framework. The authorities
have taken steps to shift to market-based government securities for monetary operations and
reduce non-remunerated required reserves (Box 1). This reform should enhance the central
bank’s effectiveness in managing liquidity, facilitate the attainment of foreign reserve targets,
and reduce the costs of financial intermediation. Staff welcomed plans to improve the
liquidity forecasting capacity and develop the interbank market. Staff also encouraged the
authorities to set up standing facilities to establish a corridor for interest rates and to phase
out the interest rate floor on savings deposits. The authorities remained committed to a
disciplined monetary policy, consistent with a fixed exchange rate.
21.
The authorities and staff were in broad agreement on the exchange rate
assessment. Staff’s analysis suggests that Belize’s exchange rate peg is broadly consistent
with fundamentals, but external stability is still vulnerable (Box 2). With Belize’s high
external financing needs, the external sector is susceptible to exogenous shocks (especially,
on the terms of trade, tourism receipts, interest rates, and weather events). This underscores

The authorities explained that current regulations fall short of international standards, as they require no
provisioning on the collateralized portion of a distressed loan.

11
the need for fiscal consolidation and makes the case for a gradual further increase in the
foreign reserve position to enhance the defenses against shocks.
E. Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction
22.
The authorities seek to reinvigorate growth prospects and reduce the poverty
rate to 35 percent by 2013. The development plan for 2010–13 focuses on job creation and
identifies sources of growth in tourism, agro-industry, and fishing. It rests on five pillars:
developing small enterprises; strengthening export trade capacity; enhancing human
development; addressing social dislocations and reducing crime; and managing
environmental and natural disaster risk. The plan seeks to strengthen competitiveness by
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, high costs of financing, and red tape. It contains
investment and social plans that will be assessed and integrated into the multiyear budget and
presented to donors later this year.
23.
The authorities recently announced a plan to sell shares in the telephone
company (BTL) starting in October. This company was nationalized by the government in
August 2009, on the grounds that it enjoyed excessive market power resulting from
privileges granted by the previous government—the Supreme Court of Belize ruled these
privileges unlawful. Under the authorities’ plan, a controlling majority of the company would
be sold to domestic investors (including the SSB), with the remaining minority shareholdings
sold to foreign investors. The authorities have indicated that they are at an early stage in the
negotiations with the previous owners for compensation. Staff highlighted the need for an
early resolution of this issue to avoid affecting adversely the investment climate, and
encouraged the authorities to avoid placing pressure on public debt in the financing of this
plan.
24.
Recent legislation on contempt of court could cloud the investment climate.5 In
March 2010, Parliament amended the Supreme Court Judicature Act, to empower the Court
to impose increased penalties or imprisonment for contempt of court. In the authorities’ view,
this amendment strengthens the rule of law, as it reinforces existing provisions related to
contempt of the court, including by providing that international judgments or awards
obtained in violation of Belize Court injunctions shall be unenforceable in Belize. However,
staff cautioned that these changes may be perceived by investors as limiting the scope for
arbitration in commercial disputes, with the unintended result of deterring private investment.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook for Belize has improved, but key
challenges have emerged. In the wake of the global slowdown and severe floods, moderate
economic growth has resumed since late 2009 and foreign reserves have strengthened,

supported by prudent macroeconomic management. Tax revenue actions were also taken,
aimed at stabilizing the high public debt ratio. However, the banking system is now facing
risks, and social conditions have weakened.
26.
The macroeconomic framework will need to be further strengthened to ease
Belize’s vulnerability to shocks and improve growth and social prospects. With expected
sluggish growth in exports and tourism, and reduced access to external funding, prospects for
growth and employment are limited. Thus, medium-term policies will need to focus on
strategies to achieve debt sustainability, protect banking system stability, and further
strengthen the external position to create an environment for increased private investment.
27.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy should be reinforced to achieve debt
sustainability, while providing space for priority social spending. To this end, the primary
surplus should be gradually raised to steadily reduce the public debt ratio. Reforms are
needed to enhance tax compliance; contain the wage bill growth; and make the pension
system sustainable. Moving ahead with plans to improve public financial management should
help entrench fiscal consolidation. Lower debt ratios would provide additional space to
respond to adverse shocks and facilitate the future rollover of amortizations falling due from
the restructured external private debt.
28.
Protecting the stability of the banking system is an immediate priority. The
increase in overdue loans in three banks that account for a sizeable portion of the banking
system is a source of concern. Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to supervise banks
more closely and seek agreement with shareholders on recapitalization plans for a few banks,
while, strengthening credit risk controls. To mitigate risks, the authorities are strongly
encouraged to ensure that the corrective plans for the three banks are rapidly implemented
and, if needed, stand ready to take additional action. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to
upgrade the regulatory and bank resolution frameworks. Present plans to improve prudential
rules should also help provide banks with better protection against credit risks.
29.
The fixed exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, but
risks to external stability remain. The fixed exchange rate has provided an adequate anchor
for macroeconomic policies and expectations. While the present foreign reserve position
offers some cushion to near-term risk, Belize remains vulnerable to shocks, due to
persistently high external financing needs and risks in the banking system. Hence, the
stability of the exchange rate system crucially depends on sustained fiscal consolidation,
strengthening of the banking system, and the maintenance of a disciplined monetary stance.
With these policies and a further build up of foreign reserves, Belize would have stronger
defenses to downside risks.
30.
Recent improvements to the monetary policy framework are welcomed. The
gradual shift to market-based monetary instruments should provide a more flexible liquidity
management, help strengthen foreign reserves further, and reduce costs to financial
intermediation. Belize should make further progress in this area along the lines of previous

13
Fund recommendations. The authorities are encouraged to phase out the remaining interest
rate floor on savings deposits.
31.
The authorities’ development plan provides a basis to raise growth potential and
reduce poverty. It rightly identifies key sectors with growth potential and envisages
strategies to improve competitiveness. Implementing this plan will require the mobilization
of public and private investment and the support from multilaterals and donors. Priority
public investment and social projects will need to be adequately integrated into the mediumterm budgeting framework and consistent with fiscal consolidation. Fostering private
investment will also require a substantial improvement in the business climate, including
with clear and stable rules.
32.
The next Article IV consultation is expected to be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Belize—Improvements to the Framework for Monetary Policy
The authorities have taken steps to gradually introduce market-based government securities for
liquidity management and strengthen the conduct of monetary policy.
1.
Traditionally, monetary policy had been conducted through direct instruments. These
instruments have included liquidity asset requirements (equivalent to 23 percent of deposits at
present), part of which held in non-remunerated cash reserve requirements. With liquidity unevenly
distributed across banks, increases in reserve or liquid asset requirements had placed an undue
burden on banks with low liquidity and often failed to mop up the desired funds. In addition, the
ceiling on the outstanding stock of government securities had been set at a relatively low level,
which had led the central government to use its overdraft facility at the central bank on a protracted
basis.
2.
In line with Fund advice, in early 2010 the authorities introduced market-based
government securities to manage liquidity:


In April 2010, the ceiling on outstanding government securities was raised significantly (from
BZ$175 million to BZ$425 million), and the maturity of the securities increased from 5 years
to 10 years.



To allow the central bank to conduct open market operations, the government issued
securities to the central bank, with a view to virtually closing the overdraft facility. In the
future, the overdraft facility is to be used primarily for emergency situations. Its ceiling has
been lowered from 20 percent of the government’s current revenue in the previous fiscal year
to 8.5 percent, and the ceiling on central bank holdings of government securities raised from
7 times its capital to 10 times.



In May 2009, the interest rate ceiling on government securities (3.25 percent) was eliminated
and competitive auctions were introduced.



Within the liquid asset requirement, which has remained unchanged at 23 percent of deposits,
the cash reserve requirement has been lowered from 10 percent to 8.5 percent and a minimum
requirement on holdings of short-term government securities, equivalent to 6.5 percent of
deposits, has been introduced.

3.
The central bank has taken additional actions to improve liquidity management. In
particular, it has been improving its capacity for liquidity forecasting, to adequately assess the
amount of government securities to be placed through the auctions. In August 2009, the central
bank converted the fixed interest rate (11 percent) on interbank market transactions into a ceiling,
and recent transactions have taken place at interest rates below 7 percent. In April 2010, it
prohibited firms under the export processing zone (EPZ) to make domestic payments in U.S. dollars
and required firms in the EPZ and the commercial free zone to register with the central bank all
their operations with offshore banks. This is intended to raise the transactional demand for domestic
currency while strengthening existing capital controls.

15
Box 2. Belize—Exchange Rate Assessment and External Stability

In real effective terms, Belize’s currency has recently appreciated, after a period of steady
depreciation. From June 2008—when it reached its lowest level since 1980—to March 2010, it
appreciated by 3.5 percent, largely driven by a temporary increase in domestic inflation and the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In contrast, it had depreciated by 10.2 percent over the preceding
10-year period, reflecting in part low domestic inflation in Belize relative to its trading partners.

Based on CGER methodology, the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with its
equilibrium level and consistent with external stability. The equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) has depreciated slightly over time as a result of a steady decline in the economy’s net foreign
asset position and a weakening in the terms of trade. Notwithstanding, the ERER approach suggests
that the Belize dollar still remained slightly undervalued at end-2009 (by 5 percent). The external
sustainability (ES) approach suggests that a small depreciation (4 percent) would stabilize the net
foreign asset position, while the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach also points to a small
depreciation (5 percent) to bring the projected external current account deficit (nearly 8 percent of
GDP) down to its norm level (5.5 percent of GDP) over the medium term.

1/ The dotted lines around the equilibrium exchange
rate represent 90 percent conf idence interv als of the
prediction.



The external debt sustainability analysis also confirms these results, although it signals
some vulnerability (Appendix II). Under present policies and the fixed exchange rate, the projected
non-interest current account deficit is consistent with a moderately declining external debt-to-GDP
ratio through 2015. However, the external financing needs would remain high, leaving the external
sector vulnerable to exogenous shocks.

The overall health of the banking system has deteriorated, with three banks
facing financial weaknesses.


Two small banks. In June 2010, their NPLs amounted to 35 percent and 44 percent of
total loans, respectively. Together, they held 7 percent of deposits in the system
(8.25 percent of GDP).



One large bank. The bank recently reclassified distressed loans in the commercial,
service, and real estate sectors. As a result, its NPLs doubled to 34 percent of total loans
over the first half of this year. In addition, it made capital charges for assets that had
been under litigation since 2008.



Other banks. The remaining banks are liquid and appear well capitalized, with a
capital adequacy ratio of 25 percent (Appendix table 1). NPLs net of provisions amount
to 8 percent of loans or 27 percent of capital.
Shortcomings exist in the current resolution and prudential frameworks.
While supervisory powers to take pre-resolution action appear adequate,
implementation capacity is limited. The central bank has powers to remove officers
from banks, restrict loan and deposit growth, and request elimination of capital and
provision shortfalls. The central bank plans to continue enhancing its human capital to
monitor these procedures, and would also need to have an in-house legal counsel to
oversee the process.

30


The bank resolution framework is weak. At present, the initiation of ‘statutory
administration’ process requires ministerial and judicial approval. Any reorganization
of a bank under statutory administration requires Supreme Court approval and is
subject to veto powers exercisable by depositors and other creditors. Relevant
legislation provides no clear time limit for the completion of the ‘statutory
administration’ process and, in the absence of a deposit insurance scheme, a long period
of depositor lock out would be likely in a resolution under the current framework. In
addition, the central bank has no legal power as a resolution authority to implement
“purchase and assumption” type of resolutions or to impose changes to the capital
structure of a bank (for example via debt-to-equity conversions and other devices
common in more sophisticated resolution regimes).



Prudential rules fall short of international best practice and lead to balance-sheet
risks. In particular, present rules exempt the collateralized portion of distress loans
from provisioning and fail to adjust for the overvaluation of collateral.

3.




Staff made recommendations to strengthen banking stability.
Containing risks. Specifically,


Conduct on-site inspections simultaneously and regularly at banks; and



Ask shareholders to develop credible recapitalization plans for a few banks.

Upgrading the resolution and prudential frameworks. Specifically,


Put in place promptly upgraded regulatory and bank resolution frameworks; and



Strengthen loan classification and provision rules, including eligibility of
collateral and its valuation, in line with international best practice.

31
APPENDIX II—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
The DSA projects somewhat higher public debt ratios than in the 2009 Article IV
consultation, due to weaker fiscal performance and slower growth derived from adverse
shocks in 2008–09. The baseline scenario shows that debt remains high and vulnerable to
shocks over the medium term. The strengthened policy scenario places the debt ratio on a
firm downward path.
A. Key Assumptions
1.
Both scenarios. They were constructed around the two scenarios described in
Tables 5 and 6; assume that multilateral and bilateral loans are borrowed at LIBOR plus
100 bps; and incorporate the step-up interest rate (from 4.25 percent in 2009 to 8.5 percent by
2012) on restructured debt.
2.
Baseline scenario. It assumes that domestic debt increases slightly in 2011–12 and is
broadly constant thereafter, and that projected financing needs will be covered primarily by
external commercial creditors at market interest rates (10-year U.S. T-Bond plus 400 bps),
and to a lesser extent by multilaterals. FDI is projected to remain below historical levels.
3.
Active scenario. It assumes that the fiscal stance will be strengthened and that
multilateral financing will be available to meet projected financing needs and that improved
confidence will bring FDI inflows to historical levels.
B. Assessment
4.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt would remain at slightly under
80 percent of GDP through 2015. The stable debt ratio reflects the positive effect of a
gradual increase in growth that offsets the impact of the step-up in coupon rates on
restructured debt. Public sector financing needs would reach 6.3 percent of GDP by 2015.
For the remainder of the decade, the debt ratio would increase steadily, as the projected
primary surplus would remain low (see Table 6a).
5.
Bound tests highlight that the public debt trajectory is vulnerable to standards
shocks. Since about 90 percent of total public debt was denominated in foreign currency in
2009, the debt ratio is particularly sensitive to the depreciation shock—with a 30 percent
depreciation, total debt would climb to about 115 percent of GDP and then follow a similar
trajectory to that of the baseline. The debt ratio is also highly sensitive to shocks in growth
and the primary balance and to a slightly lesser extent to shocks in interest rates and
contingent liabilities, which could arise from the pension system or bank recapitalization.
6.
Under the active scenario, the public debt ratio declines steadily to under
60 percent by 2015. A strengthened fiscal stance and higher availability of multilateral
financing at more favorable terms result in an improved dynamics and the targeted debt ratio
of 40 percent would be reached by the end of the decade (see Table 6b). Public sector

32
financing needs would be under 2 percent of GDP per year. Bound tests reveal reduced
vulnerability to standard shocks compared to the baseline scenario, although the standard
depreciation shock would result in a substantial step-increase in the debt ratio, followed by a
steady decline.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and alpha = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

1/ Public sector debt includes central government, publicly guaranteed external debt and other public sector external debt. External debt is on a gross basis, while domestic debt is on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of 2015
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

III. Country Strategy

Implementation of the IDB Country Strategy with Belize (2008-2012). The draft Country
Strategy has four development objectives: (i) Ensure sound fiscal management and public
sector transparency; (ii) Create conditions for and restore sustainable, private sector led
growth; (iii) Improve human resource development and social protection; and (iv)
Rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. Approvals to date under this strategy have reached
US$51.5 million (six projects). The approved program includes 4 investment loans that will
contribute towards tourism, agriculture and infrastructure development, land management,
and a policy based loan targeting reforms in the education, health and fiscal policy sectors.
Strategy results to date include the introduction of a medium-term fiscal framework in the
2010/11 budget; approval of amendment to the Education Act establishing the creation of the
National Teaching Services Commission; and reconstruction and localized repairs of the road
network, replacement and repair of culverts, and replacement of bridges and crossings
damaged by the floods of 2008.

III. Economic and Sector Work

The major objective of CDB’s Country Strategy which covered the period 2007-09, was to
enhance sustainable economic growth by: supporting attempts to correct fiscal and external
imbalances; financing investments that were critical for enhancing growth; lending to eligible
private sector entities; and financing critical social development projects. Most assistance
contemplated under the strategy has been executed. The authorities have been making
significant effort to address the difficult fiscal and debt consequences that had resulted from
the expansionary policies prior to 2005. In December 2006, a Policy Based Loan (PBL) of
US$25 million was approved, together with technical assistance (TA) support by way of
additional loan and grants to assist in ensuring the sustainability of fiscal and structural
reforms being implemented. The loan was fully disbursed by the first quarter of 2009. The
strategy recognized that the continuation of the fiscal and external imbalances will affect
Belize’s ability to undertake critical investments in social and economic infrastructure. The
PBL was intended to help close the fiscal and external financing gaps over the short to
medium term, while it continued to implement corrective measures, including the
restructuring of its debt, the reform of its tax regime and the strengthening of fiscal
management capacity. Parallel PBL TA was also approved and included a TA loan for the
modernization of the Customs and Excise Department, and TA grants of US$101,200 each,

7
for the modernization of financial regulations, and to assist Belize to establish an appropriate
institutional framework for macro-economic management.
With respect to infrastructure to enhance growth prospects, in December 2006, the Bank
approved a loan of US$12.6 million for the upgrade of the Placencia road which was
appraised to have significant social and economic benefits. CDB has also continued to
respond to Belize’s natural disaster emergency needs, and in 2008, approved a loan of
US$8.8 million for the reconstruction of a major bridge which was destroyed by flood water.
CDB has maintained its focus on direct poverty reduction through the Basic Needs Trust
Fund, while disbursements have continued under the Belize Social Investment Fund (BSIF).
While the funds under BSIF are expected to be exhausted by the third quarter of 2010, a
second loan amounting to US$15 million is being appraised.
There have also been some efforts to assist the private sector, including a US$10 million line
of credit for on-lending to the private sector and households through the Development
Finance Corporation (DFC). The DFC was revamped in 2009 to facilitate lending activity. Its
lending operations had been previously curtailed as part of a process to wind down its
activities, and this was one of the elements of Belize’s fiscal adjustment program. Prior
lending to the private sector included a US$8.3 million to Belize Cogeneration Energy Ltd
(Belcogen) which was approved in 2005.
Going forward, Belize needs to build on the success of its macroeconomic adjustment
program, while navigating through a challenging global environment, characterized by slow
recovery among major developed economies. Thus, in seeking to further assist Belize, CDB
staff will soon commence preparation of the draft Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for the
period 2011-13. In drafting the new strategy, staff will be cognizant of the severity of
poverty in Belize. The specific projects or areas that will be recommended for CDB’s
intervention will be based on priorities set out in National Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(NPRSP) and subsequent revisions based on the results of the CPA 2009, the recently
completed Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), and the soon to be completed
Horizon 2030 – the long-term national development strategy document.

Appendix V. Belize––Statistical Issues
(As of August 31, 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance. In general, the quality, coverage, and
timeliness of statistics permit an adequate monitoring of economic developments. However,
the multi-sector statistics report of July 2007 listed shortcomings in national accounts, prices,
external trade, government finance, and labor statistics. The central bank publishes, in regular
intervals, a quarterly bulletin covering developments in the real, fiscal, monetary, and
external sectors, as well as an annual report and a statistical digest.
Real sector: A new national accounts system has been phased-in. Under the new system,
national accounts at constant and current prices are produced quarterly (instead of annually)
and were rebased from the year 1984 to 2000, with quality improvement of estimates at
constant and current prices. Priorities for the period ahead include establishing a user
advisory committee, updating the SNAPC-Belize application to account for changes in the
structure of the economy, modifying the concept of government industrial activity in line
with the 1993 SNA, rebasing the national accounts to 2006, including electricity imports in
the merchandise trade statistics, conducting a survey of activity in the commercial free zone,
disaggregating the imports of the export processing zone, undertaking an inventory of data
sources, updating the register of establishments, annotating all GDP tables to distinguish the
various revision stages, and collecting data on informal activity. The statistical office (SIB) is
assessing the reliability of the establishment survey conducted for 2006, given the low
response rate--conducting a new survey for reference years 2006–08 is an alternative option,
but would result in delays on the current time frame; other options include using general
sales tax (GST) and income taxpayers’ data to validate cost coefficient assumptions.
Prices and labor statistics: With the assistance of the Fund, the SIB is currently compiling a
monthly CPI, that will be tentatively released in January 2011 with data for December 2010
(currently, the CPI is calculated in February, May, August, and November, with a lag of
about three months). During the quarterly price collection in November 2010, staff will
collect and process both the old and the new CPI samples, which will provide the needed
overlap between the two. Moreover, the SIB is updating the CPI market basket on the basis
of the household expenditure survey conducted in 2008-09 (the current survey was conducted
between June 1990 and March 1991). These data were supplemented by secondary data
sources and used to prepare a new item structure at the national level. Labor market statistics
are scarce and available at irregular intervals.
Fiscal accounts: Priorities for the period ahead include preparing a comprehensive list of
institutions that comprise the central government, general government, and the public sector;
evaluating each statutory body to determine its proper sectorization; compiling GFS for the
social security fund; including the social security fund and the extra budgetary units in the
coverage of debt data; treating all government transactions in line with the guidelines of the

9
GFSM 2001, as outlined in Section V of the paper “Government Finance Statistics to
Strengthen Fiscal Analysis” (http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4431);
ensuring that annual financial statements for budgetary central government are audited in a
timely manner; disseminating the statistics for central government aggregates and debt in
accordance with the GDDS recommendations; and disseminating the available monthly data
on budgetary central government revenue, expenditure and financing.
Monetary accounts: The monetary data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Recent
advances include coverage of the largest credit unions, while establishing an integrated
monetary database remains a priority.
Balance of payments: Compilation is based on the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). The authorities are refining the process for collecting relevant data that is
enabling regular quarterly presentation. International Investment Position (IIP) Statistics are
not compiled. There is a need to improve and expand the compilation and dissemination of
external sector statistics. Additional staff and relevant training is highly recommended.
Recommended priorities for the period ahead include modifying several of the annual
balance of payments survey forms to improve data collection.
External debt: Data on public debt, including that of public enterprises is broadly adequate
for surveillance. Authorities have recently started to disseminate private debt statistics.
Development Finance Corporation (DFC): Priorities ahead include recording the financial
support provided by the government to DFC in recent years; compiling a consolidated
sectoral balance sheet for insurance companies and the Belize mutual fund; and renewing
efforts to collect balance sheet data from the DFC using principles outlined in the GFSM
2001 and the draft Public Sector Debt Guide being prepared by STA and aligned with it (the
GFSM 2001).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since September 27, 2006.
No data ROSC is available.
III. Reporting to STA
International Investment Position (IIP) Statistics are not compiled. No fiscal data are being
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or in the IFS.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 15, 2010
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report (SM/10/264). It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal
2.
Economic developments have remained broadly in line with projections in
the staff report. GDP growth reached 2.4 percent (y-o-y) in the second quarter of 2010,
supported by government services and commerce, and is running at a pace of 2 percent
for the year as a whole. After peaking in July, net international reserves fell slightly to
US$215 million in August, as the government paid interest on its external bonded debt
(Superbond). In the 12-month period through August, bank deposits remained stable
while credit to the private sector contracted by 4 percent, signaling a pause in the pace of
financial deepening observed in previous years. The authorities plan to lower the floor on
the interest rate on saving deposits by 100 basis points to 3½ percent in early November.
3.
Overdue loans in the banking system have declined somewhat. A large
domestic bank has restructured some loan facilities and, as a result, its overdue loans
have declined from 34 percent of total loans in June to 30 percent in August. The
authorities have asked this bank to increase its capital, but are concerned that such
increase may only materialize slowly. The financial situation of the rest of the banks in
the system has remained broadly stable.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On October 15, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belize.1
Background
The Belizean economy in the past two years has been vulnerable to adverse shocks mainly
because of a weak external position, policy rigidities, and reduced access to external financing.
Since 2006, growth has been lackluster, with sources limited mostly to petroleum extraction and
tourism-related construction. In 2007, debt restructuring eased external debt service, but public
debt has remained high, limiting the policy capacity to respond to shocks. Macroeconomic
management was complicated in 2008 by soaring fuel and food prices.
Economic activity stagnated in 2009, as a result of the global slowdown and the lingering
effects from the 2008 floods. Inflation fell to minus 0.4 percent during 2009, driven by a reversal
in fuel and food prices and weak domestic demand. Helped by a lower external current account
deficit and the SDR allocations, foreign reserves have strengthened substantially from the low
levels seen in previous years to reach 3.2 months of imports of goods and services or
160 percent of the country’s external financing needs.
In FY2009/10 (April–March), the fiscal balance weakened by 2 percentage points of GDP, to a
deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP, due to lower grants and higher current spending (mainly wages),

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

despite a decline in investment. The central bank has taken steps to improve the conduct of
monetary policy, by relying on market-based monetary instruments. In the banking system,
nonperforming loans have risen sharply in the recent period, while provisioning remains low.
For 2010, the economy is projected to grow by 2 percent, on an expansion in electricity
generation. Inflation would rise transitorily to 6 percent, after a rebound in fuel prices and recent
tax measures. Despite some increase in debt payments abroad, the external current account
deficit would narrow to under 6 percent of GDP, reflecting lower energy and FDI-related imports.
The foreign reserve position would improve slightly. Despite tax revenue actions taken in April,
the budgeted fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 2.2 percent of GDP in FY2010/11, due largely
to lower grant disbursements and increased investment. The public debt is projected to decline
slightly under 80 percent of GDP at year-end.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management
in the face of the global crisis and severe floods. Growth has resumed, albeit at a slow pace,
and the external position has improved. Nevertheless, the Belize economy remains vulnerable
to shocks, with weak public finances, limited external financing, and risks in the banking system.
This vulnerability highlights the urgency of further rebuilding macroeconomic and financial
buffers, strengthening the banking system, and promoting an environment conducive to private
sector-led growth.
Directors emphasized the need for an ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy, with a view to
reducing public debt to more sustainable levels over time. They supported plans to improve
public financial management and tax administration, building on recent progress in revenue
reform. Directors encouraged further efforts to contain the public sector’s wage bill and to put
the pension system on a sounder footing, and welcomed the authorities’ intention to build
consensus around their reform program. They also considered it important to create space for
priority social spending and infrastructure investment in a manner consistent with the fiscal
consolidation strategy, and to incorporate plans in these areas into a medium-term budget
framework.
Directors underscored that protecting the stability of the banking system is a priority. This will
require an agreement on recapitalization plans for a few banks and their early implementation.
Directors welcomed plans to upgrade the regulatory and bank resolution frameworks, bringing
prudential rules in line with international best practices, with technical assistance from the Fund.
They also welcomed ongoing efforts to intensify bank oversight and looked forward to continued
progress in the supervision of the offshore and non-banking sectors.
Directors welcomed recent improvements in the monetary policy framework and liquidity
management, particularly a shift to more market-based monetary instruments. They stressed
that the fixed exchange rate regime has provided an anchor for macroeconomic policies and
expectations. Its long-term stability depends on sustained fiscal consolidation, a disciplined
monetary policy, and strengthened financial stability.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ development plan, which seeks to boost competitiveness
and private investment. Its successful delivery, along with adequate donor support, will go a

long way toward raising medium-term economic prospects and reducing poverty. Continued
improvements in the business climate would help foster private sector-led growth.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director for Belize
and Peter McGoldrick, Advisor to Executive Director
October 15, 2010
Our authorities have generally welcomed and valued the engagement with the Fund. Capacity
building – made possible by technical assistance, whether by CARTAC on the revenue side
or, more recently, by MCM and LEG on financial sector regulation and monetary policy tool
enhancement issues – is especially welcome and valued, not only in Belize but the region as a
whole. Similarly, our authorities welcome a transparent and open consultation process. This
particular consultation has highlighted many concerns that our authorities share and they
welcome and appreciate continued Fund assistance in addressing these. It is exactly this
appreciation of the Fund’s ability to transmit technical capacity and to provide a valuable
independent assessment of an economy’s state of affairs that has always encouraged our
authorities to engage with the Fund in an open and transparent manner and they intend to
continue to do so in the future.

Staff rightly highlights Belizean vulnerability to external shocks. Since 2007 a succession of
natural disasters, which caused considerable damage to the economy, and global
macroeconomic shocks, such as high inflation and the most recent global crisis, have
rendered the implementation of an adjustment program very difficult, indeed. Nonetheless,
the Belizean macroeconomic performance has remained resilient by regional standards. Much
like other economies in the region, however, the Belizean economy will likely be confounded
by a low-growth external environment going forward as well as high debt levels. Hence, it is
not clear that making adjustments in the near-term shall be any easier to achieve. Our
authorities take on board, however, that certain measures need to be taken in order to address
underlying vulnerabilities. Certainly, greater room for manoeuvre must be created. Positive
growth surprises and improved revenue collection from customs revenue and improved
public financial management aside, fiscal restraint on recurrent spending is one of the few
areas where this might be possible. Further, our authorities accept the external position will
continue to strengthen with a continuation, albeit in a more gradual manner, of reserve
accumulation. Likewise, building on the basis of recent concerted efforts to improve the
monetary system should provide better liquidity management, thus reducing banks’ reserve
requirements. As a pendent, a comprehensive reform of the financial sector is underway
which should buttress financial stability. Finally, our authorities have chosen to foster an
investment climate, underpinned by the rule of law, which is attractive to investors. In this
respect, negotiations are underway with a strategic investor to bring a telecommunications
company to market. Of course, a successful completion of this process would provide proof
of the favourable investment climate in Belize.

2
Like for many in the region, generating sustainable and independent growth dynamics
remains a difficult exercise. Positive external shocks aside, our authorities hope to continue
developing sustainable growth potential and poverty reduction as outlined in their
development plan. As investment remains key to this vision, they have prioritised addressing
factors that might limit credit growth, such as long-standing issues in the monetary and
financial system, especially those of a structural and regulatory nature. Similarly, our
Belizean authorities recognise that FDI can also help generate significant growth and
employment, which is why external stability and rule of law are sacrosanct.

External shocks and sluggish growth have exacerbated fiscal constraints over the past years
and our authorities remain committed to further fiscal consolidation, especially by improving
customs collection and public financial management. Our authorities agree that external
shocks have, over the past several years, slowed the pace of fiscal consolidation. We note the
growth in recurrent spending and, while addressing this in the short-run may be difficult, our
authorities recognise that establishing consensus on restraint in this regard would be an
appropriate way to spread the adjustment burden.

As staff state, the monetary policy framework continues to improve apace and our authorities
are committed to a disciplined monetary policy, with an aim to maintaining a fixed exchange
rate. Over the past years, our authorities have made considerable progress in the area of
monetary policy. Indeed, this has been a showcase for the benefits of Fund engagement and
our authorities hope to continue to benefit from technical capacity and advice from the Fund.
Here, our authorities envisage further developing monetary policy instruments, especially
with regard to liquidity management and diversification of policy instruments. As for the
exchange rate, our authorities agree that the exchange rate is about fairly valued. Nonetheless,
they recognise the importance of having heeded Fund advice about the desirability of a
foreign reserve buffer when maintaining an exchange peg. Hence, they swiftly moved to
accumulate reserves to much more comfortable levels and concur with staff that continued
accumulation, albeit at a more gradual pace, should further bolster Belize’s resilience to
external shock.

Our authorities continue to be firmly committed to and actively engaged in the task of
enhancing financial sector stability. In order to achieve this goal, our authorities have
determined the need to address long-standing issues in the financial system. This is an
ongoing process and our authorities are grateful for the expert assistance the Fund has
provided in this regard. Of course, addressing such structural issues entails risks and, thus,
requires resolve and tact. Hence, our authorities are in close contact with their partners in the
financial sector to resolve outstanding issues. Certainly, our authorities look forward to
continued involvement with staff at this level.

Our authorities are firmly committed to structural reform with an aim at reducing poverty,
enhancing activity and employment, and increasing investment. Generation of sustainable
growth is central to Belize’s continued economic recovery and stabilisation. In line with this,
our authorities recognise the importance of addressing business needs. As for many countries
in the region, capacity remains a considerable constraint. Given the similarity of needs across
the region, assistance in developing technical capacity could help to identify needs and drive
improvements in conditions. One might wonder if a regional and centralised approach could
be co-ordinated by an agency like CARTAC in order to deliver such capacity. As for the rule
of law, our authorities can unequivocally state that they fully subscribe to it – the issue of its
independence has classically been a prerequisite for its relevance to society and our
authorities fully recognise this. For their part, they have so far underscored their commitment
to due process by remaining open and transparent about any issues brought to their attention
by the staff. Further, our authorities hope to prove the relevance of Belize as an economy
worth investing in, also by attracting FDI. This not least with respect to a telecoms company,
which is to be brought to market in the near future; talks with a strategic investor have
already begun. Success in this would certainly challenge staff’s notions that investors may be
deterred by what is merely the rule of law in Belize. Certainly, the respect of due process is
required with respect to courts and our authorities recognise this duly. In this regard,
provision of commensurate compensation pursuant cases still requiring settlement will further
underpin our authorities’ intentions to uphold the rule of law and should prove fully sufficient
to quell any concerns staff purports to have that any particular investor might not be treated
as an equal before the law.
