IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with
Islamic Republic of Mauritania
On April 25, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Islamic Republic of Mauritania.1
The global economic landscape has deteriorated since the 2014 Article IV Consultation and
Mauritania continues to face a negative terms-of-trade shock as a result of the fall of
international metal prices. The authorities’ initial response was geared to supporting economic
activity with countercyclical policies using fiscal and external buffers built during the boom
years for metal prices. As the terms-of-trade shock became increasingly perceived as longlasting, the authorities have started adjusting their fiscal and exchange rate policies, including
measures to strengthen revenues and contain current expenditures, and allowing for nominal
depreciation. Growth slowed to about 2 percent in 2015 due to lower mining activity and slower
construction and fishing activity because of base effects, and is expected to rebound to
4.1 percent in 2016.
The slowdown in 2015 economic growth was accompanied by inflation easing to 0.5 percent on
account of lower international prices and real exchange rate appreciation. Lower domestic
demand and import prices led to an improvement in the current account deficit, though it
remained elevated at 19 percent of GDP. Reserves coverage increased to 7.7 months of nonextractive imports supported by external financing. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants)
deteriorated despite higher revenues generated mainly from a lack of adjustment in domestic
energy prices in the face of falling international oil prices and some restrain in current spending.
Public debt reached 93 percent of GDP by end-2015 (including a passive bilateral debt
estimated at 20.9 percent of GDP at end-2015) as the authorities borrowed for priority
investment projects and for external support. The debt service-to-revenue ratio remained at

10.3 percent, as public debt is mostly contracted on concessional terms. With the economic
slowdown, liquidity ratios declined but the banking system remained broadly liquid.
While real GDP growth is projected to rebound to 4.1 percent in 2016 because of higher iron ore
production from a new mine, non-extractive GDP growth is projected to remain subdued and
will recover to 4 percent by 2018. Subdued economic activity, compounded with limited
interbank market and high concentration in credit or deposit portfolios, could hinder the capacity
of the financial sector to channel credit toward private sector activity, hampering efforts to
achieve more diversified and robust economic growth. Over the medium term, staff projects the
current account deficit to remain above 10 percent of GDP despite improving non-extractive
exports associated with economic diversification efforts, which will also result in some pick-up
in FDI. Assuming the cancellation of the passive bilateral debt at end-2016, external debt is
projected to peak at 79 percent of GDP by 2018 as the authorities sustain investment spending.
Public debt is projected at 81 percent by 2021 and the debt service-to-revenue ratio is expected
to rise to 22 percent in the medium-term. Under current policies, gross international reserves are
projected to fall below the authorities’ target of three months of imports (excluding extractive)
by 2020.
Risks to the outlook are tilted mainly to the downside and the economy remains vulnerable to
external shocks. Mauritania is vulnerable to higher-than-envisaged oil prices and/or lower iron
ore prices, deterioration in regional security, and domestic policy implementation risks. These
could lower growth potential over the medium term. On the upside to economic activity, a
rebound in iron ore prices, an expansion in gold mining capacity and accelerated exploration
associated with Kosmos’ gas discovery would boost economic prospects.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the policies undertaken by the authorities to support
macroeconomic stability in the face of a large and persistent negative terms-of-trade shock. In
view of heightened global economic uncertainty, they encouraged the authorities to remain
vigilant and to step up policy efforts to put public debt on a downward trend, support external
stability, and reinvigorate structural reforms to promote economic diversification and inclusive
growth.
Directors welcomed the gradual nominal exchange rate adjustment since September 2014. They
noted that the current account deficit remains elevated and agreed that continued exchange rate
flexibility, together with fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, would allow for smoother
adjustment to fundamentals and improve external stability by making the economy more resilient
to shocks. A strengthened monetary policy framework and exchange market reforms will be

important in supporting greater exchange rate flexibility. Directors encouraged the authorities to
eliminate the exchange restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII as soon as
possible.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ determination to advance fiscal consolidation by increasing
non-extractive revenues and restraining current spending while safeguarding infrastructure
investment. They saw a need for additional adjustment to put debt on a downward trend over the
medium term while safeguarding growth. In this regard, they supported a continued broadening
of the tax base; streamlining tax exemptions and subsidies while protecting social spending; and
implementing public service reform. They also stressed the need to enhance public financial and
debt management, and ensure careful selection and monitoring of public investment. They
looked forward to the organic budget law and the program to restructure public institutions and
state-owned enterprises. They recommended strengthening the fiscal framework over time,
including with regard to managing mining wealth.
Directors underscored the need to maintain financial stability. They looked forward to the new
banking and central bank laws to strengthen the prudential and bank resolution frameworks and
the operational independence of the central bank, in line with the FSAP recommendations. They
encouraged the authorities to enhance regulatory compliance and supervision, especially with
regard to liquidity, foreign exchange, concentration, and related-party risks.
Directors noted that the terms-of-trade shock has increased the urgency for economic
diversification, higher productivity, and more inclusive growth. They welcomed the authorities’
advances in enhancing the business environment and promoting private sector investment and
FDI, and highlighted the importance of continued efforts to improve governance, raise the
quality of education and training, and enhance access to finance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Mauritanian economy is facing a significant negative terms-of-trade
shock that is more persistent than initially envisaged. Low iron ore prices have reduced
economic growth, export receipts, and net international reserves; widened the fiscal
deficit; and increased risks to financial stability. Lower oil prices have, on the contrary,
provided some support to the external and fiscal positions. The exchange rate
continued appreciating in real term in 2015, moving counter to the terms-of-trade
shock. The impact of the shock is compounded by a narrow production base, structural
weaknesses and limited policy space in the context of elevated public debt and
pressures on external buffers.
Outlook and Risks. The economic outlook envisages a recovery in economic activity to
4.1 percent in 2016, but risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and the
economy remains vulnerable to external shocks. Over the medium term, current policies
will result in sustained pressures on reserves and elevated debt driven by public
investment plans. Subdued economic activity could hinder the capacity of the financial
sector to channel credit toward private sector activity hampering efforts to achieve
more diversified and robust economic growth. In the short term, the economy is most
vulnerable to higher oil prices, lower-than-envisaged iron ore prices, and a stronger US
dollar under the current exchange rate policy.
Key Policy Recommendations: The deteriorated outlook and heightened global
uncertainty call for an ambitious policy adjustment, while the urgent need to diversify
the economy and promote inclusive growth calls for a determined reform agenda.
Achieving these objectives will require advancing on three pillars: policies to support
external stability through greater exchange rate flexibility, supported by foreign
exchange market reform; policies to support medium-term debt sustainability through
fiscal adjustment and fiscal reforms; and a renewed structural reform effort to support
private sector development and job creation. Policies to strengthen financial stability
are needed to complement these efforts.

prices. Since end-2015, iron ore prices have recovered
by 30 percent, to about $60 in early March, while oil prices have recovered by 6 percent.
2.
The authorities have started adjusting to the external shock, after an initial response
geared to supporting economic activity. In 2014, the authorities responded with countercyclical
policies using fiscal and external buffers built during the boom years for metal prices. As the termsof-trade shock became increasingly perceived as long-lasting, the authorities have relied more
heavily on debt financing and allowed for a nominal depreciation of the ouguiya vis-à-vis the
US dollar since September-2014. The authorities also adopted fiscal consolidation measures in the
revised 2015 budget law and in the initial 2016 budget law.
3.
Implementation of past Fund policy advice has been mixed. Several of the 2014 Article
IV consultation recommendations were implemented (Annex I), with significant policy traction in
banking supervision. The authorities are also advancing with key recommendations from the
2014 FSAP, which are crucial given heightened risks to the financial sector resulting from weaker
economic prospects. However, recommendations to address debt sustainability concerns through
fiscal consolidation and to strengthen the monetary policy framework have yet to be implemented.
Since the 2014 Article IV Consultation, Fund’s advice has focused on addressing the impact of the
terms-of-trade shock in the economy.

4.
The economic and financial effects of the termsof-trade shock have become significant. Since 2014,
Mauritania has faced a continued decline in the terms of
trade, although less pronounced in 2015 due to lower prices
of oil and food. The contribution of the extractive sector to
the economy, exports and fiscal revenues has markedly

declined during 2014–15. Lower mining activity and receipts led to lower fiscal revenues, slower
non-extractive economic activity and domestic demand, and reduced banking sector liquidity.


Real GDP growth slowed in 2015, and inflation eased. Real GDP growth weakened to about
2 percent, from 6.6 percent in 2014, due to lower iron ore production and slower activity in
construction and fishing—both sectors depicting some slowdown due to base effects. Prices
declined by 2.8 percent year-on-year at end-2015 due to lower food prices and real exchange
rate appreciation.



The external deficit remained elevated, FX repatriation eroded and net international
reserves declined. Lower oil and capital imports and higher transfers from abroad helped
compensate for lower mining exports, narrowing the current deficit to 19 percent of GDP.1
The financial account deteriorated on lower FX repatriation from SNIM (the main state-owned
mining company) and subdued FDI, to 11 percent of GDP (from 20 percent in 2013). Gross
reserves, however, increased from 5.3 to 7.7 months of non-extractive imports by end-2015,
because the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) contracted a bilateral loan to support the external
position. Net international reserves covered 5 months of non-extractive imports at end-2015.



The average REER appreciated 5 percent in 2015, moving counter to the terms-of-trade
shock. Since September 2014, the central bank moved toward a de facto “crawl-like” exchange
rate arrangement and the ouguiya depreciated nominally by 9 percent year-on-year vis-à-vis the
US dollar as of January 2016. The nominal depreciation did not prevent an average appreciation
in real effective terms of 5 percent during 2015 due to the strengthening of the US dollar,
hampering external competitiveness and maintaining pressures on reserves.

5.
The 2015 fiscal deficit (excluding grants) deteriorated despite higher revenues
generated mainly from a lack of adjustment in domestic energy prices in the face of falling
international oil prices and some restrain in current spending. The fiscal deficit (excluding
grants), at 5.6 percent of non-extractive GDP (NEGDP), increased by 1.5 percent of NEGDP in 2015,
while revenues associated with the extractive sector declined to 2.9 percent from 8.3 percent of
NEGDP in 2014. To offset these revenue losses, the authorities took a number of measures:


On the revenue side, the 2015 Revised Budget Law incorporated a 2-percentage point increase
in VAT and changes in domestic gasoline taxes to lock-in part of the domestic oil revenues.2 In
addition, the gain in non-tax revenues related to a lack of adjustment in domestic petroleum
products accounted for 3 percent of NEGDP. To promote the consumption of local rice, the

1
EU fishing license, budget support grants and transfers related to the telecom license renewal amounted to
3.4 percent of GDP in 2015.
2
The differential between domestic and international oil prices generates additional oil revenues to the central
government recorded as non-tax revenues, which are traditionally deposited at the Fonds d'Assistance et
d'Intervention pour le Développement (FAID). In August 2015, the revised budget law introduced three major changes
in the customs tax structure of petroleum products: (i) increase in VAT to 20 percent (against 18 percent);
(ii) increase the rates of consumption tax to UM35.5 from UM5.5 per unit; and (iii) raised import duties from UM7 per
unit to 20 percent of the imported value; locking into permanent revenue about 70 percent of the revenues.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

import tax on rice was raised to 35 percent. In addition to these measures, increased tax controls
enabled to achieve higher revenues.


On spending, while current expenditures were reduced by 0.4 percentage points of NEGDP
through savings on subsidies, goods and services and transfers, there was an overrun on
foreign-financed investment, which increased by 1.3 percent of NEGDP.



Regarding financing, the authorities mobilized budget-support grants and external borrowing.
Public debt increased to 93 percent of GDP at end-2015 (Annex II), and the risk of debt distress
remains high.3

6.
The cyclical downturn, compounded with structural weaknesses, has increased risks to
financial stability (Annex III).


Structural weaknesses include fragmentation and low profitability, weak asset quality and high
concentration of deposits and loans portfolios.4 The establishment of new banks has increased
competition, but the narrow formal sector, limited financial services and similar business models
among banks have resulted in a fragmented banking system. Despite this fragmentation, the
credit and deposit portfolios remain highly concentrated in a number of banks. Five banks
represent nearly 60 percent of credit and 70 percent of deposits, and banks have highly
concentrated deposits and loans portfolios, including vis-à-vis related entities. Asset quality has
deteriorated, banks’ risk management practices are weak and profitability is low.



With the economic slowdown, deposit stagnated and net domestic credit growth decelerated in
2015. 5 The banking system remains broadly liquid, but liquidity ratios and buffers have declined.
Liquidity ratios in two banks, representing 14 percent of total banking assets, reached levels
below the prudential 20-percent norm. Asset quality deteriorated, as NPL ratios reached
27.6 percent in December 2015 (from 20 percent at end-2013) in part because of stricter risk
classification introduced in mid-2014.6 Based on reported CAR, banks appear to be wellcapitalized, but data are biased by non-compliance with regulation pertaining to related-party
exposures.7



Banks’ operational costs are reportedly increasing due to higher information compliance
requirements on foreign exchange (FX) transactions with international banks. While Mauritanian

3

See accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis for details. The debt level includes passive debt with KIA, estimated
at 21.5 percent of GDP.

4

Fragmentation in the banking system refers to the large number of small banks, hampering the efficiency of the
system as a whole. Some large banks dominate the system, while the rest are relatively small in size and have limited
capacity to grow.

5

Net domestic credit includes credit to private sector and net credit to central government.

6

The NPL ratio is expected to decline to 20.3 percent when accounting for the transfer of NPLs out of banks’ balance
sheets.

In addition, in the reported RWA, loans to the public sector, including public enterprises, are considered with zero
risk and the part of exposures to related parties above the regulatory limit of 25 percent is not deduced.

banks have not been affected directly by de-risking and have maintained their correspondent
banks, they have created compliance units to fulfill higher demand for information.


The microfinance sector remains highly fragmented, its viability is weak and capital adequacy
ratios remain below regulatory standards. The authorities are developing a strategy to
strengthen the sector and decrease its reliance on public sector support.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The economic outlook has become more uncertain and volatile on account of trends in
international commodity prices and financial sector developments. Under persistent subdued
iron ore prices, the authorities’ current policies are projected to result in continued reserve pressures
and elevated debt over the medium term. The economy will remain vulnerable to external shocks.


In 2016, growth is projected to rebound to
4.1 percent on increased iron ore production from
the Guelb II mine.8 NEGDP is projected to remain
subdued as a result of lower activity in manufacturing
and services. Inflation is projected at 3.8 percent by
end-2016 due to planned tax increases and base
effects.

5.9 (3.5) months of non-extractive imports.



Over the medium term, staff projects the current account deficit to remain above 10 percent of
GDP despite improved non-extractive exports associated with economic diversification efforts,
which will also result in higher FDI. External debt is projected to peak at 82 percent of GDP by
2018 as the authorities sustain investment spending; public debt is projected at nearly
77 percent by 2021 (assuming debt relief for KIA’s passive debt, which is estimated at
21.5 percent of GDP, at end-2016). Under current policies, pressures on reserves will remain and
gross international reserves are projected to fall below the authorities’ target of three months of
non-extractive imports in 2020–21.



Credit to the private sector is projected to slow in 2016–17 as reduced liquidity and a
deteriorated economic outlook for the non-extractive sector increase risk aversion and result in
some credit retrenchment.

The outlook for the financial sector is expected to remain challenging over the
medium term due to reduced liquidity position and subdued economic growth. Reduced
liquidity could potentially constrain access to the FX market for some banks and affect their client
base. Subdued growth could further deteriorate asset quality, hindering profitability and the
capacity of the financial sector to support the private sector and economic growth through credit.
Although network risk is limited due to underdeveloped interbank markets, systemic risk could
increase as a result of high concentration in credit and deposit portfolios and banks’ linkages to
economic groups. A weaker financial sector will be less able to support economic diversification.
9.
Risks to the outlook are predominantly on the downside (Annex IV). In the short term,
the economy is most vulnerable to an increase in oil prices and further strength of the US dollar.
Higher oil prices will put further pressure on external stability and reduce non-tax revenues, as will
lower-than-envisaged iron ore prices. Delays in policy implementation could stall economic
diversification, widen imbalances and set back progress, hindering private sector growth and job
creation, and increasing inequality. In the absence of sustained policy adjustment, macro stability
risks would rise over the medium term, with negative implications for longer-term growth. Lastly,
Mauritania remains vulnerable to a deterioration of the security situation in the region. On the
upside, a rebound in iron ore prices, an expansion in gold mining capacity and accelerated
exploration associated with Kosmos’ gas discovery would boost economic prospects. The authorities
considered the risks to be somewhat overstated, pointing to the progress already made in
implementing adjustment measures and relatively stable economic conditions. They were also
confident that their policies would reduce vulnerabilities and the impact of shocks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The deteriorated outlook and heightened global uncertainty call for a determined and
sustained macroeconomic policy adjustment, while the need for economic diversification and
inclusive growth calls for an ambitious structural reform agenda. The authorities’ steps in 2015
to boost non-mining revenues, achieve savings in spending, and foster exchange rate adjustment
were in the right direction, and the monetary stance reduced liquidity in the banking system but
remained broadly adequate. Projections for a sustained terms-of-trade shock will require the policy
response to be strengthened to support macroeconomic stability over the medium term. Achieving
this objective will require advancing on three pillars: policies to support external sustainability;
policies to support debt sustainability; and renewed structural reforms to support private sector
development and job creation (to be incorporated in the post-2015 development strategy). These
would include greater exchange rate flexibility supported by FX market reforms, renewed fiscal
consolidation efforts to place the public debt on a firm downward trend, and reforms to promote
private sector development and improve competitiveness, trade, and access to credit and FX.
Formulating and implementing such policy agenda will require close coordination to define the
appropriate composition of the policy adjustment and to support policy consistency across the three
pillars—including policies to enhance the resilience of the financial sector by monitoring and
managing financial stability risks. Greater policy flexibility will also be required in light of a more

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

volatile global environment. Hence, strengthening policy formulation and transparency will further
reduce uncertainty, anchor expectations and improve credibility of macro policies.

A. Addressing Risks to External Stability
11.
Mauritania’s external position has weakened, exposing risks to external stability under
current policies. Despite structural reforms envisaged to promote FDI and economic diversification,
the trade balance deficit is expected to remain above 10 percent of GDP and future capital inflows
remain highly uncertain. Reserves will remain under pressure over the medium term and fall below
the authorities’ target level of three-month import coverage (excluding extractive imports) in 2020–
21. High external financing requirements and external debt compound risks to external stability.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to accelerate export growth—especially in nonextractive sectors—to sustain external stability.
12.
Exchange rate policy needs to address the significant overvaluation of the ouguiya.
Tackling the current overvaluation will be critical to support external sustainability and a prerequisite
for economic diversification. The real appreciation of the past two years, the negative terms-of-trade
shock to economic fundamentals and the weak investment climate have led to an overvaluation of
the ouguiya. According to the EBA-lite methodology, the current account deficit is larger than the
norm, the level considered sustainable given economic fundamentals, estimated at a deficit between
3½ and 7 percent of GDP (Annex V). While estimates of exchange rate overvaluation are subject to
significant uncertainty, they are consistent with a persistently elevated non-extractive current
account deficit and limited non-extractive exports.9 The overvaluation of the REER limits the scope
for domestic demand adjustment to support external stability. Staff called for a combination of
measures to bring the exchange rate in line with its medium-term equilibrium value including
continuing exchange rate adjustment and FX market reforms to increase exchange rate flexibility,
fiscal consolidation efforts to reduce aggregate demand and structural reforms to promote
economic diversification.10 The authorities felt that staff’s estimates overstated the degree of
overvaluation and believed that the medium-term current account deficits would be appropriate on
account of stronger export and FDI prospects.
13.
More exchange rate flexibility would be desirable, though views differed on the pace
and the timing of reforms in the foreign exchange market. The BCM and staff agreed that
greater exchange rate flexibility is desirable to enhance the role of the exchange rate as a shock
absorber, allowing the economy to adjust more smoothly to changes in fundamentals and to reduce
reliance on reserves to buffer external shocks. While the authorities viewed their current exchange
rate policy as adequate in allowing them to adapt to varying conditions, staff favored greater
exchange rate flexibility to reflect economic fundamentals, supported by rapid implementation of
9

The degree of overvaluation of the ouguiya in real effective terms for 2015 is estimated between 16 and 78 percent
(Annex V). This range is subject to significant uncertainty associated with the poor fit of the estimates underpinned
by the methodological approaches, assumed trade elasticities and the future path of commodity prices.

Estimates of real exchange rate overvaluation should not be interpreted as the needed nominal exchange rate
adjustment.

reforms in the foreign currency market to support current account sustainability in the context of a
persistent terms-of-trade shock. FX market reforms would change the auction mechanism, allow for
all bids to sell into the market and eliminate direct sales to the private sector, allowing for an
exchange rate that reflects market forces more closely and for a more predictable private sector
access to FX (Box 1). The authorities were receptive to the reform proposals and would like to define
an action plan that also addresses advancing on strengthening the monetary framework.11 Staff
recognizes the importance of a well-functioning foreign exchange market and the need for a steady
adjustment that allows economic agents to adjust smoothly their balance sheets. Given the
moderate exchange rate pass-through and the benign price environment, staff considers that these
reforms can be implemented now, coupled with a prudent monetary stance so as to limit adverse
effects on inflation expectations. Staff supports the authorities’ approach to enhance oversight of
banks’ FX transactions and compliance of daily limits on banks’ FX position and suggested to
manage liquidity proactively to limit risks to exchange rate overshooting and excessive volatility
while preserving reserves.
14.
While the authorities prepare for reforms in the foreign exchange market, greater
exchange rate flexibility could be introduced. As a first step, greater flexibility could be gained by
widening the bands in the current regime. The central bank could also assess whether consideration
should be given to adopting a currency basket as an intermediate anchor toward a more flexible
exchange rate arrangement. A basket reflecting trade composition could reinforce the exchange rate
as a nominal anchor and help prevent further appreciation in real effective terms if the US dollar
strengthens further. In this regard, the authorities remain open to revisiting the adequacy of the
exchange rate regime to facilitate the role of the exchange rate as a shock absorber over the
medium term.
15.
Adopting a more flexible exchange rate regime requires strengthening the monetary
policy framework. The BCM and staff agreed that the current environment of subdued inflation
facilitated formalizing a monetary policy framework by defining quantitative targets and developing
forecasting methods and instruments to manage liquidity more actively. While the current liquidity
level is seen as broadly adequate, staff discussed plans to adapt liquidity management to an
environment of reduced liquidity in the banking system, including by introducing new instruments
such as standing deposit and lending facilities and using proactively reserve requirements. A
prudent monetary policy will be needed to accompany FX market reforms. In parallel, staff agreed
with the BCM on the need to develop tools for assessing and forecasting short-term liquidity, which
may require reorganizing the BCM and closely coordinating with the Treasury. In addition, staff
recommended the recapitalization of the central bank to provide greater operational autonomy.
Ultimately, the BCM will need to define a new monetary policy anchor.

The central bank requested a technical assistance mission, which is scheduled at end-May 2016.

Box 1. Mauritania’s Foreign Exchange Market and Proposals for Reform
Recent Developments
Foreign exchange flows in Mauritania have markedly
changed in composition since end-2013. Mining receipts
have declined by 53 percent in 2013–15, putting pressures
on reserves and on the authorities’ efforts to broaden FX
sources. The decline from mining has been only partially
offset by grants and higher fishing proceeds from stricter
enforcement of repatriation requirements and the renewed
EU agreement. In 2015, in light of reducing external buffers,
the BCM reduced FX supply via direct sales.

Auctions take place during fixing sessions from Monday to Thursday. The auction is a retail auction—banks
introduce individual customers’ orders—and it is a single-price auction—all successful bidders pay/receive
the same price. All FX operations above US$100,000 must be submitted to the auction.
The exchange rate is determined from the supply side. Determination of the final fixing rate follows a
multiple-stage process, as follows:



The BCM has the discretionary power to reject offers to sell considered abusive.



The BCM determines a provisional fixing rate—the most depreciated exchange rate in the supply for
which demand exists.



Then, the BCM decides whether to intervene or not and at which exchange rate—either at the
provisional rate or at a different rate. The final fixing is then determined.



All offers to purchase above UM6 from the final fixing are excluded. Qualified or effective demand is
then sorted from the most to the least depreciated.



Offers to sell are excluded if banks do not comply with the requirement to hold 100 percent of their bids
in ouguiya as excess reserves in their BCM account.



The BCM allocates FX to banks’ clients first, in the order in which they were submitted, and then to
banks on their own account. Unsatisfied or partially-fulfilled orders are cancelled by the end of the
session. FX applies asymmetric commissions of 0.25 percent for purchases and 0.75 percent for sales.

The auction allows the central bank to control prices and quantities but gives rise to an exchange rate
restriction, as demand (associated with current account operations) is not fully satisfied. There is no FX
interbank market and the central bank operates as the main FX supplier. All fishing receipts from the publicowned fishing company transit by the central bank and SNIM repatriates through its account at the BCM.

Box 1. Mauritania’s Foreign Exchange Market and Proposals for Reform (concluded)
Unmet demand is a permanent feature in the market, which leads to resubmission of purchases. Therefore,
demand in the market reflects not only the need for foreign exchange, but the duration required to get it.
Unsatisfied demand (considering demand within the 6-ouguiya limit) increased to 84 percent at end-2015
from 65 percent in 2014; doubling the time needed to acquire foreign exchange (from 3 days in 2013 to
6 days in 2015). This exerted pressures on the exchange rate and the parallel market premium tripled—
though still moderate (at around 5 percent). The high share of unsatisfied demand may not be fully reflected
in the parallel market premium due to the fact that many purchase orders are resubmitted until they get
satisfied. Recently, the BCM resisted depreciation pressures by rejecting more frequently depreciated offers
(considered abusive) and intervening at a different (more appreciated) rate than the fixing.
The imbalances tend to increase when the central bank reduces its intervention while allowing little
adjustment in the exchange rate to equilibrate the market. In addition, the BCM provides FX through direct
sales to the public sector and to the private sector. The final fixing is the exchange rate applied in these
sales.
Proposed FX Market Reform
Based on FSAP recommendations, staff
recommends reforms to enhance price
discovery, increase transparency and
competition, and improve governance.
They will help transitioning to greater
exchange rate flexibility, reducing
imbalances in the market and
developing an FX interbank market.
The proposed measures are
interdependent and complimentary.

In establishing a multiple price auction, a mechanism to prevent giving rise to multiple currency practices will need
to be in place to prevent the deviation between the winning bids from exceeding 2 percent.

B. Fiscal Consolidation Needed, with Stronger Fiscal Framework and
Governance
16.
The 2016 initial budget law aims at a strong fiscal consolidation, which may prove
challenging. The overall deficit excluding grants is projected at 2.5 percent of NEGDP in 2016, with
public spending contracting by 4 percentage points of NEGDP—equivalent to a 10-percent decline
in real terms—making economic growth vulnerable to lower aggregate demand. The authorities are
committed to the ambitious target envisaged in the initial budget law, with any additional revenues
devoted to building buffers. Staff believes, however, that tax revenue mobilization, beyond those
related to petroleum products, would be limited by subdued non-extractive growth and low mining
revenues. Staff also believes that the envisaged reduction in current spending (1.7 percent of
NEGDP) would prove challenging as fiscal outcomes have fallen short of initially-envisaged
consolidation efforts since 2013, largely as a result of higher foreign-financed investment and lower
revenues.12 Given past budget performance, staff projects less fiscal adjustment, with the overall
deficit (excluding grants) at 3.2 percent of NEGDP and some reduction in current spending
(0.7 percent of GDP).
17.
Medium-term fiscal projections under the baseline envisage a gradual fiscal
adjustment that will lower public debt only marginally. Staff envisages the overall balance
(excluding grants) to hover around an average deficit of 3.8 percent of NEGDP in 2017–21,
consistent with authorities’ investment plans under current policies. This baseline takes into account:


Additional tax revenues are expected to result from measures introduced in 2015 on petroleum
products and on VAT, as well as from the new measures introduced by the 2016 initial budget
law reinforcing custom revenues and introducing new exports duties on fish products. The
authorities also reiterated their engagement in increasing non-extractive revenues by expanding
the tax base; reinforcing fiscal controls (better risk management practices and improved
coverage rates); limiting the erosion of the tax base by eliminating revenue losses related to
transfer pricing of foreign mining companies; and improving fiscal information and tax and
custom administration. Staff welcomes these efforts; highlights the difficulty in evaluating the
impact of tax administration measures, and calls for implementing them in a way that promotes
a more equitable taxation.



Non-tax revenues from the lack of adjustment in domestic energy prices in the face of falling
international oil prices will remain substantial during the projection period (averaging
2½ percent of NEGDP per year). Given the uncertainty regarding global oil prices, staff
recommended that any larger-than-envisaged revenues would be used to eliminate domestic
public arrears and accumulating fiscal buffers.

12

According to recent TA, the 2016 tax revenue targets are ambitious and will require renewed efforts on broadening
the tax base and a more equitable distribution of fiscal pressures.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

18.
Additional fiscal adjustment is needed to support debt sustainability over the medium
term. While the authorities recognized the importance of decreasing public debt levels, their current
plans to streamline spending and raise revenues to create fiscal space for social spending and
investment are not sufficient to prevent further increases in public debt. Given the high risk of debt
distress, staff argued for re-orienting fiscal policy toward a medium-term public debt target of
70 percent of GDP as a fiscal anchor and a gradual fiscal consolidation that supports growth
dynamics (Box 2). Achieving primary balances consistent with this debt reduction path will require
higher non-extractive revenue mobilization, rationalization of current spending and a realistic
investment program that goes beyond current plans under the baseline. Such efforts assume
additional fiscal consolidation amounting to 2.2 and 2.5 percent of NEGDP in 2016 and 2017,
respectively. To achieve this adjustment, staff recommended the following:


Additional revenue mobilization should result from broadening the tax base and renewed tax
administration efforts to promote fair taxation and, ultimately, economic activity. Staff also called
for a gradual elimination of tax exemptions (estimated at about 3 percent of GDP) and
emphasized that, ultimately, a durable and sustainable expansion of the tax base also depends
on advancing economic diversification and reducing economic informality.



Control on current spending needs to focus on streamlining the wage bill, subsidies, and
transfers to public institutions. The authorities’ strategy aims at maintaining social spending to
protect the most vulnerable with better targeted transfers. A comprehensive public service
reform, including implementing the integrated management of state personnel (EPMIS), and
further rationalizing spending on goods and services could yield savings of 2.6 percent of
NEGDP over 2016–18.



Public investment spending needs to be streamlined and prioritized to ensure consistency with
fiscal targets and fiscal adjustment efforts. In this context, the authorities are committed to
review the effectiveness of public investment to maximize potential growth effects, while
ensuring consistency with poverty-reduction priorities and absorption capacity. However,
reaching fiscal and debt targets will require reducing external debt disbursements by 30 percent.
Preliminary estimates suggest that, other things equal, such adjustment scenario would reduce
the foreign-financed public investment envelope by 2.2 percent of NEGDP per year over
2016–21. The impact on public investment could be dampened with additional fiscal
consolidations efforts. Financing of public investment should be limited to concessional
borrowing.

Box 2. Anchoring Mauritania’s Fiscal Policies to Reduce Public Debt over the Medium Term
With a high public debt level, a high risk of debt distress driven by lack of diversification and weak capacity, and an
outlook clouded by the global uncertainty, fiscal policies should aim at bringing the public debt on a firm downward
trend toward a medium-term debt target of 70 percent of GDP.

In addition, an analysis of the debt structure shows significant
exposure to exchange rate risks, a bunching of upcoming maturities, and a concentration of oil exporters in the
creditor base. A more rapid depreciation of the ouguiya than the one envisaged under current policies will impact
external debt levels and call for additional fiscal adjustment.

(equivalent to 14.5 percent of GDP). This public debt path will
require that priority investment for development be maintained within a realistic envelope and through additional
fiscal consolidation. The authorities could also seek opportunities to involve the private sector in infrastructure
investment.

Control of operations executed outside the central government. Given that the current coverage of fiscal
statistics is limited to the central government, controls of debt-financed public investment executed outside the
central government will be needed to reach the debt target objective. Going forward, broadening the coverage of
fiscal statistics towards the general government in line with GFSM 2001 and passing the organic budget law will
help anchor fiscal policy to support debt sustainability.
Policy recommendations. Bringing down firmly the public debt over the medium term will help contain the risk of
debt distress and lay the foundation for future growth. Given the weight of foreign debt in particular,
strengthening the export base through economic diversification to help the economy cope better with external
shocks and expand the base for foreign exchange resources is equally urgent. Public investment objectives should
be realistic and should be tailored to provide basic infrastructure and promote private sector participation where
possible.

Such reduction will result, on average, in lower foreign-financed investment by 2½ percent of NEGDP per year if all the
adjustment burden efforts would fall on investment and on the central government.

19.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to advance with significant fiscal structural
reforms, including of public entities. In 2016, the authorities intend to submit to Parliament a
code of tax procedures, the new customs code, and the Organic Law of Finance (LOF). The adoption
of the LOF will help anchor fiscal consolidation towards debt reduction. Moreover, the launch of the
new public institutions restructuring program will strengthen supervision of state enterprises and
other public institutions. A study funded by the World Bank, expected by end-2016, will clarify their
financial situation and their relationship with the central government. Revamping financial
information flows and harmonizing administrative and financial management of public institutions
will start with the five most important EPAs. In terms of cash management, a second-generation
single Treasury account will be effective by December 2016 and improved cash management
practices will include public procurement plans and a monthly central engagement plan at the
Ministry of Economy and Finance.
20.
Limiting deteriorating debt dynamics will involve fiscal consolidation and close
monitoring of borrowing outside the central government. Enhanced debt management
practices require strong institutional coordination, better coverage of public sector activity and
strengthened governance. A consolidated investment strategy under the newly created Ministry of
Economy and Finance will facilitate priority

Ministry of Economy and Finance. Finally, an
assessment of fiscal risks and contingent
liabilities, including those that could arise from SNIM, could help identify fiscal vulnerabilities and
support the restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to address inefficiencies and financial
sustainability. In this vein, priorities include improving their financial reporting; curtailing direct and
indirect subsidies; enhancing governance, transparency and accountability; streamlining corporate
structures to core activities; setting utility tariffs to cost-recovery levels; strengthening the legal
framework for SOE operations; and developing appropriate investment plans.
21.
Addressing fiscal dependence on extractive resources will improve fiscal policy
formulation. The budgetary framework should include a fiscal rule, an explicit fiscal anchor, and a
fiscal stabilization fund that take price volatility into account, while incorporating intergenerational
equity considerations through a resource wealth fund. Strengthening fiscal policy formulation will
help better safeguard the budget against boom-and-bust cycles in nonrenewable resources, reduce

pro-cyclicality, and provide predictability to fiscal policy. Accompanying robust institutions will
enhance the management of mining wealth. The authorities agreed in principle with this approach
but felt that such reforms were premature. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to continue
pursuing reforms in public financial management, including a multiyear fiscal framework and the
approval of the LOF, considered prerequisites for introducing the fiscal rule.

C. Staying Vigilant on Risks to Financial Stability
22.
The authorities agreed that rising risks to financial stability call for more vigilance and
a careful calibration of the policy adjustment. Under current trends, liquidity and asset quality
may reduce banks’ ability to address shocks, extend credit and support economic activity. Liquidity
pressures for some banks may constrain their access to FX market, leading to deposit losses. Banks
may come under strain, whether because of weakening liquidity or asset quality, or because of
exposure to vulnerable sectors (commerce, construction and public works); some banks might
require liquidity support or recapitalization (Annex III). High NPLs could erode capital and limits
banks’ ability to lend. In turn, policy adjustment to the external shock could result in subdued nonextractive growth in the short term; which could weaken balance sheets and generate confidence
shocks. This could place challenging trade-offs on the need for economic rebalancing and could
require heightened coordination with the Ministry of Finance, especially on short-term liquidity
management.
23.
The central bank is stepping up financial sector supervision and efforts to strengthen
prudential and crisis resolution frameworks, in line with FSAP recommendations (Table 8).


In terms of enhancing supervision, the central bank is finalizing IT data transmission; enhancing
data quality; and reinforcing the credit registry for banks’ real-time access. International audits
of all banks should complement those commendable efforts. In parallel, the central bank is
strengthening human resources at the General Directorate for Banking Supervision. Additional
important measures include bringing the CDD under financial supervision and devising a clear
restructuring plan for microfinance institutions.



Adopting a new banking law and the statute of the central bank in 2016 will represent a
fundamental step in transitioning toward a risk-based supervision, including by modernizing the
banking resolution framework, strengthening licensing requirements and enhancing the
independence of the central bank and the protection of supervisors.



Further progress with FSAP recommendations is also necessary to enhance financial stability
including (i) implementing, without delays, the regulation in place; (ii) publishing banks’ financial
statements; (iii) establishing clear qualification system for auditors; and (iv) increasing banks’
contribution to the deposit guarantee fund.

24.
Rising risks call also for stricter enforcement of banking regulation and enhanced
supervision, especially on liquidity, FX position, concentration and related-party lending risks.
In particular, the central bank should consider reviewing penalties and sanctions to align incentives

to compliance. In the face of the specific risks associated to concentration and related-party
exposures, staff calls for strengthening the micro- and macro-prudential frameworks, recapitalizing
some banks and reducing the planned three-year timeframe to comply with related-party exposures
(Annex III). The BCM should also consider activating, if needed, the emergency liquidity assistance to
support illiquid but solvent banks. In the current context, staff also recommends more effective
coordination with the MEF to manage short-term liquidity, a temporary freeze to licensing new
banks and a review of risk classification and weights for public enterprises.

D. Accelerating Structural Reforms to Promote a More Diversified and
Inclusive Growth
25.
The authorities indicated that the external shock increased the urgency for economic
diversification and more inclusive growth. Staff agreed that the structural reform agenda should
focus on promoting a competitive private sector to generate and sustain inclusive growth (Box 3). To
this end, it is necessary to continue to reduce the infrastructure gap, improve the business
environment and facilitate access to finance, including FX. It is also important to reform the
education system and strengthen the social protection system. These reforms will be crucial to
support economic diversification and inclusive growth during the adjustment period and mediumterm sustainable growth.
26.
The authorities plan to continue improving the business environment, but renewed
efforts are needed.


Mauritania, ranked at 168th, was one of the top 10 reformers worldwide in the 2016 Doing
Business ranking. Mauritania eliminated the minimum capital requirement for SMEs; reduced the
time for documentary and border compliance for imports; and expanded borrower coverage in
the credit registry. A new action plan, with the support of the World Bank and African
Development Bank, will focus on simplifying administrative procedures and taxation; clarifying
property rights; modernizing the judicial system and investors’ protection; and re-launching
public private dialogue. Robust use of AML/CFT tools can support efforts to reduce corruption;
which is perceived as an important obstacle to doing business.13 Staff welcomed the authorities’
plans on these fronts, and call for enhancing implementation capacity.



The authorities have identified comparative sectoral advantages (in agriculture, livestock, and
fishing), with plans to increase value-added in production and to diversify the export base which
is now narrowly concentrated in unprocessed fishing and mining. Staff emphasized the
importance of private sector contribution to developing these sectors through FDI and
investment. Staff also noted the risks these sectors could face from climate change shocks.

13

The country ranks poorly in corruption indices (133th out of 140 in the Global Competitiveness Report and 112th
out of 168 in the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index). The AML/CFT regime is planned to be
assessed under the revised FATF by end-2016.



Measures to enhance financial inclusion will help mobilize domestic savings for economic
growth. In this vein, staff supported authorities’ plans to enhance governance of financial
institutions and to diversify financial services through Islamic Finance, and called for promoting
competition, reducing information asymmetry, and developing a sound private-led microfinance
sector. To promote investment, a framework for PPP needs to be developed, taking into account
the need for valuations of fiscal risks.

27.
The authorities’ post-2015 development strategy should support private sector
development and competitiveness. Promoting access to finance, private sector investment and
FDI is the cornerstone to development. The overvaluation of the ouguiya and high costs of banking
services are not supportive of SMEs development and job creation. Access to finance requires also
promoting accessibility through a modern payments system. These measures should also be
accompanied by more predictable private sector’s access to foreign exchange.
28.
Protecting the most vulnerable should remain a priority under the challenging
economic environment. High economic growth in the past supported poverty reduction and
advances in social indicators despite remaining challenges. Access to education has improved,
notably among girls who now enjoy parity in primary school enrollment. Health indicators have also
improved but important geographical and gender inequalities remain. The authorities are
committed to the introduction of a well-targeted cash transfer scheme, whose implementation will
start this year in some regions. The authorities should be ready to increase targeted social transfers
further to protect the poor from the impact of policy adjustment.
29.
Efforts continue to improve statistics. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance
and commendable progress has been made in national accounts and price statistics, but data gaps
remain in balance of payments, fiscal and financial statistics. Social indicators benefited from recent
surveys, but shortcomings remain.14

Box 3. Growth Diagnostic and Constraints to Growth
Mauritania’s growth performance was strong during
the last decade. Growth has been driven by services and
construction, and, more recently, increased mining
production. On average, real GDP grew by 6 percent during
2004–09 and by 5 percent during 2010–15. On the demand
side, public investment has played an important role, and
the external sector contributed negatively to growth. The
deterioration of terms of trade, expected to last until 2018,
will prove challenging for macroeconomic performance.
Staff envisaged growth to average 3.5 percent in 2016–21,
provided that the current account position becomes fully
financed.

However, growth has not been inclusive enough. The spur in growth during the commodity price boom
was driven mostly by capital-intensive sectors. Staff analysis suggests that the most binding constraints to
growth and job creation in Mauritania are macroeconomic risks, microeconomic risks, low productivity and
access to finance, poor external competitiveness, and exposure to shocks.


Macroeconomic risks are reflected in fiscal and external vulnerabilities which affect confidence and
investment.



Microeconomic constraints stem from high electricity tariffs, monopoly market structures, weak
governance, perceived high levels of corruption, and constraints to doing business. Only 18 percent of
population has access to electricity (versus 32 percent in sub-Saharan African countries); less than
2 percent in rural areas. Mauritania still lacks initiatives and policies on actively promoting competition,
curbing unfair business practices and reducing the size of the informal sector. Poor enforcement of
contracts and inefficient administrative and judicial system are major impediments to doing business.



Growth remained constrained by the insufficient
quality of employed labor and lackluster gains in
productivity, with total factor productivity declining by
around 2 percent per year since 2006. To increase
labor productivity, Mauritania will need betterfunctioning labor markets, a workforce equipped with
more relevant skills, and more effective active labor
market programs.

Low access to finance also limits growth performance.
Low bank deposit-to-GDP ratio (25 percent) and
Sources: Penn World Tables; and IMF staff estimates
private credit-to-GDP ratio (30 percent) result in the
bulk of the population and most small and medium size enterprises lacking access to banking services.
Loans are mostly short-term and concentrated on a limited number of clients.



The negative contribution of the external sector to growth reflects poor overall competitiveness. Nonextractive merchandise exports (including fishing) were only about 7 percent of GDP in 2010–15. Limited
external linkages, real exchange rate appreciation, and the weak business environment have been
obstacles.

Box 3. Growth Diagnostic and Constraints to Growth (concluded)
Notwithstanding past achievements, the overarching challenge is to foster economic diversification
through sustainable private sector-led growth. Mauritania needs to reduce its dependence on the mining
and public sectors for growth dynamics. Economic diversification is a priority given the downside risks
relative to iron ore prices and global demand, as it will also increase the resilience to shocks. The
government is aiming to establish a broad-based growth strategy, which would also help sustain the decline
in poverty and inequality. The authorities’ strategy to sustain economic diversification includes closing the
infrastructure gap; supporting development in labor-intensive sectors such as agriculture, livestock
production, and fishing; and moving toward renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.

index, evaluating the vulnerability to extreme climate

over the next 30 years, ranks Mauritania as the 12th
most exposed countries to climate change. Mauritania is
Source: Maplecroft (2016)
the 4th country most prone to drought worldwide. As a
result, the authorities would need to prepare to address negative climate effects on sectors where
comparative advantages have been identified, mainly agriculture and livestock production.

E. Article VIII and Safeguard Issues
30.
The authorities are committed to meeting Mauritania’s obligations under Article VIII
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Since the last Article IV consultation, Mauritania maintains an
exchange restriction arising from the insufficient FX availability at the fixing sessions organized by
the BCM for those transactions that are required to be submitted to these sessions, which was
approved by the Board at the time of the 2014 Article IV Consultation. The authorities request again
Fund’s approval to temporarily maintain the exchange restriction as it continues to be necessary for
BOP reasons and does not discriminate among Fund members. The authorities commit to removing
the restriction within one year following its approval, in the context of planned FX market reforms.
31.
Progress in implementing 2010 safeguards recommendations has been protracted. The
2014 audited financial statements were published, albeit with delay. The central bank has taken
steps to enhance its capacity in the areas of information systems and internal audit, but progress
remains subdued. Legal reforms to strengthen the central bank’ autonomy and governance are
envisaged under the upcoming central banking law. Further, the CBM needs to develop its financial
reporting, which lagged behind international standards.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Mauritania faces a challenging external environment that requires determined policy
efforts in the short term to promote macroeconomic stability and economic diversification. A
significant and durable terms-of-trade shock has reduced economic growth, export receipts, and net
international reserves; widened the fiscal deficit; and increased public debt and risks to financial
stability. These strains are compounded by a weaker-than-envisaged global economic recovery and
heightened volatility and uncertainty about the outlook for commodity prices. The situation requires
an ambitious policy package to foster sustained growth and economic diversification while
protecting the most vulnerable and based on three pillars: policies to support external stability
through greater exchange rate flexibility supported by foreign exchange market reform; policies to
support debt sustainability through enhanced fiscal consolidation and fiscal reforms; and renewed
structural reform efforts to support private sector development and job creation. Together with
greater vigilance on financial stability, this approach would create jobs; reduce external and public
vulnerabilities and support credit and financial stability. Enhanced policy coordination, transparency
and governance would also support policy predictability and help anchor expectations.
33.
Greater exchange rate flexibility, accompanied by fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms, is needed to support external stability. The current account deficit is above the norm
despite some adjustment envisaged over the medium term. Current policies are not sufficient to
address vulnerabilities, mainly high public debt and pressures on external buffers, which would
require deeper adjustment. Priority should be given to allowing greater exchange rate flexibility,
supported by FX market reforms, fiscal consolidation to reduce aggregate demand, and structural
reforms to promote economic diversification. FX market reforms, including those in the auction
mechanism, need to focus on supporting a level-playing field to FX access. Such steps would help
the exchange rate to reflect more closely market forces and adjust more smoothly to the underlying
fundamentals, strengthen competitiveness and attract foreign investment.
34.
Fiscal consolidation is crucial for macro stability and medium-term debt sustainability.
The authorities plan to continue to increase non-extractive revenues, cut inefficient current spending
and sustain infrastructure investment. These efforts are commendable and should continue to focus
on broadening the tax base in an equitable manner; reducing informality to promote fair taxation;
and implementing the planned public service reform to increase efficiency, reduce labor market
distortions and free resources for more productive spending, such as education. However, additional
fiscal consolidation efforts are needed to put the debt on a downward trend. A realistic investment
envelope and measures to increase investment efficiency need to be complemented by borrowing
plans that rely on concessional borrowing and are consistent with absorption capacity. The
authorities should be ready to increase targeted social transfers to protect the poor from the impact
of policy adjustment.
35.
Sustaining financial stability is needed for economic diversification. The upcoming
banking and central bank laws will enhance the prudential and banking resolution frameworks and
the operational independence of the central bank and its staff in banking supervision. Efforts to

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

improve financial supervision will need to be accompanied by improved regulatory compliance and
possibly increased sanctions and penalties. In addition, stronger regulatory requirements for
liquidity and credit risks, licensing new banks, consolidated supervision and regulatory compliance
on related-party exposures will strengthen financial stability. The CDD should come under the
supervision of the central bank. Reforms are needed to promote access to finance and financial
inclusion. The microfinance institutions need a clear restructuring plan.
36.
The external shock has increased the urgency for economic diversification and more
inclusive growth. Policies to promote economic diversification, create jobs, and protect the most
vulnerable are needed to achieve a durable improvement of living standards. A first priority is to
implement measures to unlock private sector-led growth, notably by advancing reforms to improve
the business environment that improve governance and encourage FDI and domestic investment. It
will be important to promote open competition and a level playing field for investors, while
improving labor market outcomes through better quality of education and training.
37.
Mauritania remains vulnerable to domestic policy implementation risks and external
shocks, including a deterioration of the security situation in the region. Reform objectives need
to be translated into coherent and consistently implemented objectives, which require enhanced
capacity. In addition, there are implementation risks given the magnitude of the required
adjustment; close policy coordination and steadfast implementation are needed for the reform
effort to become successful. Lastly, Mauritania remains vulnerable to external shocks and a
deterioration of the security situation in the region. These risks to the outlook suggest a need to
strengthen financial and policy buffers. Raising international reserves and preparing contingency
plans in case risks materialize would be useful to boost confidence.
38.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for approval of the existing exchange
restriction. The authorities are planning reforms in the foreign exchange market that will bring
Mauritania’s foreign exchange regime in compliance with the member’s Article VIII obligations. Staff
considers that the temporary retention of the existing exchange restriction is necessary for balance
of payments reasons. In addition, the exchange restriction does not discriminate among Fund
members. Hence, staff recommends the temporary approval of the retention of this restriction until
April 25, 2017 or the date of the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation, whichever is earlier.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Annex I. Mauritania: Implementation Status of the Main 2014
Article IV Recommendations
Mauritania’s 2014 Article IV policy recommendations were focused on ensuring fiscal sustainability,
strengthening the monetary policy and the bank resolution frameworks, and building the foundations for
solid private sector led growth through economic diversification and inclusive growth. Progress in
implementing the recommendations has been mixed.
Recommendations
Fiscal Policy
Framework for managing the
mining wealth

Implementation Status
Partial progress. No advances in anchoring fiscal policy to nonmining revenues and adopting a fiscal framework for managing
mining wealth. However, pending approval, a revised draft of
the organic budget law incorporating provision for a
stabilization fund has been prepared.

Fiscal consolidation to support
fiscal sustainability

No progress. Lower mining revenues due to the persistent ToT
shock and sustained public investment spending has
deteriorated the 2015 fiscal position.

Debt sustainability

No progress. Risk of debt distress remains high,
macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated with the ToT shock,
and the authorities had recourse to more debt to weather the
shock mostly on non-concessional terms.

Monetary and Financial Policies
Strengthen monetary policy
formulation

No progress

Liberalize the foreign exchange
market to achieve greater exchange
rate flexibility.

Partial Progress. The authorities introduced some flexibility in
determination of the exchange rate by establishing a crawl-like
exchange rate arrangement.. It remains heavily managed, and
has not played the role of a shock absorber.

Introduce liquidity support and
banking resolution frameworks
Structural reforms
Accelerate the reforms for

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Partial progress. A draft of the banking law is under finalization.
The passing of the law will represent a fundamental step to
strengthen the operational framework of the Central Bank
Progress. The authorities have initiated a diversification of the
economic base by supporting the development of new areas
(fishing, agriculture, and livestock) in which they have identified
sectoral comparative advantage. They also improved the
business environment to address structural weaknesses by
eliminating the minimum capital requirement, reducing the
time for documentary and border compliance for importing;
and expanding borrower coverage in the credit registry.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

Annex II. Mauritania: Debt Dynamics and Fiscal Risks
This note analyzes recent trends and vulnerabilities associated with Mauritania’s public debt. In
addition to the high level of debt and debt service due over the medium term, vulnerabilities arise from
elevated exposure to US dollar developments and regional lenders (mostly oil exporters). In addition,
potential fiscal risks could emanate from the state enterprises and other public entities.

A. Public Debt Coverage and Institutional Arrangement
1.
Mauritania’s public debt includes that of the central government, state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) and the central bank. Public debt is mostly external debt (97 percent of total
public debt), and domestic debt is small (3 percent). The external debt is medium to long term
foreign-currency loans contracted by the central government and the central bank. The central
government also contracts external debt on behalf of all the SOEs except the mining company SNIM
which borrows without explicit government guarantee.1 SOEs’ debt is dominated largely by the
power company SOMELEC. Domestic public debt is short term and is composed of treasury bills
held by banks and non-banks, but excludes SOEs’ liabilities towards domestic banks.

B. Current Trends
2.
Mauritania’s debt level is high when compared to other countries that received HIPC
and MDRI debt relief. Lower debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors (NPCs) and recent rapid new
borrowing to close infrastructure gaps explain the high debt level. Since 2014, debt dynamics have
deteriorated, following unfavorable revisions to the macroeconomic outlook emanating from the
persistent terms-of-trade shock. Institutional capacity for debt management remains limited.
Mauritania is now one of 12 low-income countries with high risk of debt distress according to the
latest IMF-WB assessment.2

Public debt has grown markedly since early 2014. Public debt level has risen rapidly—by
22.2 percent of GDP—owing to borrowing by the central government (15.3 percentage
points of GDP in 2014–15) and the central bank (6.3 percentage points of GDP in 2015). The
central government resorted partly to external debt financing to tackle their sizeable
infrastructure gaps, while the central bank use the external financing to boost its gross
reserve position following the persistent ToT shock.

The scaling-up on public investment has allowed to address sizable infrastructure
gaps. Since 2011, to boost potential growth and diversify their economy, the authorities started to
proactively improve roads, power supply, arable lands and water distribution networks. Over
2009–15, they have achieved notable advances such as increasing the access to potable water from
45 to 68 percent, augmenting the power supply from 44 to over 400 megawatts, extending the road
networks from 2,720 to 4,600 km, increasing arable land by about 200 percent and agricultural
production by 90 percent. Public investment increased from 7.5 to 15 percent of GDP during
2010–15 financed with both domestic and external resources.


Domestically-financed investment, representing on average 60 percent of the public investment
program, has been fueled by significant domestic revenues from high iron ore prices, improved
tax collection, and lately from lack of adjustment of domestic energy prices. The authorities have
used all the room for domestically-financed public investment since 2014 (measured by the
difference between total revenues minus current expenditures). Going forward, sustaining this
level of domestic financing will require sustaining non-extractive revenues and streamlining
current expenditures.



As for the foreign financed investment, it grew to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2015 from 3.2 percent in
2010.

Official borrowing from Non-Paris Club Creditors (NPCs) has increased markedly.
Mauritania shares similar trends with other LIC commodity exporters which experienced a higher
non-concessional borrowing from NPCs to finance
their developmental financing needs. In recent
years, Mauritania has increased its borrowing from
non-Paris Club bilateral creditors (mainly Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and China) and regional Arab
multilateral institutions. In 2015, Mauritania
borrowed mainly from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, India
and China to finance its investment program and
support reserves. As noted in a recent board
paper, Mauritania shares similar trends with other
LICs which experienced a higher non concessional
borrowing from NPCs to cover their

developmental financing needs. 3

C. Contributing Factors to Debt Dynamics, 2010–15
6.
A decomposition of debt dynamics flows reveals that exchange rate depreciation
played an important role.


Real growth and interest rate differential: Mauritania benefited from strong growth during
the commodity boom years and low interest rates with regards to debt dynamics.



Primary balance: Overall the primary balance did not contribute to the worsening of the debt
dynamics during this period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA



Exchange rate depreciation: The nominal exchange rate depreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar
had a significant negative impact on debt dynamics. Over 2010–15, the ouguiya has cumulatively
depreciated by about 20 percent against the US dollar in nominal terms. The large share of debt
denominated in US dollar directly (27 percent) and indirectly (32 percent) to currencies pegged
to the US dollar explains the debt sensitivity to the US dollar (see Section D).



Residual flows: Borrowing by public sector entities outside the central government and the
central bank resulted in significant debt accumulation. The limited coverage of fiscal statistics to
central government explains most of the large residuals that have contributed to the
deteriorating public debt dynamics. For example, these residuals include external loans
contracted by the central government on behalf of the public power enterprise (SOMELEC) to
expand energy production.

D. Potential Vulnerabilities Arising from Debt Structure
The analysis of the debt structure highlights potential vulnerabilities associated with currency risk,
maturity profile, and creditor base.
7.
The large share of debt denominated
in US dollar and foreign currencies linked to
the dollar exposes the portfolio to currency

average, are highly volatile depending on international prices, and are largely inelastic to the
exchange rate. Countries with large tradable sectors can bear more foreign currency risk because a
depreciation of the currency can lead to higher exports and income, and thus improve their ability
to cope with higher debt service caused by depreciation.

An analysis of the maturity profile reveals elevated debt service over the medium
term. The central government will continue to face high levels of debt service while for the BCM
debt service spikes during 2018–22 reflecting the repayment of bilateral financing contracted in
2015 to boost reserves. The challenge for the BCM will be to maintain an appropriate level of gross
reserve during this period as persistently low iron ore prices provide limited opportunities to build
up reserves. The central government’s debt service is also peaking to 3.6 percent of GDP (or
12.5 percent of revenue) over the medium term, as maturities falling due over 2016–21 represent
25 percent of its debt stock. These maturity profiles result in large external financing requirements
and could add to pressure on reserves under a macroeconomic outlook marked with risk tilted on
the downside.

With most debt owed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Arab multilateral creditors,
Mauritania is exposed to the economic situation in oil exporters. Over 80 percent of the debt
portfolio is owed to oil exporters. In an environment of low oil prices, some oil exporters may reduce
their financial support to countries in the region, leading to greater rollover risks.

E. Potential Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities could emanate from SOEs. A comprehensive analysis of debt sustainability taking
into account potential fiscal risks would be needed to better inform vulnerabilities and prepare
contingency plans.
10.
SOEs domestic borrowing could be a source of contingent liabilities and fiscal risks. In
the past, the central government incurred in fiscal costs as it assumed some of SOEs debt vis-à-vis
the banking system. While SOEs’ domestic debt level (2 percent of GDP in 2015) is relatively small, it
could become a source of fiscal risk due to the implicit government guarantee. This risk is first
compounded by SOEs’ ability to secure short-term credit from the banking sector and weak

monitoring. Second, the concentration of SOEs loans on some banks’ balance sheets may require
future government intervention to address banks’ potential financial liquidity pressures if SOEs face
treasury problems.
11.
SNIM is the only SOE that can borrow externally without the explicit central
government guarantee but should be closely monitored to avoid potential contingent
liabilities. SNIM’s external debt increased from 5 to 11½ percent of GDP during 2010–15 to finance
its mining capacity expansion and diversify its portfolio. The debt service-to-revenue ratio was
estimated at about 35 percent in 2015, and about 70 percent of its debt is coming due over
2016–21. Limited public information is available about its financial position and debt service profile,
since its financial statements are not disclosed. .
12.
All government external liabilities should continue to be centralized, and great caution
would be warranted to monitor public sector borrowing. External liabilities should continue to
be centralized in a debt registry at the MEF. Staff welcomes the authorities' plans for the proactive
implementation of public entities reform, while proactively monitoring public guarantees through a
central registry. For domestic borrowing of public institutions, the authorities intent to enhance
monitoring to help limit fiscal risks and safeguard financial stability.
13.
Additional fiscal risks could arise from PPPs. The authorities are seeking to mobilize
private investment for some development projects through PPPs, mainly for the FTZ and further
route expansion. Should the authorities move in this direction, explicit and implicit guarantees
should be centrally recorded, and fiscal risks should carefully be assessed. Country experience has
shown that fiscal risks in PPPs are more likely to arise in the absence of a comprehensive, clear, and
stable body of legislation informed by common principles. As an initial step, a sound legal and
institutional framework covering all major aspects of the PPPs process should be developed
introducing the general principles of transparency, fairness, and long term sustainability. In
particular the framework should establish a legal environment that is clear, fair, predictable, and
easily accessible, give the private sector assurance that the public sector will honor its commitments,
and clarify the roles and responsibilities of all relevant counterparts.

F. Institutional Considerations
14.
Foreign borrowing decisions are centralized by the central government and central
bank, which allows to keep under control guarantees and borrowing levels. For all of the public
sector, excluding SNIM, borrowing decisions are centralized by the central government which
contracts and guarantees loans. Until early 2016, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development
(MAED) was in charge of negotiating and contracting the debt and the Ministry of Finance (MF) was
responsible of servicing the debt. With the merge of the two ministries as the Ministry of Economy
and Finances (MEF) in February 2016, the responsibilities are now within one ministry, which will
help align borrowing incentives.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

G. Policy Recommendations
Putting the debt on a downward trend will require strengthening the institutional framework, have a
unified budget, tackle public spending efficiency issues, and broaden the coverage of fiscal statistics.
15.
Institutional framework. Staff welcomes the merge of ministries that will allow aligning
borrowing incentives and increase coordination in formulating financing strategies. The approval
and implementation of the organic budget law—which will pave the way for a unified budget
presenting a consolidated investment budget, with both domestically and foreign financed
envelopes—and the budget law will be important measures. In the meantime, monitoring
investment projects executed outside the central government (by SOEs and other public entities) will
be required to ensure that debt target would be reachable.
16.
Efficiency of public investments should be maximized to reap their benefits in terms of
growth and reduce debt vulnerabilities. Efficiency of investment even more so than the level
determines the growth benefit.
17.
Coverage of fiscal statistics. Expanding the statistical coverage of public finances towards
the general government and preparing a unified budget with both envelopes of investment (foreign
and domestically financed) will help put the total public debt on a downward path. Such steps will
anchor the fiscal deficit to the public debt path.
18.
Mauritania’s high debt levels and associated vulnerabilities give urgency to start
putting the public debt on a downward path by:


Adopting a single budget which incorporates both externally and domestically financed projects
as part of the budget submitted to Parliament, and passing the organic budget law.



Improving the coverage of fiscal statistics beyond the central government to ensure
comprehensive monitoring and management.



Reducing imbalances in the rest of the public sector so that the debt reduction target can be
achieved.



Establishing a fiscal anchor coherent with the debt target (see Box 2 in Staff Report).

19.
Addressing vulnerabilities tied to the public debt structure through intensifying the
efforts for economic and export diversification will help reduce the impact of exchange rate
depreciation on debt dynamics. Increasing the relative size of the tradable sector by expanding
the exporting industries will help the economy cope better with external shocks and amplify the
base of foreign currency resources. For countries with a significant weight of foreign currency
denominated debt, exchange rate depreciation will increase debt service but at the same time
augment debt servicing capacity by increasing the value of its tradable goods and boosting FX
receipts.

20.

A cautious and proactive approach to contingent liabilities is advisable through:



Strengthening the supervision of SOEs and other public entities, including by keeping a
centralized registry of their domestic borrowing to have a full grasp of the contingent liabilities
and fiscal risk their could pose



To achieve a comprehensive view of the scope of contingent liabilities, the authorities could
expand the DSA analysis to incorporate fiscal risks.



The budget law should also include an annual report on debt dynamics, contingent liabilities,
and guarantees.

21.
Strengthening institutional processes and governance will also contribute to improved
debt dynamics and risk rating:


Enhance the efficiency of public investments projects (FAD PIMA) to maximize their growth
benefit.



Strengthen the debt management capacity: Improved data collection (already significant
progress with the DAD); inter-institutional coordination; medium-term debt plans.



Broadening the coverage of public finance—going beyond the central government and the
budget.

Annex III. Mauritania: Effects of Worsened Terms of Trade on the
Financial System—Exploring Macro-Financial Linkages1
The Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) has made noteworthy efforts in recent years in the area of
supervision and undertaken a program of reforms with West AFRITAC support. In addition to
enhancing capacity for banking and financial supervision and bringing regulations toward standard
(on bank governance, risk management, internal control, and risk-based supervision), the BCM now
monitors the banks more regularly and applies the penalty regulations more systematically.
However, the cyclical slowdown, combined with the financial sector’s structural weaknesses, is
beginning to affect the financial system. The sustained decline in metal prices is having an impact on
the banking sector, primarily through the downturn in economic activity, which heightens the credit
and liquidity risks. Asset quality has deteriorated, and deposits, which represent the principal banks’
financing resource, have stagnated. In the context of a fragmented banking sector with highly
concentrated credit and deposit portfolios, the banks have limited capacity to absorb shocks. Although
the system remains generally liquid, buffers are declining, and some banks are facing liquidity
pressures and deposit losses. Their profitability is likely to suffer from the decline in import-financing
operations and the upturn in provisioning needs. The viability of the microfinance sector remains
uncertain and the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of most microfinance institutions (MFIs) is below
regulatory standards.
Given heightened risks that may affect the financial system’s ability to support economic diversification
over the medium term, the BCM should increase vigilance and continue strengthening the prudential
and crisis management frameworks while putting into place contingency plans to help clarify the
course of action if vulnerabilities materialize. It is also important to increase the coordination of
monetary and fiscal policies in such a way as to limit amplifying the shock on liquidity.

A. Snapshot of the Financial Sector in Mauritania
1.
Banks dominate the financial sector. In 2014, the Mauritanian financial sector comprised
16 licensed commercial banks, including two investment banks and five Islamic banks;
21 microfinance institutions (MFIs) and two active networks (Agence de Promotion des Caisses
Populaires d’Epargne et de Crédit [PROCAPEC], with 51 offices, and Mutuelle d’Investissement des
Crédits Oasiens [MICO]); two specialized financial institutions (Caisse de Dépots et de Développement
[CDD] and Finance, Conseils, et Investissement [FCI]); 32 exchange bureaus; 12 insurance companies;
and two pension funds. There is no stock market.


End-2015 banks’ total assets, estimated at about US$2 billion (43.5 percent of GDP), represented
over 90 percent of total financial sector assets. Credit-to-GDP ratio amounts to 31 percent of
GDP.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA



The number of banks has increased significantly, with nine new licenses granted since 2007. The
number of foreign banks has risen to six (from one in 2005), with a share of about 30 percent in
total banking assets. Five Islamic banks have been licensed since 2012, and a growing number of
banks are offering Islamic products.2



The public development bank CDD, with a special legal status, has grown rapidly since its
creation (in 2011) to finance development, representing 5 percent of total credit in the system.3
Its credit portfolio is highly concentrated on the short term (68 percent of the total).

2.
Mauritania’s financial sector suffers from structural weaknesses. The 1991–92 banking
crisis resulted in the privatization and restructuring of public banks. Since then, some banks and
MFIs have been restructured or liquidated, with limited spillovers to the financial system given
limited interbank operations. For example, BACIM (2007) was taken over by a foreign bank; GBM
(2013) experienced difficulties; and Maurisbank has been under liquidation since December 2014.4
The recurrence of such incidents results from several structural vulnerabilities:


The banking sector is at once highly fragmented and concentrated. There were six commercial
banks in Mauritania for every one million adults in 2013, which is high compared to peer
countries. Despite increasing number of banks in recent years, concentration remains high; five
banks control 58 percent of total credit and 71 percent of deposits. All other banks are small
with low profitability and little opportunities to develop and gain market shares. Banks’
governance remains weak: despite improving regulation, there is no effective separation
between management and shareholders.



Close ties with business conglomerates limit transparency and governance and may lead to
systemic risks. Domestic banks have strong ties to business conglomerates. Transactions with
entities of the same group lack transparency and do not comply with regulatory exposure limits
to companies of the same group (set at 25 percent).5 Such noncompliance presents risks for
financial stability.



Banks have highly concentrated deposit and credit portfolios. Given the small size of the formal
economy, there is little deposit and credit diversification. Because the banks have limited
funding sources, competition is focused on few customers and highly cyclically-sensitive sectors,
such as trade, construction and public works. In addition, information asymmetry,6 lack of
collateral, and problems related to collateral enforcement, reduce the number of individuals and

According to its organic law, CDD is considered a special financial institution, not a bank. For the purpose of this
analysis, banks refer to commercial banks. CDD is not part of the monetary survey.
4

A network of MFIs (UNACEM) has been liquidated. The CAPEC network has also recently faced liquidity problems.

5

The DGSB has recently engaged in the identification of liabilities to related parties and received technical assistance
from West AFRITAC on improving the CAR calculation.

A credit registry exists, but data dissemination to banks is not timely.

companies that qualify for bank credit, which limits private sector access to credit and increases
banks’ concentration risk.


Despite progress in strengthening banking supervision, asset quality and risk management
practices remain weak. At end-December 2015, NPLs represented 27.6 percent of total credits.
NPLs were reduced from 40 percent in 2010 to 20 percent in 2013, primarily as a result of the
restructuring of claims on the public sector, write-offs and favorable economic conditions; in
addition, new banks had not yet recorded any NPLs on their loan portfolios.



Bank profitability is weak. Despite relatively low funding costs due to a large share of
unremunerated demand deposits, average ROE and ROA during 2008–14 remained low, at
8 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. This can probably be explained by cost of provisioning
but may also be attributed to the low profitability of new banks during the initial years of
operation.

3.
Structural weaknesses hamper financial sector deepening and financial inclusion.
Despite some improvement in recent years, financial intermediation and inclusion remain limited.
Since 2011, deposits with banks hovered around 25 percent of non-extractive GDP, whereas credit
granted by commercial banks to the private sector reached 33.6 percent of non-extractive GDP
in 2015 (from 31.6 percent in 2011), benefiting somewhat from favorable economic conditions.


According to the 2014 World Bank Enterprise Survey, access to credit nevertheless remains a
major constraint for 52 percent of Mauritanian companies, compared to 42 percent in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Only 9 percent of the companies, primarily medium-sized, were eligible for
investment credit. Access to finance is also restricted by the lack of financial reporting standards
for SMEs; the authorities are working on those standards and on establishing a professional
career stream for accounting and auditing.



Financial inclusion is hampered by the existence of a large informal sector. Efforts to promote
financial inclusion comprise microcredit and Islamic banking. The microfinance sector could be a
catalyst for financial inclusion, but its financial viability is unclear, and its solvency low (see
Section E).

B. Macro-Financial Linkages and Transmission Channels
4.
A sustained drop in metal prices affects the banking sector directly because of the
interaction with the mining sector and, indirectly, through the resulting slowdown in overall
economic activity, which increases credit and liquidity risks. Since the direct transmission channel is
limited in Mauritania, the effects of the deterioration in the terms of trade are largely dictated by its
impact on economic growth and consequently by the authorities’ response to this shock.7

7

Deposits with the banking sector are limited to working capital needs, as most companies are foreign and the
public mining company (SNIM) repatriates part of its receipts via its central bank’s account. Credit to the mining
sector represented less than 2 percent of total credits in October 2015.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA



The public sector channel. As low iron ore prices persist, lower revenues reduce fiscal space for
countercyclical policy and, ultimately, public spending and growth. This affects the performance
of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private companies, leading to lower liquidity (deposits)
and reduced ability to service debt (thus to NPLs). In addition, in the event that the authorities
seek higher domestic financing through the issuance of T-bills, there could be also tighter
banking liquidity, private-sector crowding out, and higher domestic interest rates.



The FX channel. In the face of pressures on reserves, the central bank could reduce foreign
currency sales or allow for faster depreciation of the ouguiya. In the first case, a self-reinforcing
mechanism could be triggered, in which banks experiencing problems in obtaining FX might
lose deposits,8 reducing their liquidity and exacerbating their difficulties. This is particularly
relevant in the context of a shallow interbank market without a lender-of-last-resort function. In
the second case, the depreciation would affect households’ real incomes, consumption, and
repayment ability, as well as the balance sheets of companies and banks, depending on their net
FX positions.



The confidence channel. The expectations of domestic and foreign investors as regards
Mauritania’s economic outlook could also affect the banking sector. Although recent events in
the financial sector –in particular difficulties of GBM and liquidation of Maurisbank– did not have
a systemic impact partly because of action taken by the BCM, the confidence of economic
operators may have been somewhat shaken.



Spillbacks. A self-reinforcing loop could occur, with banks potentially tightening their credit
conditions (higher risk premium) and/or rationing their credit supply, which would exacerbate
their customers’ liquidity and solvency problems. Another channel is the fiscal cost that could
arise from the bankruptcy of a bank.

8
According to the FX market regulations, banks must hold 100 percent of their bids as free reserves at the BCM in
order to purchase FX.

6.
Despite a growing appetite for time deposits, banks remain heavily reliant on shortterm funding. In December 2015, time deposits increased by nearly 20 percent year-on-year,
to 22 percent of total deposits. In addition to the households’ income effect, this could reflect a
precautionary behavior by depositors and a more aggressive pricing strategy adopted by some
banks to attract more stable deposits in a context of lower liquidity and greater competition. Should
this behavior become more widespread, it could increase funding costs and reduce interest margins.
Credit to the economy

Although the banking system remains broadly liquid, buffers have declined.12 Although
still above the 20 percent norm, the median liquidity ratio worsened to 33 percent in
December 2015, from 49 percent before the deterioration in the terms of trade, mainly because of
the decline in liquid asset holdings (T-bills converted to

requirement and two other banks recorded intermittent
breaches. In addition, some banks have faced major

Stress tests show that some banks have limited capacity to address liquidity shocks.
Although still above the regulatory minimum, certain banks do not have enough flexibility to cope
with liquidity pressures. Under a scenario of a deposit run, with daily withdrawal of 6 percent of the
total deposits, three banks – including a major institution – would be short of liquidity to deal with
withdrawals within six days (see Box 1). The liquidity ratios remain above the
20-percent minimum requirement under the scenario of deposit withdrawal of two largest
depositors or of 50 percent of public deposits.

Liquidity problems originated from higher credit to a SOE and lower deposits of fishing exporters due to the

Credit risk and solvency
13.
Credit quality remains low and fell further in 2014–15, partly because of the
regulations strengthening risk classification. In 2015, NPLs for the aggregate banking system
increased by 3.7 percentage points, to 27.6 percent. This increase reflects a deterioration of credit
quality; NPLs have grown by 37.3 percent since December 2014, with five banks recording more
than 30 percent growth in NPLs over the same period and the NPL ratio exceeding 25 percent in
seven banks. In addition to the cyclical effect, this increase results from stricter enforcement of the
risk classification regulations published in 2014.14 Therefore, a high share of those NPLs predate 2010 and are fully provisioned, and will be written off.15

14

Instruction N5/GR 2014: this instruction spelled out stricter, more specific rules for the calculation of delinquent
loans and their provisioning.

15

These claims have now been identified and will be deleted from the balance sheet as of end-FY 2015—data to be
confirmed with the reporting of banks’ financial statements in June 2016. This will bring the NPL ratio down
from 27.6 percent to around 20 percent, according to authorities’ calculations.

The banking system seems generally well capitalized, but there are weaknesses in net
equity calculation. The median CAR is 27 percent, well above the 10 percent minimum
requirement, in part because of the high ratios carried by the new banks that have not yet engaged
in significant lending.16 However, the central bank applies a methodology that differs from the
Basel III international standards, especially on exposures to related parties, whereby all related
liabilities must be subtracted from the net equity calculation. The BCM allows for a 25-percent
related-party exposure in the CAR; in addition, half of the banks do not respect the regulation, and
in six out of seven banks’ exposure to related parties is twice the regulatory limit. According to the
BCM regulation, three banks would be below the minimum threshold of 10 percent when complying
with the 25-percent limit, with recapitalization needs amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP.17 Finally, as
regards the calculation of weighted risks, loans to the central government and to SOEs are zeroweighted.
15.
Given the concentration on a limited number of borrowers and exposures to cyclically
sensitive sectors, some banks may need recapitalization. Claims on the trade, transport, and
construction sectors represent 43 percent of total claims.18 Based on stress tests, weakened trade
sector activity as reflected by a default on 20 percent of all the sector’s liabilities would result in a
recapitalization shortfall for two medium-sized banks. Similarly, a 30-percent default on liabilities in
the construction and public works sector would require the recapitalization of four banks, including
a major institution. Also, four banks (including two large ones representing 32 percent of total
banking assets) would be in violation of the minimum CAR in the event of default of their principal
borrower (see Box 1).19

16

Only one bank has a CAR of about 10 percent.

These refer to direct loans and signature liabilities. The latter are shown off-balance sheet and represent one third
of total liabilities.

It is noteworthy that simulations do not take into account neither recapitalization needs related to connected
parties nor guarantees held against customer liabilities.

Exchange risk
16.
Currency mismatch and short FX positions expose banks to losses in the event of
ouguiya depreciation. The asset-to-liability ratio in foreign currency fell abruptly to 68 percent in
2015 from 138 percent in 2014. This may be attributable not only to the decline in export proceeds
but also to the enforcement of repatriation requirements (e.g. in the case of fishing export
proceeds). Most banks reported short open positions for both the US dollar and the euro, often
exceeding the regulatory ceiling (of10 percent per currency and 20 percent for all currencies). A
simulation of a 40 percent depreciation of the ouguiya to the dollar or the euro would trigger losses
for banks but would not have a significant impact on solvency (Box 2).20 Yet, if banks channel
exchange risk to their customers, they would amplify credit risk as importers’ balance sheets are less
diversified and more sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
Box 2. Mauritania: Results of Stress Tests
The simulation scenarios aim at providing information about potential risks to the banking sector. It covers
15 banks, 100 percent of banking assets, using provisional end-2015 data (or the latest available data). The
scenarios are conducted under unfavorable economic scenarios which are designed to determine whether
banks have enough resilience to withstand the impact of adverse developments.

would likely increase funding costs and reduce
further interest margins.

E. Financial Stability Considerations in the Microfinance Sector
18.
The microfinance sector remains highly fragmented in Mauritania. According to the
BCM’s 2014 Annual Report, there are two active networks and 21 MFIs. The largest network—the
UNACEM (National Union of Mauritanian Agricultural Savings and Loan Cooperatives)—was placed
under liquidation in 2014. The PROCAPEC is the main active network, with 51 MFIs, followed by the
MICO. The CAPEC network accounted for 84 percent of MFI members. At end-2015, CAPEC
distributed 38 percent of loans and received 80 percent of the total deposits within the microfinance
sector.
19.
The lending products offered by MFIs are limited to short-term micro-credits. Loans
granted by MFIs reached UM 2.1 billion (0.3 percent of total credit), and deposits stagnated at UM
5.5 billion (1.5 percent of total deposits). These are essentially individual loans granted to very small
businesses and group loans to support women in income-generating activities. Annual microcredit
interest rates vary in the range of 10–15 percent, which is close to commercial banks’ lending rates.
In addition, MFIs provide Islamic products such as Murabaha, representing more than three quarters
of all CAPEC loans. MFIs have also started developing new products and services such as money
transfers and mobile payments. These activities are still negligible but could contribute significantly
to financial inclusion.

1/ Data as at end-2014.

20.
The sector’s viability is uncertain, and the CAR of its institutions is below regulatory
norms.


The CAPEC network has been facing major difficulties since 2009, due to embezzlement and
mismanagement that has led to deposit withdrawals. The deterioration in asset quality remains
substantial (from 13.2 percent in 2013 to 23.3 percent in 2015).



Safeguard measures to support the network were initiated in 2010 but have ensured neither its
full recovery nor its return to financial viability. Operating risks, lack of access to reliable credit
information, low capacity, and weak supervision are all factors that explain the sector’s
difficulties in regaining viability.



MFIs depend primarily on grants (operating subsidies from the government to PROCAPEC) and
other external financing resources (in the form of external credit lines and earmarked funds).
Financial autonomy and transparency are major challenges for these institutions to make
professional operators in the sector.



Even though the liquidity ratio appears high (49 percent at end-2015, compared to 42 percent at
end-2014 and 44 percent at end-2013), MFIs record negative net equity as a result of CAPEC
situation.21 The assets medium- and long-term are not fully covered by medium- and long-term
resources as required in the regulation.

21.
The BCM should strengthen control and supervision of the microfinance sector, to
support strengthening of risk management practices and promptly implementing corrective
measures. The BCM has built up its capacity and has been performing on-site inspections of
vulnerable MFIs since 2014; but not much progress has been made in terms of addressing the
restructuring of the sector. In addition, the BCM should end its participation in the CAPEC

orientation board, which creates a conflict of interest likely to reduce the effectiveness of the
sector’s supervision.
22.
Prior to restructuring the microfinance sector, a comprehensive diagnosis of the MFIs
seems a critical step to identify the main bottlenecks and establish a strategic development
agenda for the sector, which can help support its financial autonomy and viability. This
diagnostic work could be entrusted, if necessary, to a specialized firm,22 while considering corrective
measures to improve the situation of MFIs in Mauritania.

F. Recommendations
23.
The BCM should increase its oversight, further strengthen the prudential and crisis
management frameworks, and put in place contingency plans.


On surveillance, the data sharing system currently being finalized would facilitate greater and
more regular monitoring of liquidity, credit, and exchange risks but should be supported by
sustained efforts to improve data reliability.



At the prudential level, the process of transition toward risk-based supervision and the
alignment of the regulations with international standards are on the right track, with the new
banking law and the instruction on capital adequacy ratio under preparation. In the meantime, it
is important to enforce regulations—if necessary through more severe penalties—and
strengthen the micro- and macro-prudential framework to better take account of the specific
risks associated—in particular with concentration and transactions with related parties. In this
context, the BCM is currently preparing a circular allowing for gradual regularization (over three
years) of cases where exposure limits to connected parties have been violated. Staff
recommends that the central bank acts decisively and proactively to address capital shortfalls for
these banks, and reducing the regularization timeframe to two years.



Finally, Mauritania is in the process of establishing the legal framework for a modern crisis
management framework. At the same time, it would be helpful to activate the emergency
liquidity mechanism and increase banks contributions to the deposit insurance system.

24.
The BCM should adapt its liquidity management framework to a new context that may
be marked by liquidity shortfalls. The BCM needs to make more active use of the existing shortterm liquidity management instruments and broaden the range of intervention tools. Proper
coordination with exchange rate and fiscal policies would also be necessary to avoid amplifying

22

The diagnostic should include preparation of terms of reference; compilation of various internal and external audit
reports, annual reports, and financial statements; assessment of human and financial resources; etc.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

effects on liquidity.23 The BCM should also actively play its role as lender of last resort when
required, that is, when banks are illiquid but solvent. However, it should distinguish clearly between
day-to-day liquidity management (monetary policy) and interventions using the emergency liquidity
mechanism (prudential policy) to avoid conflicts of objectives.24
25.
Restructuring the central bank and developing analytical capacity should be
accelerated. The BCM has made laudable efforts as regards its regulatory framework. The decisionmaking process will be strengthened through the creation of three committees (prudential,
resolution, and financial stability). Human resources improved with the recruitment and training
of 14 additional inspectors. However, in order to increase the effectiveness of these reforms, action
is needed to restructure the DGSB and the central bank in general as well as to build analytical
capacities.

23

For example, the BCM intervention in the money market to reduce FX demand and limit pressures on exchange
rate and reserves could exacerbate the liquidity problems of some banks, especially in the absence of a lender of last
resort. Similarly, the accumulation of arrears by the government, an abrupt fiscal consolidation or an increase in
domestic financing through T-bills could amplify the liquidity shock.
24

The planned separation in the decision-making process between monetary policy council and financial stability
committee could limit the risk of conflicts.

In the short-term, external and fiscal buffers and higher
exchange rate flexibility would provide room for some gradual
adjustment. Sound macroeconomic management, a wellaligned exchange rate and reforms to increase the resilience of
the economy to external shocks will require diversifying the
economy and exports away from natural resources. Fiscal
consolidation will be needed to limit risks to fiscal
sustainability over the medium term in the context of high risk
of debt distress. Policy coordination will be crucial to support
sound policy management of the shock.

Higher exchange rate flexibility would be needed to support
external sustainability and competitiveness. To mitigate
balance sheet effects, limits in banks' FX position should be
strictly enforced. Targeted social transfers will help contain
effects on the poor. Efforts to implement structural reforms for
economic diversification should be elevated and sound
macroeconomic management will require increasing the
effectiveness of the transmission mechanism to anchor
inflation expectations.

exchange rate (REER) continued to appreciate in
2015. Despite the nominal depreciation, the average
REER appreciated by 5 percent in 2015, compared to
3.5 percent in 2014 due in part to the strengthening of
the US dollar during 2015; however, year-on-year, the

8.4 percentage points to reach 19.3 percent of GDP.
The adjustment was driven in part by revenues from a
fishing agreement with the EU, telecom licenses, and
budget support grants amounting to 3.4 percent of
GDP. The deficit in the non-extractive current account
balance contracted despite the adverse terms of trade
shock because of higher transfers. The surplus in the
extractive current account balance was replaced with a
deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2015.1

2016 driven by lower FDI flows, but it set to rebound in 2017 and 2018 because of an increase in
medium and long term loans contracted to finance large

EBA-lite approaches to assessing exchange
rate misalignment suggest that the ouguiya is
overvalued, but the estimated degree of the
overvaluation varies significantly. In particular:



EBA-lite current account model. Under the EBA-lite methodology, the current account balance
is modeled as a function of its fundamentals.2 The current account reference is the deficit of
19.3 percent of GDP for 2015. The estimated norm was a deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP (Table 1).



External sustainability approach. This approach is designed to stabilize the net international
investment position over the medium term at either -60 or -80 percent of GDP. On this basis, the
estimated current account norms are between -4.7 and -5.8 percent of GDP, compared to a
projected medium-term current account deficit of 10.5 percent of GDP (Table 1).



Equilibrium REER model. The price-based approach directly models a REER norm within a panel
framework as a function of the many fundamentals used in the EBA approach.



Given the challenges in applying these methodologies to resource-rich low-income countries
associated with the poor statistical fit of the regressions underpinning these methodological
approaches and trade elasticities, the estimates need to be considered with caution as they may
not be reliable indicators of Mauritania’s real exchange rate gap. The real exchange rate gap
estimates are also subject to uncertainties relating to the future path of commodity prices.

Positive numbers indicate overvaluation. Elasticity of current account to real exchange rate gap is 0.2.

8.
In light of a deteriorated outlook, Mauritania’s external position will need to adjust.
Economic growth in the short term is predicated on the expansion of mining. NEGDP growth is
projected to be markedly lower over the medium term compared to the years of high commodity
prices—in part due to the overvaluation of the exchange rate which hampers external
competitiveness—but begins to improve in 2018. Under current policies, gross international reserves
will drop below the authorities’ target of three-month coverage of imports (excluding extractive
industries) after 2019.

B. Reserve Adequacy Considerations
9.
Mauritania’s gross reserve coverage is adequate according to traditional measures.
Gross reserves covered 7.7 months of non-extractive imports in 2015 and are projected at
5.9 months in 2016; this level is above the 3-month import coverage conventional rule and wellabove the 20 percent coverage of broad money. However, the buildup of reserves during 2015 was
debt-financed; and, in net terms, reserves have declined from US$998 million in 2013 to
US$536 million in 2015, or 2.9 months of prospective imports excluding those related to the
extractive industries. While the reserve adequacy assessment for credit constrained economies

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

suggests that reserves cover 9.1 months of imports, Mauritania’s current reserves are close and cover
7.7 months of imports.3
10.
Rebuilding foreign reserve buffers would help mitigate the impact of possible future
external shocks. Pressures on reserves are expected to remain over the medium term. The recent
terms-of-trade shock demonstrated the economy’s vulnerability to swings in global commodity
prices, particularly those for iron ore prices. The collapse in iron ore prices in 2014–15 resulted in
significant reserve losses. The Mauritanian economy remains vulnerable to additional external shocks,
beyond developments in the global iron ore markets. Higher oil or/and food prices would bring
about substantial deterioration in trade and current account balances. Other things equal, assuming
the shock is fully absorbed with reserves, a 20 percent rise in world food or oil prices would result in
a decline in foreign reserves equivalent to 0.4 month of imports.

Non-price measures of structural
competitiveness suggest that Mauritania has
improved and ranks well among its peers. This
is true for the relative price of communication and
transport (Figure 1). Although the relative price of
housing/water/electricity deteriorated compared
to 2005, it remains slightly below the median for
its peers. The shipping cost per container in
Mauritania is on the lower end of the spectrum
for oil exporters, resource intensive non-oil
exporting countries, and non-resource intensive
non-oil exporting countries in the Middle East and

Sources: World Bank, World Development Indicators; and IMF staff estimates.

The target of six months of imports is based on ARA metrics estimated for resource-rich low-income countries with
a fixed exchange rate (IMF Policy Paper “Assessing Reserve Adequacy—Further Considerations,” November 2013). The
paper finds that countries with low economic flexibility and high vulnerability to external shocks may need to hold
higher precautionary reserves.

African region. These features suggest that Mauritania is well placed to spur domestic production of
goods and services.
12.
Indicators for governance, competitiveness and doing business in Mauritania improved
during 2015. However, Mauritania ranks lower than its resource-based peers in all categories of the
global competitiveness indicator. Mauritania’s governance has been slightly better than the average
of the Low Income countries (LICs), mainly due to better performance in the Rule of Law, Regulatory
Quality and Political Stability categories (Figure 2). As for doing business in Mauritania, the findings
are mixed. On one hand, Mauritania performed better than the average of the Lower Middle Income
countries (LMICs) in starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property and
enforcing contracts; but it scored worse than the average of the LICs in getting credit, paying taxes,
trading across borders and resolving insolvency. Overall, doing business in Mauritania remains more
challenging than its peer groups. Competitiveness is also lower, with the exception of Infrastructure,
Macroeconomic Environment and Technological readiness, where Mauritania performs better than
its LIC peers.
13.
Gains from improving competitiveness in Mauritania remain large. The authorities are
already addressing deficiencies through their public investment program and reforms to protect
investors and enhance investment. Continued well-targeted and effective improvements—as well as
better access to finance through—can ease the operating conditions for local business and thereby
improve their external competitiveness.

Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
3
Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
4

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.
5

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Safeguards Assessments
The 2010 safeguards assessment of the CBM found significant risks in the central bank’s safeguards
framework. The assessment noted that action was needed to develop the CBM’s financial reporting,
which lagged behind international standards and the practices of other central banks in the region.
Legal reforms were also recommended to strengthen the central bank’s autonomy and governance.
The assessment further noted that capacity building was needed in the areas of information systems
and internal audit. Progress in implementing safeguards recommendations has been protracted.
Some steps have been taken to strengthen the internal audit function and the audited financial
statements for 2013 and 2014 have been published in full, albeit with delay. Other important
recommendations remain outstanding, including the implementation of IFRS and legal reforms to
strengthen the CBM’s autonomy and establish adequate oversight arrangements.
AML/CFT
The Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) adopted the mutual
evaluation report for Mauritania in November 2006, where it recommended corrective measures to
address the deficiencies in the country’s AML/CFT framework. In the ninth follow-up report last
November 2014, the MENAFATF noted the positive steps taken by the authorities, such as Senate
approval of the amended AML/CFT draft law. However they concluded that some core and key
recommendations remain unaddressed, in particular, (a) shortcomings in the legal definition of the
act of terrorist financing; and (b) lack of sufficient procedures to implement United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1267 and 1373 on listing and freezing of terrorist assets. Mauritania
was thus kept under the enhanced follow-up procedures and is expected to report back on new
actions taken at the next Plenary scheduled for end-April 2015. Authorities are committed to
improving the AML/CFT laws to address the identified deficiencies, and have undertaken measures
to expedite procedures for joining the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units as
recommended by the 2012 FATF. MENAFATF is also scheduled to assess the country’s AML/CFT
regime under the revised FATF methodology with an onsite visit in late 2016.
Exchange Arrangement
Mauritania’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement
has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement effective September 9, 2014. Since the, the
nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has followed a 9-percent annual crawl within a
2 percent band. Mauritania maintains one exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article
VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange restriction arises from the insufficient foreign
exchange availability at the fixing sessions (auctions) organized by the Central Bank of Mauritania
(CBM) for those transactions which are required to be submitted to the auctions. The authorities
have requested, and staff recommends, Board approval for the temporary retention of this
restriction.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 31, 2015)

Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most shortcomings
are in the areas of national accounts, balance of payments, external debt, and financial sector
statistics. Since 2005, STA and AFRITAC West have been assisting the authorities with
macroeconomic statistics.
Mauritania is participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The metadata has
been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB); and ROSC data for most
internationally recognized standards and codes is not available except for fiscal transparency.

Real sector
Under AFRITAC West technical assistance, the National Statistical Office (ONS) released revised
national accounts for 1998-2010 based on 2004 prices, and also produced provisional estimates for
2011-12. The revised national accounts are in compliance with the 1993 System of National
Accounts (1993 SNA), however the ONS is planning to move to SNA 2008 by 2016 and to develop
quarterly national accounts in parallel.
The current consumer price index (CPI), developed with the assistance of AFRISTAT, has been
published since May 2004 with a geographical coverage limited to Nouakchott (the capital). The
authorities plan to update and broaden the consumer basket by using the 2013 consumer survey
titled “Enquete sur la Pauvreté et les Conditions de Vie” (EPCV), and by extending the geographical
coverage to four cities.

Government finance statistics
The adoption of systematic compilation practices has improved data comprehensiveness, but there
is a need to make operational a data validation process as a quality control measure. In view of
ongoing methodological improvements, the authorities should publish monthly statements of
treasury accounts. Substantial work is needed to move towards GFS2001 and to broaden the scope
of government statistics beyond the central government to generate a comprehensive assessment
of public sector statistics.

Monetary and financial statistics
CBM monetary statistics are broadly in line with the statistical methodologies of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual and data dissemination recommendations of the GDDS. The CBM
developed and implemented bridge tables from source data to the Standardized Report Form (SRFs)
and since last year submits SRF 1SR (central bank) and 2SR (other financial institutions) to STA on a
preliminary basis. The quality of these data needs to be further enhanced, and the scope of 2SR
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

should be expanded to cover micro-finance institutions, and the Caisse de Dépôts et de
Développement (CDD) which is a deposit and development fund created in 2011. The CBM should
be moving to prepare its financial reporting system for IFRS implementation, a key safeguards
assessment recommendation. The CBM should also publish monetary statistics on its official website
in a timely manner.

Balance of payments
Balance of payments statistics are affected by significant shortcomings, as many components are
routinely based on estimates, and there are no systematic efforts to collect data on certain types of
transfers, foreign direct investment, or tourism receipts. In addition non mining exports, services and
short-term capital flows are not well measured. Similarly, under-reporting of external transactions by
commercial banks is problematic. No balance of payments statistics are reported to STA. An April
2011 STA TA mission provided recommendations, which, if implemented by the authorities, would
significantly address identified shortcomings.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS
Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
Peter Allum (IMF) and
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association.

Mauritania’s risk of debt distress is rated high due to substantial and persistent breaches of
all but one threshold under the baseline scenario. The outlook has worsened compared to
the debt sustainability analysis prepared at the time of the 2014 Article IV Consultation
owing to a worse-than-anticipated terms-of-trade deterioration that has decreased growth
and export prospects. Further pressure results from debt disbursements which have been
revised upwards over the medium term in line with the public investment plan. Although
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio declines in the long run due to a recovery in growth rates, the
ratio remains high because of disbursements linked to public infrastructure projects.

BACKGROUND
1.
The outlook has worsened since the 2014 Article IV consultation. This is reflected in the
deterioration of debt distress indicators. Compared to
the 2014 Article IV, iron ore prices were 31 percent lower

(US$/Ton)
in 2015 and, based on the latest WEO projections,
90
45 percent lower for 2016 and around 54 percent

onward. Despite lower oil prices, the terms of trade
60
deterioration in 2015 was approximately three times as
50
40
2014 Article IV
severe as the projection in the 2014 Article IV. The actual

2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021
projections for 2016–19 have been revised upward.
Source: WEO.
These revisions are due to higher disbursements mainly
associated with new public investment projects; the PPG
debt-to-GDP ratio has been increased by 16.5 percentage points in 2016 and is 49 percentage points
higher in 2021 compared to the levels projected at the time of the 2014 Article IV consultation.
2.
Mauritania’s external debt is high and largely composed of public debt contracted on
concessional terms. PPG debt represents over
90 percent of total external debt and includes debt

3.
External PPG debt-to GDP ratios have increased markedly since 2014. The central government
has increased external debt financing for public investment. Although external PPG debt is held
predominantly by official creditors and largely on concessional terms, the central bank contracted a loan
(6.3 percent of GDP) in 2015 to support the reserve position that is non-concessional because of its
relatively short maturity (7 years). This non-concessional loan exposes Mauritania to rollover risks given its
short maturity profile. In 2014, external PPG debt rose by 12.6 percentage points to 80.4 percent of GDP
and, in 2015, by 12.9 percentage points of to 93.3 percent of GDP. Private external debt is projected to
decline to 14.8 percent of GDP in 2016 from 15.6 percent of GDP in 2015. Movements in private external
debt are driven by changes in borrowing by SNIM.
4.
The authorities are actively seeking debt relief from Kuwait. An agreement has not yet been
reached between the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) and Mauritania to address this longstanding issue.
Both parties are seeking agreement about valuation, including interest in arrears. According to the 2002
Paris Club Agreement, Mauritania was expected to seek debt relief on comparable terms from non-Paris
Club Creditors.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
5.
This debt sustainability analysis updates the joint IMF-World Bank DSA produced in
January 2014 for the Article VI consultation. Key changes to the DSA assumptions since the previous
exercise are as follows:


Real GDP growth rates are between 1 and 6 percentage points lower over the medium term, as
a result of lower iron ore prices putting the mining expansion envisaged under the 2014
Article IV consultation on hold.



Metal prices have significantly declined and are projected to remain low over the medium term.
Compared to the 2014 Article IV consultation, on average over the medium term iron ore prices
are projected to be 54 percent lower, gold prices about 2 percent lower and copper prices about
24 percent lower.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA



Current account deficits are projected to decline by 5.7 percentage points of GDP in 2016 led
by lower oil prices, only to increase by 2.2 percentage points of GDP in 2017 because of an
increase in imports related to investment projects needed to bolster production in the context of
lower iron ore prices. Over the medium term, the current account deficit is envisaged to narrow
to 10.5 percent of GDP driven by lower imports associated with the extractive industry and
increased volumes of iron ore exports.



Public financing needs are set to remain elevated over the medium term. This is caused by
declines in revenues (around 3percentage points of GDP by 2021) and a large public investment
program that sets average capital expenditure to 14 percent of GDP. Beyond 2028, debt
disbursements are projected to stabilize at

concessional making the average grant
element just short of the 35 percent benchmark for concessionality. A lower grant element will
increase debt service due to higher borrowing costs.



CPIA scores determine a country’s quality of policies and institutions which, in turn, affect debt
thresholds against which the various debt ratios calculated in the DSA are compared. The CPIA
score of Mauritania has reflected significant gains in the institutional environment since 2011,
and stands at 3.4 for 2014 (latest available), bringing the 3-year moving average to 3.3. As such,
the 30 percentage point threshold for the ratio of the present value of PPG external debt to GDP
remains valid.



KIA debt relief is assumed to take place in 2016 and incorporated into the analysis since
Mauritania had reached the HIPC completion point. According to the authorities’ latest data, the
KIA passive debt is evaluated according to the authorities at US$977 million (21.5 percent of
GDP—driving the large reduction in the public and external debt-to-GDP ratios in 2016).2 The
previous DSA assumed the debt relief to take place in 2015.

2

Estimates of the passive debt vary widely depending on underlying assumptions regarding the (non-) capitalization
of interest arrears and the interest rate used for calculating the current value of arrears.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
6.
The baseline projections breach their respective thresholds for all indicators except one.
Improvements in the path of the PV of debt-to GDP ratio over the projection period are driven by a pickup
in GDP as disbursements are projected to remain on an increasing path. The debt service-to-revenue ratio
peaks at 23.8 percent in 2020. Staff project the ratio to decline gradually after 2023 because of pickup in
growth dynamics and hence government revenues.
7.
Standardized stress tests lead to breaches of thresholds for all indicators. Stress tests highlight
vulnerabilities to shocks to exports and to exchange rate depreciation.
8.
Debt distress indicators decline over the long run because of improved growth. Over the
medium term, the PPG debt-to-GDP ratio increases by 5 percentage points, peaking at 82 percent of GDP
by 2018, to later decline to its 2016 level. The hump-shaped medium-term dynamics are due to increasing
disbursements in the context of subdued growth dynamics. Debt disbursements are driven by projectfinancing to address Mauritania’s infrastructure gap and increasing growth potential over the long run.
Stronger growth over the long run puts the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path.
9.
The historical scenario produces unrealistically large swings in projected external debt. This
scenario involves a substantial change in the current account balance due to structural changes of the
economy, namely shifting from a large FDI-financed deficit—while the mining capacity was being
expanded— to a reduced CA deficit once mining exports increase over the medium term.
10.
The outlook for external debt has worsened compared to the DSA prepared in 2014.
A more persistent terms-of-trade shock than originally envisaged and slower growth are major
contributing factors to the deterioration in Mauritania’s debt profile. As no major deceleration in debt
accumulation is envisaged, existing policies do not provide a counterforce to the ToT deterioration. While
in the 2014 DSA only the baseline PV to debt-to GDP ratio breached its threshold and large breaches for
baseline projections were short-lived, breaches for baseline projections in the current DSA exercise are
large and sustained over the long run.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
11.
Indicators of public debt sustainability mirror those of external debt. The public debt stock is
largely composed of external debt. Public domestic debt is about 5 percent of total PPG debt, largely shortterm (up to 6 months) and denominated in local currency.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA

CONCLUSIONS
12.
A deteriorated global outlook and significant downward revisions in metal prices have
resulted in Mauritania facing significant debt vulnerabilities, the risk of debt distress remains high.
Improvements to debt sustainability hinge on improvements in growth dynamics and restrain in
contracting new debt.


Sustained structural reforms are needed to promote economic diversification through private
sector development and enhance potential economic growth. Allowing the private sector to take
a more proactive role in investment and economic diversification could help ease the role of
public sector in development and improve debt dynamics.



Debt dynamics require closer monitoring and enhanced governance of the public
investment program. In addressing infrastructure gaps, the authorities should also enhance the
efficiency of public investment; increase debt management capacity; and limit contracting new
debt to priority projects that support potential growth.

13.
Authorities broadly agree with the assessment of the DSA and acknowledge the need for
prudent debt management while sustaining priority investment. Recent technical assistance from
AFRITAC-West provided advice on centralizing the recording of debt for more efficient monitoring; and the
authorities are working on a centralized registry of public guarantees and public debt. The recent merger of
the Ministry of Finance with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development helps in aligning incentives
and centralizing decisions on the consolidated public investment program and its financing—a key factor
for more efficient debt management practices.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Over the long term, the current account is assumed to reach a surplus of around 4 percent of GDP based on efforts of economic diversification.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
8/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
9/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for
Islamic Republic of Mauritania,
and Mr. Mohamed Sidi Bouna, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 25, 2016

1.

Introduction

My Mauritanian authorities express their deep appreciation to staff for the candid discussions
and the helpful policy advice provided during the Article IV Consultation.
The decline in international iron ore prices ―Mauritania’s main export commodity― has had a
severe impact on the country with strong negative spillover effects on the rest of the economy.
The sizeable terms-of-trade shock slowed economic growth and contributed to an increase in
debt levels. The current account deficit (although on a declining path) remains elevated. While
lower international oil prices will help mitigate the impact of the shock on the external position,
Mauritania’s overall performance and the country’s outlook have been adversely affected by the
commodity shock.
The authorities have adjusted their policies to the new economic environment. They introduced
more flexibility to the exchange rate and let the currency to depreciate gradually ―a policy
initiated as early as October 2014 and which is still ongoing― while pursuing their fiscal
consolidation efforts. They feel that that their policy adjustment efforts are starting to have the
intended effects on the economy.
The authorities share some of the concerns expressed in the report over debt levels and
acknowledge that the current account deficit remains elevated which poses financing risks.
While they recognize that 2015 has been a difficult year and that the period ahead remains
challenging, due in part to the fact that iron ore prices will likely remain subdued for the
foreseeable future, they are of the view that the impact of the shock has somehow stabilized from
the “lows” reached in 2015.
Overall, my Mauritanian authorities feel that the tone of the report and the staff’s assessment of
the economy and the country’s economic prospects are more pessimistic than their own
assessment, especially with regard to the exchange rate policy and fiscal consolidation efforts.
They also believe that the report could have been more balanced, emphasizing areas of difficulty
(debt levels, current account deficit) but also giving more prominence to areas of relative
resilience.
2.

Recent economic developments show signs of resilience

Following the 2014 severe terms-of-trade shock, the policies implemented by the authorities
have been effective in improving the resilience of the economy. This is shown by the growth

2
performance. Economic growth is projected to rebound in 2016 to 4.1 percent up from 1.9
percent in 2015 and should stabilize at around 3.5-4 percent over the medium-term. Importantly,
economic growth will be driven increasingly by non-extractive sectors. Inflation remains
moderate at an estimated 3.8 percent in 2016 and is projected to stabilize at around 5 percent
over the medium-term as growth resumes.
In assessing Mauritania’s economic performance, the report would have benefited from
comparisons with LICs and Sub-Saharan Africa given that many economies in Africa and in
developing countries more generally are being affected by similar shocks. Putting things into
perspective, we would note that while Mauritania’s performance may have weakened in some
areas compared to other LICs (debt/GDP is an example) in other areas, the performance has been
relatively strong.
In the fiscal area, the fiscal revenue-to-GDP ratio of Mauritania at 28.1 percent in 2015 (as
indicated in the DSA report) is not only high in absolute terms but has increased despite the drop
in mining revenues. This compares favorably to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa which stands
at 18.5 percent in 2015 (April 2016 WEO). Moreover, the primary fiscal deficit for Mauritania
(excluding interest payment) is projected to improve from -2.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to -0.9
percent in 2016, which in the context of a high debt/GDP ratio such as for Mauritania, is crucial
and indicative of the efforts being made.
As regards the external sector, the authorities have adopted a prudent and gradual depreciation of
the exchange rate, to address the impact of the shock on the external position. The central bank
also contracted a bilateral loan to strengthen foreign exchange reserves which is contributing to
the stability of the foreign exchange market and further reassuring markets of the central bank’s
ability to defend the currency.
The current account deficit narrowed significantly from 27 percent of GDP in 2014 to 13 percent
projected in 2016 ―in just two years. Part of this improvement is the result of lower
international oil prices but part is also due to the exchange rate adjustment, as other imports have
dropped, affected by the depreciation of the currency (as shown, for example, by the decline in
imports of capital goods.) International reserves buffers are estimated to have remained elevated
at almost 6 months of imports in 2016, and are projected to remain above 3 months of imports
until 2019.
The authorities disagree with the staff’s assessment in paragraph 12 of the main report that the
currency is significantly overvalued. They see no evidence of imbalance in the official market,
nor do they see any meaningful premium on the parallel market. The absence of premium on the
parallel market can be explained in part by the size of the foreign exchange reserves, and in part
by the ongoing policy of gradual depreciation of the currency. Furthermore, as a matter of
consistency with previous IMF reports, the authorities believe that the present report should have
addressed the significant divergence between the results of the methodology used to assess the

3
exchange rate misalignment (concluding to an overvaluation of the currency) and the lack of
meaningful premium on the parallel market (Annex V).[1]
On debt, the authorities share some of the concerns over the increase in debt levels. They would
like to indicate, however, that part of the increase reflects the need to adjust to the severity of the
terms-of-trade shock (including the need to build up foreign exchange reserves through a
bilateral loan). The increase in debt levels also reflects the need to sustain efforts to close the
country’s vast infrastructure gap, essential for raising Mauritania’s potential growth and fighting
poverty.
They would also like to emphasize that the overall debt situation is more nuanced than it appears.
First, the elevated debt levels referred to in the report (and in all IMF staff reports on Mauritania
since the HIPC completion point) include a sizeable Kuwaiti debt which has been passive for
many decades. If the Kuwaiti debt is excluded, the level of debt drops to 70 percent of GDP in
2016 ―which is still high but much lower than the level of 93% discussed in the report. Second,
the additional recent borrowing is mostly on concessional terms (see the report on the DSA).
Third, the ratio of “external debt service-to-GDP” remains low and manageable at 0.9 percent in
2015 and 2016.
3.

Medium-term policies and outlook

The authorities have made difficult policy choices in the wake of the severe terms-of-trade shock
to adapt to the new challenging environment. They are determined to pursue their policies and
are confident that their policy choices will enable them to make progress towards
macroeconomic stability and higher growth. They believe that given Mauritania’s economic
circumstances, the gradual approach to exchange rate adjustment is the right approach to
strengthen the country’s external position (as opposed to an abrupt depreciation which would do
nothing to revive exports given the extremely narrow export base and which would instead
exacerbate the already difficult economic situation by considerably slowing growth and
significantly increasing inflation.)
According to the staff projections, the current account is forecast to remain elevated over the
medium-term, posing financing risks. In response, the authorities will continue to introduce
further flexibility of the exchange rate. They are confident that the continued gradual
depreciation of the exchange rate (as long as the fundamentals require it) will help narrow the
current account deficit and will also likely have a lesser impact on the foreign exchange reserves
than currently assumed in the report. This is due in part to the fact that the import-to-GDP ratio
would further adjust to a continued depreciation of the currency.
The authorities are also determined to continue their fiscal consolidation efforts. While the
slowdown in economic activity and in the mining sector has had a severe impact on fiscal
revenues, the authorities will continue to adjust to the decline in extractive industries’ revenues
by reigning in expenditures while preserving essential social expenditures, with the objective to

4
lower further the primary fiscal deficit to a level that would stabilize debt levels as a share of
GDP. The authorities will also pursue important reforms which will support their fiscal
consolidation efforts to reduce debt. In this regard, they intend to improve the code of tax
procedures, the Organic Law of Finance (LOF) and the new customs code. Other important
reforms will improve cash management through a second-generation single treasury account and
strengthen the supervision of public enterprises.
Over the longer-term, the recent gas discoveries offshore Mauritania by the U.S. company
Kosmos, could significantly improve the outlook beyond 2019. However, the authorities rely
primarily on a dynamic and competitive private sector to diversify the economy and boost
growth in the medium-term. As noted in the report, Mauritania was one of the top 10 reformers
appearing in the 2016 Doing Business ranking. The authorities will pursue their efforts to
improve the business environment by simplifying administrative procedures and taxation,
modernize the judicial system, protect investors’ rights and implement the AML/CFT
framework. These efforts will need to be supported by a sound financial system to support
growth. In this regard, the authorities are committed to strengthen banking supervision and
promote a more competitive financial system to improve financial intermediation and inclusion
in support of their development agenda.
4.

Conclusion

The recent terms of trade shocks have impacted negatively on Mauritania’s economy. However,
the authorities are taking steps to address them, such that the economic outlook envisages a
recovery in economic activity for 2016. The focus of their efforts will be to address the current
account deficit and debt levels as they pursue their adjustment efforts. In doing so, they will
continue to work closely with Fund staff and other development partners to put in place the
appropriate policies that will help mitigate the impact of the shocks. With the help of the Fund
and the donor community, they will also continue their efforts to further diversify the economy
away from mineral commodities with the objective to raising growth to more sustainable and
inclusive levels.
________________________________________
[1] In the past, the IMF has always used the parallel market to assess potential imbalances on the
official market and possible misalignment of the currency. For example, in the 2008 the Article
IV Consultation report, staff note that the “results from the implementation of the CGER-type
methodologies indicate that misalignment estimates lie within the range of statistical error. These
results are confirmed by the absence of a significant premium on the parallel exchange rate
market”. In the July 2013 report on the sixth revue of the ECF, they note that “the premium
against the dollar and the euro on the parallel market remains small, indicating that there is no
fundamental imbalance on the official market”.
