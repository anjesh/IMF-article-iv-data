IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On February 1, the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation1 with
Austria, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting. 2
Austria is prosperous and stable. The economy has weathered the global financial crisis
(GFC) relatively well, and output surpassed pre-crisis levels in 2011. While growth has been
slow in recent years, inequality and poverty are low, and living standards high.
The economic recovery has strengthened in 2016. GDP growth in 2016 is estimated at
1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012–15. Growth has
been broad-based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax cuts, a recovery in
investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. Employment growth
has picked up as well, and unemployment has stabilized at below 6 percent. At 1.5 percent y/y
in November 2016, inflation is gradually picking up from low levels, driven mainly by rising
energy prices and price hikes in tourism-related services. The outlook for 2017 appears
similarly robust, while in the medium term growth would decline toward its potential rate,
which IMF staff estimate at just above 1 percent. Risks to the outlook are mainly external, with
limited likely impact overall.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Austria, Executive Directors endorsed
the staff’s appraisal as follows:

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal
can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Austria benefits from high levels of stability and social cohesion. Per capita income is high,
unemployment comparatively low (even though higher than previously), social protection
systems are strong, and the society is among the most equitable of advanced economies.
The overall outlook is solid, but potential growth is low. Growth picked up in 2016, but is
projected to slow gradually toward the medium-term potential rate of just above 1 percent as
the output gap closes and fiscal policy turns back to consolidation. Unemployment is set to
remain elevated for some time as employment creation just keeps pace with the rising labor
force, while inflation is projected to gradually rise to slightly above 2 percent in the medium
term.
Risks arise from a number of external factors, but are overall limited. International political
fragmentation or slow growth in other advanced economies and/or emerging markets would
undermine Austria’s performance, largely through the trade and financial channels. However,
with the European Single Market providing a stable economic framework and bank exposure
to risks in CESEE declining, the overall vulnerability of the Austrian economy is limited.
Raising the economy’s potential is important to raise living standards further and lower
unemployment, as well as to ease the fiscal burden of demographic change. A comprehensive
reform package should focus on four key areas: (i) structural reforms to strengthen
competition and further reduce firms’ administrative burden; (ii) raising public investment to
support private sector productivity and investment; (iii) shifting the tax mix away from labor
toward property, pollution, and consumption; and (iv) providing incentives for higher labor
force participation among elderly workers, as well as for full-time employment of women.
Long-term fiscal sustainability requires additional reforms. While projections indicate a
reduction of the fiscal deficit and debt in the medium term—largely on account of interest
savings and restraint in government consumption—fiscal pressures will re-emerge over the
longer term as the population ages, and debt will start to rise again. To ensure fiscal
sustainability in such an environment, the current window of opportunity should be used to
put in place efficiency-boosting expenditure reforms in health, education, and subsidies, as
well as further pension reform measures. To be successful, many of these reforms require
adjustments in fiscal relations between the federal and subnational governments. The
potential for savings is significant, and, in combination with growth-raising reforms,
sufficient to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Full implementation of these reforms
would also allow reducing the labor tax wedge further.
Maintaining financial stability calls for ensuring that banks raise capital as planned and
availing regulators with macroprudential tools to address potential risks in the real estate
market. Boosting banks’ capital buffers remains important, even though the low-growth, lowinterest rate environment makes this challenging. The authorities’ introduction of a systemic
risk capital buffer is welcome—they now need to ensure that banks will meet their capital

targets as scheduled. This is all the more important as the environment for banking remains
difficult both at home and abroad, and new challenges may arise. Financial stability risks
from the real estate markets are currently limited; nonetheless, regulators should be given the
legal authority to use macroprudential instruments at their discretion. To preserve Austria’s
position as a financial center, the authorities will also need to bolster its AML/CFT
framework, notably by enhancing supervision and banks’ compliance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 13, 2017

KEY ISSUES
Context: Austria is prosperous and stable. Nevertheless, it can still improve its economic
performance to ensure a continuing rise in incomes and employment within a stable
macroeconomic environment. To this end, a comprehensive package of structural and
fiscal reforms can raise low GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt.
Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment.
Outlook and risks: After a pick-up in 2016 supported by a tax cut-driven fiscal stimulus
and a recovery in investment, growth is expected to gradually decline to potential.
Inflation would gradually rise to above 2 percent in the medium term. Unemployment
has stabilized, but remains high by Austrian standards (though low compared to other
Euro Area countries). Risks arise from external factors such as international political
fragmentation, slower global growth, and a possible rise in risk premia embedded in
global interest rates.
Raising GDP growth: Structural reforms to boost competition and reduce firms’
administrative burden, higher public investment, shifting the burden of taxation away
from labor, and enabling higher labor force participation would raise GDP growth,
support higher employment and living standards, and ease fiscal strains.
Preserving fiscal sustainability: Public debt peaked at 85½ percent of GDP in 2015,
and fiscal consolidation is underway after the stimulus in 2016. However, to meet
ageing-related costs in the medium to long term, efficiency-boosting expenditure
reforms in health, education, and subsidies, as well as further pension reform measures,
need to be implemented. Many of these reforms require adjustments in fiscal relations
between the federal and subnational governments to realize their full potential.
Maintaining financial stability: The financial system is stable, but capital levels of large
banks are still low relative to peers, and raising them should be a priority. At the same
time, the low-interest rate environment, high bank costs, and legacies of heavy
engagement in emerging Europe call for significant adjustments in the banks’ business
models. Macroprudential tools to address potential risks in the real estate market need
to be made available to the regulators.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Austrians enjoy high quality of life. The
economy has weathered the global financial crisis
(GFC) relatively well, and output surpassed pre-crisis
levels in 2011. While growth has been slow in recent
years, inequality and poverty are low, and living
standards high.
The recovery has strengthened. GDP growth
in 2016 reached 1.4 percent (y/y) in 2016:Q1–Q3, and
is estimated at 1.4 percent for the year as a whole.
Growth has been broad-based, driven by private
consumption supported by income tax cuts, a recovery
in investment, and higher public consumption, in part
due to spending on refugees. Employment growth has
picked up in 2016 (Figure 1), catching up with the
rising labor supply driven by migration and higher
labor force participation. As a result, unemployment
has stabilized recently, at 5.8 percent in November (EU
harmonized rate) although it remains elevated relative
to historical levels.1 At 1.5 percent y/y in November,
inflation is picking up from low levels, driven mainly by
price hikes in tourism-related services.

being implemented, supported by a €0.6-1 billion
increase in refugee-related fiscal spending in 2016 relative to 2015. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain, such as a language barriers and low skills.

The external position remains broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies
(Annex I). The External Balance Assessment suggests that the current account balance in 2016 was
somewhat below the norm, while the REER was modestly overvalued. Policy gaps explain about a
third of the current account gap/REER overvaluation, with the main policy effect coming from high
health expenditure relative to trading partners (see ¶20 and footnote 8). Staff expects the current

account surplus to gradually decline from some 2½ percent of GDP in 2016 to 2.1 percent of GDP in
the medium term¸ as steadily improving business and consumer sentiment nudge private investment
and consumption higher (Tables 1 and 3). The international investment position, currently
moderately positive, should strengthen accordingly.
Political situation. The coalition government of Social Democrats and the right-of-center
People’s Party holds a small parliamentary majority. The partners’ views on some economic issues,
including further fiscal reforms, diverge at times. The need to build political consensus sometimes
slows down the design and implementation of economic policy measures. The next parliamentary
elections are due in September 2018. In a re-run of the second round of the presidential election in
December 2016, Alexander van der Bellen, backed by the Green Party, defeated Norbert Hofer of the
right-wing Freedom Party.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Outlook
Growth is projected to slow in the medium term, while inflation would gradually
normalize. In 2017, GDP growth is projected to slow marginally to 1.3 percent as the 2016 fiscal
stimulus tapers off. Current momentum in private investment and employment, strengthening
demand in major trading partners, and positive credit growth, supported by the ECB’s
accommodative policy stance, should underpin GDP growth around that level. In the medium term,
the closing negative output gap and the projected moderate fiscal consolidation should see growth
revert to its potential rate of just above 1 percent. With the output gap eventually turning mildly
positive, inflation should run somewhat above 2 percent in the medium term.

B. Risks
Risks to the outlook are largely external, with likely limited overall impact (Annex II):


International political fragmentation: Increasingly inward-oriented economic policies in some
trading partners may undermine international policy coordination and collaboration. This would
affect Austria, a very open economy, through the export and FDI channels. Also, prolonged
uncertainty over the modalities of Brexit could affect Austria via trading partners, although the
impact would likely be small.2 Lastly, should immigrant inflows resurge due to further dislocation
in the Middle East, Austria’s fiscal and economic capacity to absorb refugees could be strained.



Global growth: A slowdown of growth in non-European emerging markets, notably China, would

Austria’s economic links with the UK are limited. Exports of goods to Britain comprise only about 3 percent of total
exports, and the share in tourism is similar. However, Germany, Austria’s most important trading partner taking
30 percent of Austria’s exports, is more exposed through trade, direct investment, and financial links. The Brexit
repercussions therefore affect Austria largely indirectly, through their impact on Germany and other partners.

Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) countries, which take 31 percent of Austria’s exports
and with which its banks have extensive financial relations, could affect growth directly, as well
as the financial system. More broadly, structurally weak growth in Austria and other advanced
economies would make fiscal consolidation and debt reduction more difficult.


Financial conditions: A tightening of global financial conditions caused by a rise in risk premia
could be an upside risk for Austria, as its sovereign debt is widely regarded as a safe-haven
asset. On the other hand, were Austrian banks’ profitability to be significantly reduced by
materialization of political or regulatory risks in CESEE countries, confidence in Austria’s financial
stability could be affected and financial conditions deteriorate.

However, the impact of these risks would likely be limited, as the European Single Market, the
destination of 70 percent of Austria’s exports, continues to provide a stable economic framework.
Also, declining bank exposure to risks in CESEE is containing vulnerabilities.

Authorities’ views
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment. However, they estimated
medium-term potential growth somewhat higher, at around 1¼–1½ percent, based on a higher
total factor productivity (TFP) growth, which led to marginally higher projections of growth in 2017
and beyond. They were also more optimistic about containing non-demography related spending in
the long term. Concerning risks, the authorities emphasized that Austria, as a small open economy,
was dependent on open access to markets, and also highlighted the direct and indirect effects of a
potential slowdown in emerging markets, especially in CESEE. At the same time, they agreed that
banks’ exposure to risks in CESEE had declined with divesting of subsidiaries by several banks.

POLICIES
Increasing potential output by raising productivity, public investment, and labor force participation
would boost employment and living standards and ease fiscal strains. Efficiency gains in public
spending would create fiscal space for growth-friendly policies and ensure the continued decline of
public debt. Maintaining financial stability is a key component of a stable overall macroeconomic
environment.

A.

Raising Potential Output

Raising the economy’s potential would
require sustained and coordinated efforts.
Currently, staff estimates the potential growth rate at
just above 1 percent, limited mainly by low TFP
growth. Higher potential output––which would
manifest itself in a higher potential and actual growth
rate for a number of years––would help absorb the
rising labor force, ensure a continuing rise in living

standards, and ease the fiscal burden of demographic change. However, with Austria near the best
practice in many structural policies, there are no easy gains to be made from a single policy
measure. Nonetheless, a package of structural and fiscal policies can have an appreciable impact on
potential output––some 3 percent within ten years and up to 5 percent in the long run (chart).

Structural reforms need to concentrate on policies to strengthen innovation and
competition. Austria performs well in many structural indicators of economic governance. But there
is scope to lower barriers to entrepreneurship (regulations that hinder entry and competition in
professional services, as well as regulations that impose high administrative burdens on companies,
including start-ups) and barriers to investment in the network sectors. Improving Austria’s product
market regulation score by some 20 percent through reforms in these areas could boost potential
output by about 1.5 percent in the medium term (Figure 6).3 In this regard, the authorities’ start-up
promotion package announced earlier this year—providing administrative and financial aid—is a
step in the right direction, as is the increased support for research and development (R&D) in 2016.
Higher public investment can enhance
productivity. While Austria’s infrastructure is of high
quality, investment is low: in 2015, gross budget
investment (including capital transfers) stood at only
3.7 percent of GDP, resulting in net investment below
½ percent of GDP. Moreover, Austria has fallen back
in the World Economic Forum’s global ranking of
infrastructure quality between 2009/10 and 2016/17.4
An increase in public investment, focusing on
infrastructure bottlenecks, would raise the productivity

of private sector investment. Staff’s model simulation indicates that increasing public investment by
½ percent of GDP (which would bring it back to the levels of 2010–11), compensated by
reform-driven cuts in government consumption, could raise GDP by about 1 percent in the medium
term and up to 2 percent in the long term.
Shifting the tax mix would also raise potential output and employment. Despite recent
tax relief, Austria’s high labor tax wedge remains a drag on employment creation. Shifting the
burden of taxation away from labor and toward property, pollution, and consumption (by improving
VAT efficiency) would reduce economic distortions, improve resource allocation, and raise output. If
low-income households are adversely affected by such a tax shift, they would need to be protected
through the social assistance system by, e.g., raising the eligibility thresholds for means-tested social
benefits and the associated amounts. A model simulation suggests that if one percent of GDP in
income taxes is replaced by a combination of increased consumption and property taxes, potential
GDP would rise by about ½ percent over the medium term.

Higher labor force participation would raise output and ease pressures on social
security funds. Overall, labor force participation (LFP) of both men and women is close to the OECD
advanced economies (AE) average. However, in the age group of 55–64 it is significantly lower, and
also lower than the Nordics––the leaders in LFP (Box 1). While low LFP and part-time work may very
well reflect individual and societal preferences, they strain social security systems due to both lower
contributions and higher demand for basic income support from pensioners with too low
accumulated pension rights. LFP among the elderly is already on the rise and is likely to rise further
in the long term as already legislated reforms to raise the pension age for women gradually take
effect after 2024. However, bringing forward this increase, further tightening early retirement
options, and indexing the pension age to life expectancy would generate further and faster savings.
Measures to make full-time work more attractive for women (including through an extension of
kindergarten and school hours where needed) should raise hours worked (Box 1). The planned
introduction of incentives to work beyond the official pension age would help as well.

AUSTRIA

Authorities’ views
The authorities agreed on the need to raise potential output. They outlined measures
already implemented to this effect, but also pointed to economic, social, and political limitations on
reforms.


With regard to structural reforms, they pointed to initiatives already undertaken to reduce
financial and administrative burdens on start-ups, as well as increase support for R&D. They
agreed that deregulation of professional services and other heavily regulated professions could
strengthen competition, but pointed out that some regulations were needed to ensure high
quality standards. Staff agreed that quality and consumer protection should not be
compromised and pointed to the experience of some Nordic countries and Switzerland that
achieve high penetration and quality in professional services with less regulation.5



The authorities agreed that public investment was important to support the economy. They were
generally satisfied with Austria’s quality of public infrastructure, and thought that public
investment should focus on R&D, digitalization, and education. Some were skeptical about the
productivity-raising effect of certain infrastructure projects. Staff agreed that infrastructure
projects need to be carefully designed and prioritized to achieve maximum economic effect,



With regard to the tax mix, while seeing the merit of further reduction in social security
contributions, the authorities thought that finding offsetting tax measures would be politically
difficult. They would prefer instead to rely on improved tax administration, where measures put
in place in the course of 2016 should bear fruit in 2017, and on expenditure savings in the
medium term. Staff encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts.



On measures to raise labor force participation, the authorities agreed that improvements in
provision of childcare, in particular the extension of kindergarten and school hours, would help.
In this regard, they pointed to efforts underway to lengthen school hours, as well as to their
recently legislated education/training guarantee for youth up to the age of 21. On pension
system measures, views were split, with some satisfied with the effects of recently legislated
reforms while others arguing for further measures before population ageing raised costs.
Regarding integration of accepted asylum seekers, the authorities pointed to programs for
language training and identification and recognition of skills, but noted that the asylum seekers’
uneven skills slowed them in finding employment.

Box 1. Growth and Female Labor Force Participation
Raising female LFP can help cushion the impact of demographic change. Improving opportunities for full-time
work for women and promoting employment for the elderly—both men and women—could have a significant
effect on the labor supply.
Background (Box Figure 1): The increase in employment over the past 20 years has been entirely in
part-time employment, and mostly by women who have higher incidence of part-time work than in other
OECD AEs. Concomitantly, the average number of hours worked has declined significantly.
Causes: The relatively high incidence of part-time work by women may

increase in part-time work by men suggests that preferences in a rich
society may shift toward a higher valuation of free time. With regard to low labor force participation of
elderly workers, reasons include the relatively low retirement age for women (60 years, set to rise to 65 from
2024 to 2033), as well as options for early retirement for workers doing arduous work.
Impact: A high incidence of part-time work leads to lower pensions in an insurance-based system such as
Austria’s. However, old-age poverty in Austria is overall low, supported by a means-tested minimum income
for pensioners.3 Nonetheless, while the impact of part-time work on individuals is mitigated by the social
security system, the cost in terms of public spending (and foregone social security contributions) can be
significant. Indeed, Austria’s public expenditure on pensions is among the highest in the OECD. Lastly, the
level of potential output is lower than if more part-time workers worked full time.
Policy measures: Reforms to the pension system have already been legislated (including an increase in the
retirement age for women, and a tightening of eligibility for early retirement). Nonetheless, further reforms
(though not gender-specific) will be required to contain rising pension costs. With regard to the high
incidence of female part-time work, an increase in child care availability or long term care for the elderly
could widen women’s choices and encourage some to work full time.
Simulation: If policy measures were to lead to a decline in female part-time work to a level in line with other
OECD AEs (with male part-time work unchanged) and a corresponding increase in full-time employment,
full-time equivalent employment in Austria would rise by 2.9 percent, ceteris paribus.4 An increase in overall
LFP in the 55–64 age group to the OECD AE average (and employment of the additional workers) would
increase employment by a further 3.5 percent.
Only 11 percent of women and 16 percent of men work part-time involuntarily, well below the average of OECD AEs.
However, e.g., in Vienna, childcare facilities are open 11 hours or longer a day.
3
The risk of poverty is, though, somewhat higher for women over 65 than for men (15 percent vs. 11 percent).

B. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
Tax cuts generated a fiscal stimulus in 2016. With a structural surplus of 0.2 percent of
GDP (and a headline deficit of 1 percent), the fiscal outturn in 2015 was better than anticipated, in
part due to early dividend payments ahead of an increase in capital gains taxation in 2016. Public
debt stood at 85½ percent of GDP, and financing costs have declined further on the back of the
ECB’s quantitative easing policies. However, in 2016, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened
to 1.4 percent of GDP (0.8 percent of GDP in structural terms), as income tax cuts took effect,
compensating tax administration measures were implemented only gradually, capital gains tax
revenue fell, and refugee-related spending increased. Nonetheless, staff estimates that public debt
declined to below 84 percent of GDP.
Fiscal policy is set to gradually return the structural deficit to ½ percent of GDP,
Austria’s medium-term objective (MTO), by 2020 and reduce public debt. The authorities
project that interest savings and restraint in public consumption would bring expenditure down by
some 1¼ percentage points of GDP by 2020, more than enough to offset the ageing-driven rise in
social benefits of ¼ percent of GDP (Table 2). This, as well as the positive effects of the HETA debt
restructuring deal would bring gross public debt to some 71 percent of GDP by 2022, 13 percentage
points down from its 2016 level (Annex III).
In the longer run, however,
demography-related fiscal strains are emerging.
Without additional measures, strong pressures arising
from an increase in the share of pensioners in the
population and higher healthcare and long-term care
costs would drive up spending by some 3 percentage
points of GDP, widen the budget deficit accordingly,
and push public debt above 100 percent of GDP by
2060 (text chart).6

Moreover, both the medium term and the long term projections are subject to
downside risks. In the medium term, the fiscal restraint envisaged for the wage bill and spending
on goods and services, while certainly feasible, may run into political or implementation constraints,
as the projected 2018–22 levels (relative to GDP) are notably below the averages for the last five
years. In the long run, slower growth, lower labor force participation, or higher costs of social
policies could jeopardize fiscal consolidation and lead to debt levels even significantly higher than in
the baseline.

6

In the 2015 Article IV consultation, staff projected debt to exceed 130 percent of GDP by 2060 on unchanged
policies. The reduction to just above 100 percent of GDP in this round reflects: (i) the authorities’ updated long-term
demographic projections, reflecting recent trends in the labor force; (ii) the debt agreement with the creditors of
HETA, the wind-down unit of the former Hypo Alpe Adria bank (see Annex II), (iii) updated interest rate and inflation
projections, reflecting the latest WEO projections, and (iv) a downwardly revised 2015 debt outcome. These
developments have also led to improved debt sustainability in 2017–22 (Annex II).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRIA

Maintaining debt on a steady downward path is important. The authorities’ envisaged
path toward a structural fiscal balance target of -0.5 percent of GDP strikes the right balance
between reducing public debt and supporting the economy. Specifically, the essentially neutral fiscal
stance in 2017 is appropriate in view of the still slightly negative output gap (Table 1). So is their
plan to maintain this structural balance target until debt falls below 60 percent of GDP and risks to
long-term sustainability of public finances are reduced, and relax it to -1 percent thereafter in line
with EU rules. By rebuilding fiscal buffers, such a policy would: (i) increase the space for
countercyclical fiscal response to growth shocks; (ii) allow absorbing potential materialization of
contingent liabilities stemming from Austria’s large banking sector and sizable export guarantees,
(iii) help Austria regain its AAA rating, and thus keep borrowing costs low in the long term, and (iv)
prevent a deterioration in Austria’s external position.7
Efficiency-enhancing structural fiscal reforms would open up fiscal space. In the 2015
Article IV consultation report (Country Report No. 16/50), staff identified a number of areas in which
significant savings in public expenditure could be realized while maintaining the quality of public
service delivery. The main areas are the health and, to a lesser extent, education systems, which
together comprise around one quarter of total public spending, as well as spending on subsidies.8
Moreover, pension system measures (see ¶13) could reduce demographic spending pressures in the
long term. Combined, the expenditure savings in all these areas could amount to 2½–3 percent of
GDP over the medium to long run. Realizing these potential savings would also insure against risks
to the medium-term outlook as noted above. Some of these reforms would require adjustments of
fiscal relations between the federal and subnational governments with the aim of improving
subnational entities’ incentives to enhance the efficiency of service delivery (Box 2).

With this deficit path, gross public debt would fall below 60 percent of GDP by 2029 and stabilize around

fundamentals (¶4).

Authorities’ views
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to Austria’s MTO. They acknowledged
longer-term fiscal pressures, as well as risks surrounding the projections, and agreed on the need for
policy measures to maintain the MTO over the longer run. They also thought that healthcare,
education, and subsidies offered opportunities for savings, but emphasized that quality standards
needed to be maintained or improved, in particular in education. They also noted that, while a
reform of fiscal federalism was desirable, political difficulties were significant, in part due to
trade-offs between efficiency, autonomy and equity.

Risks to banks’ portfolios have declined. Bank profits increased in 2015–16, largely owing
to lower risk provisioning as the quality of bank assets improved, and higher profits in CESEE. To
reduce risk further, banks have actively promoted conversion of Swiss franc mortgage loans to
euro-denominated loans with gradual amortization in Austria, as recommended by staff (Annex IV),
and a reduction in foreign-currency loans in CESEE. In a move that paves the way for a closure on
the global financial crisis legacy, a large majority of HETA creditors representing nearly 99 percent of
the claims have accepted the authorities’ offer for a settlement giving senior and junior creditors an
NPV of 90 percent and 45 percent, respectively, which avoids an involuntary restructuring under the
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and problems with guarantees on Hypo Alpe Adria’s
liabilities extended by the state of Carinthia.
Credit dynamics are mixed. While business credit to Austrian firms remains subdued,
lending to households has picked up (largely mortgages) against a background of rising house
prices (Figure 3 and Box 3). In response, the authorities are drafting a law enabling the Financial
Market Authority (FMA) to introduce real-estate-loan related macroprudential instruments (caps on
the loan-to-value ratio, debt- and debt service to income ratio, amortization requirements etc.).
Meanwhile, in November 2016 the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) issued a warning that
house prices appear overvalued. In many CESEE markets, credit growth remains robust overall
against a background of continuing strong deposit mobilization. This has allowed Austrian-owned

Box 2. Fiscal Federalism in Austria
Fiscal federal relations involve tradeoffs between equity, autonomy, and efficiency. In Austria, the different
levels of government (federal, state, and local) are closely interlinked financially, and the system is fairly
complex and rigid. This leads to spending inefficiencies, as sub-national authorities have little incentive to
economize. On the other hand, the degree of spatial equity is high.
Features:

Size and complexity. States and local authorities play a considerable role in providing public
services. Together, they are responsible for about 31 percent of total public spending. Transfers flow from
the federation to states and municipalities, as well as from states to municipalities, and from them to
states.

Autonomy. The fiscal autonomy of subnational governments is very narrow. Most taxes are levied
at the federal level and shared in specific proportions among the federation, states, and municipalities.
Only a small amount of taxes is levied by states (5½ percent of their revenue) and municipalities
(14 percent of revenue). Expenditure autonomy is also very limited, as a large share of transfers from
higher-level governments are earmarked.

Redistribution. Austria has a strong redistributive mechanism, with revenue being allocated to
ensure a similar level of public service provision across the country.
Implications:

Efficiency. Limited revenue and spending autonomy demotivates efficiency, since more efficient
provision of public services does not allow a reduction in taxation (and only to a limited extent a
reallocation of funds for other purposes). This may go some way to explain why Austria has high
spending on, e.g., health and education relative to the achieved results (see Country Paper 16/50).

Equity. However, limiting revenue autonomy, as well as significant redistribution, may help limit
regional economic disparities, while a lower degree of spending autonomy implies that public services are
supplied to broadly the same standards.
Reform options: With strong centralized social security systems—which ensure a degree of equity across
the population independent of states’ fiscal position—Austria is in a position to exploit the opportunities
that greater fiscal autonomy offers. Higher revenue autonomy could lead to better use of efficient tax
resources (e.g., property taxes, since these are locally determined). At the same time, most business and
consumption taxes should continue to be set at the federal level to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor policies
and economic distortions. Higher expenditure autonomy, accompanied by financial incentives such as
sharing in the gain from reforms, benchmarking targets to best domestic and international practice, and
rewards/penalties for under/overspending, would motivate the states to bring health and education
spending per capita in line with other high-income federations without loss of quality (Box Figure 1). This
need not come at the expense of equity; for example, neighboring Switzerland combines significant fiscal
autonomy for its cantons, with a high degree of equity. The most recent agreement on fiscal equalization
for 2017–22 takes some steps in this direction: the introduction of cost reduction paths, spending reviews
and benchmarking aims at reducing healthcare spending while ensuring quality, while states gain
autonomy over one, admittedly minor, tax.

the plans to raise capital through cost
rationalization and asset reduction have not
adversely affected credit supply in these countries
so far. The risk of this happening in the future is
reduced by the overall profitability of CESEE
subsidiaries and the fact that asset reduction is
planned to occur mainly through sale of non-core
assets rather than restraint on lending.

Slow credit demand, high costs, and declining interest margins make it challenging for
banks to strengthen capital. To meet their capital targets, banks rely on divesting non-core assets
abroad and cutting costs to raise profitability with the aim of capitalizing profits. However, costs are
being cut only slowly, and the low-growth, low-interest rate environment hampers a sustained
increase in profits in the home market, while in CESEE markets higher profits are accompanied by
higher economic, political, and regulatory risks. This calls for significant adjustments in the banks’
business models and makes it challenging to raise capital. The authorities will need to stand firm in
enforcing capital strengthening along the envisaged path, using the full range of tools available to
them. This would bolster financial stability and place the banking system in a better position to
finance private sector investment should credit demand recover with reforms that lead to faster
potential growth. 10
Macroprudential tools to address potential risks in the real estate market need to be
made available to the regulators. While real estate-related risks—and banks’ exposure to them—
are currently limited, including due to overall conservative lending practices (Box 3), a law allowing
the introduction of real estate-specific macroprudential tools should be passed as soon as possible
to allow the authorities to stay ahead of the curve. This is all the more important since, as experience
elsewhere shows, the design, development, and application of macroprudential tools is typically a
time-consuming process, and implementation often needs to be phased. Measures to stimulate the
supply response to the increased demand for housing in major cities should also be implemented,
such as reviewing the zoning regulations and other restrictions on construction.
To preserve Austria’s position as a financial center, the authorities will need to
strengthen the AML/CFT framework. The 2016 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual
Evaluation Report of Austria recommended a number of prioritized actions, including to enhance

the effectiveness of AML/CFT supervision and the implementation of preventive measures, as well as
improvements in the investigation and prosecution of money laundering and in the use of financial
intelligence.11 The authorities have developed an action plan to implement the report’s
recommendations, including through, among other measures, strengthening of banks’ compliance
functions and an increase of supervisory agencies’ resources, as well as legislation to implement the
4th EU AML Directive.

Authorities’ views
The authorities underlined their commitment to stronger bank capitalization. They
contended that banks were on track to meet their capital targets thus far, but assured staff that they
would deploy all available tools to ensure this outcome should problems appear. They indicated that
they were in regular consultation with banks to ensure interim targets were met.
The Austrian supervisory authorities shared staff’s assessment that real estate-related
risks were limited, while agreeing that macroprudential tools needed to be made legally
available to them. They thought that the ESRB’s warning did not sufficiently take into account
initial conditions, including the low share of mortgage lending both as a percentage of GDP and in
relation to banks’ capital compared with other Euro Area countries, but focused only on price
changes. They also explained that homeownership in Austria was low on account of the comparative
prevalence of social and rental housing (above all in Vienna), and mortgage lending practices
conservative, as evidenced by the low default and loss ratios on mortgages. Nonetheless, they
agreed that the situation needed monitoring, and considered the passage of legislation to enable
the FMA to develop and apply macroprudential tools as a priority. They also pointed out that they
were already encouraging banks to shift consumers from variable to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce
risks to debt service affordability.
The government emphasized that they were strongly committed to strengthen their
AML/CFT framework. They explained that legislation to implement the European Union’s 4th AML
Directive and strengthen banks’ risk analysis, customer due diligence, and compliance functions
(including intra-bank group information exchange across borders) was being prepared. Meanwhile,
negotiations to amend the Directive at the EU level were ongoing, inter alia to create a legal basis
for intra-EU cooperation among supervisory authorities with regard to AML. They also indicated that
they had formed an inter-agency committee to better coordinate AML/CFT work and hold to
account individual agencies, and were planning to strengthen key agencies (the FMA and Financial
Intelligence Unit) with more powers and personnel. However, they pointed out that much of the
FATF’s comments on Austria’s AML/CFT framework pertained to implementation, and results of the
measures taken now would take time to materialize.

The FATF is an intergovernmental body tasked with setting standards and promoting effective implementation of
measures to combat money laundering, finance terrorism, and other related issues.

Box 3. Recent Dynamics of House Prices in Austria

Factors underpinning recent housing price dynamics.
Low interest rates over recent years have loosened credit
constraints and increased households’ borrowing
capacity, putting upward pressure on housing demand.
That said, prices have been kept high by supply side
constraints and other idiosyncratic factors, especially in
Vienna.1 Reviewing and relaxing local planning systems
and regulations to facilitate the supply response to price
movement can help contain the price rises close to the
long run trend.

Price increases in Vienna have moderated lately,
while picking up in the rest of the country (Figure 3).
In 2015, prices rose by 7.6 percent nationwide, of which
3.9 percent in Vienna and 9.6 percent in the rest of the
country. As of June 2016, the year-on-year house price
increase picked up to 9.5 percent, with 3.1 percent in

House price growth has been strong in recent years
by international comparisons. The cumulative increase
in the house price index over 2007–2015 was nearly
40 percent. To a large extent, this increase was driven by
price dynamics in Vienna. The OeNB residential price
index indicator, which assesses whether prices move in
line with fundamental factors, points to an overvaluation
of property prices of about 22 percent for Vienna, while
prices in the rest of the country appear broadly in line
with fundamentals.

ratio is about 90 percent, low compared to peers.
Nonetheless, the authorities need to have the legal authority to expand the macroprudential toolkit with real
estate-specific instruments when needed, to limit any potential risks to banks’ portfolios if real estate price
bubbles were to emerge. Moreover, the large share of new mortgages at variable interest rates (77 percent
in 2016:Q1) raises concerns about debt service affordability if interest rates begin to rise.

In Vienna, municipality-provided social housing (which can be rented only by eligible households) accounts for some
70 percent of total housing. Moreover, strong international demand for luxury housing is affecting price developments.

STAFF APPRAISAL
Austria benefits from high levels of stability and social cohesion. Per capita income is
high, unemployment comparatively low (even though higher than previously), social protection
systems are strong, and the society is among the most equitable of advanced economies.
The overall outlook is solid, but potential growth is low. Growth picked up in 2016, but is
projected to slow gradually toward the medium-term potential rate of just above 1 percent as the
output gap closes and fiscal policy turns back to consolidation. Unemployment is set to remain
elevated for some time as employment creation just keeps pace with the rising labor force, while
inflation is projected to gradually rise to slightly above 2 percent in the medium term.
Risks arise from a number of external factors, but are overall limited. International
political fragmentation or slow growth in other advanced economies and/or emerging markets
would undermine Austria’s performance, largely through the trade and financial channels. However,
with the European Single Market providing a stable economic framework and bank exposure to risks
in CESEE declining, the overall vulnerability of the Austrian economy is limited.
Raising the economy’s potential is important to raise living standards further and
lower unemployment, as well as to ease the fiscal burden of demographic change. A
comprehensive reform package should focus on four key areas: (i) structural reforms to strengthen
competition and further reduce firms’ administrative burden; (ii) raising public investment to support
private sector productivity and investment; (iii) shifting the tax mix away from labor toward property,
pollution, and consumption; and (iv) providing incentives for higher labor force participation among
elderly workers, as well as for full-time employment of women.
Long-term fiscal sustainability requires additional reforms. While projections indicate a
reduction of the fiscal deficit and debt in the medium term—largely on account of interest savings
and restraint in government consumption—fiscal pressures will re-emerge over the longer term as
the population ages, and debt will start to rise again. To ensure fiscal sustainability in such an
environment, the current window of opportunity should be used to put in place efficiency-boosting
expenditure reforms in health, education, and subsidies, as well as further pension reform measures.
To be successful, many of these reforms require adjustments in fiscal relations between the federal
and subnational governments. The potential for savings is significant, and, in combination with
growth-raising reforms, sufficient to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Full implementation of
these reforms would also allow reducing the labor tax wedge further.
Maintaining financial stability calls for ensuring that banks raise capital as planned
and availing regulators with macroprudential tools to address potential risks in the real estate
market. Boosting banks’ capital buffers remains important, even though the low-growth, lowinterest rate environment makes this challenging. The authorities’ introduction of a systemic risk
capital buffer is welcome—they now need to ensure that banks will meet their capital targets as
scheduled. This is all the more important as the environment for banking remains difficult both at
home and abroad, and new challenges may arise. Financial stability risks from the real estate

markets are currently limited; nonetheless, regulators should be given the legal authority to use
macroprudential instruments at their discretion. To preserve Austria’s position as a financial center,
the authorities will also need to bolster its AML/CFT framework, notably by enhancing supervision
and banks’ compliance with AML/CFT obligations.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
External position. Austria’s external position has strengthened considerably in recent years, with
the international investment position (IIP) moving from -13 percent of GDP in 2006 to a moderate
+5½ percent in 2016. This turnaround stems

from a combination of factors. While Austria’s

reduced imports somewhat (chart). Regarding
financial flows, Austrian banks sharply reduced their reliance on foreign wholesale financing (and
exposure to CESEEs), with the decline in foreign liabilities exceeding the decline in assets as deposits
rebounded both at home and in CESEEs. This has led to a decline in banks’ gross external assets
from a peak of well over 100 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 76 percent of GDP in 2016, still above
the 1995 level of about 40 percent of GDP. However, Austria’s total gross external assets increased
from 67 percent of GDP in 1995 to a peak of 273 percent in 2007, before receding more moderately
to 255 percent in 2016.
Current account balance and real exchange rate. The External Balance Assessment suggests that
the current account balance in 2016 (2.4 percent of GDP) was below the norm (estimated at
3.4 percent of GDP), while the REER was modestly overvalued (around 8¾–10½ percent), with both
effects largely due to an unexplained residual.1 Policy gaps explain about one-third of the current
account gap and REER overvaluation, with the main policy effects coming from high health

1/ Considers the REER CPI index in each country, and thus does not explain inter-country variations of the REER.
2/ Takes into account differences in real exchange rates across countries by considering PPP real exchange rate.

The analysis is based on panel regressions of the current account balance and the real effective exchange rate
(REER), which are simultaneously determined. The first stage is descriptive and focused on understanding current
account and real exchange rate developments. The second stage is oriented toward a normative evaluation, drawing
on the regression results to estimate equilibrium values for the current account balance and the REER, deviations
(“gaps”) of actual current account balances and REER from these equilibrium values, as well as the contributions of
“policy gaps” to the overall current account balance and REER gaps.

expenditure relative to trading partners (see ¶20, footnote 8 in the main text). In the current account
analysis, the low budget deficit relative to trading partners partially offsets the effect of the high
health spending.
Capital and financial account. Net direct investment outflows to both CESEE countries and the
EU15, have recovered quickly after the GFC driven by real-sector investment, keeping the FDI
position in surplus. Net portfolio investment outflows have been strong as well and are expected to
remain so, despite the further retrenching of Austrian banks’ foreign holdings, and the negative net
portfolio investment position is expected to close gradually. This will be mirrored by a decline in the
positive net “other investments” position.
Overall assessment. Austria’s external position is sustainable and broadly in line with fundamentals.
The ageing population implies that a build-up of external assets in the next few years is warranted
as a buffer for future withdrawals. Policies are broadly appropriate, though raising the efficiency of
health expenditures would open significant savings potential to help ensure fiscal sustainability in
the long run.

Impact/Policy Response

Medium

Austria is a very open economy, with
exports comprising over 50 percent of
GDP (of which about 70 percent to the
EU). Political fragmentation could
reduce exports and potential growth
and jeopardize fiscal consolidation.
However, the impact is likely limited.
Policy response: maintain free
movement of goods, services, capital,
and labor with key partners as at
present.
The effects of Brexit are largely
indirect (via their impact on Germany
and other EU partners) since direct
economic relations with the UK are
limited. However, a slump in
confidence could reduce investment.
Policy response: raise public
investment to boost demand,
productivity, and potential growth.
Increased migrant flows could lead to
another wave of refugees entering
Austria. Apart from creating political
tensions, this would put some strain
on public finances in the short term.
The contribution of immigrants to the
economy will depends on the success
of integration policies. Policy response:
invest in integration of admitted
asylum seekers.

Protracted uncertainty associated with
negotiating post-Brexit arrangements
could weigh on confidence and
investment more than expected.
Increased barriers could also dampen
the longer-run economic performance
of affected countries more than
expected.

Safe haven currencies—especially the
US dollar—surge creates balance sheet

Low

For Austria, this can be an upside risk.
Despite a high level of public debt, its
bonds are regarded as safe-haven
assets. Current risk premia in
sovereign yields are exceptionally low,
so an increase will be easily
manageable. However, were Austrian
bank profitability to be notably
reduced by materialization of political
or regulatory risks in CESEE countries,
confidence in Austria’s financial
stability could be affected and
financing conditions deteriorate.
Policy response: strengthen banks’
capital cushions.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Austria’s debt outlook has improved. Public debt is sustainable within the medium-term projection
horizon, though ageing cost pressures are looming in the longer term. Under the baseline, debt will fall
from around 84 percent of GDP at end-2016 to 71 percent of GDP by end-2022. Standardized
macro-fiscal stress tests indicate that lower growth and a combined macro-fiscal shock could shift the
debt-to-GDP ratio upwards, even though debt would remain on a downward trajectory. However, in
the longer term (starting in the mid-2020s), ageing cost pressures and higher interest rates would
reverse the debt path without additional policy measures.

Baseline
Under the baseline, fiscal policy is set to return the structural deficit to ½ percent of GDP, Austria’s
MTO, by 2020.1 This, as well as the positive effects of the deal with the creditors of HETA, the
wind-down unit of the former Hypo Alpe Adria bank, would bring gross public debt to 71 percent of
GDP by 2022, 13 percentage points down from its 2016 level.2 Gross financing needs are moderate
in the period 2017–22.
The heat map indicates that vulnerabilities have receded. The declining debt level implies that the
impact of potential shocks would not push Austria’s debt—with the exception of a contingent
liability shock—over the relevant thresholds. The high share of public debt held by non-residents,
and the attendant external financing requirements, are a potential vulnerability, though this is
limited by the perception of Austria as a safe-haven Euro Area country. However, it could lead to
higher volatility in spreads, especially once the ECB’s asset purchases end, depending on interest
rate dynamics outside Austria and residual risks from commercial banks’ CESEE exposure.

Stress Tests
The low-growth scenario assumes that growth is reduced by one standard deviation of the historical
outturn, implying a reduction of growth by 2 percentage point in 2017–18. The debt-to-GDP ratio
would increase by close to 8 percentage points to a peak of 84½ percent of GDP in 2019 and then
decline to 79 percent of GDP by 2022. An illustrative contingent liability shock of 10 percentage
points of GDP would raise public debt to 97½ percent of GDP, which would only slowly decline to
93½ percent of GDP by 2022. The other standardized macro shocks––the primary balance shock, the
real exchange rate shock, and the real interest rate shock––will not lead to significant deviations
from the baseline debt path. A combined shock for all variables is driven by assumed lower growth
and leads to a similar debt path as in the low-growth scenario.
The structural balance excludes various one-offs, in particular bank restructuring cost. International experience
suggests that the baseline scenario is realistic (see panel “Austria Public DSA – Realism of Baseline Assumptions”).
1

The debt forecast for 2021 is lower than in the 2015 Article IV consultation by 4½ percentage points (ppts) of GDP
on account of now-incorporated projections for HETA asset recovery (1.6 ppts), a 0.7 ppts better outturn of the debt
ratio in 2015, and 2.1 ppts on account of a slightly higher nominal GDP and a lower deficit during 2015–21, resulting
from a 2015 base effect (higher revenue and lower expenditure than expected that carry through the medium term)
and lower projected real interest rates, reflecting updated nominal interest rate and inflation projections.

Annex IV. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
2015 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policy I
Broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2016, defined as
a fiscal relaxation within ½ percentage points of
GDP

In 2016, the structural fiscal balance was relaxed
by some 1 percentage point of GDP, as a result
of an upward revision of the 2015 outcome and
delays in planned tax administration measures.

Fiscal policy II
Consolidation in medium term. Moving to a
structural surplus in 2018-20 and keeping it until
public debt reaches 60 percent of GDP

While envisaging consolidation, the authorities’
latest projections imply a structural deficit of
0.5 percent of GDP by 2020. This is supported
by improved demographic projections and oneoff debt-reducing factors.

Fiscal policy III
Broad-based expenditure reforms to realize
savings while maintaining quality of public
service delivery

Discussions on fiscal federal relations aimed to
introduce incentives for savings at the level of
state governments. The government started
discussions on further pension reforms.

Fiscal policy IV
Further reduction of labor tax wedge

The tax code envisages some modest reductions
in social security contributions in 2017-18.

Immigration
Rapid integration of accepted asylum seekers

Several initiatives taken, including provision of
language classes and a program to identify
skills.

Structural reforms
Policies to raise TFP growth and labor force
participation

A program to support start-ups financially and
administratively has been put in place. Fiscal
support to encourage work instead of early
retirement is in place and further measures to
retain elderly workers are in discussion.

Financial sector I
Continuously assess adequacy of bank capital
Financial sector II
Alternative measures to raise capital if banks’
plans to raise capital ratios falter.
Financial sector III
Proactively mitigate risks related to Swiss franc
loans
Financial sector IV
Strengthen preparedness by introducing
macroprudential instruments

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The authorities are closely monitoring banks’
capital cushions and capital-raising plans.
Not applicable, as banks’ plans are still being
implemented.
Banks have been promoting conversion of Swiss
franc mortgage loans to euro-denominated
loans with gradual amortization.
In process. Legislation not yet approved.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
Exchange System:
As of January 1, 1999, the currency of Austria is the euro, which floats freely and independently against
other currencies. Austria’s exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, with the exception of restrictions notified to the Fund in
accordance with decision No.144-(52/51) resulting from UN Security Council Resolutions and EU
Council Regulations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available on the Fund’s
electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of the SDDS flexibility
option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the merchandise trade data. Austria is
currently preparing for SDDS Plus adherence.
2.
The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to
the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an efficient
transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS and IFS Supplement.
