EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Economic growth strengthened in 2010 as the global recovery pushed oil prices higher and
fiscal spending supported non-oil growth. Going forward, high oil prices and increased oil
production to offset supply shortfalls elsewhere provide for a positive economic outlook for
2011. The authorities have taken advantage of the strong economic outlook to accelerate
initiatives to address important social issues, notably in housing, unemployment, and
extending the social safety net. Despite the increased fiscal spending associated with these
initiatives, external and fiscal balances are expected to strengthen further, but vulnerabilities
to a sustained decline in the oil price have increased and there are upside risks to inflation.
Policy priorities
Key priorities are to: contain near-term inflationary pressures; ensure medium-term fiscal
sustainability; create job opportunities for nationals while maintaining competitiveness;
further develop capital markets; and improve access to housing finance.
Staff’s recommendations


Proactively use fiscal and monetary policies to contain inflationary pressures, if
needed.



Ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term by diversifying non-oil revenue
sources, scaling back subsidies, and enhancing efficiency of spending through the
development of a medium-term expenditure framework.



Promote the development of capital markets, ensure sound development of mortgage
finance, and better align the legal framework for supervision and regulation with
practice.



The exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate.

Authorities’ views


Inflation remains driven by structural factors—imported food prices and rents—while
increases in domestically driven components would be modest and temporary.



The fiscal accounts will remain strong throughout the medium term as the strong
demand for oil will support the oil price. Much of the recent increase in fiscal
spending constitutes an investment in future generations.



Capital markets are emerging, with the yield curve likely to develop from the
corporate bond market. Housing finance will be carefully monitored and regulated.
The current legal framework for banking supervision and regulation has proven to be
effective.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Saudi Arabia has achieved substantial gains in key development indicators
(Figure 1). With about one fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves, Saudi Arabia has been able
to translate its oil wealth into advances in social outcomes. Most indicators are close to the
average for both the G-20 countries and other emerging market commodity exporters (Chile
and Mexico), but remain below those of the advanced economy commodity exporters
(Australia and Norway).

2.
Nonetheless, important social issues remain. In particular, pressure on housing
resources and unemployment are longstanding concerns—which have been highlighted in
previous development plans—that have yet to be resolved and could intensify in the face of
still high rates of population growth.
3.
The confluence of high oil prices, increased oil export volumes, substantial
international reserves, and the absence of debt, provides a significant opportunity to
address these social priorities. The challenge then is how government can best respond,
while fostering the emergence of a private sector capable of creating sufficient new jobs but
without heightening near or medium-term fiscal sustainability risks and vulnerabilities.
II. EMERGING FROM THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
The economy strengthened as oil prices increased with the rebound in global economic
activity, and fiscal spending stimulated an acceleration in non-oil GDP growth. Fiscal and
external balances improved with higher oil revenues. Spillovers on financial markets from
unrest elsewhere in the region have been limited.
4.
Following a decline in growth in 2009, the economy has recovered in 2010 and
early 2011 along with the rebound in global demand. Overall real GDP growth rose from

Fiscal accounts moved back into surplus in 2010 as increased oil revenues more
than offset rising fiscal spending. Fiscal spending continued to grow in 2010—although at a
slower pace than in the past five years—exceeding the approved budget by a wide margin as
the wage bill and capital spending surpassed their respective targets. Overall revenue
increased in line with global oil prices, while non-oil revenue declined marginally compared
to 2009, due to below average growth in the private sector and lower investment income,
reflecting the low yields in international financial markets.
7.
The external current account surplus strengthened in 2010 reflecting stronger
global demand and higher oil prices. The increase in oil export revenue—about 85 percent
of overall export revenue—more than compensated for a rise in imports and net factor income
outflows, with the current account surplus increasing from $20.9 billion in 2009 (5.6 percent
of GDP) to $66.8 billion in 2010 (15.4 percent of GDP). This resulted in an overall balance of
$35.1 billion in 2010 and an increase in SAMA’s gross foreign assets to $444 billion (just
over two years of import cover).

Policies pursued in Saudi Arabia have significant spillovers both regionally and
globally; but the impact of recent regional unrest on financial markets in Saudi Arabia
has been limited (Box 1). Saudi Arabia accounts for more than two-thirds of spare capacity

East as well as South and East
Asia. Further, increased fiscal spending by Saudi Arabia, including at the height of the global
financial crisis, has important positive spillovers for demand in regional and global trading
partners.1

Saudi Arabia’s share of global imports of goods and services increased by 20 percent during 2007–09, from
0.87 percent to 1.06 percent. The linkages between fiscal decisions in Saudi Arabia and the global economy
(with Asia and the rest of the world modeled separately) and between growth in Asia and Saudi Arabia are
explored in the context of the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model. The model highlights the close
linkages between growth in Asia and oil production in Saudi Arabia as well as the continuing linkages between
fiscal spending in Saudi Arabia and activity in the rest of the world.

Box 1. Financial Contagion from the Region?
Recent unrest in the Middle East was associated with large movements in financial markets in the region.
Stock markets in most Middle Eastern economies have been flat or fallen over the last year—a sharp contrast to the
sharp increases seen in other emerging markets—while CDS spreads have risen, though not to the levels seen during
2008–09 at the height of the Global Financial Crisis.

The dip in the Saudi stock exchange in early 2011 can
partly be explained by spillovers from the region.
Saadi Sedik and Williams (IMFWP/11/138) estimate
volatility spillovers in equity markets within the GCC and
between the GCC and the U.S. Their results indicate that
cross-volatility spillovers within the GCC and from the
U.S. stock market to the region were significant between
2000 and 2010. For Saudi Arabia, the spillover of shocks
from the U.S. was lower than other GCC countries,
consistent with the limited non-GCC participation in the
Saudi stock market.
CDS markets identify only modest contagion from
events in the region. Using the methodology of
Caceres, Guzzo, and Segoviano (IMF WP10/120),
spillover coefficients—a measure of vulnerability of
one country to contagion from a group of other
countries—are extracted from CDS data. While markets
are generally thin, trading in the Saudi five-year CDS
contract has increased, in part as a means of hedging
exposures toward both Saudi Arabia and the region in
general. While the spillover coefficients have increased,
in absolute levels they remain well below the levels
seen at the height of the global financial crisis.
Bahrain and Egypt have been the key contributors
to risks in other countries. Inverting the spillover
coefficients provides an indicator of the contribution of
one country to the spillover coefficient of the other
countries. During January 11 to March 15—a period
which covers unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrain
and a few other countries—the countries at the center of
events, notably Bahrain and Egypt, were the principal
sources of risk.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Surging oil revenues are likely to improve fiscal and external balances in the near
term, despite fiscal expansion and heightened uncertainties in the oil market. Oil
revenues will increase relative to 2010 from both price and volume effects as Saudi oil
production is expected to increase to help stabilize global oil markets by filling the void left
by supply shortfalls elsewhere in the region. The volatility seen in oil prices combined with
the uncertainty of both demand and supply conditions in the global market create an unusually
large range of forecasts for oil revenues. However, even in low price/production scenarios,
fiscal and external balances are expected to remain in surplus in 2011 despite the substantial
fiscal spending packages announced in February and March (see table below and Box 2).

Despite the strong near-term outlook, staff estimates suggest that the recent fiscal
packages have increased vulnerabilities to a dip in the oil price while pushing
expenditures beyond a long-term sustainable level. The break-even oil price for 2011 is
estimated by staff to have risen to $80/bbl (higher if oil production is below the 9.3 mbd
projected), rising to $98/bbl by 2016. Thus an adverse shock, such as oil prices falling to the
level of 2010 for a sustained period, would lead to the emergence of fiscal deficits. Further,
the fiscal position as reflected in the non-oil primary deficit as a share of non-oil GDP is
currently beyond sustainable level as measured by a standard intergenerational equity models
based on the permanent income hypothesis.2

The authorities noted that there were significant upside risks to the staff’s
medium-term scenario and stressed that increased spending levels over the next few
years constituted an important investment consistent with a long-established
development strategy. Given the dominant position of oil in the economy—which would
remain even with progress on diversification—economic prospects remain linked to the global
oil price. In this regard, the authorities considered the break-even oil price for 2011 to be
much less than estimated by staff and that the continuing strong demand for oil, especially
from emerging market economies, points to upside risks on the oil price forecast. Higher
fiscal spending involved initiatives to strengthen social outcomes—including addressing the
housing shortfall and introducing an unemployment benefit as part of an expanded social
safety net—that had important welfare implications for current and future generations.

2

The intergenerational equity model is based on the assumption of a constant real consumption per capita out of
the oil wealth. Results are sensitive to assumptions on the stock of oil reserves, the real rate of return on
investments, population growth, and the projected path for oil prices.

11
Box 2. 2011 Fiscal Packages
Royal Decrees issued on February 23 and March 18, 2011 introduced new initiatives to
tackle social issues that will have substantial short- and medium-term expenditure
implications. The packages include public sector wage increases, expansion in public
employment, unemployment benefits, and measures to improve access to housing. The packages
are estimated to be a combined amount of about SR 400 billion or $110 billion (19 percent of
2011 GDP).1 Of this, an estimated SR 117 billion or $31 billion (5.5 percent of GDP) would
likely be spent in 2011. Capital expenditures, particularly related to housing, are expected to pick
up slowly and spread over several years.

IV. POLICY PRIORITIES
Large surpluses in both fiscal and external accounts provide an opportunity to address social
priorities, as witnessed by the recent Royal Decrees. Implementation of these initiatives will
however raise a number of policy challenges, including: (i) inflation risks; (ii) medium-term
fiscal policy; (iii) growth and employment; and (iv) financial market development.
A. Inflation—Guarding Against Overheating
14.
Inflation risks have risen due to both external and domestic factors. Inflation has
been driven by a combination of imported prices—particularly global food prices that are
expected to increase by 22 percent in 2011—structural factors, notably rents, and other
factors. Housing prices continue to rise due to the existing supply shortages and high pent up
demand from the growing population, though such pressures would diminish over the medium
term as the new housing initiatives take hold. In terms of other factors, the staff noted that the
recent fiscal transfers—in particular, the two month salary bonuses for public servants paid in
March, subsequently matched by some private sector enterprises—had injected significant
additional liquidity into the domestic economy. The authorities considered that the potential
inflationary impact from domestic factors was manageable noting that any inflation spike
emanating from the cash transfers would be temporary and that the capital investments
envisaged would be implemented over a number of years. Nonetheless, the authorities
stressed that they continue to monitor for signs that the high liquidity levels were spilling over
into excessive credit growth.
15.
It was agreed that in the event that inflationary pressures do materialize, fiscal
and monetary policies should be used proactively to contain pressures. Staff noted that
while the pick up in inflation is likely to be significantly below that seen in 2008, several of
the key drivers of the 2008 spike are in place (Box 3) and others could emerge. The exchange
rate peg limits the policy tools available to SAMA to contain inflation, so that fiscal policy
will need to play a lead role in the policy response. More specifically key policy options
would include:


Slowing the pace of government spending, particularly on capital projects if supply
bottlenecks arise.



SAMA should continue to closely monitor the level of commercial bank funds held at
SAMA as well as the loan to deposit ratio. In the event of sharp movements, staff
agreed with the authorities’ view that either raising reserve requirements or lowering
loan to deposit ratios could be employed to absorb liquidity and prevent excessive
credit growth.

13
16.
The staff supports the maintenance of the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar.
The U.S. and Saudi business cycles are currently not well-aligned—the Saudi business cycle
remains driven by oil, which in turn is increasingly linked to the business cycle in emerging
Asia—contributing to inflationary pressures. However, the peg has provided a long-term
anchor for the economy in terms of facilitating the development of financial markets and
providing clarity for investors. The staff’s assessment of the level of the exchange rate
suggests that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals—this is also supported by
currency forward markets, which point to no evidence of misalignment of the exchange rate
(see Appendix I). There is, however, some evidence suggesting that a modest overvaluation
could develop over the medium term, consistent with fiscal spending being above estimates of
the sustainable level (and therefore the current account surplus below its norm).

Box 3. Will Inflation Return to 2008 Levels?
With the ongoing rebound in economic activity, a question that emerges is whether inflation will increase
again as it did in 2007–08 when the annual increase in consumer prices peaked at 11.1 percent in July
2008. Many of the drivers of inflation

Development Fund and to the Saudi Credit and Saving Bank that are unlikely to be fully utilized this year.
Overall, these figures suggest that inflation will remain well below the levels of 2008. This conclusion is
also supported by a more formal econometric analysis, which using a range of models suggests average
inflation during 2011 in the range of 5.8–6.6 percent.1
One potential concern, however, is the buildup of liquidity in the banking system and the risk that it will

The econometric analysis is based on a high-frequency Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) framework. Variables used in
the VAR included CPI index, deposits, bank claims on private sector, point of sales transactions, the nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER), international prices of food and beverages, international price index of crude oil, and current
and capital spending of the central government. Various specifications were used to provide a plausible range for the
end-of-year forecast of inflation. Goodness of fit tests as well as robustness checks were also employed to assess
model uncertainty.

15
B. Fiscal Policy
17.
The key fiscal policy challenge is to limit vulnerabilities to oil revenue volatility,
while ensuring the efficiency of spending. Expenditure levels are likely to remain high as
the public housing program and new initiatives in key social areas, such as health, education,
and the social safety net, are implemented. The substantial buffers built-up in recent years—
high international reserves and low debt—provide a significant cushion, but targeting fiscal
policy to preserve an overall fiscal surplus over the medium term would provide insurance
against a sustained reduction in oil revenues. There are policy options for both revenue and
expenditures:


Additional non-oil revenue sources should be developed in order to broaden the tax
base and reduce dependence on oil. The authorities noted that in light of GCC
integration efforts, tax reform should be approached in unison. In that regard, studies
for a GCC-wide VAT were continuing though the precise timing of its introduction
remained to be determined. Staff noted that the absence of a near-term revenue need
provided an opportunity to introduce the VAT at a low rate and in a revenue-neutral
manner as part of a package in which other taxes are eliminated.



The authorities noted that significant progress had been made in modernizing tax
administration, with nearly all revenue payments in the non-oil sector now filed
electronically. A web-based system with core and support functions for tax
administration has been implemented. The number and value of transactions through
the e-filing (SADAD) system have increased—an estimated SR 12 billion of payments
were received through 13.5 million operations in SADAD at the end of the second half
of 2010. The system also connects 41 government agencies, which enables prompt
exchange of data among them. A unique tax payer identification number has also been
introduced, which is portable across the GCC in anticipation of revenue-sharing
arrangements once a VAT is implemented.



On the expenditure side, further steps to enhance the efficiency of spending—
including through the more effective monitoring and control over spending once the
ongoing reforms to adopt GFSM 2001 are completed—could yield savings without
impinging on service provision.



Reducing subsidies—especially on petroleum products as well as on water and other
utilities that are not captured on the budget—would both provide more resources to the
budget (through improved outcomes for the relevant public enterprises) and remove
important distortions in resource allocation. Petroleum product prices for example are
among the lowest in the world—raising prices to the average of other Middle Eastern

16
oil exporters could generate about 3 percent of GDP a year in fiscal resources while
helping contain the growth in domestic consumption of energy that will, on current
trends, soon start to limit Saudi Arabia’s ability to export absent investment in new
drilling capacity. The authorities noted that initiatives were underway to enhance
energy efficiency.

The authorities noted that, even in the absence of a formal medium-term
expenditure framework, expenditures had been smoothed, consistent with the
government’s investment program. Existing budgetary processes—based on a budget
formulated at a conservative oil price with expenditure adjustments during the year as
revenues evolve—have

The balance sheets of the pension funds should be kept under review. The current
cash flow positions of the pension funds appear to be healthy. While dependency ratios are
expected to decline, reflecting the high proportion of young in the population, the various
public pension funds are witnessing an increase in the number of retirees and actuarial
positions could face pressures with the recent adjustment in minimum wages generating
increased payment obligations.
Growth and Employment Creation
20.
Generating employment for a young and fast-growing population is a key policy
challenge. Over the past decade, the number of Saudi nationals has grown at an annual rate of
2.5 percent—almost twice the average rate for emerging and developing economies and four
times that in advanced economies. With half the population below the age of 23, the number
of new Saudi entrants to the labor force is growing especially rapidly. Recorded
unemployment rates are highest among the youth (15–29 year olds), with unemployment rates
dropping sharply for those above age 30. Labor force participation rates—just 36 percent in
2009, in large part a reflection of a female participation rate of just 12 percent—are unusually
low and their evolution in the coming years will have important impacts on labor market
outcomes.

22.
Despite scoring well on investment climate surveys, employment growth in Saudi
Arabia has been driven by government spending. The size and resources of the public
sector have been critical for private sector development—indeed, the intended ratcheting up in
the provision of housing over the next several years will feed through into private sector
growth, but will likely have limited impact on employment of nationals as the construction
sector tends to be dominated by expatriate labor. It was agreed that two areas with potential
for a positive impact on growth and national employment would be:


Increased economic integration within the GCC and deeper trade relations with
emerging partners in the Middle East beyond the GCC, as well as Asia. While
aggregate trade data for both exports and imports point to limited growth in intra-GCC
trade, the authorities noted that intra-GCC trade in services, including tourism, was
growing rapidly. Both emerging Asia and certain countries in Middle East—including
Egypt, Jordan, and Syria—were becoming increasingly important trade partners and
further trade facilitation efforts could provide a stimulus to growth.



Access to finance has been an important constraint on private sector activity. Recent
initiatives to stimulate SME credit through a system of partial guarantees have eased
access issues for this segment of the market, but broader capital market reforms to
foster the development of corporate bond markets and Islamic products could also
enhance financial intermediation.

23.
Active labor market policies can also play a role in tackling unemployment, but
need to be designed to minimize the impact on competitiveness. Saudi Arabia has opened
its labor markets to a large number of expatriate workers, both skilled and unskilled. Various
Saudiization initiatives, intended to increase employment of Saudi nationals, have been in
operation since the mid-90s, but with limited overall impact. The authorities noted that the
new “traffic light” system of industry-specific quotas for Saudi employment introduced in
May was designed to provide incentives for compliance, rather than just penalties, and
therefore could reduce the burden on enforcement capacity. The authorities stressed that this
was just one component of a multi-pronged strategy and that accompanying initiatives to
assist in matching job seekers with employers, including through the scaling-up of placement
programs and training and education schemes, would also have a positive impact on labor
markets.
24.
Recent public sector employment initiatives and the introduction of an
unemployment benefit scheme will impact labor market outcomes. While raising public
sector salaries and expanding public sector employment opportunities can enhance short-term
social outcomes, they may also provide a disincentive for nationals to seek private sector
employment. Similarly, an unemployment benefit scheme needs to be designed carefully to
ensure that it does not create an additional disincentive to private sector employment. The
authorities noted that the unemployment benefit scheme was still under design but was
intended to be temporary and a transitional step to a more comprehensive social safety net.

20
C. Financial Sector—Managing Risks While Supporting Growth
25.
The banking system is well capitalized, highly liquid, and has proven to be
resilient to a wide range of shocks. Stress tests conducted by the FSAP update team
demonstrated that the high levels of liquidity and high levels of capital currently held by the
banking system constitute significant buffers to provide confidence that banks can withstand
most plausible shocks.3 Indeed, the banking system has withstood a number of challenges,
including a prolonged period of low oil prices, the after effects of the global financial crisis,
and a debt restructuring and sharp drop in real estate prices in neighboring U.A.E. The
principal risk—as expected for an oil-based economy—is a sustained drop in oil prices,
although loan concentration ratios and exposures to single borrowers are high by international
standards. The authorities noted that preparations were well underway for a move to Basel III
and that it is expected that banks would be able to comply with Basel III requirements without
disruption to existing business models.
26.
Supervision and regulation have been effective. The Basel Core Principles
assessment showed a high degree of compliance with international best practices, but
identified some areas—such as bank resolution (notably the absence of a special resolution
regime)—where the legal framework could be updated to better reflect existing practices. The
authorities stressed that the existing framework had proven to be fully effective and that
SAMA had been able to intervene when needed. In addition, the proactive nature of
supervision by SAMA had avoided bank insolvencies and protected depositors. It was agreed
that the adoption of Basel II had produced a substantial improvement in risk management
practices by banks. In terms of Islamic banking products, the authorities noted that risks in
this growing segment of the market were appropriately monitored within the context of the
existing regulatory and supervisory framework so that there was no need for a separate
regime.
27.
Capital markets are slowly emerging, but important gaps remain. Government
debt has been reduced to a very low level and there is no active secondary market nor a robust
government yield curve. Notwithstanding the government’s current absence of a need for
financing, staff noted that maintaining a stable stock of government securities with a range of
maturities would help to anchor a yield curve. The authorities noted that corporates had been
able to place bonds and that the absence of an active government debt market did not preclude
the emergence of a corporate bond market. In terms of the absence of a secondary market,
they noted that this reflected a tendency for banks to purchase securities and hold them to
maturity as a stable source of income—a reflection of a high level of liquidity usually present
in the market.

22
28.
Progress in housing finance is critical to improve access to housing. The five draft
laws in the mortgage package that are expected to be approved in 2011 would dramatically
improve the housing finance framework (see Box 5). It was agreed that as housing finance
expands, ensuring loan soundness through strong prudential measures, particularly through
lower permissible loan to-value and debt service ratios, will be important. Furthermore,
adequate supervision of the reconstructed REDF should be put in place, including by
contracting banks to manage its loan portfolio to improve the quality of loan origination and
recovery rates.
29.
The AML/CFT regime could be further strengthened. The initial FATF assessment
undertaken in 2004 noted that Saudi Arabia had a high degree of compliance with FATF
recommendations. A joint FATF/MENAFATF mutual evaluation report, drawing on new
FATF standards, was adopted by the Middle East & North Africa FATF in May 2010 and the
FATF in June 2010. The report noted progress made since the original assessment in the areas
of broadening the legal framework, improving institutional cooperation, and investing in
training and awareness. Looking forward, a number of areas were identified where further
progress could be made, including: the criminalization of terrorism financing; reinforcement
of international cooperation; and strengthening the implementation of the AML/CFT regime
in the insurance sector and in designated nonfinancial businesses and professions.

23
Box 5. Housing Market
Pressures on the availability of affordable housing have emerged due to demographic
factors and bottlenecks in the real estate market. Growing population, smaller average size
of households, and continued urbanization have sharply increased demand for housing in
recent years. As a result, the need for additional housing—primarily for low and middle
income households—is estimated in the Ninth Development Plan at 1.25 million units during
2010–14. At the same time, supply of affordable housing units is constrained by scarcity of
buildable land and limited access to finance for developers—reducing their ability to take on
large projects and shifting their focus to the high-end market. Given the uncertain legal
environment, banks have so far played a limited role in mortgage financing. The publically
owned Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) has stepped in to fill the gap by providing
interest free loans. However, the REDF, which currently accounts for 80 percent of outstanding
housing credit, has been unable to keep up with demand, resulting in a waiting period of about
18 years. Excess demand for housing and the shortage of available land have also contributed
to rising real estate prices, further reducing the affordability of housing.
The government has recently announced several measures to address both supply and
financing constraints. First, the Ministry of Housing (MOH) has replaced the General
Housing Authority in order to centralize housing efforts under one umbrella. The REDF, which
is now under the MOH, is being restructured and recapitalized with the intention to better
target low income households, leverage its lending program through a guarantee scheme with
the banking system, provide funding to real estate developers, and outsource the management
of its current portfolio to banks in order to improve the recovery rate—the current portfolio of
REDF amounts to SR 80 billion, half of which is classified as delinquent. Second, the central
government has allocated SR 250 billion to the MOH for the construction of 500,000 new
housing units over the next 5–10 years. Third, the long awaited mortgage law is expected to be
approved in 2011. A key component of the mortgage law package is the enforcement law,
which is anticipated to increase the ability of banks to realize underlying collateral in case of
default.
Additional measures can be taken to expedite the supply of housing and to monitor the
expansion of real estate finance. To address the affordability of housing, mitigate the rise in
land prices, and increase the supply of land for real estate development, the government should
implement measures to unlock the static supply of land. Following the final approval of the
mortgage law, long-term funding solutions for mortgage lending institutions should be
developed in the medium term.

D. Other Issues
30.
Further enhancing the quality of statistics is an important priority. As laid out in
the recent report to the G-20 Data Gaps Initiative, work is ongoing to strengthen data in the
fiscal area through the adoption of the GFSM2001, the financial sector through the refinement
of Financial Soundness Indicators, and in the balance of payments including in compiling an
International Investment Position and the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey. The
mission encourages the continuation of these initiatives and their dissemination once quality
is judged adequate.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Policy buffers built up in recent years, and prudent financial sector supervision,
enabled Saudi Arabia to rapidly emerge from the global financial crisis and contribute
to the global recovery. Increased fiscal spending in 2009 and 2010 supported non-oil growth
which has accelerated further in early 2011 as the global oil price has risen. The economic
outlook is positive due to higher oil prices and increased oil production as spare capacity is
used to meet shortfalls in oil supply elsewhere, boosting external and fiscal balances.
Relatively conservative banking practices and limited capital account openness served to limit
the spillovers from financial markets in the region or globally.
32.
Higher oil revenues provide an opportunity to accelerate initiatives to address
social issues, but this needs to be managed carefully to avoid overheating in the
economy. While inflation declined marginally in the first quarter of 2011, risks are on the
upside. Rent and food prices continue to be the main contributors to inflation, but the buildup
of liquidity in the banking system has the potential to increase inflationary pressures. Given
the fixed exchange rate, moderating government spending should be the key policy lever in
the event that inflationary pressures materialize, supported by available monetary policy
instruments.
33.
Recent spending initiatives have raised entitlements throughout the mediumterm and increased dependence on volatile oil revenues. While substantial buffers remain,
measures could be taken to strengthen underlying fiscal balances such as the implementation
of a GCC-wide VAT, and a reduction in subsidies on petroleum products. The latter measure
would also help contain the growth in domestic consumption of energy products which, if left
unchecked, could impinge on the ability to export with current capacity. Increased fiscal
spending also raises the importance of ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency of public
spending through strengthening screening and monitoring of public projects and developing a
multi-year expenditure framework. To this end the establishment of a macro-fiscal unit would
constitute an important initial step.
34.
While the economy has created jobs, reducing the unemployment rate of
nationals may require a fundamental overhaul of the labor market and repositioning of
the growth strategy. Reliance on the public sector to absorb domestic labor needs to be

25
scaled back and policies promoting job opportunities in the private sector enhanced. To
stimulate job creating growth in the private sector, efforts should focus on increased access to
finance, especially for SMEs, and deeper trade integration with Asia and the Middle East
beyond the GCC. Active labor market policies, such as skill matching initiatives, can help
reduce unemployment amongst nationals but must be designed in a market-friendly manner to
avoid further distortions and preserve competitiveness.
35.
Staff supports the fixed exchange rate regime. The exchange rate peg to the
U.S. dollar has facilitated international trade and investment and financial development. Staff
estimates suggest that while some indicators point to a slight overvaluation over the mediumterm, the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
36.
Supervision and regulation of the banking sector appear effective and the
banking system has demonstrated resilience to a wide range of shocks. Significant
improvements in banking regulation and supervision have been achieved in recent years, but
the legal framework could be updated to be better aligned with actual practice. High capital
and liquidity levels in the banking system provide an important buffer that has enabled banks
to survive large regional and global shocks. Efforts to further strengthen the AML/CFT
regime should continue.
37.
Deepening capital markets by maintaining a stable stock of government
securities—despite the absence of a financing need—would help improve liquidity
management in the banking sector and assist corporate to diversify their sources of
funding. The on-going repayment of government debt has reduced the volume of securities
available for banks to manage liquidity and hampered the development of a benchmark yield
curve. Broader capital market reforms to foster the development of domestic bond markets
could also enhance financial intermediation.
38.
Efforts to reduce pressures on housing resources should be supported by the
approval of the new mortgage law and a strong prudential framework to ensure loan
soundness. The government has introduced several initiatives to expedite the supply of
affordable housing and increased access to mortgage finance. Passing the new mortgage law
should help improve the housing financing framework significantly, while prudent loan-tovalue and debt service ratios should be put in place to preserve loan soundness as housing
finance expands. In addition, given the planned expansion of REDF’s activities, it is essential
to ensure that the institution is adequately supervised.
39.
Ongoing efforts to improve the quality and dissemination of statistics should
continue. In particular, completing the move to GFSM2001 and finalizing the compilation
and dissemination of the International Investment Position and Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey would reduce existing data gaps.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. SAUDI ARABIA: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
Preliminary estimates from CGER-type methodologies for exchange rate assessment indicate
that the Saudi Riyal is broadly in line with its macroeconomic fundamentals, with some
evidence of overvaluation over the medium-term.
1.
Despite terms of trade gains, the real exchange rate has appreciated by only
1 percent since the end of 2009. Following a period of moderate depreciation between 2002
and 2007, the trade-weighted real

2.
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests the riyal is within close
proximity to its estimated norm during 2010 and over the medium term, with some
evidence of overvaluation. The macroeconomic balance approach estimates three main
specifications of the equilibrium current account (norm) from a set of fundamentals (non-oil
and gas fiscal balance, oil and gas reserves, old-age dependency ratio, population growth
rate, initial net foreign assets (NFA) net of external debt, oil trade balance, growth rate of real
per capita GDP, relative income, and lagged dependent current account) employing a
generalized method of moments (GMM) technique.2 As shown (in the table below), the
estimation yields an average current account norm for Saudi Arabia of a surplus of about
13.2 percent of GDP in 2015. The projected current account position in 2015 is a surplus of
9.5 percent of GDP, which lies within two standard error of the prediction, suggesting no
statistically significant evidence of exchange rate misalignment.

The external sustainability approach suggests mixed results over the mediumterm. This underpinning of this approach is that the sustainability of the current account
trajectory requires that the net present value (NPV) of all future oil and financial/investment
income (wealth) be equal to the NPV of imports of goods and services net of non-oil exports.
Subject to this constraint, the government would choose a path for imports, and hence a
current account norm, that would support intergenerational equity—and some precautionary
savings in view of volatile oil prices—through an appropriate pace of accumulation of net

“(annuities or allocation rules)” are calculated under two different policy scenarios:
(a) constant real per capita annuity; and (b) constant real annuity. Both types of annuities are
used in the literature,4 and can be derived from the optimization of plausible government
utility functions. One rule suggests a moderate overvaluation of the currency over the
medium term (2015), while the other suggests a modest undervalaution: rule (a) has an
implied current account surplus of 15 percent of GDP, while the less generous rule (b) has an
implied current account norm of 8 percent of GDP. These results are very sensitive to the
assumed parameters.

Assuming for illustrative purposes 267 billion barrels of reserves, a 77 percent recovery rate, oil production
would peak at 11.8 million barrels in 2029 before declining gradually (2.0 percent). Domestic consumption and
production costs include imports to develop and maintain production valued at 8 percent of the value of oil
production (WEO prices). Oil prices and the GDP deflator increase by 2 percent after 2015, and real non-oil
GDP grows by 5 percent while total real growth is assumed to be 3 percent. Future oil revenues are nominally
discounted at 6 percent, the assumed rate of return on externally held financial wealth/NFA, while population
growth is 1 percent.

The Fund as Trustee of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) entered into a
borrowing agreement with Saudi Arabia on May 13, 2011, by which Saudi Arabia will
provide new loan resources of up to SDR 500 million. Saudi Arabia has also consented to the
amendments of the NAB Decision and the increases of credit arrangements of participants as
approved by the Executive Board on April 12, 2010 (Executive Board Decision No. 14577(10/35), increasing its own credit arrangement in the expanded NAB to SDR 11.13 billion,
from the current SDR 1.76 billion. The current outstanding amount as of May 31, 2011 is
SDR 384.10 million. The Fund also has a borrowing agreement with Saudi Arabia in
association with the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), for an amount equivalent to
SDR 1.5 billion, which was renewed for another five-year period from December 26, 2008.
In March 2001, Saudi Arabia agreed to support the PRGF-HIPC Trust with investments
totaling SDR 94.4 million, which as of end-May 2006, were received as scheduled.
Since 1989, Saudi Arabia disbursed SDR 49.5 million in PRGF loans under the Associated
Agreement with the PRGF Trust. This loan had been fully drawn and repaid as of end-May
2006. Saudi Arabia has committed about SDR 2.6 million in grant associated with the IMF’s
Subsidization of Emergency Assistance for Natural Disasters. In April 2006, Saudi Arabia
agreed to contribute SDR 40 million in end-2005 NPV terms in subsidy resources to support
the Exogenous Shocks Facility.
VII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Saudi Arabian riyal was

37
formally pegged to the U.S. dollar, effective January 2003. Prior to that, it was officially
pegged to the SDR at the rate of SRls 4.28255=SDR 1, with margins of 7.25 percent even
though in practice it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1986, with a middle rate of
SRls 3.7450=$1. Saudi Arabia maintains security-related exchange restrictions pursuant to
UN Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373. These security-related restrictions should be
notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No.144-(52/51).

ANNEX II. SAUDI ARABIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The World Bank’s Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) has been providing policy advice,
capacity building, and implementation support to development efforts in Saudi Arabia on a
reimbursable basis since 1975. In 2006, Saudi authorities agreed to move the program from
an annual to a three year planning horizon in order to promote a programmatic engagement
in certain areas.


The TCP aims to assist Saudi Arabia in addressing its development challenges of
generating productive jobs for a fast growing population; improving the performance
of its health system to meet evolving needs; strengthening social safety net
mechanisms; enhancing the provision of public services including water, electricity,
transport, health and education; and strengthening capacity in national and municipal
organizations.



Among priority activities in the FY12–14 program are: work on unemployment
assistance and unemployment insurance; continued training for potential SME
entrepreneurs in business plan formulation, accounting and marketing; analytical
work on the costs and benefits of developing renewable energy; using information
technology to improve the administration of health insurance; updating the water
sector strategy and building a national consensus around it; developing links with
civil society to complement public sector social safety net efforts; and updating a
national ports strategy.



Since 2007, the IFC Office has been co-located with the World Bank Office in
Riyadh. IFC activities in the country, as well as with Saudi investors outside the
country, have increased significantly. They are in line with the following three
objectives:

Promote Selective Business in Saudi Arabia:
IFC’s strategy for investments in Saudi Arabia is to invest in selective transactions that can
add value in terms of institution building, development of new financial instruments and
SME development. Specific investments in the financial sector include housing finance,
insurance, leasing, microfinance and a student loan program (current portfolio is
approximately $140 million). IFC also provides Advisory Services in mortgage finance,
SME finance, corporate governance, risk management and PPP transactions.

39
Promote South-South Investments From Saudi Arabia:
Many Saudi investors are looking to expand outside of their home-base. This is an
opportunity for IFC to work with such companies and invest with them inside and outside the
MENA region. IFC Riyadh office increased its activity, especially in facilitating south-south
investments that reached around $900 million in IDA and middle income countries (Pakistan,
Egypt, Yemen, Ethiopia, Ghana, etc.). IFC continues to work closely with Saudi sponsors to
further facilitate cross border investment in the region.
Mobilize Funds From Saudi Public Sector:
IFC is working closely with the Saudi Public Institutions to undertake global initiatives that
benefit private sector activities in developing countries. So far, these efforts have resulted in
obtaining commitments of over US$ 500 million. The current commitments include
US$ 300 million from Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) for Global Trade Liquidity
Program (GTLP), US$100 million from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) for IFC Africa,
Latin America & Caribbean Fund and US$ 100 million from OPEC Fund for International
Development (OFID) for GTLP, Microfinance Fund and Africa Capitalization Fund. In
addition, the IsDB contributed US$5 million to IFC’s Advisory Services program, and has
recently agreed to a new contribution of $2 million. IsDB has also contributed $1 million for
IFC’s Education for Employment (E4E) initiative.

ANNEX III. SAUDI ARABIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 31, 2011)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Most affected areas are: national accounts, government finance statistics, and balance of
payments.
National Accounts: Annual estimates of GDP are calculated from the production side at
current and constant prices (with 1999 as a base year). However, GDP using the expenditure
approach is compiled in current prices only.
Government finance statistics: The authorities are reclassifying the budget in line with
GFSM 2001. Most chapters have been completed and the Ministry of Finance is planning on
using the GFSM 2001 framework to report fiscal data.
Balance of Payments: Although a comprehensive measure of the International Investment
Position (IIP) is not available, the authorities publish monthly the foreign assets and
liabilities of the central bank and pension funds. The central government does not have a
sovereign wealth fund nor external debt. This permits staff to derive a broad estimate of the
public sector IIP. The coverage in the capital and financial accounts, particularly for the
private sector, needs to be improved.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Saudi Arabia
On July 18, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Saudi Arabia.1
Background
Over the last few decades, Saudi Arabia has achieved substantial gains in social
development indicators which are now close to G-20 averages. Important challenges
still remain, particularly the high level of youth unemployment for nationals and pressures
in the housing market. With oil prices having rebounded following the global financial
crisis, strong fiscal and external balances, coupled with high international reserves and
very low debt, Saudi Arabia has the fiscal space to address these social priorities.
Growth recovered strongly in 2010 to an estimated 4.1 percent, following the 0.1 percent
recorded in 2009. The acceleration in growth stemmed from both the oil and non-oil
sectors, supported by higher public spending as well as a recovery in global demand.
Profitability of corporates listed on the stock exchange improved significantly in 2010,
with net profits some 56 percent higher than in 2009.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The fiscal accounts moved back into surplus in 2010 as increased oil revenues more
than offset higher spending. Royal Decrees issued in February and March 2011
introduced new initiatives to tackle housing needs, to expand employment opportunities,
and to broaden the social safety net.
Broad money growth slowed in 2010, but together with private sector credit has now
begun to pick up. Monetary policy rates were left unchanged during 2010 in order to
support private sector activity, and in line with domestic monetary indicators and
monetary conditions in the U.S. and the exchange rate peg. Banks remain highly liquid
and continue to hold capital well in excess of statutory limits.
Looking ahead, oil revenues are likely to be significantly higher than in 2010, reflecting
both higher oil prices and increased oil volumes as Saudi Arabia expands production to
make up for supply shortfalls from other countries. Fiscal and external balances are
expected to strengthen further in the near-term. Available leading indicators point to an
acceleration in private sector activity in early 2011, with overall real GDP growth now
expected at 6.5 percent. Inflation has been subdued but the combination of continued
pressure from imported food prices, rents, increased government spending and high
domestic liquidity is likely to result in inflation rising to an average of about 6 percent for
the year as a whole.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that policy and financial buffers, combined with prudent
financial sector regulation and supervision, had allowed Saudi Arabia to weather the
global slowdown well. The near-term outlook for the economy is favorable. Over the
medium term, policy priorities should focus on maintaining fiscal sustainability, securing
broad-based growth and fostering job creation. Directors commended the authorities for
their continued stabilizing role in the oil markets. They noted the significant positive
spillover effects of Saudi policies on the regional and global economies, including the
provision of generous official development assistance.
Directors supported the authorities’ actions to use the higher oil revenues to accelerate
initiatives to address important social issues, notably in housing, unemployment, and
extending the social safety net. At the same time, they highlighted the need to carefully
monitor possible inflationary pressures and encouraged the proactive use of fiscal policy,
supported by available monetary policy instruments, if needed.
Directors noted that the recent initiatives have increased spending entitlements over the
medium term and raised vulnerabilities to a sustained decline in the oil price. They
considered that spending programs that would complement private sector activity would
enhance the economic impact of higher spending. The establishment of a formal
medium-term expenditure framework, supported by a macro-fiscal unit, would help
strengthen the implementation of fiscal policy over time. Directors welcomed ongoing

3
initiatives to strengthen revenues, including modernizing tax administration, and looked
forward to further progress towards a GCC-wide VAT. They also highlighted the
importance of gradually reforming domestic energy pricing.
Directors noted that the supervision and regulation of the financial system by the central
bank has been effective, as evidenced by the banking system’s resilience to recent
shocks and confirmed by the conclusions of the recent FSAP update. Directors
commended the authorities for the improvements in the areas of banking regulation and
supervision in recent years. They encouraged the central bank to continue to strengthen
the regulatory and supervisory framework, including by aligning the legal framework with
actual practice. Directors also commended the authorities for their strong efforts in
combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and encouraged further
enhancement of the AML/CFT framework.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar has provided a credible
nominal anchor, while facilitating investment and financial sector development.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ multi-pronged strategy for stimulating job creation in
the private sector, which would allow to scale back reliance on the public sector to
absorb domestic labor. They noted the importance of efforts to increase access to
finance and to deepen trade relationships with emerging trading partners. Directors
emphasized that labor market policies should be designed in a market-friendly manner to
avoid distortions and preserve competitiveness.
Directors acknowledged the steps to enhance access to housing finance, as part of a
broader effort to address pressures on the availability of affordable housing. They looked
forward to the final approval of the new mortgage law while stressing the importance of
maintaining a strong prudential framework to ensure loan soundness and contain risk in
the financial system.
Directors noted the ongoing efforts to improve the quality and dissemination of statistics
and encouraged continued progress to address remaining data gaps.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
