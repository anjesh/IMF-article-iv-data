STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 29, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Slovenia is recovering from a profound recession, which culminated in a
banking crisis in 2013. Following the recapitalization by the state of the major banks,
growth has returned, supported by strong exports and EU funded public investment.
Nevertheless, output is below pre-crisis levels, and unemployment remains high. Large
deleveraging needs of the private and public sectors weigh on medium-term growth.
Challenges: The balance sheets of banks, corporations, and the state remain vulnerable
and are deeply interlinked. Without continued reforms to address these, more losses
could materialize, risking renewed financial stress.
Policy priorities: Slovenia needs to reignite the reform momentum to reduce
vulnerabilities and boost potential growth. Priorities include the following:


Address the still high non-performing loans, including through more transfers to
the bank asset management company (BAMC), strengthen bank governance, and
fully privatize all state-owned banks;



Restructure the corporate sector by making full use of existing tools, such as the
BAMC, whose independence should be safeguarded, and the new debtrestructuring legal framework; further reduce the role of the state in the economy;



Consolidate the public finances through structural measures and reforms, including
of the pension system, to put public debt on a sustained downward path; and



Implement structural reforms to support corporate restructuring and youth
employment and facilitate domestic and foreign investment.

CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Slovenia is slowly emerging from a deep crisis....
1.
Slovenia experienced a deep crisis, which culminated in a bank bailout in late 2013.

economy experienced a modest recovery in 2010–11,

8 percent below its pre-crisis peak—among the largest
crisis-related losses in the region—and unemployment is still high, at 9½ percent (with youth
unemployment at 16½ percent). Inflation fell sharply in 2014, driven by food and energy prices,
averaging 0.2 percent.
3.
The current account remains in surplus (Figure 4). The positive balance reached
5.6 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 2014, slightly below its level over the same period
in 2013. This reflects export growth of 6 percent over this period, on the back of improving cost
competitiveness. Imports continued to increase, but at a slower pace than exports, leading to a
widening of the trade surplus to 8.4 percent of GDP. The income balance, however, registered a
deficit, due to higher interest payments on external public debt. In the financial account, large inflows
associated with external government-bond issuances were more than offset by repayments of

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

external liabilities by the banking sector. The net international position was negative 38 percent of
GDP at end-June 2014, with external liabilities largely dominated by government and corporate debt.
4.
The cumulative general-government cash deficit reached 5.3 percent of GDP at endSeptember (Figure 5). Net of bank-related costs and extra-budgetary funds, the deficit was
3.7 percent of GDP, significantly lower than a year ago (4.9 percent), but still above the 2014 budget
target (2.9 percent). The underperformance was due to both higher-than-planned spending on
subsidies to some public enterprises and increased absorption of EU funds supporting public
investment and to lower tax revenues—mainly as a result of the rejection by the Constitutional Court
of the new real-estate tax—which were only partially compensated by one-off non–tax revenues (cellphone license sales, exceptional SOE dividends, and central bank profit transfers) and tighter
spending on goods and services. Relative to 2013, revenues were 6 percent higher, but spending (net
of bank costs) was also 4.6 percent higher. Taking advantage of falling yields (Figure 6), the
government pre-financed part of 2015 fiscal needs. Public debt was 78.3 percent of GPD at end-June.
5.
The situation in the banking sector has improved over the last year (Figure 7). Its core
tier 1 (CT1) capital ratio stands at 15.3 percent after the recapitalization of four banks in 2013—two of
which are being wound down—a fifth partly in 2013 and partly in 2014, and a sixth in 2014 (at a total
cost of about 10 percent of GDP for the state). The ECB’s recent comprehensive assessment (CA)
identified only small additional capital needs for the two largest banks (€65.3 million), which will be
covered by profits realized in 2014. After falling by about 6 percent in 2013, deposits increased by
10.8 percent in the first eleven months of 2014 (excluding intra-bank deposits), of which 4.2 and
11.4 percent for household and corporate deposits, respectively. Banks used liquidity, including from
recapitalization and sales of assets to the BAMC, to repay debt on the wholesale markets and LTRO
liabilities to the ECB and were able to maintain comfortable liquidity buffers through 2014.
6.
Nevertheless, non-performing loans (NPLs) remain high, hampering credit. Systemwide NPLs stood at 13.2 percent of total loans at end-October (and reportedly at 17.5 percent if
restructured loans are included), even after gross transfers to the BAMC (of about €5 billion).
Corporate NPLs reached close to 20 percent, while household NPLs remained low, at 5.5 percent.
Provisioning of NPLs stands at about 60 percent. Credit growth declined by close to 7 percent during
December 2013-November 2014 (net of transfers to the BAMC). Corporate loans fell by around
10 percent, reflecting the sector’s focus on reducing existing debt, the ability of creditworthy firms to
borrow from abroad, but also banks’ reluctance to lend, given still tight credit standards. Household
loans fell by 1½ percent, although housing loans have recorded small positive growth.
7.
A new government took office in September. The last three years have been marred by
high political instability, with two early elections called and four governments sworn in. The previous
government fell in April 2014 due to internal turmoil, but early elections took place only in
September, contributing to delays in policy implementation. The current center-left governing
coalition, comprised of the recently established party of Prime Minister Miro Cerar, the Social
Democrats, and the Pensioners’ Party, has broadly endorsed the previous government’s reform
agenda. It holds a narrow majority in Parliament, and its public support has been eroding recently.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
... and the growth outlook remains subdued and vulnerable to risks.
8.
The recovery is projected to be gradual. It faces headwinds from necessary fiscal
consolidation and the corporate sector’s need to restructure and reduce its debt. Growth is thus
expected to moderate to just under 2 percent in 2015 after reaching an estimated 2½ percent
in 2014. Lower oil and commodity prices and a weaker euro this year are expected to support exports
and private consumption, while public investment should continue to expand. Private investment is
projected to stay subdued, as financing conditions will take time to normalize. Inflation is projected to
decline to slightly below zero in 2015, given lower expected energy and commodity prices.
Unemployment is set to fall gradually over the medium term.

9.
Potential growth remains weak. Staff estimates the output gap to have declined to
2.3 percent for 2014 and expects it to close by 2017. These estimates, however, are subject to high
uncertainty, especially given the structural break experienced during the crisis. Potential growth is
estimated to reach about 1¾ over the medium term, significantly lower than the pre-crisis average of
3¾ percent. This reflects low capital accumulation, as deleveraging continues and some of the stock
was rendered obsolete by the crisis, high structural unemployment eroding human capital, and
continued weak TFP trends. By 2020, investment as a share of GDP is projected to remain some
8 percent below its pre-crisis peak, and living standards would only just have returned to pre-crisis
levels.
10.
The general government deficit (in cash terms, and excluding extra-budgetary entities)
is estimated at 6 percent of GDP in 2014. On
the basis of end-October 2014 fiscal data, the
deficit net of bank-support costs (two bank
recapitalizations and repayment of ELA for the
banks being wound down) is estimated at
3.7 percent of GDP in 2014. The authorities only
implemented about a fifth of the original
measures envisaged, relied on one-off measures,
and increased public investment spending
substantially. As a result, the structural primary
balance is estimated to have deteriorated by ½ percent of GDP in 2014.

11.
Public debt sustainability remains highly vulnerable to shocks (Annex I). On the basis
of current policies, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to continue to gradually increase to just

concerns. Moreover, public debt dynamics are highly vulnerable 140 (percent of GDP)
to shocks. In particular, the materialization of half of outstanding

recent crisis) would result in an explosive debt path, highlighting
the importance of resolute policies to address remaining bank and corporate vulnerabilities.
12.
Slovenia’s external position is assessed as sustainable. With the current account
expected to stay in surplus over the medium term, external debt is projected to decline to just under
95 percent of GDP by 2020, as private sector deleveraging more than offsets the increase in public
sector debt. As a result, the international investment position is expected to reach balance from a
deficit of about 38 percent of GDP in 2014. Still, external debt dynamics remain vulnerable to shocks,
such as a sharp slowdown in growth or a deterioration in the current account (Annex II). Staff’s
assessment does not point to competitiveness problems, suggesting that the current account and the
real exchange rate are broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies
(Annex III).
13.
Risks remain tilted to the downside (Annex IV). While immediate domestic risks have
been mitigated by the recent bank recapitalization and the government’s pre-financing of 2015
external-amortization needs, this could reduce the perceived urgency of reforms, increasing risks of a
re-emergence of financial stress in the medium term. Moreover, failure to credibly consolidate the
public finances could lead to higher borrowing costs—which could also be affected by renewed stress
elsewhere in the euro-area—jeopardizing debt sustainability. The real debt burdens of both the
public and private sectors could be exacerbated if deflation persists. The ECB’s recent quantitative
easing measures are welcome, although they are expected to have only a limited effect on credit
growth, given weak demand; while exports could benefit from a weak euro and financing conditions
for the government could ease, this may also diminish incentives for reform. On the external front, a
more pronounced slowdown in the euro-area or an intensification of geopolitical tensions around
Ukraine, could weigh on exports.
14.
The authorities shared staff’s views on the outlook, but saw lower risks. The official
growth forecast has been revised upward for 2014–16 on account of the stronger-than-anticipated
momentum. In its December forecast update, the Institute for Macroeconomic Analysis and
Development (IMAD) foresees growth at 2 percent in 2015 and 1.7 in 2016. The authorities estimated
a somewhat lower fiscal deficit outturn for 2014 and the medium term, which was seen to enable
stabilization of the debt level at a lower level than that projected by staff. They shared staff’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

assessment of external stability. While they agreed that external risks to the outlook remain elevated,
they considered that domestic risks are on the upside as a result of reform implementation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policies need to focus on reducing vulnerabilities and boosting potential growth.
15.
The authorities took steps to address the crisis in 2013, but policy implementation
slowed in 2014. The bank recapitalization (largely undertaken in 2013) and transfer of some NPLs to
the BAMC during 2014 reduced uncertainty in the financial sector, but NPLs are still high. The reform
of the insolvency regime in 2013 put in place conditions to facilitate corporate-debt restructuring;
however, restructurings have just begun, and the sustainability of some restructured loans appears
questionable. The authorities took measures to consolidate the public finances during 2013–14,
including through steps to reform the pension system, but the quality of fiscal adjustment weakened
considerably in 2014. Finally, although the authorities have announced plans for a substantial
privatization effort, only three small privatizations have been completed to date. The slow pace of
reform implementation reflects, partly, the high political uncertainty during 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

16.
Reigniting the reform momentum is essential to mitigate still high risks and support
sustainable growth. Despite the policy actions taken so far, the balance sheets of banks,
corporations, and the state remain vulnerable and deeply interlinked. Without continued reforms to
restructure the banks and the corporate sector, strengthen their governance, and significantly reduce
the role of the state in the economy, more losses could materialize, risking renewed financial stress.
These reforms and associated confidence effects could also help facilitate the transmission of
monetary policy and alleviate deflation risks. In addition, maintaining fiscal sustainability requires a
credible fiscal consolidation strategy underpinned by structural reforms, including of the pension
system. Finally, further structural reforms of labor markets and the business environment are needed
to support corporate-sector restructuring, and diversify the sources of growth to strengthen the
economy’s resilience against external shocks.

A. Financial Sector
Better asset quality and governance are keys to strengthening the health of the banking
sector
17.
Banks’ weak asset quality and governance impede their ability to support the
economy. The high level of NPLs—three to four times as high as pre-crisis levels system-wise, and
even more at state-owned banks—is a drag on banks’ cash flow and profitability, limiting their
capacity to generate credit. Indeed, close to half of new lending reportedly financed NPL
restructurings, most of which represented an extension of maturities of large and connected clients,
with a third of restructured loans already under renegotiation (Box 1). In addition, as the state now
owns more than 60 percent of the banking sector, the risk of political interference in lending
decisions remains substantial. Although the authorities have committed to privatize the state-owned
banks, the process could be prolonged, given strong vested interests. Moreover, another bank is still
in need of capital, while the merger of two banks and resolution another two are yet to be finalized.

Banks need to address their NPLs decisively. A two-pronged strategy can help maximize

effectiveness:


For large corporate NPLs—which are highly concentrated, with 50 corporates accounting for a
third of total NPLs1—transferring all large exposures to the BAMC would help offload NPLs from
banks’ balance sheets. In line with current restructuring plans, only about half of corporate NPLs
were transferred to the BAMC, suggesting further room to do so. While more transfers will likely
result in a higher public debt in the short run, BAMC’s centralization of the workout process and
its longer time horizon can help maximize returns for the taxpayer and lead to a reduction in debt
in the long run, while allowing banks to focus on new lending to the economy rather than on
caretaking of existing exposures. Using the recent bank asset-quality reviews as a valuation basis
for the transfers can help ensure banks’ capital neutrality, although approvals from the European
Commission would still be required and may take time. If large corporate NPLs are maintained on
banks’ books, all available legal tools should be used to achieve efficient and sustainable loan
restructuring agreements with viable companies, including through debt-to-equity swaps. The
Central Bank of Slovenia (BoS) should closely monitor banks’ operational capacity and progress
toward reducing corporate NPLs against set targets, including through a framework assessing the
sustainability of restructurings.



SME NPLs—which represent about 40 percent of corporate NPLs—need to be dealt with through
the banks’ internal restructuring units, given the large number of clients involved. However, only a
few SME restructurings have reportedly taken place to date. With SMEs playing a key role in the
economy (representing 63 percent of value added and 73 percent of employment in the business
sector),2 addressing the indebtedness of a critical mass of SMEs can help lay the foundation of a
more robust and sustained recovery.3 To do so, the BoS will need to enhance its supervisory tools,
such as by developing a framework for voluntary negotiations including simplified debtrestructuring options (differentiated based on a few criteria, such as size, indebtedness and ability
to generate cash-flow), which could be used by banks readily, while remaining within provisioning
margins. Care needs to be taken to minimize incentives for strategic default and to ensure that
both creditors and debtors have adequate incentives to negotiate and to take advantage of
potentially mutually beneficial outcomes, including by strengthening the implementation of the
insolvency regime (see below). BoS should set ambitious SME restructuring targets and monitor
progress against them.

19.
Bank governance should be strengthened, and the state’s role in credit intermediation
curtailed. Lax governance and pervasive connected lending were at the root of the recent banking
crisis and resulted in large fiscal costs. To avoid further taxpayer costs, state-owned banks should be

Evidence suggests that countries with a higher prevalence of SMEs tended to recover more slowly from the global
crisis (see IMF WP/14/98).

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

insulated from political pressures and/or interference. All state-owned banks should thus be
privatized as soon as possible. In particular, the authorities need to make good on their commitment
to privatize the second largest bank (NKBM) in 2015, and sell in full (rather than only in part) the
largest bank (NLB); given that a partial privatization of the latter had already been tried in the past
and proved inadequate to ensure either proper governance or capitalization, this should be avoided.
The authorities need to add the other state-owned banks (after completing planned mergers) to the
privatization list. In the meantime, a governance relationship framework between the banks and the
relevant state agency (as the shareholder) should be put in place ensuring these banks’ independent
management, including appropriate operational performance targets and transparent and strong
accountability.4 Even after privatization, maintaining adequate bank governance is essential to
safeguarding financial stability.
20.
The bank recapitalization and restructuring process needs to be finalized. The
authorities have granted a new extension (to mid-2015) to one of the banks identified as
undercapitalized in late 2013, following remedial measures taken in the interim to minimize the
identified shortfall. To safeguard financial stability, they will need to closely monitor the bank’s efforts
to raise capital and stand ready to address any remaining shortfalls in a transparent manner, while
minimizing fiscal costs. Moreover, the wind-down procedures for the two banks intervened in
September 2013 need to be completed as soon as possible. Mergers of smaller nationalized banks
can help attract strategic investors, but care should be taken to prevent concentration and enhance
competition. Finally, banks should be encouraged to focus on core lending activities, including by
continuing to divest non-core operations and selling corporate-equity stakes in due course.
21.
The authorities need to continue to improve the monitoring and management of
macro-financial risks. With the Single-Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) now in effect, supervision is
expected to be strengthened as standards are brought in line with international best practice. In
particular, resolution mechanisms need to be aligned with the new pan-European framework and the
BoS’s operational capacity strengthened to enable it to intervene and resolve banks promptly. In
addition, the authorities should speed up implementation of a centralized-credit registry, especially
given the widespread practice of firms to borrow from multiple banks. The BoS should also develop a
comprehensive system to monitor connected lending, which has been pervasive in the past. Finally,
the authorities should review the various administrative and macro-prudential tools introduced
during the crisis,5 whose usefulness appears limited. In particular, there seems to be scope to
eliminate the deposit-rate cap and to simplify the complex loan-to-deposit growth instrument, as well
as to consider introducing a cap on loan-to-value ratios on all assets, including those purchased
through leveraged buy-outs, to prevent overleveraging in the future.
22.
The authorities agreed that addressing NPLs and strengthening governance are key
priorities. They saw that results from restructuring efforts are starting to materialize and expected

NPLs to gradually decline as a result. They concurred with the need to monitor progress in this
regard, and noted that proposed innovations in the supervisory toolkit may need to be discussed and
agreed with the SSM. The authorities considered that additional transfers to BAMC are not needed, as
BAMC was seen to hold a critical mass of exposures, and any other transfers could add to the shortrun debt level and take substantial time due to the need to secure approvals from the European
Commission. While they agreed that bank governance should be strengthened and reiterated their
commitment to sell NKBM bank in 2015, they intend to maintain a blocking minority stake in NLB.
The authorities aimed to complete remaining bank recapitalization and restructuring processes this
year. They expressed a slight preference for maintaining existing administrative and macro-prudential
tools.

B. Corporate Sector
Corporate restructuring and improved governance are needed to boost investment and
growth
23.
High corporate sector indebtedness and weak governance weigh on growth. Although
the corporate debt-to-equity ratio has fallen in recent years, it remains higher than its pre-crisis
average and the level of peers. Deleveraging will continue to hamper investment and employment,
unless corporate restructuring effectively lowers debt and/or equity increases.6 But restructurings
have been limited so far, and the sustainability of some bank-led multilateral restructuring
agreements is questionable, reflecting strong vested interests and bottlenecks in the implementation
of the new insolvency legal framework (Box 1). Moreover, prospects for increasing firm equity are
dim, given a shallow equity market, limited domestic liquidity, and Slovenia’s poor record in attracting
FDI. Weak corporate governance compounds the sector’s problems, with prevalent direct and indirect
state control and complex corporate structures distorting decision-making and hampering efficiency.

Box 1. Corporate Debt Restructuring
Corporate restructuring has begun, but is
proceeding only slowly. Following the 2013
reform of the insolvency framework, creditors and
debtors have more options to address corporate
indebtedness. As a result, during 2013–14, about
30 compulsory settlements were completed per
year. Simplified compulsory settlements also
increased from 10 in 2013 to 90 in 2014. And
in 2014, some 8 pre-insolvency restructuring
proceedings were concluded for the first time in
Slovenia. By comparison, corporate bankruptcy
procedures remain widespread, amounting to close
to 1000 per year in 2013–14, double their level
in 2012.

For large corporates, restructurings are occurring through two main channels:

BAMC: As of end-September 2014, it received 616 corporate NPLs, with a gross value of
€3.5 billion, for which BAMC paid €1.5 billion in bonds (reflected in public debt). Of these, a sixth was
assessed as potentially viable and is being restructured, while the rest is in recovery proceedings. Of the
restructuring cases, fifteen cases (about €1 billion gross value) are reportedly completed or at an
advanced stage. A third of these are being dealt with through compulsory settlement and a few through
preventive restructuring. In other cases, orderly bankruptcy proceedings were required to separate viable
from non-viable operations, with the viable part successfully leased to investors. The BAMC has also
been working with the banks on voluntary MRAs (see below). It recovered €94 million from sales of nonviable NPLs received so far, most of which had already been in bankruptcy proceedings.

Bank-led Multilateral Restructuring Agreements (MRAs): These are based on agreed
restructuring guidelines on the basis of key principles, including: (i) keeping the restructuring voluntary;
(ii) applying to debtors with more than one financial creditor; (iii) assigning a lead bank to coordinate all
creditors; and (iv) a commitment by creditors to allow for a standstill pending the restructuring
negotiations. So far, 36 MRAs have been initiated, of which 30 were concluded. The 36 MRAs represent
gross exposures of €2 billion, or about a fifth of excessive leverage in the economy.1 Of the total cases,
6 involve compulsory settlements and 4 are preventive restructurings under the new legal framework.
Negotiations are often complex, involving multiple creditors (9 banks, on average, although in some
cases, 15 or more banks were involved). The BAMC has been involved in 16 of the MRAs, of which 4 have
included debt-to-equity swaps (representing 10 percent of all MRAs).
The sustainability of some corporate restructurings under MRAs is questionable. The vast majority
(90 percent) of bank-led restructurings under MRAs involve a re-profiling of debt, rather than
representing a reduction of corporates’ debt burden relative to their capacity to generate income. In fact,
in a third of the signed agreements, additional financing or guarantees were provided by the banks. And
a third of concluded agreements are being renegotiated.

24.
The BAMC should play a leading role in corporate restructuring. International evidence
suggests that asset-management companies (AMCs) can effectively centralize and coordinate the
workout of distressed debt, as they can achieve economies of scale, unify workout practices, break
corporate-bank links, and concentrate the ownership of collateral, thus enhancing leverage over
debtors. Successful cases highlight the vital role of a strong legal framework, independence from
political interference, and professional and highly skilled management and staff.7 Maintaining these
conditions in place, in particular safeguarding BAMC’s independence from political interference, is
essential to achieve sustainable debt-restructuring solutions and maximize taxpayer returns. Indeed,
BAMC has started to show results (Box 1) and its efforts will need to accelerate.
25.
The operational effectiveness of the insolvency framework should be increased. The
recent reform of the framework has brought it closer in line with international best practice. Although
some legal weaknesses remain, given frequent changes to the law in recent years, further
modifications would be unwelcome at this point, as maintaining a stable and predictable framework
is key to fostering debt-restructuring agreements The authorities should focus on strengthening the
implementation of existing tools, which are hampered by capacity constraints and other operational
bottlenecks (see Selected Issues Paper “Legal and Institutional Challenges in Corporate Insolvency”).
The capacity of the judiciary and the professionalism of bankruptcy administrators should be
enhanced, including through adequate appointment and remuneration systems and proper
supervision and accountability. The corporate-insolvency framework should also be supported by a
more efficient mortgage-enforcement regime, which would facilitate credit and help underpin debtrestructuring efforts. Finally, the authorities could consider tax measures to incentivize debt
restructuring and, over the medium term, could consider simplifying and further strengthening the
legal framework.
26.
Corporate governance needs to be strengthened. To facilitate corporate restructuring
and attract much needed equity, corporate governance standards should be brought in line with best
practice by enhancing the accountability of directors, the protection of investor rights, and auditing
and reporting standards and practices. The authorities should also ensure that the recentlyestablished Slovenia Sovereign Holding Company (SSH) remains professional and independent and
maintains an appropriate governance framework ensuring management of state assets on
commercial criteria, with clear objectives and accountability.
27.
The authorities should step up privatization efforts. Slovenia has been slow to privatize
compared to its peers, which has contributed to governance problems and led to inefficiencies. Welldesigned and implemented privatization can bring in fresh capital, including FDI, and related
technological and managerial know-how, fostering competition and leading to better quality at lower
prices. It can also help reduce public debt. The authorities should thus intensify efforts to divest the
remaining twelve companies slated for sale, while avoiding fire sales. A few early and successful sales

Such cases include the Finnish and Swedish AMCs established in the early 1990s. See Klingebiel , Daniela. The use of

(such as of the telecom company and NKBM, expected this year) can send a strong signal to the
markets about Slovenia’s commitment to privatization and openness to FDI. The strategy for
remaining state assets should be finalized, with the aim to divest all non-strategic ones.
28.
The authorities concurred that reducing corporate debt overhang is a priority. They
agreed that the BAMC can play a key role, but noted that its independence also comes with
obligations to maintain transparency and accountability. In this regard, they suggested that
remuneration may need to be lowered and governance changed to achieve balance in its board (now
majority foreign). The authorities saw positively the reformed insolvency framework, which is
facilitating MRAs, but agreed that capacity bottlenecks need to be addressed. They reiterated their
commitment to privatize companies slated for sale, formulate a strategy for other state-owned assets,
and ensure an independent professional board of the SSH.

Depending on cash-accrual adjustments and developments in the broader public sector, there is a
risk that the authorities’ EDP target (ESA2010 terms) may not be achieved, which could jeopardize
policy credibility.
30.
Without further structural fiscal adjustment, both the medium-term objective of a
balanced budget and debt sustainability would be jeopardized. On the basis of current policies,
staff projects about 3¾ percent of GDP in further measures will be required to reach a balanced
budget in the medium term, as committed to under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Moreover,
without further adjustment, debt is projected to increase to close to 90 percent of GDP by 2020,
raising sustainability concerns. Vulnerabilities also arise from large maturities (some 12 percent of
GDP) coming due in 2016 and sizeable government guarantees (18 percent of GDP), which are
concentrated in a few public entities. Finally, population aging will boost pension costs beyond 2020;
left unaddressed, they would lead to an explosive debt path.

31.
To enhance the durability of the adjustment, the authorities could target a somewhat
more ambitious structural improvement in 2015. Structural measures of around 1.2 percent of
GDP—corresponding to an improvement in the structural balance of about 1 percent of GDP—can
help strike a balance between short-run cyclical and long-run sustainability concerns. This would
imply replacing some ½ percent of GDP of proposed temporary measures with permanent ones.
Measures could include better targeting of social transfers and subsidies to ensure that those most
vulnerable are protected, while reducing abuse in the system. Indeed, the crisis has led to an increase
in the risk of social exclusion relative to the pre-crisis period.8 The authorities could also consider
reducing the tax preferential treatment for pensions and the pensioner-specific social benefits (while
ensuring that low-income pensioners are adequately covered by the safety net), which would also
help mitigate long-run population aging costs. Plans to protect public investment through absorption
of EU funds should be maintained, as they are supportive of growth.
32.
The deficit reduction needed to put debt on a sustained downward path should be
undertaken gradually to help minimize risks to the recovery while ensuring policy credibility.
An adjustment of ¾ percent of GDP per year over 2016–19 would be required to reach structural
balance (and an overall primary surplus of around 3.3 percent of GDP) by 2019. This would bring debt
down to around 77 percent of GDP by 2020, close to the 2013 level, but still more than three times its
pre-crisis level.


On the revenue side: Redesigning and adopting a real-estate tax next year in line with the
constitution would not only help boost revenues, but would also promote social and intergenerational equity by ensuring an adequate sharing of the tax burden based on wealth. Broader
tax reforms could help to address the erosion in the tax base by revisiting income tax exemptions
as the economy recovers and remove tax distortions favoring debt over equity financing.



On the spending side: The authorities should pursue further pension reforms, including the
measures noted in ¶19, as well as moving to indexation of benefits to prices and reducing

8

remaining incentives for early retirement (see Selected Issues Paper “Social Spending Reform and
Fiscal Savings in Slovenia”). Early adoption can help to minimize costs. Furthermore, the planned
health expenditure review is an opportunity to modernize the sector and achieve efficiency
savings. More broadly, a public administration review and reform could help reduce inefficiencies
and costs while maintaining the quality of public services. Putting in place a system of monitoring
government guarantees that is integrated into the overall debt-management strategy can help
reduce fiscal risks.
33.
Fiscal credibility would also be enhanced by implementing a fiscal rule. The authorities
have drafted legislation implementing the new EU fiscal framework by introducing expenditure
ceilings consistent with the EU’s minimum recommended structural adjustment of ½ percent per
year, while providing flexibility in exceptional circumstances, and setting up an independent Fiscal
Council. As noted above, they should aim for a more ambitious medium-term structural adjustment
to reach the medium-term objective in a well-specified and realistic timeframe. This is a key to
enhancing predictability and safeguarding the credibility of fiscal policy and debt sustainability.
Specification of automatic corrective mechanisms to deal with unforeseen deviations and with large
shocks impacting the fiscal accounts would also help.
34.
The authorities had a more sanguine view of short and medium-term fiscal prospects.
They were confident that the new fiscal measures (which they estimate to have a higher yield than
staff expects), together with large and positive cash-accrual adjustments and substantially improved
financial outturns of extra-budgetary entities would be sufficient to attain the 2015 EDP target.
Moreover, they considered that a pace of fiscal adjustment of ½ percent of GDP per year would be
appropriate from a cyclical perspective, while being sufficient to meet their SGP targets in the
medium term. They agreed that further adjustment should be supported by structural reforms, but
did not see an urgency to implement the real-estate tax and pension reforms.

D. Structural Reforms
Structural reforms can help support corporate restructuring, jobs, and growth
35.
Structural bottlenecks hinder investment and growth (Figure 8). In the labor market,
the 2013 reform reducing severance payments and notice periods has led to an increase in the share
of new contracts that are open-ended.9 Yet, the number of temporary contracts remains large and is
among the highest in the EU, discouraging job-specific investment in human capital, which is
especially problematic for the youth. In addition, following a 23 percent minimum-wage increase
in 2010, the wage structure is highly compressed, which also affects employment negatively and
limits productivity. Entry barriers in restricted professions further constrain employment

36.
Further labor and service-market reforms can help boost long-term youth
employment. Such reforms are also key to facilitating the reallocation of labor across firms and
sectors, supporting corporate restructuring and boosting long-run productivity. Building on the 2013
reform, the authorities should take further steps to reduce the protection of open-ended contracts, in
particular on collective dismissals, where Slovenia still lags the OECD average.11 Active labor market
policies can also be better focused on providing the skills required by changing economic conditions.
Additionally, reducing wage compression, for example through slower indexation of minimum wages,
can help boost employment and reward (and retain) strong performers. And closed professions
should be further liberalized.
37.
Other institutional reforms can help spur domestic and foreign investment.
Streamlining procedures and regulations (e.g., easing rules for registering or selling property,
simplifying requirements for foreign trade, cutting barriers to business development, and eliminating
red tape related to the granting of construction permits) can help attract fresh capital in the
economy, including from abroad. To boost long-run growth and innovation, education curricula can
be better aligned to the needs of the economy, and cooperation between universities and industry
strengthened. Bringing the institutional environment in line with best practice could have a significant
impact on growth (with the upside estimated at up to 2-2¾ percentage points), and carefully
prioritizing reforms can maximize their impact (see Selected Issues Paper “Prioritizing Structural
Reforms to Support the Recovery”).
38.
The authorities concurred with the need to strengthen institutions to boost jobs and
growth. However, they considered that the 2013 labor market reform, together with recent measures
to increase payroll taxes on student work, are sufficient to reduce discrepancies between temporary

and permanent contracts. The authorities agreed that there is further scope to improve the business
environment and noted that they have recently integrated plans from various ministries into a single
reform strategy aiming, inter alia, at reducing the administrative burden by 25 percent.12

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Slovenia is recovering from a profound recession. The economy was hit hard by global
developments, which, combined with domestic imbalances, culminated in a banking crisis in 2013.
The authorities responded by providing significant state support to the banks and implementing
measures to facilitate corporate-debt restructuring and bolster the public finances. As confidence
returned and external conditions improved, activity rebounded last year, supported by strong exports
and EU-funded public investment.
40.
But the legacies of the crisis weigh on the outlook. Output remains well below pre-crisis
levels, and unemployment is still very high. Bank NPLs remain excessive, also reflecting the overindebtedness of the corporate sector, hampering investment and job creation. And the public
finances are strained, as the large bank recapitalization costs boosted the deficit and debt, placing a
heavy burden on future generations of taxpayers. As a result, the growth outlook remains subdued
and the economy is still vulnerable to shocks.
41.
Resolute policy action therefore remains of the essence to reduce vulnerabilities and
boost growth. With the balance sheets of banks, corporations, and the state still weak and deeply
interlinked, continued comprehensive reforms are needed to strengthen the economy’s resilience to
shocks, improve the monetary transmission mechanism, and pave the way for sustainable long-term
growth. Policy complacency, on the other hand, could lead to more losses down the road, risking
renewed financial stress.
42.
A key policy priority is to address NPLs decisively and strengthen bank governance.
The authorities should take steps to ensure more active use of transfers to the BAMC, as these are a
critical element of any strategy to reduce large corporate NPLs. For SMEs, guidelines for voluntary
negotiations including simplified debt-restructuring options could help promote work-outs for viable
firms. The supervisory authorities should monitor banks’ operational capacity to deal with NPLs, set
ambitious targets, and monitor progress toward these. Bank governance should be strengthened and
state-owned banks (including the largest bank) should be fully privatized as soon as possible, in order
to reduce the risk of political interference in credit allocation.
43.
Bank restructuring should be completed, and macro-financial risk management
strengthened. To safeguard financial stability, any remaining capital shortfalls should be addressed in
a timely and transparent manner, while minimizing taxpayer costs. Ongoing wind-down procedures
need to be completed. With the SSM now in effect, supervision is expected to be strengthened. Still,

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

there is scope to enhance the monitoring of risks, including by implementing a centralized credit
registry and a monitoring system for connected lending.
44.
Corporate-sector restructuring should accelerate. The BAMC should play a leading role
in the restructuring process, to achieve economies of scale and sever corporate-bank links.
Safeguarding the BAMC’s independence from political interference is essential to maximizing
taxpayer returns. The authorities should encourage the use of existing legal tools to restructure the
debt of viable companies, including through debt-to-equity swaps. Increasing the operational
effectiveness of the insolvency framework can help facilitate this process.
45.
Corporate governance should be strengthened, including by speeding up
privatizations. Weak governance and pervasive state control in the economy were at the root of the
crisis. To address this, facilitate corporate restructuring, and attract much needed equity capital in the
economy, the authorities need to intensify privatization efforts, while avoiding fire sales. Strategic
state-owned assets should be managed independently, without undue political interference.
46.
Another policy priority is to put public finances on a sustainable footing. After
the 2014 fiscal targets were missed due to slippages and setbacks, the 2015 budget includes
additional consolidation measures to bring the deficit in check. In light of still rising and vulnerable
public debt, the authorities could target a somewhat more ambitious structural improvement this
year, aiming for an adjustment of about 1 percent of GDP. Additional structural measures of about
¾ percent of GDP per year over the subsequent four years would be needed to reach structural
balance and place debt on a sustained downward path by 2020.
47.
Structural fiscal reforms need to underpin the adjustment. Implementation of a new
property-tax system in line with the constitution can help boost revenues and enhance intergenerational equity. Comprehensive pension reform is critical to address the large costs of population
aging. Further tax reform can help simplify the system, reduce compliance costs, and eliminate biases
in favor of debt. And reforms of the health sector and public administration can help reduce fiscal
costs and boost efficiency.
48.
Other institutional reforms can help support employment and long-term growth.
Addressing labor market segmentation by taking further steps to reduce the protection of openended contracts can help facilitate labor relocation as the corporate sector restructures, while
boosting long-term prospects for youth employment. Improving the business environment, including
by cutting red tape, is key to spurring investment, including from abroad. Careful prioritization of
structural reforms can maximize their impact on growth.

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
On the basis of current policies, Slovenia’s public debt is projected to continue to slowly increase
toward 90 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, raising sustainability concerns. Moreover, public
debt dynamics are highly vulnerable to shocks. In particular, the materialization of part of outstanding
government guarantees or a prolonged deflation shock could bring debt above 100 percent of GDP
by 2019, while a combined growth-primary fiscal balance shock could increase it even further, to close
to 115 percent of GDP; if the latter shock is also combined with fiscal losses from the financial sector,
debt would rise to 135 percent of GDP. This analysis highlights the importance of resolute policy action
to ensure debt sustainability. In particular, a durable and credible fiscal consolidation can help put
debt on a sustained downward path. Restructuring of the bank and corporate sectors, improved
governance, and a reduction of the role of the state in the economy can strengthen the resilience of the
economy to shocks. And structural reforms can boost potential growth.
Slovenia’s public debt is projected to gradually increase over the medium term under the
baseline scenario. Without additional fiscal consolidation beyond the 2015 proposed measures, the
debt ratio would be rising by around 1¾ percentage points of GDP per year on average,
approaching 90 percent by the end of the decade. While debt dynamics in 2013–14 were dominated
by the impact of bank restructuring, the medium-term increase in the debt ratio largely reflects the
limited adjustment, with the primary surplus too low to offset the impact on debt dynamics of the
unfavorable growth-real interest rate differential and of “below-the-line” liabilities, including called
guarantees (assumed at ½ percent of GDP annually, in line with the 2013–14 average).1
While staff’s forecasting performance to date has been mixed, the current macroeconomic
baseline remains conservative. Staff’s real sector forecast has tended to underestimate growth in
the period preceding the crisis, and overestimate it since then. The depth of the global downturn
in 2009 was difficult to forecast, as was the second dip in the recession. Staff has also tended to
over-predict inflation, which in the more recent period reflected the unanticipated depth and
duration of the recession, and also the consistent undershooting of the ECB’s inflation target. In this
context, staff’s current macroeconomic baseline—based on slow reforms and fiscal consolidation
in 2015 alone—is more conservative than indicated by quarterly growth trends, and the inflation
forecast has been brought down.
The baseline fiscal adjustment is broadly realistic, although staff’s recommended adjustment
is ambitious by international standards. Staff’s past fiscal forecasts have been close to the actual
outturn, with the forecasting error remaining within the 25–75 inter-quartile range. The projected
fiscal adjustment under the baseline falls below the top quartile, and the primary balance is slightly
below the median of the distribution. However, the baseline adjustment is insufficient to place the
debt ratio on a downward path. Staff recommendations would put Slovenia well into the top
quartile in terms of size of required adjustment, and the primary balance at the low end of the top
quartile. While these targets may be viewed as ambitious, Slovenia has achieved an adjustment in
the primary structural balance of a similar size during 2011–13 (half of the time span currently
envisaged), while the economy was in recession.
1

The projections assume a gradual reduction in the cash buffer from over 10 percent of GDP in 2014 to under
5 percent over the medium term.

the primary structural balance of a similar size during 2011–13 (half of the time span currently
envisaged), while the economy was in recession.
Slovenia’s high level of public debt and debt service are the main areas of vulnerability, in
particular under the stress scenarios. The debt ratio remains below 90 percent of GDP throughout
the medium term under the baseline, but is projected to exceed this threshold under stress
scenarios, in some cases substantially. In terms of debt structure, the shares of non-resident holders
and of short-term debt in total debt are moderate, and Slovenia’s spreads have fallen steadily to low
levels. Debt service is projected to remain marginally below 20 percent of GDP during most of the
medium term, but it exceeds this threshold in 2019, when two large maturities come due. However,
debt service is projected to cross the threshold much earlier under standardized stress scenarios,
and to approach 30 percent of GDP under the most adverse ones.
Slovenia’s debt dynamics are highly vulnerable to specific shocks:


Standardized macro shocks: Sensitivity to GDP growth shocks is especially noteworthy: a
negative 1-standard deviation growth shock over 2 years would bring the debt ratio to almost
110 percent by 2020.



Country-specific shocks:
o

Contingent liabilities from government guarantees are a potential source of vulnerability.
Guarantees amount to 18 percent of GDP, and the weak financial position of borrowers
raises the probability that guarantees may be called. To illustrate, calling of some 10 percent
of GDP of guarantees outstanding would bring the debt ratio to over 100 percent by 2020,
highlighting the importance of reducing the state’s involvement in the economy.

o

A deflation shock would have an adverse impact on debt dynamics. A negative 1-standard
deviation shock over 2 years would bring the debt ratio close to 105 percent by 2020.

o

A combined macro-fiscal shock (with GDP growth at the level of the adverse growth
scenario, inflation and fiscal revenue at the respective minima of the standardized scenarios,
and fiscal expenditure, exchange rate, and interest rate spread at the respective maxima of
the standardized scenarios) would bring debt above 115 percent of GDP by the end of the
projection period, highlighting the importance of a credible medium-term fiscal policy.

o

A macro-financial shock could have dramatic effects on debt dynamics. A scenario
combining the macro-fiscal shock presented above with further losses from the corporate
and banking sector (10 percent of GDP) would bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to around
135 percent by 2020. This highlights the importance of policies to strengthen the banking
and corporate sectors and reducing the state’s direct and indirect involvement in the
economy.

o

An active scenario of fiscal adjustment along the lines of staff’s recommendations can
put debt dynamics on a firmly downward path. Adoption of structural fiscal measures of
¾ percent of GDP in 2015–19, implying a cumulative improvement in the structural primary
balance of 3¾ percentage points of GDP over that period, would bring debt down to close
to 75 percent by 2020, even as medium-term growth would be somewhat lower, as a result
of the fiscal headwinds. Structural reforms, including privatization, could further reduce the
debt-to GDP ratio.

5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ Assumes issuance of EUR 1.7bn of bonds by the Bad Assets Management Company (BAMCO), and recap of EUR 3 bn at end 2013 (of which, EUR 2 bn in cash),
and--conservatively--government recap of EUR 0.6 bn in 2014 of two currently privately-owned small banks.
9/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period. The figures in 2013 and 2014 reflect accumulation and subsequent use
of cash balances around the bank recapitalization
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex II. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
The gross external debt ratio is expected to fall gradually to around 94 percent of GDP
by 2020. External debt rose by about 10 percent of GDP in 2014 due to external issuances to prefinance 2015 needs. In the medium term, external public debt is expected to decline gradually, as
additional government debt issuance is expected to be more than offset by a reduction in private
sector external liabilities. The net international investment position is expected to reach broad
balance by 2020.
External debt dynamics are vulnerable to shocks. In particular, a growth shock (involving a
reduction by one-half of a standard deviation relative to the baseline) could push external debt up
to close to 120 percent of GDP. A worse-than expected current account (also by one-half of a
standard deviation relative to the baseline), also results in an increase in the external debt/GDP ratio
to 110 percent of GDP, with a combined shock bringing the external debt-to-GDP ratio to
115 percent of GDP.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Annex III. External Assessment
Various indicators of the external balance and real exchange rate suggest that, on balance, Slovenia
does not appear to suffer from competitiveness problems, as also evidenced by strong export
performance and broadly stable market shares. This suggests that the current account and the real
exchange rate are broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Modelbased indicators of the real exchange rate give a mixed picture; their results should be interpreted with
care, given the models’ weak fit for Slovenia after the crisis period.
The current account (CA) has adjusted sharply following the crisis. It went from a deficit of
5.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to a surplus of 5.8 percent in 2013. Resilient exports contributed to the
adjustment, owing to integration in core euro-area supply chains. But import compression also
played a significant role, as domestic demand and in particular import-intensive investment
plunged, offset in part by the large import-component of exports. The income deficit remained at
around 1½ percent of GDP as rising labor income from abroad was offset by rising interest
payments. This year, the current account is expected to remain in surplus of about 5.6 percent of
GDP, well above its long-term (1996–2008) average of -1 percent of GDP.

The real exchange rate has also adjusted. The CPI-based
REER declined by about 5 percent relative to its peak, and
ULC-based REER adjusted by about 10 percent from its peak.
Both stand close to their long-run historical averages. Still, the
external competiveness impact of the reduction in the ULCbased indicator has been limited, as it was largely driven by
gains in the non-traded goods sector, in particular the public
sector, where wage cuts of about 6 percent were
implemented over 2012–13. In contrast, ULCs in the tradablegoods sector have remained broadly flat, as productivity

The large current account reversal was largely driven by
capital flows. Slovenia’s investment boom during 2004–08
was mainly financed by domestic banks making use of cheap
foreign funds. The combination of low FDI inflows, high
corporate leverage, focus on non-tradable investment, and a
local boom in mergers & acquisitions did not prepare
Slovenia well for the eventual turn of the tide. As Slovenian
banks lost access to external markets in 2008–09, they had to
repay large external maturities, with an attendant collapse of
investment. Between mid-2008 and end-2013, the net
reduction in banks’ external liabilities reached €11.8 billion,
¼ of the end-2008 aggregate balance sheet, or 30 percent of
GDP.

growth due to employment reductions was offset by rising wages. Market shares have remained
broadly flat.
Model-based indicators of the real exchange rate (REER) give a mixed picture, in part due to
difficulties in capturing structural factors during the post-crisis adjustment. In particular, the
models do not appear to capture well the specifics of the Slovenian case, such as the large collapse
in demand and 11 percent of GDP CA reversal, the sudden stop in credit (which went from growth of
34 percent in 2007 to a 6 percent decline in 2013), and the large external deleveraging of banks
since the crisis (by about 30 percent of GDP). As such, the results should be interpreted with caution:

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS) follows the European
System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by industry and expenditure categories are
compiled in both current and constant prices, and are published within 80 days after the reference quarter.
In September 2005, the SORS changed the base year for compiling constant prices GDP from 2000 to the
previous year’s prices and started using the chain–link index methodology.
The SORS compiles the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for monitoring compliance with the
Maastricht inflation criterion. However, price collection is restricted to four cities and their surrounding rural
areas. The weights are based on the three-year average of expenditure data for consumer goods from
continuous Household Budget Surveys for 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI),
which differs from the consumer price index in weights only.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high quality. The ministry of
finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government Finance, which presents monthly data
on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary Central Government), local governments, social security
(Pension and Health funds), and the consolidated general government. The coverage of general
government excludes the operations of extra-budgetary funds and own revenues of general government
agencies (zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are reported for
publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government operations, including
the operations of the extra-budgetary funds are reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and broadly use the analytical
framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986 government finance statistics methodology. The
data reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook are also on a cash basis but are recast in the analytical
framework and classifications of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001(GFSM 2001).
The Slovenian authorities adopted the GFSM 2001 methodology, which is used as a building block for the
compilation of the ESA 95–based data jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the SORS for reporting to the
European Commission. To assist the Ministry of Finance resolve several classification issues and develop a
migration path, a STA technical assistance mission visited Ljubljana in April 2006. The introduction in 2008
of a new chart of accounts for all public entities based on accrual principles greatly facilitated the adoption
of the new methodology.
Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA

Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of high quality. The
data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook since 1993 (with estimates of the
international investment position published since 1994). In 2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance
of payments statistics going back to 1994; the most significant revisions were related to the income
component of the current account and to the other investment component of the financial account.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line with the SDDS in August
2003. The main change comprised the inclusion of trade credits in the debt data.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Philip Gerson and Ranil Salgado

This supplement provides information that has become available since the Staff
Report was circulated to the Executive Board on January 30, 2015. The information
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.

Economic Developments and Prospects
Preliminary data through end-2014 suggest that the general government deficit
reached 5.8 percent of GDP (cash basis, excluding extra-budgetary entities and
including bank-related costs). Net of bank-related costs, the deficit is estimated at
3.5 percent of GDP,1 0.2 percent of GDP lower than the Staff Report projection (which
was based on end-October data). The difference is due to lower spending (0.5 percent of
GDP) on public investment, capital transfers, and public wages, which was partly offset
by lower revenues (0.3 percent of GDP) from indirect taxes and EU receipts. Assuming
adherence to the expenditure targets included in the 2015 supplementary budget—
which was recently approved by the cabinet—the better-than-expected 2014 fiscal
outturn does not materially affect staff’s projections for 2015 and the medium term nor
the related policy advice.

Staff’s definition of the interest bill includes interest on BAMC bonds of about 0.1 percent of GDP.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Slovenia
On February 13, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Slovenia.
Slovenia is recovering from a deep crisis. Growth is estimated to have reached around
2.6 percent in 2014, supported by strong exports and EU-funded public investment. The financial
sector has stabilized following recapitalization of the major banks by the state. Government
bonds yields have declined markedly.
Nevertheless, the legacies of the crisis weigh on the outlook. Output remains below pre-crisis
levels, unemployment is high, and strained public and private balance sheets continue to weigh
on domestic demand. Growth is thus projected at around 1.9 and 1.7 percent in 2015 and 2016,
respectively, with potential growth well below pre-crisis levels. Risks are tilted to the downside,
and include those of insufficient reform implementation and weaker-than-expected external
demand.
The key policy challenges include (i) strengthening the health of the banking sector to enable it
to support the economy; (ii) accelerating corporate restructuring to address the large debt
overhang and reduce the role of the state in the economy; (iii) putting public finances on a
sustainable path; and (v) further boosting the economy’s potential growth through ambitious
structural reforms.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed that Slovenia’s economy is recovering and commended the
authorities for their efforts to mend the banking system, facilitate corporate debt restructuring,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

and consolidate the public finances. Nevertheless, continued comprehensive actions are needed
to restore the health of the financial and corporate sectors, ensure fiscal and debt sustainability,
and foster sustainable long-term growth.
Directors agreed that reducing the still high non-performing loans (NPLs) is a key priority.
Measures to be considered in this context are additional transfers to the bank asset management
company (BAMC), the development of guidelines for voluntary negotiations with SMEs, and the
setting of ambitious NPL reduction targets by the supervisory authorities with monitoring of
progress against them. Directors urged the authorities to press ahead with efforts to strengthen
bank governance, and privatize state-owned banks. They also encouraged the authorities to
address remaining capital shortfalls promptly and transparently, while minimizing fiscal costs,
and to strengthen risk management and oversight on connected lending.
Directors highlighted the need to accelerate the restructuring of corporate debt by using all
available tools. They emphasized that the BAMC should play a leading role in this process and
stressed the importance of safeguarding its independence from political interference. Directors
noted that increasing the effectiveness of the new insolvency framework by addressing
operational bottlenecks can help facilitate restructurings. They also highlighted the importance of
strengthening corporate governance to facilitate the sector’s restructuring and attract much
needed equity, and of stepping up privatization efforts, while avoiding fire sales.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed fiscal consolidation efforts, aiming to bring the
budget deficit in check, and the progress towards implementing a fiscal rule. Most Directors
recommended a somewhat more ambitious structural improvement, while being mindful of the
still nascent recovery, to achieve fiscal balance and place debt on a sustained downward path.
Structural fiscal reforms should underpin the durability of the adjustment. In this context,
Directors emphasized the importance of pension reforms to address looming demographic
pressures; tax reforms, including revamping the property tax system; and efforts to increase
efficiency in health, education, and the public administration.
Directors called for continued structural reforms to support employment and growth. Noting the
positive impact of earlier labor market reforms, they encouraged additional efforts to reduce the
protection of open-ended contracts to facilitate labor reallocation as the corporate sector
restructures and boost long-term employment prospects for the youth. Further reforms to
improve the business environment, including by cutting red tape, to spur domestic and foreign
investment are also important.

Statement by Ibrahim Halil Çanakci, Executive Director for the Republic of Slovenia
and by Borut Repansek, Advisor to the Executive Director
February 13, 2015

The Slovenian authorities thank the mission team for the candid and constructive discussions,
and appreciate the Fund’s technical assistance. They broadly share staff’s views, with the
exceptions reflected in the authorities’ views in the Staff Report. The authorities consider that
the reform momentum has already been reignited, but are aware that the substantial policy
challenges ahead leave no room for complacency.
Slovenia’s economic growth has resumed and macroeconomic developments are
broadly positive.
GDP growth in 2014 is estimated at 2.6 percent, while year-on-year data show 3.2 percent
growth in the third quarter of 2014. The January 2015 business sentiment indicator points to
an annual increase of 11.5 percent. Growth has largely been driven by improved cost
competitiveness and the export-oriented part of the corporate sector, indicating that problems
are not spread across the entire sector. The inflation rate is close to zero. Furthermore,
employment growth rebounded in 2014. Although still high, the unemployment rate is
stabilized at around 9.3 percent, which is below the EU average.
The current account is in surplus and the trust of the markets has been regained.
The 2014 and 2015 current account surpluses are projected at 5.5 percent and 6.2 percent of
GDP, respectively. Slovenia has been repaying external liabilities regularly, as reflected in
the negative balance in the financial account of the balance of payments, and in the
rebalancing of private to public debt. Nevertheless, private sector deleveraging more than
offsets the increase in public sector debt, which will result in a lowering of the total external
debt. Slovenia’s export market share has increased. Lastly, the financial markets’ perceptions
of Slovenia significantly improved after the banks’ balance sheet strengthening. Since
Slovenia joined the euro area in 2007, yields on its government bonds have never been lower
than in recent months.
The signed social agreement provides broader support for reforms.
Slovenia held European and local elections in 2014. The early parliamentary elections took
place in July, and the new government took office in September 2014. Maintaining sufficient
public support and social cohesion while implementing comprehensive measures, is a
challenge for every government. In this context, the recent social agreement between the
authorities and social partners, which was reached after two months of intensive negotiations,
is an encouraging development. The agreement, which includes 140 measures, covers the
period 2015–16 and provides the basis for social consensus on reform policy
implementation.

2
With regard to fiscal policy, the authorities took important steps on the revenue and
expenditure sides in 2014.


On the revenue side, they preserved the four income tax brackets, raised the tax on
financial services and insurance operations, as well as the environment tax (due to
CO2 emissions). A number of measures were adopted to increase the efficiency of tax
collection and the reduction of the “shadow economy”. The personal income tax was
adjusted by eliminating the automatic indexation of the tax base and tax allowances.
Some additional measures were also introduced to eliminate the senior allowance and
benefits for daily migrants, while the decision against lowering the corporate income
tax supported consolidation efforts. Certain excise duties were increased, such as on
tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages other than wine, and certain fuels.
The exemption from the excise duty on bio fuels enjoyed by petroleum product
retailers was abolished.



On the spending side, measures aimed at lowering expenditures initiated in October
2014 are gradually being implemented. They include the centralization of the public
procurement and IT systems, as well as of the state asset management; the reduction of
labor costs in the public sector; measures in municipality funding; changes to the
student work system; streamlining of public services; changing some subsidies into
refundable resources; and sector-specific measures by individual ministries. 



Preliminary data on the consolidated general government deficit for all of 2014 became
available very recently. The consolidated general government deficit in cash terms
stood at 3.4 percent of GDP, and the total deficit in ESA terms was registered at
5.3 percent of GDP. This includes one-off expenditures for the Ljubljanska banka
depositors based on the European Court for Human Rights’ (ECHR) ruling and bank
recapitalizations (in the amount of 1.9 percent of GDP) which is in line with the
Eurostat methodology.

Fiscal consolidation in 2015 follows the commitments of the 2014 Stability Program and
the need for maintaining the growth momentum.
Fiscal policy targets for 2015 take into account the requirements and recommendations of the
European Council and the commitments made in the 2014 Stability Program. At the end of
January 2015, the government approved the draft 2015 revised budget, based on the 2014
budget’s realization and the updated macro-economic forecasts predicting 2 percent GDP
growth in 2015. The draft 2015 revised budget set the general government deficit on a cash
basis at 3.62 percent of GDP. After recalculating to an accrual basis and taking into
consideration the expected balance of other government units, the general government deficit
in 2015 is expected to be less than 3 percent of GDP under the ESA methodology. The bulk
of the difference is due to the system of execution of EU funds, where part of the cash funds
will be withheld by the EU until future years (in line with EU rules).

3
The authorities are preparing further measures to improve tax collection, including a
redesigned real estate tax and a system of certified cash registers with online connection to
the tax authorities, both slated for introduction at the beginning of 2016. The draft 2015
revised budget expenditure structure is more investment-oriented, as reflected in the increase
of construction expenditures and investment transfers. It also incorporates the
aforementioned reduction in public sector labor costs and the replacement of some subsidies
by refundable financing, as well as reduced transfers to individuals and households through
better targeting.
The authorities and staff have differing views with regard to the medium-term fiscal
outlook.
The authorities consider the 0.5 percent structural deficit consolidation over the medium term
(lower than staff’s 0.75 percent recommendation) to be appropriate in view of the ongoing
economic recovery and corporate balance sheet repair, and the uncertainties concerning the
size of the estimated output gap.
The authorities do not share the assessment that under the current policies, debt will increase
to just below 90 percent of GDP by the end of the decade. In their view, in the medium term,
debt will stabilize at around 82 percent of GDP in ESA 2010 terms due to the following:
(i)

4.2 percent of GDP of the general government debt reflects bonds issued by the
Bank Assets Management Company (BAMC) under a government guarantee,
which are intended to be redeemed throughout the BAMC’s lifespan through the
use of proceeds from the sale of assets which the BAMC received in exchange for
the bonds.

(ii)

4.2 percent of GDP of the general government debt reflects the Republic of
Slovenia’s contribution to the European Stability Mechanism. It is expected that
this contribution will be partially recovered in the medium term.

(iii)

The government’s policy stance over the medium term, including the use of
privatization proceeds, will result in debt stabilization at the lower level.

The authorities find the scenario of a materialization of half of the outstanding government
guarantees highly unlikely. The largest guarantees were issued in favor of DARS (the
company managing the highway system that collects tolls), which can repay its obligations
on this basis; and to the BAMC, which is already included in the government debt.
The process of implementing a fiscal rule is proceeding well. The implementation law passed
the first reading in parliament with substantial support a few days ago.
However, the authorities agree that realizing the medium-term fiscal objectives is a challenge
and the implementation of structural reforms is crucial. In that respect, they highly appreciate
the comprehensive analyses in the Selected Issues Paper.

Slovenia’s banking sector is comfortably liquid and solvent.
According to the data for the first eleven months of 2014, the banking sector has become
profitable again. The increase in deposits reflects the trust of depositors. On the other hand,
the income risk warrants attention, while the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs)
remains, which is closely related to the slow pace and quality of the corporate sector balance
sheet repair.
In terms of banking sector supervision, last year’s introduction of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism was a significant step forward. In parallel, the central bank is committed to
strengthening banking supervision. Adjustments in the macro-prudential toolkit can be
expected along with changes in risks to financial stability.
The credit-less growth of the Slovenian economy has reasons on the supply and demand side
of the credit market. On the supply side, even foreign-owned banks in Slovenia are not very
active on the market. Creditworthy corporates have increasingly been raising loans abroad at
more favorable terms than in Slovenia. However, in 2014, corporate sector credit demand
showed some increase in Slovenia for the first time in the last four years.
The BAMC took over EUR 4.865 billion of bad assets from the banks in 2014 (i.e. EUR
1.365 billion on top of EUR 3.5 billion as of the end of September last year). In addition, the
value of the 36 bank-led multilateral restructuring agreements amounts to EUR 2 billion.
These, in comparison to the total loans of the Slovenian banking sector to corporates,
currently standing at around EUR 9.8 billion, reflects the size of the ongoing restructuring
process. Moreover, banks now are well-equipped to handle their NPLs internally and in line
with their own strategies, with the overall process closely monitored by the Bank of Slovenia.
Given all this, as well as considering its adverse impact on public debt, the authorities do not
agree with staff that additional asset transfers to the BAMC are warranted.
Continuing to address non-performing loans and the corporate sector overhang, as well
as strengthening governance in the banking sector remain key priorities.
The improvements in the insolvency legal framework are reaping results and the Fund’s
recent advice to increase its effectiveness instead of another reform of the insolvency legal
framework, is most welcome. The wind-down procedures in two banks are proceeding faster
than expected. In the process of the sale of the second largest bank, binding offers of
potential buyers were recently submitted. In the approval procedures of state aid, the
Republic of Slovenia committed to divest its equity shares in banks. Being mindful of this
commitment, the authorities steadfastly prepared a comprehensive strategy of state-owned
assets management. It aims at transparently clarifying goals, methods, criteria, procedures,
and equal treatment of buyers, and covers the financial and corporate sectors. The strategy
will be discussed by the parliament and is expected to be approved by the end of March
