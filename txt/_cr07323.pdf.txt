MOROCCO
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representative for the 2007 Consultation with Morocco
Approved by Amor Tahari and Matthew Fisher
July 11, 2007

•

Discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation took place in Rabat, Morocco, during
May 31–June 11 2007. The team comprised Mr. Fanizza (head), Ms. Allain, Messrs. BoughaHagbe and Arezki (all MCD). Mr. Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco, joined the
meetings.

•

Discussions were held with Minister Oualalou (Finance and Privatization), Minister
Boussaid (Modernization of Public Sectors), Governor Jouahri (Bank Al-Maghrib), and
other government officials. The mission held a press conference at the end of its visit to
present its main conclusions.

•

Political setting: The process of political opening initiated by H.M. Mohammed VI is
continuing. The outcome of the September elections is unlikely to affect the authorities’
commitment to market-oriented reforms.

•

Focus of the mission: In light of the broad consensus on economic policies, this year’s
consultation is streamlined. Discussions focused on: (a) ensuring that the ongoing recovery does
not translate into increased inflation; and (b) progress achieved in reforming the financial sector
and deepening the integration in the world economy.

•

Past Fund advice: The Fund and the authorities have generally agreed on broad policy
priorities. In the past, the authorities have generally favored a more gradual approach to reform
implementation than the Fund, but the pace of reform has recently picked up.

•

Exchange arrangement: Morocco’s currency, the dirham, is pegged to a basket of currencies
dominated by the Euro. The authorities are preparing for a possible transition to a flexible
exchange rate regime in the medium term.

•

Morocco has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and subscribes to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard. An FSAP update is scheduled to take place in November 2007.

•

The authorities intend to continue publishing all documents related to the Article IV
consultation.

I. BACKGROUND AND MAIN ISSUES
1.
Morocco’s economic performance has been strong, with favorable effects on
poverty and unemployment. Reflecting the pickup in growth since the turn of the century,
job creation has accelerated, bringing the unemployment rate down to a thirty-year low, and
real per capita income is on the rise after a decade-long stagnation. Nevertheless, poverty and
unemployment remain major policy concerns, as one out of seven Moroccans lives below the
national poverty line and 15 percent of the urban labor force is unemployed.
2.
Higher productivity and increased resilience to shocks are the main drivers of
the strong economic performance. The authorities have liberalized the transport, energy,
and telecommunications sectors, strengthened the financial sector, and opened up the trade
regime. Average growth has reached 5.4 percent per annum since 2001, 3.4 percentage points
higher than in the 1990s. This reflects the ongoing diversification of the nonagricultural
sector, and its increased resilience to shocks, both external and weather-related. However,
bad crop years still impact the overall economic performance, as evidenced by the growth
deceleration in 2007.
3.
In the short term, the main issue is to avoid the buildup of demand pressures,
which could jeopardize the sustainability of the recovery. Although the evidence is
mixed, there are signs that the continued vigor of domestic demand, which has been the main
engine of growth, may be stoking inflationary pressures. Increased net foreign direct
investment could also provide additional stimulus to domestic demand. In the context of
Morocco’s pegged exchange rate, preserving price stability is key to avoid unwarranted real
exchange rate appreciation.
4.
In the medium term, the challenge is to build upon Morocco’s recent
achievements to further raise growth. The policy dialogue with the authorities has
identified three areas that are key to strengthen the economic performance. First, by shoring
up private-sector confidence, further fiscal consolidation will help foster an environment
conducive to growth. Second, a more efficient financial sector will improve the mobilization
of savings and ensure their efficient allocation, thereby contributing to growth. Third, deeper
integration in the world economy would help Morocco harness the full benefits of
globalization, allowing the external sector to become the second engine of growth.
5.
Medium-term prospects are good. Steadfast implementation of macrostructural
reforms would improve total factor productivity, and increase the external sector’s
contribution to growth. As a result, nonagricultural GDP would grow by more than 5 percent
on average over the next five years. Tourism and remittance flows, the main drivers of
Morocco’s current account performance, are projected to remain strong, at about 10 percent
and 8 percent of GDP on average during 2008–12, respectively. However, the pickup in
economic activity is likely to bring the current account close to balance in the outer years.
Despite rising capital outflows resulting from future capital account liberalization, strong

4
foreign direct investment would help keep official reserves comfortably higher than the stock
of external debt. The standard external debt sustainability analysis does not highlight
significant external vulnerabilities; the fiscal sustainability analysis indicates that Morocco’s
public debt is mostly sensitive to output shocks.

Box 1. Revision of National Accounts
The authorities have prepared new series of national accounts using the 1993 UN system
of national accounts, and changing the base year from 1980 to 1998. A preliminary analysis
using the new series suggests that:
•

In 2006, nominal GDP is 14 percent above its level in the previous series. This change
comes mainly from an upward revision of the value added of the tertiary sector.

•

The share of the primary sector in real GDP is roughly unchanged in 2006 (14 percent
of GDP). The 5 percentage point decrease in the share of the secondary sector
(25 percent of GDP) has been offset by the equivalent increase in that of the tertiary
sector.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Inflation Outlook and the Role of Monetary Policy
6.
The authorities pointed to the preponderance of one-off factors in the 2006
increase in inflation. The adjustments in domestic fuel prices following the reinstatement of
the price indexation mechanism and the increase in the price of some services, mainly in the
transportation and communications sectors, did not seem to have a lasting impact on price
dynamics. Bank Al-Maghrib’s (BAM) two-stage tightening of the monetary policy stance in
20061—first by using the 7-day deposit auctions instead of the overnight facility in April,
then by increasing the rate on these auctions by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent in
December—contributed to contain overall inflation. There is little evidence that the strong
increase in credit to the private sector and associated fast-paced growth of broad money have
fueled inflationary pressures, confirming BAM’s assessment that the link between monetary
aggregates and inflation may have weakened in recent years.
7.
BAM believes that the balance of inflationary risks for 2007 is tilted to the
downside. The position of the economy in the cycle is difficult to gauge as the ongoing
transformation of the Moroccan economy complicates the measurement of the output gap.
The important liberalization efforts undertaken during the last decade may have shifted the
production frontier outward, imparting a downward bias on trend-based measures of the
output gap. BAM’s assessment is that output is now below its potential, and that the
contraction in agricultural output and ensuing deceleration in overall growth expected in
2007 should further dampen domestic demand. The slowdown in inflation in the first few
months of 2007 appears to bear this assessment out. Beyond changes in the international
environment, notably in international oil prices, the high level of real balances remains one of
the main risks to the inflation forecast. The substantial rise in real estate and financial asset
prices and the concomitant fall in treasury bond yields point to the existence of pent-up
liquidity. The possible acceleration of net capital inflows, which reflects for a large part the
importance of foreign direct investment, could also stoke demand pressures. The authorities
stressed that the envisaged gradual easing of remaining restrictions on capital account
transactions by residents could significantly contribute to liquidity management.
8.
BAM is committed to maintaining a prudent monetary stance. In line with the
mandate conferred by its new statutes, which granted BAM its autonomy, the central bank’s
main objective in 2007 is to continue to keep inflation under control. The interbank market
rate has increased again in the first half of 2007, and is now close to the central bank’s key
policy rate of 3.25 percent.

1

In the context of the pegged exchange rate, the existence of restrictions on capital account transactions by
residents leaves some scope for independent monetary policy.

B. Fiscal Policy
9.
The authorities have kept fiscal policy geared toward medium-term
consolidation. As a result of strong revenue performance and tight expenditure control, they
expect the 2007 deficit at 2.5 percent of GDP, broadly unchanged from its underlying 2006
level, excluding the impact of one-off factors.2 The debt-to-GDP ratio will remain on a
downward trend.3
10.
The improved public finance position demonstrates that the consolidation
strategy is bearing fruit. On the revenue side, the authorities have started to simplify the tax
system and increase its transparency, notably by presenting reports on tax expenditures with
the 2006 and 2007 budgets, and by publishing a tax procedure code, as well as a tax
assessment and collection manual. In addition, the favorable impact of the recovery, the
strengthening of tax administration, and the widening of the tax base—particularly for the
VAT—have significantly improved tax revenue performance, and offset the impact of lower
external tariffs. On the expenditure side, the success of the 2005 early retirement program has
generated substantial savings on the wage bill. The authorities have also taken important
steps to reduce the cost of subsidies by returning to the indexation mechanism of retail
domestic prices of petroleum products to international oil prices.
11.
To bring the government debt-to-GDP ratio closer to the average for
emerging-market OECD countries in the medium term, the authorities intend to:
•

Maintain the public wage bill around 10 percent of GDP by continuing the
no-new-net-hiring policy in the civil service and redeploying civil servants in priority
sectors;

•

Gradually reduce spending for food and energy subsidies, and replace them with
direct subsidies targeted to the most vulnerable segments of the Moroccan population;

•

Accelerate the simplification of the tax system, particularly through the continuation
of VAT reform and the reduction of exemptions; and

•

Continue to modernize tax administration, with a particular focus on strengthening
the collection function.

One-off payments (0.4 percent of GDP) boosted nontax revenue in 2006.

Historical debt series have been revised upward to reflect the inclusion of twenty-year old liabilities to the
central bank (1 percent of 2006 GDP).

C. Financial Sector Reform
12.
The recent surge in credit to the private sector demonstrates the success of the
authorities’ policies to deepen financial intermediation. The implementation of stricter
information requirements on credit, on both the demand and the supply sides, has contributed
to improving risk assessment and hence to reducing its cost. The new privately managed
credit bureau, expected to become operational in the first half of 2008, is also an important
step forward and will be the first of its kind in the region.
13.
Concurrently, important progress has been achieved in the area of financial
supervision. Banking supervision reports are now published annually. In view of the fast
growth of real estate and consumption
credit, specific studies on these
Selected Financial Soundness Indicators, 2001–06
developments, as well as on interest
25
75
rate-related risk, have recently been
70
20
added to these reports. The preliminary
65
conclusions of these studies indicate
15
60
that the recent surge in credit has not

deteriorated the quality of the banks’

portfolio. The implementation of

previously unsupervised institutions,

Provisioning/NPLs (right axis)
and the cooperation between entities
supervising different segments of the
financial system has been
strengthened. Starting from June 2007, BAM has required banks to comply with Basel II
prudential requirements. More generally, financial sector vulnerabilities have abated, with a
drop in nonperforming loans and an increase in provisioning.
14.
The strengthened balance sheet of public sector pension funds will enhance
financial sector stability. The consolidation of the different public sector funds should also
increase the availability of long-term resources to finance economic activity. Finally, the
ongoing study on the possible unification of the public loan guarantee system should help
rationalize it and assess its possible impact of the system on the budget.
D. Deeper Integration in the World Economy
15.
Morocco continues to make progress in the area of trade liberalization. The
gradual elimination of tariffs under the Association Agreement with the European Union
(EU) is proceeding according to schedule, and should be complete by 2012. The recent
implementation of the Agadir agreement and the coming into effect in 2006 of the free-trade
agreement with Turkey should stimulate trade both within the signing parties and with the
EU, since it provides for diagonal cumulation of rules of origin. Efforts to deepen regional

12
trade and financial integration in the Maghreb are also ongoing. The free-trade agreement
with the United States (U.S.) has led to a significant increase in textile exports to the U.S. in
2006. Morocco recently cut the maximum MFN import tax rate on industrial products by
5 percentage points to 45 percent, with a view to minimizing trade diversion.
16.
The authorities have taken measures to enhance the economy’s ability to adapt
to a changing global environment. The strengthening of public infrastructure, particularly
highways and ports, will continue to generate substantial productivity gains and to increase
Morocco’s attractiveness to investors. The authorities are also implementing a number of
sectoral reforms aiming at (a) supporting tourism; (b) modernizing existing industrial sectors
such as textile; and (c) facilitating the expansion of new industrial sectors and service
activities. The reforms are complemented by a broad range of incentives, including tax
incentives and the outfitting of offshore zones. The positive change in export composition
toward higher value added sectors indicates that these efforts are starting to bear fruit.
17.
The authorities believe that their
policies are consistent with external
stability. Recent analysis suggests that the
dirham is not misaligned. The increase in
inflation, combined with the strength of the
Euro vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, contributed
to a slight appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate in 2006. However, the gap
between the equilibrium exchange rate, as
estimated both by the authorities and staff,
and the observed rate remains statistically
insignificant. As trade in goods and services
continues to result in a deficit, the recent
increase in the current account surplus
mainly reflects strong remittances flows.
Empirical evidence points to the stability of
these flows.4 Further, the current account
surplus is bound to dwindle under the
impulse of the ongoing recovery,
weakening the case for a possible
undervaluation of the dirham. In spite of the
large reserve accumulation, BAM has
intervened during the year to provide banks

with foreign exchange to the tune of MAD 2 billion (equivalent to $250 million) a month. To
a large extent, the reserve accumulation reflects privatization revenue and long-standing
regulatory measures, including partial surrender requirements for export proceeds and
restrictions on capital outflows for residents.
18.
In this context, the authorities have started to consider options for a gradual
opening of the capital account to facilitate liquidity management, and intend to take
concrete steps in this direction in the near future. The progressive elimination of
remaining restrictions on operations carried out by residents will also help deepen the foreign
exchange market and improve economy wide risk management. The authorities have
requested the Fund’s assistance in drawing a road map toward global convertibility,
including reshaping the roles for monetary and exchange rate policies.
19.
Concurrently, BAM is preparing the transition to a more flexible exchange rate
regime and the possible adoption of an inflation-targeting framework. To this effect, the
central bank continues to strengthen its analytical capacity, and has already fleshed out its
analytical toolkit, including its understanding of the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. The publication of its first two monetary policy reports demonstrates the
progress achieved in modernizing BAM’s analytical and forecasting framework. The
strengthening of its communication strategy has helped increase the transparency of
monetary policy and contributed to better anchoring inflation expectations.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
Achievements: Morocco’s steady economic progress in recent years demonstrates the
benefits of broad-based economic reforms. Per capita income has risen continuously since
the beginning of the century; overall growth has become less dependent on climatic vagaries;
and the recent employment gains have started to make a dent in the stubbornly high urban
unemployment rate. The authorities’ broad reform agenda and sound macroeconomic
policies have buttressed private sector confidence, and both foreign and private domestic
investments have surged.
21.
Challenges: Morocco needs to sustain and possibly improve its recent strong
economic performance to bring per capita income closer to that of the emerging-market
OECD countries, further lessen the economy’s dependence on agriculture, and further reduce
unemployment and poverty.
22.
Risks: In the short term, the pickup in domestic demand could ignite inflationary
pressures that could destabilize the recovery. In the medium term, strong and durable growth
cannot rely only on the contribution of domestic demand. If the external sector does not
emerge as an additional growth engine, the recovery may reveal difficult to sustain.
23.
Inflation and monetary policy: Monetary policy has so far succeeded in containing
inflationary pressures, but new challenges lay forward. The inflation outlook remains mixed.

15
On the one hand, the decline in both headline and underlying inflation in the first five months
of the year, and the likely impact of this year’s bad crop on consumption suggest that
inflation may remain subdued in 2007. On the other hand, the rapid growth of domestic
credit to the private sector, the surge in foreign direct investment, and soaring asset prices
heighten the inflation risks. Under these circumstances, the current monetary stance appears
appropriate, but a tightening would be warranted in the event that inflation rises.
24.
Fiscal policy: The authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts have paid handsome
dividends, but need to continue. The recent declines in the government debt-to-GDP ratio,
the drop in the wage-bill burden, and the strong revenue performance have no doubt
contributed to heighten private sector confidence. Continued fiscal discipline will also help
contain inflationary pressures and further improve the investment climate. The likely deficit
outcome for 2007 (2.5 percent of GDP) is in line with the objective of bringing down the
government debt-to-GDP ratio. Looking forward, the authorities’ success will depend
crucially on their ability to keep the growth of the wage bill under check, reform the food and
energy subsidy systems, and further pursue tax reform.
25.
Financial sector reform: The authorities’ efforts to increase the transparency of the
financial information available to potential lenders have improved the efficiency of financial
market intermediation. The resulting increased access to credit for small and medium
enterprises is particularly welcome, but requires continued strengthening of financial
supervision to ensure that the quality of banks’ loan portfolios does not deteriorate. In this
sense, the recent drop in the share of nonperforming loans in total banking loans is
encouraging. The ongoing reform of various guarantee funds, in addition to facilitate access
to credit, should also help identify their fiscal costs.
26.
Deepening Morocco’s integration into the world economy. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ decision to gradually liberalize the external capital account. Staff and the
authorities agree that, while there are no indications of exchange rate misalignment, opening
up the capital account heightens the need to prepare for exiting the current peg of the dirham.
In addition to helping the successful integration of Morocco in the global economy, a flexible
exchange rate regime would help fight inflationary pressures, preserve a role for monetary
policy under full convertibility, and avoid implicit exchange-rate guarantees. In this
perspective, BAM has taken important steps toward improving its operational and forecasting
capacity with a view to eventually adopt an inflation-targeting framework. Further progress
toward MFN-based trade liberalization is needed to maximize the benefits from bilateral and
regional liberalization efforts. Staff welcomes Morocco’s active participation in the efforts to
enhance trade and financial integration in the Maghreb in collaboration with the Fund.
27.
Staff welcomes the adoption and the publication of anti-money laundering legislation,
and the ongoing efforts to set up a financial intelligence unit.
28.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ In 2005, a nonresident company (Vivendi) sold part of its shares in Maroc Télécom to a resident company.
2/ The increase in 2004 is due to a sale of government shares of Maroc Télécom in the Casablanca and Paris stock exchange.
3/ Includes the loans that Moroccan banks gave in 2003 and will give in 2005 to the company (Vivendi) that bought part of Maroc Télécom in 2003 and additional shares in 2005.
4/ Excluding the reserve position in the Fund.
5/ Public and publicly guaranteed debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP, ε = nominal appreciation
(increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in U.S. dollars (change in percent)

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain
restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),
pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in
accordance with Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM)
intervenes in the market to maintain the exchange rate within its target range, defined around
a fixed central rate. Morocco has a conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate
of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a basket of currencies representing Morocco’s principal
trading partners. In 2001, the authorities changed the basket of currencies by increasing the
weight of the euro to better reflect the weight of external trade with EU countries. The basket
was adjusted, limiting its composition to the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights
of 80 and 20 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations
on the value of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on
the basis of the daily dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to
the euro in the international exchange markets. As of May 31, 2007, the SDR/dirham
exchange rate was SDR 1=DH 12.58.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the 12-month cycle. The last discussions of the Article IV consultation were
held in Rabat during June 7–21, 2006, and were concluded by the Executive Board on

Annex II. Financial Relations with the World Bank
(As of June 21, 2007)
29.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the World Bank Board on
May 19, 2005. It plans to contribute to the broad goals of accelerating sustainable
employment-generating growth and reducing poverty and marginalization. It will focus upon
four objectives: (a) improve competitiveness and the investment climate; (b) increase access
to basic services by the poor and marginalized groups; (c) improve the efficiency of the
education system; and (d) improve water management and access to water services and
sanitation.
30.
The World Bank’s current portfolio in Morocco consists of 15 operations, with a total
net commitment of $1,158.4 million and an undisbursed balance of $629.3 million. Bank
lending is a mix of investment loans, SWAPs, and development policy loans (DPL). Recent
loans include Financial Sector Reform ($200), Public Administration Reform ($120), Rural
Roads II ($60), National Initiative of Human Development ($100). Integrated Solar Power
($43.2), Water Sector Reform ($100), and Energy Sector Reform ($100).
31.
For FY07, disbursements for DPLs and investment projects amount to $202.7 million
and $48.8 million, respectively. The disbursement ratio has improved, and is currently at
15.1 percent. The quality of the portfolio has generally been satisfactory and the percentage
of commitments at risk is low (8 percent) compared to the region (16.9 percent) or Bankwide
(15.1 percent). Despite recent improvements in the quality of the portfolio, institutional
capacity for project implementation still needs to be strengthened.
32.
A new Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), done in collaboration with Fund
staff, was finalized in March 2006 and has been largely discussed with the government. Its
dissemination had wide participation from the private sector, academia and civil society.
Ongoing studies include the preparation of (a) a series of policy notes in response to a request
from the government to identify the major issues to be faced by the incoming administration,
so as to ensure a smooth transition; and (b) a 2007 ICA survey, the mid-term review of the
CAS, summarized in a progress report is also being prepared. This is in line to monitor
compliance with the CAS objectives to support the government’s reforms for a private
environment conducive to faster growth and increased employment creation.
33.
Prospects for lending are significantly improving and specific requests have been
made for budget support and investment projects. Projects under preparation include: Oum
Er Rbia Water Resource Conservation ($60 million), Meknes Local Development
($30 million), Electricity Transmission project (ONE), Education reform II and Public
Administration Reform III DPL. The Bank and the Moroccan authorities are also discussing
a possible follow-up operation to address the trade constraints identified by the CEM.

28
Other recent analytical and advisory work includes studies on Backbone Services and EU
Neighborhood, Trade, Housing, Competitiveness and ICT, Water Sector, Logistics and
Transport, and Wheat, Flour Compensation Reform. The Bank is launching work on land
tenure as a constraint to private sector development and investment. Current studies include:
Employment and Skills Development, Housing PSIA, Urban Transport, Doing Business and
ICT, Land Markets and Growth, Moving Out of Poverty, Gender and labor market,
Decentralization and EU Neighborhood. The Bank is also providing strong support with
participatory approaches (Programmatic Economic and Sector Work-PESW) for Tertiary
Education, Public Administration Reform, Poverty, and Water.

29
ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 2, 2007)
Economic and financial data have been provided to the staff on a regular basis and most of
these data are also published or made available on publicly accessible web sites. Data
provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. The results of a data ROSC mission that took
place in January 2002 were published in April 2003 (Country Report No. 03/92). Morocco is
a SDDS subscriber since December 2005.
Real sector
The Statistical Office rebased national accounts from 1980 to 1998 and brought it in
conformity with the System of National Accounts 1993. The series of accounts for 1998-2005
were released on October 2006, and the preliminary accounts for 2006, on June 2007. The
revision of the consumer price index is also planned to be completed shortly, with updated
expenditure weights based on the results of the 2001 household budget survey. A consistent
monthly time series for the producer price index (with weights derived from the 1997 annual
survey) are available.
Government finance
Central government finance data are generally available with a few months lag. GFS data
reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook are not timely (the most recent data relate to
2005), and their coverage is limited to the budgetary central government, the Moroccan
pension fund, and the National Social Security Fund. The reporting of data for the central
government on a monthly or quarterly basis for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) is irregular. A technical assistance STA mission in February 1999 and a
follow-up mission in February 2000 advised on improvements in the compilation of both
central and local government statistics and assisted the government in establishing
appropriate consolidation procedures for a presentation of general government data.
Substantial progress has been made by the Accounting Office for the compilation of local
government data and their consolidation with central government budgetary data. The actual
use of those source data for general government compilation may require further clarification
of responsibilities between various directorates. Regarding the monthly Treasury’s
Expenditure and Revenue Table, the 2002 data ROSC mission recommended some
reclassifications (e.g., transfers and privatization), to maintain the Fonds Hassan II within the
coverage of the table, and, for dissemination purposes, to complement the table with more
details and data on financing and to improve the format of dissemination. A 2005 SDDS
assessment mission prepared an action plan for the production of data on the consolidated
general government operations.

30
Monetary and financial statistics
Bank Al-Maghrib disseminates monetary and financial and other macroeconomic statistics to
the general public primarily through its website (www.bkam.ma). The statistical part of the
site includes web-based versions of the Bank’s weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual
publications. The degree of detail in the breakdown of financial assets and liabilities by
resident institutional sector could be more extensive; at present, this problem is reflected in
the lack of precision in some of the monetary aggregates, including credit indicators.
Balance of payments
The 2002 data ROSC mission found that in general the balance of payments data are in line
with the concepts and definitions set out in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). However, further work is needed to implement certain recommendations on
scope, classification, and basis for recording. Thus, recent measures to exclude the effects of
changes in exchange rates from the valuation of transactions in reserve assets should be
continued, and transactions in foreign currency assets and liabilities of intermediary banks at
their correspondent banks should be excluded from transactions in reserve assets. Also, the
Office des Changes (OC) is planning to treat operators in free trade zones as residents.
Offshore banks located in Morocco should also be considered residents. The OC lacks a firm
legal basis for compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics, relying for the
time being exclusively on customs and exchange control data. These data are gradually to
become less available and too limited as exchange liberalization proceeds and as
participation of foreign investors in the economy increases. The OC has initiated legislative
measures that would give it access to statistical data collected directly from economic
operators, to record among other things, private foreign debt, and more generally the
international investment position. Furthermore, the data ROSC mission recommended the
introduction of quarterly surveys of enterprises and other agencies to improve the scope,
classification, and valuation of balance of payments transactions, in particular for goods for
processing, transportation services, and financial transactions. Since May 1998, the OC has
been publishing, on its internet site, monthly statistics on trade, tourism, private transfers, and
incoming foreign direct investment in accordance with the BPM5. The quality of balance of
payments statistics will significantly improve with the planned inclusion of free zones and
offshore banks located in Morocco or in its economic territory.
The latest BOP and IIP information received from Morocco, and published in the IFS, relates
to quarterly BOP data for 2005 and annual IIP data for 2005. Furthermore, Morocco reports
on a regular basis international liquidity data to STA for publication in the IFS.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Morocco
August 3, 2007
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data confirms the slowdown in inflation. Year-on-year consumer-price
inflation stood at 1.9 percent at end-June 2007, down from 3.3 percent at of end-December
2006, reflecting mostly the deceleration in the prices of transportation and communications
services.
3.
In June, Morocco issued ten-year Eurobonds in an amount of €500 million, the
first such issuance since 2003. The bonds were issued with a 55 basis point spread, and were
more than 3 times oversubscribed. The authorities used the proceeds to repay their
outstanding London Club debt ahead of schedule.
4.
On July 18, the Minister of Finance announced a package of capital account
liberalization measures, in line with staff recommendations. Measures include: (a) a
reduction in the surrender requirement on export proceeds; (b) the partial liberalization of
trade-related credit and payments; (c) the broadening of the range of transactions that can be
covered by currency hedging instruments, and the extension of the maximum maturity
allowed; and (d) the partial liberalization of outward portfolio investment by banks,
insurance companies and mutual funds, as well as foreign direct investment by firms.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August, 3, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Morocco
On August 3, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
Background
Macroeconomic conditions remain strong. Average growth has reached 5.4 percent per
annum since 2001, 3.4 percentage points higher than in the 1990s, reflecting the
ongoing diversification of the nonagricultural sector, and its increased resilience to
shocks. As a result, real per-capita income is on the rise and the unemployment rate
has started to decline. However, bad crop years still impact the overall economic
performance, as evidenced by the growth deceleration in 2007.
The current account is expected to record its seventh consecutive surplus in 2007,
thanks to strong remittances and tourism receipts. Increased foreign direct investment is
also boosting reserves, which reached US$21 billion at end-May 2007, significantly
higher than the stock of public external debt. In spite of a good export performance in
2006, trade in goods and services continues to result in a deficit. There are no
indications that the exchange rate of the dirham is misaligned.
Inflation increased to 3.3 percent in 2006, reflecting strong domestic demand conditions
and robust money growth. It subsequently slowed down during the first months of 2007
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
following the two-stage tightening of the monetary policy stance in 2006, also
suggesting that the deceleration in overall growth may be dampening domestic demand
pressures. However, money growth remains robust, driven by a pickup in credit to the
economy and external inflows, and asset prices have been increasing. In this context,
the central bank’s prudent monetary stance remains appropriate.
The public finances situation has strengthened. The fiscal deficit reached 2.1 percent of
GDP in 2006, and is expected to remain below 3 percent in the medium term. This good
performance reflects both the strong collection of all major taxes, thanks to the widening
of the tax base and the strengthening of tax administration, and the authorities’ efforts to
tackle the main sources of fiscal rigidities, including the wage bill.
Financial sector vulnerabilities have abated, with a drop in nonperforming loans and an
increase in provisioning. The recent increase in credit to the private sector demonstrates
the success of the authorities’ efforts to enhance financial intermediation. Important
progress has also been achieved in the area of financial supervision. In particular,
starting from June 2007, banks are required to comply with Basel II prudential
requirements.
The authorities intend to continue publishing all documents relating to the Article IV
consultation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed
Morocco’s remarkable economic progress in recent years, which demonstrates the
benefits of broad-based structural reforms. GDP growth has moved onto a higher
trajectory, inflation has been contained, foreign direct investment has increased, and
poverty and unemployment have been reduced significantly. Looking ahead, Directors
considered that Morocco will need to sustain and possibly improve upon its strong
performance to bring per capita income closer to that of emerging-market OECD
countries and further reduce unemployment and poverty.
Directors viewed Morocco’s current policy mix as appropriate, and noted that inflation
slowed in the first half of 2007. As the future path of inflation is subject to risks, it calls
for continued vigilance on the part of the central bank. In particular, the rapid growth of
credit to the private sector, the surge in foreign direct investment, and soaring asset
prices could offset the dampening effect of this year’s poor harvest on domestic demand
and inflation. Resurgence of inflation would warrant a further tightening of monetary
policy.
Directors commended the authorities for the recent improvement in the fiscal position,
which has played a key role in buttressing private sector confidence. It is important that
fiscal policy remains geared toward medium-term fiscal consolidation. Directors
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the implementation of their fiscal
strategy, with a few Directors observing that a more ambitious fiscal adjustment could be

3
appropriate in the current favorable environment. Reducing the public sector wage bill,
reforming the oil and food subsidy system, and accelerating tax reform will be key to
bring the government debt-to-GDP ratio closer to the average for emerging-market
OECD countries.
Directors noted with satisfaction that financial sector soundness has improved. They
welcomed the central bank’s decision to require banks to comply with Basel II prudential
requirements since June 2007.
Directors considered that Morocco’s exchange rate policy is consistent with external
stability, and that there are no indications that the dirham is misaligned. They supported
the authorities’ strategy of gradually opening the capital account, as well as the recently
announced capital account liberalization measures, and they welcomed the authorities’
request for Fund technical assistance in this area. Directors commended the central
bank’s ongoing efforts to improve its operational and forecasting capacity with a view to
eventually adopting an inflation targeting framework.
Directors welcomed the progress achieved in the area of bilateral and regional trade
liberalization. Further progress toward multilateral trade liberalization will be important to
minimize trade diversion.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Morocco will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri
Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
August 3, 2007
As recognized in last year’s Article IV consultation report, Morocco is reaping dividends
from sustained commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reform. This
year’s report confirms that in recent years, the country has entered a new phase of economic
performance, with higher growth trajectory, low inflation, strong fiscal and external
positions, sound and vibrant financial system, combined with high job creation, further
reduction in poverty, and improved confidence. Since 2001, real GDP growth has averaged
5.4 percent, resulting in gains in real GDP per capita of 4 percent annually, unemployment
declined to less than 10 percent for the first time in decades, and poverty was reduced
from 19 to 14 percent. Importantly, the economy’s resilience has been strengthened and its
vulnerability to weather conditions, although still significant, has declined. While agricultural
GDP declined in 2007 to its lowest level on record, following very unfavorable weather
conditions, its effect on overall growth was mitigated by stronger performance in
nonagricultural sectors. With the return of agricultural production to its long term average
level, real GDP is expected to rebound to close to 7 percent in 2008. Reflecting these
favorable developments and outlook, market confidence has improved, with declining
interest rates, buoyant stock market, increasing FDI, which is more diversified and less
dependent on privatization, and improved standing in the international markets as evinced by
the recent award of investment grade by a major rating agency and the success and very
favorable terms of the recent benchmark euro issue.
The authorities are encouraged by these achievements but are also aware of the remaining
challenges, including the need for achieving higher and sustained growth and further
reducing unemployment, in particular among the young and university graduates, as well as
poverty and regional and gender disparities. They remain committed to maintain and
accelerate the reform momentum and stay the course of prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
They will continue to improve the business climate by further streamlining regulations,
reducing red tape and combating corruption, improving public service delivery, and
strengthening and deepening the financial system in order to unleash the potential for higher
private sector investment and productivity gains, while remaining vigilant so as to preserve
the hard-won gains in macroeconomic and financial sector stability. In this regard, the policy
and institutional framework will be further modernized to make it consistent with the new
phase of economic performance and flexible enough to adjust to evolving conditions and
structural changes. Continued attention will also be given to upgrading human resources and
to developing and modernizing infrastructure in order to tap new sources of growth and
seize the new opportunities offered by the globalized economy and regional integration.
Consistent with progress in macroeconomic stability and the strengthened reform
momentum, this year’s streamlined consultation has appropriately focused on further fiscal
consolidation, strengthening of the financial sector, and greater integration into the world
economy. The authorities broadly concur with the thrust of staff assessment in these
important areas and welcome their recommendations. Moreover, staff and the authorities had

2
a useful exchange of views on potential risks to inflation arising from recent credit
expansion, following the ongoing recovery, as well as from increases in asset prices.
The operational independence recently gained by the central bank (BAM), the ongoing
modernization of its monetary framework as well as development of its policy instruments
and analytical and research capabilities, together with greater transparency, have significantly
improved its credibility and effectiveness. This was demonstrated in 2006 when the monetary
policy was tightened in response to the slight acceleration of inflationary pressures resulting
from the pass through of international oil prices. With tight bank liquidity and average
inflation during the first half of 2007 falling to 2.1 percent for headline inflation (1.6 percent
for core inflation) over the same period of last year, BAM is confident that recent easing in
inflationary pressures will be sustained. Continued vigilance and readiness to tighten the
monetary stance if warranted, supported by recent capital account liberalization measures,
should help keep inflation in check. BAM is aware of the potential risks that excessive credit
growth and asset valuations could pose to inflation and, together with improved monitoring
of the CPI, is carefully following credit and asset price developments and has called for
greater banks’ vigilance. Preparations are underway for a possible move to an inflation
targeting framework, and the High Level Regional Seminar on the topic organized last April
with Fund support, for which the authorities are grateful to management and staff, was an
excellent opportunity to review Morocco’s progress in light of other countries’ experience.
Fiscal consolidation is ahead of schedule. While staff and the authorities agreed, during last
year’s consultation, that a medium-term deficit target of 3 percent of GDP, to be achieved
in 2009, was consistent with fiscal sustainability, the fiscal deficit, excluding one-off factors,
declined to 2.5 percent GDP in 2006, reflecting strong revenue performance and a decline in
the wage bill as a result of the voluntary retirement program, and is expected to remain
within this limit in 2007. After increasing in 2005 following the settlement of arrears to the
government pension fund and the one-off cost of the voluntary retirement program, public
debt-to-GDP ratio resumed its downward trend, falling to 58 percent of GDP in 2006.
Progress in fiscal consolidation is all the more significant in an election year and attests to the
authorities’ firm determination to put fiscal policy on a sound footing. It also strengthens
their conviction that persistent pursuit of well-prepared structural fiscal reforms have large
pay-offs in strengthening the fiscal position, even if these are difficult to evaluate ex-ante and
are gained only gradually.
Progress toward fiscal sustainability is also timely since it provides room for monetary
policy, under its strengthened framework, to take responsibility for the task of
macroeconomic stabilization, allowing the Budget to focus on qualitative fiscal adjustment to
create the fiscal space needed to attend to key infrastructure and social needs and to absorb
potential shocks. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency, and efforts will continue
toward further reducing the public debt, strengthening the tax system, improving spending
efficiency, and increasing budget flexibility. Ongoing efforts at broadening the tax base,
including by improving tax and customs administration, enhancing transparency, and
reducing exemptions, will continue. Building on the success of the voluntary retirement
program, the authorities intend to continue with wage moderation and civil service reform to
increase productivity and improve service delivery, including through continued no-new-nethiring policy, reform and unification of the civil service statutes and paylines, linking

3
compensation and promotion to productivity, and redeploying and retraining to meet urgent
staffing needs in priority sectors and regions. Expenditure control system has been
overhauled, focusing on improved execution through simplification of procedures and
increased efficiency. Results-based budgeting has now been extended to 25 ministries
accounting for 75 percent of the Budget. A medium-term expenditure framework has been
developed and a pilot program is underway in 6 major ministries. The authorities attach high
importance to reforming the subsidy system and adopting an appropriate and well targeted
safety net. While unlikely to result in significant net budgetary savings, it would help
rationalize consumption, enhance efficiency, and provide for effective allocation of budget
support to the poor. The authorities are reviewing available options to address this issue, in
close consultation with social partners, consistent with their social strategy priorities as
embedded in the National Initiative for Human Development.
A vibrant, competitive, and resilient financial sector is essential for effective resource
mobilization and allocation. The stakes are even higher at a time of increased demand for
resources resulting from the ongoing recovery, and in the context of greater integration of
Morocco into the globalized economy and financial system. The authorities’ efforts at
strengthening financial sector stability, resilience, and efficiency, enhancing bank regulation
and supervision, restructuring public financial institutions, and deepening the financial
markets, in line with FSAP recommendations, are bearing fruit. Progress achieved over the
last 18 months in particular has been impressive. The new banking law has strengthened
BAM’s independence and powers in banking supervision, expanded its scope to new sectors,
including micro-credit and off-shore banks, and provided for improved coordination with
other financial sector supervisors, both domestically and internationally. BAM’s supervisory
resources were strengthened, and special emphasis was put on improving banks’
transparency, governance and internal risk assessment as well as on crisis prevention and
resolution. The creation of a credit bureau is a major step forward and should improve risk
assessment, strengthen competition, and improve consumer protection. Bank profitability and
capital adequacy has improved, and nonperforming loans were reduced to 10.9 percent
in 2006, down from 19.4 percent in 2004, while provisioning increased from 59 percent to
71 percent. In response to BAM’s efforts, in coordination with the banking association and
business representatives, aimed at increasing information disclosure, access to credit by
SMEs, one of the main weaknesses hindering their development, as discussed during last
year’s consultation, has improved significantly and its cost has declined, as confirmed by a
recent survey conducted by the central bank. Attention will therefore be refocused on
improving nonfinancial services to SMEs in terms of advice and assistance. Restructuring of
the two troubled public financial institutions has been virtually completed, their balance
sheets and profitability have improved, and the temporary exemption from some prudential
regulations has elapsed in June 2007 as scheduled, with the institutions now broadly in
compliance. An anti-money laundering law, consistent with best practices, has been adopted,
and a Financial Intelligence Unit will soon become operational.
The central bank has adopted a pragmatic and gradual approach for implementing Basel II
principles, with due consideration to Morocco’s financial sector structure and specific needs.
A risk based reporting system is in place starting from June, in conformity with pillar I, and
the second pillar will be implemented gradually, starting from June. Preparations are also
well advanced for adoption of international accounting standards (IFRS/IAS) in 2008, in

4
close consultation with the banking system, and the necessary regulations have already been
adopted. Ongoing work on the establishment of a postal bank system, benefiting from the
extensive network of postal offices, will significantly enhance access to banking services in
the remote and underprivileged areas. The FSAP update, scheduled for November, will be a
valuable opportunity to take stock of recent progress in strengthening the financial sector,
including recommendations of the 2002 FSAP, and should help identify avenues for further
financial sector reform.
The authorities are also preparing for greater integration into the world economy. BAM, in
particular, is actively preparing for the possibility of moving to a more flexible exchange rate
system, including by strengthening the monetary policy framework. Moreover, progress is
being made toward deepening of the forex market; recent authorization of forex bureaus
should contribute to the process. The central bank has also published the composition of the
currency basket of the peg, which so far had been kept confidential, which should help
improve transparency and exchange rate risk management. With nonresident transactions
virtually free from restrictions, recent measures liberalizing capital outflows and other capital
account transactions for residents are important additional steps toward capital account
convertibility, which should encourage more efficient use of resources and risk
diversification., while facilitating the task of liquidity management.
The authorities see bilateral and regional trade agreements as a complement, and not a
substitute for multilateral trade liberalization to which they remain fully committed. The
dismantling of tariffs with the EU and other partners is proceeding as scheduled and the
MFN tariffs are also being reduced to avoid trade diversion. Economic integration within the
Maghreb has been revived recently, thanks to the Managing Director’s laudable support and
personal involvement and staff’s helpful contributions. High level conferences organized
late 2005 and 2006, in cooperation with the IMF, have adopted important roadmaps for
regional trade facilitation and financial sector integration, respectively, drawing on best
international practices and experiences in the region, to be followed by a conference on
private sector development this fall. The authorities are firmly committed to redouble their
efforts aimed at advancing regional integration.
The authorities highly appreciate the excellent cooperation with the IMF. They reiterate their
gratitude to staff for their hard work, candid discussions, and useful and well-focused
analysis, and to management and Executive Directors for their invaluable advice and support.
