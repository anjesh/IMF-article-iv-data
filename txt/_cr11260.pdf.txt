STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 9, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis and the
February 2010 earthquake and the output gap has closed. The unemployment rate is at
historically low levels and the external current account surplus has narrowed despite
favorable terms of trade. Headline inflation moved above the 3 percent target in the first
half of 2011, although core inflation remained contained. Strong economic growth is
expected to continue through 2012.
Normalization of policies. The central bank appropriately accelerated the pace of policy
normalization in early 2011, helping bring inflation expectations closer to the target. A
more ambitious withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is also warranted as it would help reduce
domestic demand pressures and improve the macroeconomic policy mix. Staff
recommended aiming for a positive structural fiscal balance over the medium term, and
frontloading the consolidation.
Mitigating risks to financial stability. Continued monitoring is warranted to prevent a
buildup of leverage in the corporate and household sectors. In the context of heightened
risks of a resurgence of global financial stress, it also would be prudent to continue to
maintain high levels of liquidity in the banking system. In case concerns arise about the
speed of credit or asset price growth, it would be advisable to strengthen prudential
measures to maintain stability. As discussed in the companion FSSA report, efforts to
improve the regulatory and supervisory framework are welcome.
Structural challenges. The government has launched several initiatives aimed at boosting
productivity, including reducing the cost of doing business, increasing competition, and
supporting innovation. Improving labor market efficiency and raising labor force
participation should remain on the structural reform agenda going forward.

III. POLICY CHALLENGES
Chile’s main near-term policy challenge is managing successfully the transition to a more sustainable
growth path. The authorities remain committed to unwinding the crisis-related policy stimulus. Staff
suggested taking advantage of the favorable economic conditions to withdraw fiscal stimulus and
rebuild public sector assets faster than originally envisaged to help contain domestic demand growth
and keep inflation close to the target. Raising productivity growth is the key long-term policy goal.

Chile’s exports have been increasingly dominated by commodity products. The share of copper
exports in Chile’s total exports increased from 36 percent in 2003 to 57 percent in 2010. Copper
exports increased from US$7.8 billion to US$40.3 billion over the same period, and the ratio of

The rising importance of China as a trade partner
is reflected in the strong correlation between
growth trends in Chile and China. The correlation of
growth trends in the two countries (calculated using
Vahid-Engle’s common cycles method) has been very
high since the early 2000s. In contrast, Chile’s growth
trend has recently decoupled from those of the US
and Europe.

China is Chile’s main export partner. Chile’s share of
world copper exports almost doubled during 2003−10
to 44 percent. The top five markets for Chile’s copper
exports (China, Japan, South Korea, the United States,
and Italy) account for about two thirds of total copper
exports, with China alone accounting for 35 percent.
While the United States remains the main destination
for Chile’s non-mining exports, its share has declined
(from 51 percent to 41 percent for agricultural exports;
and from 23 percent to 12 percent for industrial
exports), China’s share has doubled over the same
period.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. The Advisory Committee’s Recommendations for Reforming the Fiscal Rule
The expert committee appointed by the Government to propose reforms to the fiscal rule
published its final report in June 2011. Its main recommendations are the following:


The cyclically adjusted balance (or structural balance) should reflect adjustments to fiscal
revenues only to the extent that they are affected by the economic cycle and by
deviations of copper and molybdenum prices from trend.



The structural balance should be calculated at the central government level. It should not
make cyclical adjustment for interest income or interest payments. It is recommended to
transition to a primary balance indicator in the future to eliminate the effects of
exogenous changes in interest rates, the procyclicality induced by the accumulation and
withdrawal of net financial assets, and to establish a more direct link with fiscal
sustainability analysis.



The fiscal rule should be complemented by a mechanism giving the fiscal authority scope
to implement countercyclical fiscal policy. The parameters governing the mechanism
would be set at the beginning of a new administration.



In the case of substantial changes to fiscal rule parameters that affect cyclically adjusted
revenues (such as long-term copper prices), the government should use partial
adjustment mechanisms to smooth the convergence towards a new long-run equilibrium.



The introduction of exit clauses would allow the administration to waive the requirement
to meet the rule strictly under exceptional circumstances. In case exit clauses are invoked,
it is necessary to define policies to ensure a return to the original fiscal path.



The fiscal authority should be held accountable for meeting the fiscal goals established in
the budget. To this end, the mid-year fiscal update report should discuss the causes of
any deviations from budget goals.



The fiscal target should be set at the beginning of each administration for the duration of
its term. The choice of the target should be guided by a Value-at-Risk approach that
accounts for contingent liabilities and factors that could affect fiscal assets in the future,
for example expected changes in the mines’ mineral concentration.



Establish an independent Fiscal Council to evaluate fiscal policy. The proposed functions
of the Council include evaluating the fiscal rule methodology; providing assumptions and
projections for variables required to calculate the cyclical adjustment; assessing fiscal
policy, the application of the fiscal rule, and medium-term and long-term sustainability;
issuing a report in case there are changes to the principles and methodologies governing
the budget; evaluating cases when exit clauses are invoked and the proposed strategy to
converge to the structural balance target; and issuing an opinion on the coverage of the
contingent liabilities report.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX I. CHILE - DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Chile’s external debt is relatively
low (Figure A1). Total external debt declined
slightly from 45 percent in 2008 to
43 percent in 2009. Debt levels are not very
sensitive to growth or interest-rate shocks,
but are somewhat sensitive to a depreciation
of the peso, as nearly all of Chile’s external
debt is denominated in foreign currency.
2.
Chile remained a net public
creditor in 2010. Relative to GDP, net central
government assets declined to 7½ percent
from 20¼ percent in 2008. Going forward,
high copper prices and robust GDP growth
would contribute to overall balance surpluses
and further improve the net creditor position
of the country. Gross government debt is low,
at 10½ percent of GDP in 2011. The public
debt sustainability analysis suggests that
under various shocks (Figure A2), the net
asset position of the government remains
comfortable in the medium term.
3.
The government’s report on
contingent liabilities suggests that they
are relatively small. According to the 2010
report, the net present value of contingent
liabilities amount to 4 percent of 2010 GDP

(or 0.03 percent of 2010 GDP on an annual
flow basis), of which deposit guarantees and
guarantees on the debt of state enterprises
account for 1½ percentage points.
4.
However, the report does not
include long-term projections of health
care or education expenditure. Health care
spending tends to rise very fast with aging, as
spending is heavily skewed towards the
elderly. In addition, health care inflation
tends to be much higher than CPI inflation. In
2009, public health care expenditure
amounted to 4 percent of GDP. Staff
calculations suggest that demographic
changes alone would increase annual public
health care spending to about 6 percent of
GDP in 2050, if per capita health care
spending for a given age group grows in line
with nominal GDP per capita. It could rise to
almost 9 percent of GDP, if annual per capita
health care spending growth for a given age
group exceeds per capita nominal GDP
growth by 1 percent.1

1

The calculations use UN projections for population
growth by age group and assume that relative health
care spending across age groups in Chile are the
same as in the United Kingdom during 2002/03.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 24, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Chile
On August 23, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chile1, on a lapse-of-time basis2.
Background
Chile’s economy has recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis and the February
2010 earthquake. Its resilience was underpinned by solid policy frameworks (including a
fiscal rule, inflation targeting and exchange rate flexibility), a sound banking system and
a strong policy response, supported by the large fiscal buffers. Growth rebounded to
5.2 percent in 2010, and is expected to pick up further to 6.5 percent in 2011 on the
back of strong domestic demand.
The slack in the economy has diminished and some constraints are emerging. The
unemployment rate has reached a historically low level and wage growth is picking up.
The rapid growth of domestic demand has fueled import growth, leading to a narrowing
of the current account surplus despite favorable terms of trade. While the nominal
appreciation of the peso has helped moderate the rise in consumer prices, headline
inflation moved above the 3 percent target in the first half of 2011, although core
inflation remained contained. Inflation is projected to increase in the second half of the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board
agrees that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

year as spare capacity diminishes further, before declining during 2012 as the effect of
interest rate increases passes through.
Credit conditions have eased significantly over the last twelve months, and commercial
and consumer loan growth has accelerated. External borrowing by non-financial
corporations has also increased significantly. Nonetheless, the ratios of corporate debtto-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and household debt-to-disposable income remain
broadly stable.
The authorities are withdrawing policy stimulus. Against a backdrop of rising inflation,
the central bank raised the policy rate from 0.5 percent in mid-2010 to 5.25 percent in
June 2011. The rapid increases in the policy rate in the first half of 2011 helped bring
down inflation expectations close to the official target. In January 2011, the central bank
announced a daily schedule of foreign exchange purchases to increase its gross
reserve by US$12 billion by year-end.
In early 2011, the government announced a reduction of public expenditure of about
0.3 percent of GDP, which would lower the 2011 structural fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of
GDP (0.5 percentage point lower than in 2010). The headline fiscal balance is expected
to move from a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to a surplus of 1.3 percent in 2011
on the back of high copper prices.
Despite a pickup in gross capital inflows, net capital inflows remain moderate. Rising
gross portfolio inflows have been largely offset by higher portfolio investments abroad by
domestic pension funds. In early 2011, however, large foreign borrowing by banks and
corporates resulted in a sizable surplus in the financial account. The peso appreciated
14 percent vis-à-vis the US dollar (although only 4 percent in real effective terms) in the
year to May. The strengthening of the peso is consistent with improvement in the terms
of trade and other fundamentals.
The financial soundness indicators are favorable. Banks are well capitalized, liquid, and
highly profitable. Stress tests suggest that banks’ capital ratios will remain above
minimum requirements even if economic conditions deteriorate and the cost of funding
increases. Non-performing loans declined in 2010 and banks have increased their
provision coverage. Despite the recent rise in external borrowing, banks’ foreign funding
remains moderate and there are no significant currency mismatches in the banking and
corporate sectors.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Chile, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:

3
Chile has recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis and strong growth is
expected to continue. Real GDP is expected to grow by 6.5 percent in 2011 on the back
of buoyant domestic demand. Consumption will benefit from strong employment growth
and firming wages, while large reconstruction spending will support investment.
Domestic risks to the outlook are mostly to the upside. The main downside risks are
related to the possibility of a sharp slowdown of economic activity in Asia, or an
intensification of global financial stress.
The key task of macroeconomic policies at the current juncture is to ensure a smooth
transition to a sustainable path for domestic demand. The output gap has closed and
some capacity constraints are emerging. The current account balance has narrowed,
despite favorable terms of trade, and is expected to deteriorate further as rapid import
growth continues to outpace export growth. Upward pressures on headline Consumer
Price Inflation (CPI) have eased in line with commodity price developments, but core
inflation is likely to continue to rise as spare capacity diminishes further.
The authorities have appropriately started to withdraw policy stimulus. Fiscal
expenditure growth moderated in 2010 (from very high levels during the crisis), and is
expected to be somewhat lower than GDP growth in 2011. The rapid pace of policy rate
increases in the first half of 2011 reinforced market confidence that inflation pressures
will be contained, bringing inflation expectations closer to the target. Staff agrees with
the authorities that the magnitude and timing of any future policy rate moves would
depend on domestic and global economic developments.
Staff urges the authorities to accelerate the pace of fiscal tightening and set more
ambitious medium-term fiscal targets. Rebuilding fiscal buffers at a faster pace than
currently envisaged would optimize the contribution of fiscal policy to macroeconomic
stability. In the near term, greater fiscal restraint would help guard against upside
inflation risks and improve the policy mix, reducing the risk of a surge in capital inflows
and easing pressures on the exchange rate. In the long term, larger fiscal buffers will
help preserve the government’s ability to respond to adverse shocks and prepare it to
deal better with challenges related to population aging. Staff recommends aiming for a
structural surplus in the medium term, and frontloading the adjustment.
Ongoing efforts to improve Chile’s fiscal policy framework are welcome. Staff supports
the thrust of the recommendations of the commission for improving the functioning of
Chile’s fiscal rule and its institutional framework. In particular, it supports the
recommendations to improve the calculation of the structural balance, reduce
unintended policy procyclicality caused by assumptions about long-term copper prices,
and add an explicit escape clause to the rule. Introducing an explicit link between
medium- and long-term budget targets would help improve the policymaking process.
Staff believes that the establishment of an independent fiscal council would strengthen
the framework and enhance the assessment of fiscal policy.

4
The flexible exchange rate system continues to serve Chile well. It has helped limit
speculative capital inflows and mitigate inflationary pressures. Staff analysis suggests
that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Foreign
exchange reserves at end-2011 would be fully adequate based on various reserve
measures and staff sees no case for extending the intervention program beyond the end
of the year.
Although financial soundness indicators remain strong, continued vigilance is necessary
to contain vulnerabilities. In the context of heightened risks of a rise in global financial
stress, it would be prudent to continue to maintain high levels of liquidity in the financial
system. In addition, continued monitoring is needed to prevent an excessive buildup of
leverage in the corporate and household sectors. In case concerns arise about the
speed of credit or asset price growth, prudential measures could be considered to help
maintain stability.
Staff supports the planned enhancements to the regulatory and supervisory framework
for the financial system discussed during the Financial Sector Assessment Program
update. Staff commends the authorities for advancing measures aimed at modernizing
Chile’s regulatory framework, including the establishment of a financial stability
committee, the strengthening of consumer protection in financial services, the adoption
of a commission structure for the supervisory agencies, and planned changes in the
Banking Law. As the Financial System Stability Assessment points out, it would also be
advisable to strengthen the legal basis for oversight of financial conglomerates, the
framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, and the
procedures for resolution of failed financial institutions.
Boosting productivity remains the key long-term challenge. Government initiatives to
reduce the cost of doing business, increase competition, support research and
development, and reform the corporate bankruptcy code are welcome. Another
important goal is increasing labor market efficiency and raising labor force participation.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with Chile is also available.
