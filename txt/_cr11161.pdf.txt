STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 11, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Near-term challenges: The rise in commodity prices and abundant global liquidity
pose risks for the inflation outlook and for macroeconomic policy more generally.
Maintaining the exchange rate band with the nominal rate at the most appreciated
end is complicating further macroeconomic management. A well coordinated policy
response comprising a tightening of the fiscal stance, greater exchange rate
flexibility and watchful monitoring of inflation pressures is warranted.
Fiscal sustainability: Under staff projections, the authorities’ fiscal plans would
result in a gradual decline in the fiscal deficit and a moderate but steady rise in the
public debt ratio (to 46 percent of GDP by 2016). The strategy is anchored on an
important tax reform proposal under consideration by the Legislative Assembly.
Although borrowing constraints are not likely to be binding in the near term, this
strategy entails risks over the medium term. More ambitious fiscal consolidation
targets centered on strict expenditure restraint would be advisable.
Monetary policy framework: The authorities have made progress in monetary
control recently, and reiterated their commitment to transition to an inflation
targeting regime. Delays in eliminating the exchange rate band could undermine the
credibility of the process.
Financial system: The financial system remains sound, although there is scope to
further strengthen supervision and regulation. Seeking approval of legislation
enhancing consolidated supervision, establishing a deposit insurance system and
strengthening the resolution framework should receive higher priority.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report

BACKGROUND
1.
Costa Rica weathered the global crisis
well, but its fiscal position weakened
considerably. The authorities’ response to the
crisis consisted of a supportive fiscal stance
and increased recourse to external resources,
(including through a 15-month precautionary
Stand-By arrangement with the Fund that
expired in July 2010). In the event, the output
loss was moderate, the balance of payments
adjustment was orderly, and the financial
system remained sound. The fiscal position,
however, deteriorated significantly as a result
of much lower-than-expected revenues and
higher-than-envisaged increases in current
expenditure.

2.
The administration that took office in
May 2010 has proposed a tax reform to
reduce the fiscal deficit. President Laura
Chinchilla is committed to improve law
enforcement, education, and infrastructure.
In January 2011, the administration submitted
a tax reform proposal to the Legislative
Assembly. The government has also taken
steps to improve tax administration.
3.
Exchange system and statistics. Costa
Rica has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. Its exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Data provision is
broadly adequate for surveillance.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic growth resumed in 2010,
while inflation remained subdued (Figure 1).
Following a 1.3 percent decline in 2009, real
GDP grew by 4.2 percent in 2010, initially led
by a recovery in inventories and public
consumption
and
later
by
private
consumption. Annual inflation increased from
4 percent in 2009 to 4.6 percent at endMarch 2011 (within the 4-6 percent official
target range). Core inflation also increased
moderately (to 4 percent). More recently, the
rise in international food and fuel prices has
pushed inflation expectations further above
the ceiling of the inflation target range.
5.
The external current account deficit
widened in 2010, but private capital inflows
recovered (Figure 2). Following a sharp
contraction of trade, export growth
rebounded in 2010 (6.5 percent) but was

outpaced by the growth rate of imports
(19.6 percent), raising the external current
account deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP
(2 percent in 2009). The surplus in the capital
account also increased significantly, as the
private sector deleveraging observed in 2009
ended, and net public sector inflows
increased (including a US$500 million loan
from the World Bank). As a result, the overall
balance of payments recorded a surplus of
over US$550 million (1½ percent of GDP)
during the year.

The exchange rate appreciated and
reached the bottom of the band in late 2010.
From mid-2009 to April 2011, the colón
appreciated by some 15 percent vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar (14 percent in real effective terms).
The colón reached the appreciated end of the
exchange rate band in December 2010, and
has remained within 2 percent of the floor
since then. The appreciation pressures
stemmed from higher private capital inflows,
and were supported by some portfolio
rebalancing
toward
colón-denominated
assets.

7.
The central bank adopted measures to
contain the appreciation pressures. Starting
in August 2010, it has lowered the policy
interest rate by a total of 250 basis points (to
6.5 percent); and in September 2010 it
launched a 16-month program of foreign
exchange purchases for a total of US$600
million (Figure 3). The cumulative purchases
under the program reached the announced
US$600 million target in April 2011.
8.
The authorities kept the inflation
target range for 2011 unchanged at 4–
6 percent, and adopted measures to enhance
monetary control. The increased inflation
risks led the central bank to postpone a
planned reduction in the inflation target to 3–
5 percent. The authorities also established a

9.
The fiscal deficit continued to widen
(Figure 4). Government spending continued
to increase in 2010, including in wages and
current transfers; and the consolidated public
sector deficit rose to 5½ percent of GDP
(4 percent in 2009). Public sector debt at end2010 reached 39.4 percent of GDP, up from
36 percent in 2008.

10. The banking sector remained resilient.
Although banks’ profitability declined (the

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
return on equity fell from 14.3 percent in
December 2008 to 8.3 percent in December
2010), the change was largely attributable to
the economic slowdown and other transitory
effects. Moreover, capitalization and liquidity
levels remain adequate. Nonperforming loans
have stabilized below 2 percent of total loans
(Figure 5). Credit growth to the private sector
remained subdued in 2010, but has started to
pick up in 2011. The share of bank loans and
deposits denominated in U.S. dollars

continued to decline, although the latter
remains above pre-crisis levels. (Figure 6).

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11. The economic outlook is generally
positive. Supported by the global recovery
and strong inflows of foreign direct
investment (FDI), real GDP is projected to
grow by 4.3 percent in 2011 and stabilize at
4½ percent over the medium term (somewhat
below pre-crisis rates). Higher global food and
fuel prices and the one-off impact of the tax
reform (expected to be approved in the
second half of 2011) would push inflation
above 7 percent in 2011; thereafter inflation
is projected to fall gradually to about
4 percent. The external current account
deficit is expected to increase to 4.8 percent
of GDP in 2011 and stabilize at about
5.2 percent over the medium term, and be
fully financed by strong FDI and other capital
flows.
12. Risks to the medium-term outlook are
somewhat tilted to the downside.
•
Risks to the growth outlook appear
balanced. Concerns about the strength of the
global recovery are subsiding, while lax global

6 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

financial conditions may induce further
capital inflows and fuel domestic demand and
activity growth.
•
Higher global commodity prices pose
risks for the inflation outlook. Continued
global price pressures could push headline
inflation further above the official target
range, which in the absence of corrective
policies could ignite second round effects and
keep inflation above the target range for a
prolonged period of time.
•
Fiscal policy’s capacity to respond to
adverse shocks will be limited. The
government’s fiscal strategy may result in a
moderate increase in the public debt to GDP
ratio, even after taking into account the
revenues from the tax reform. There are also
risks that the increase in public debt is higher
than envisaged.

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13. Focus of the consultation. Discussions with the authorities centered on the appropriate policy
mix at the current stage of the economic cycle; and medium-term reforms to: (i) ensure fiscal
sustainability; (ii) improve the effectiveness of monetary policy; and (iii) increase the resilience of
the financial system.

A. Near-term Policy Mix
14. There was broad agreement that
containing second round effects from higher
global food and fuel prices is a key policy
challenge. Although inflation has remained
subdued, staff highlighted the upward risks to
the inflation outlook stemming from lags in
the transmission mechanism and entrenched
backward-looking indexation, including for
public sector wages. Those factors
contributed to a large pass-through to
inflation in Costa Rica during the global price
shock of 2007–08. The authorities were of the
view that inflation risks would be lower this
time around because the surge in commodity
prices is taking place when there is still slack
in the economy.

Staff encouraged the authorities to
take prompt action to preserve the
significant gains on the inflation front
attained in recent years. Concretely, staff
recommended:
•
Restraining domestic demand growth
through further fiscal effort. Staff noted that
the fiscal outturn projected for 2011 (a
consolidated public sector deficit of about
5½ percent of GDP) was too expansionary
given the rebound in private domestic
demand. The authorities agreed, in principle,
and noted that a recent presidential directive
freezing employment levels in the central
administration and reducing operational
expenditures below the levels contemplated
in the budget would generate some savings.
However, additional expenditure reducing
measures were not regarded as viable.

remains in place, those inflows would put
pressure on the Central Bank’s sterilization
capacity and, in the end, result in higher
inflation and a real appreciation of the colón.

15. Continued capital inflows also present
risks to the inflation outlook. Lax global
financial conditions will remain a push factor
for capital flows to emerging economies. Staff
noted that, as long as the exchange rate band

•
Standing ready to raise interest rates
before core inflation increases. Staff
underscored that, if fiscal policy remains
loose, efforts to attain the inflation target
would place a considerable burden on
monetary policy. The authorities indicated
their intentions to evaluate the monetary
policy stance at the first signs of secondround effects on inflation. However, they

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
were of the view that those inflationary
pressures are not likely to materialize for a
while.
•
Allowing the nominal exchange rate
to appreciate. The authorities indicated they
remained committed to a more flexible
exchange arrangement, but considered that
conditions were not propitious for the
elimination of the exchange rate band, as it
could result in a large appreciation of the
colón. They argued that given current loose
global financial conditions, macroeconomic
policy tools may be insufficient to fend off a
large undershooting. Staff noted that the risk
of a large or prolonged undershooting of the
nominal exchange rate following the
termination of the band could be mitigated
through a tighter fiscal stance and sterilized

intervention. The authorities indicated their
preference for waiting until temporary
appreciation pressures subside rather than
doing away with the bands.
17.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
develop a strategy to reduce backwardlooking indexation practices. In particular, it
recommended to start using forward-looking
measures of inflation (such as the mid-point
of the official inflation target) to adjust prices
and wages set by the government (including
the minimum wage). The authorities agreed
that forward-looking measures would be
preferable but noted that any changes to
current practices would require building
consensus and, in some cases, changing
legislation, both of which were likely to take
some time.

B. Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability
18.
The mission developed a scenario
incorporating the government’s fiscal plans.
The scenario envisages an increase in
government revenues of 3 percentage points
of GDP in the next five years (mainly as a
result of the proposed tax reform and
improvements in tax administration, Box 1)
and an increase in expenditures of about
1 percent of GDP (reflecting planned spending
in the areas of security, education and
infrastructure 1). With these assumptions, the
consolidated public sector deficit (central
government deficit) would decline to about
4¼ percent of GDP (3¾ percent of GDP) by
2016, while the public debt to GDP ratio
would rise to about 46 percent of GDP. The
1 The Legislative Assembly is expected to approve a
constitutional amendment mandating an increase in
education spending to 8 percent of GDP by 2014 (about
1 percent of GDP above the current level).

8 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

authorities thought that the scenario made
too conservative assumptions regarding the
gains from the tax reform and were of the
view that the fiscal deficit would decline more
rapidly to debt stabilizing levels.
19.
The
mission
encouraged
the
authorities to adopt more ambitious fiscal
consolidation targets. It noted that Costa Rica
had been able to respond effectively to the
global crisis in large part because of the
significant fiscal consolidation it had
undertaken in the years prior to the crisis.
Staff argued that a priority of fiscal policy
should be to regain the capacity to respond in
a similar way to future adverse shocks by
placing the public debt to GDP ratio on a
downward path, and bringing the ratio below
35 percent of GDP over the medium term.
The authorities indicated that reducing the
public debt ratio to pre-crisis levels would be
challenging, but stressed that they will make

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
every effort to keep the public debt at
prudent levels, including through expenditure
restraint.

Box 1

Revenue Mobilization Strategy

The Costa Rican government has developed a strategy to increase tax revenues over the
medium term. The strategy comprises a tax reform and tax administration efforts, which the
authorities expect to yield 2½ percent of GDP and about 1 percent of GDP, respectively.
A comprehensive tax reform proposal was submitted to the National Assembly in
January 2011. The main measures contemplated in the bill include: replacing the 13 percent
sales tax for a 14 percent full-fledged value-added tax (VAT); a significant broadening of the
VAT base to include key services that

deposits and public debt securities
(from 8 to 15 percent); introducing a 15 percent tax rate on external payments made to toptier banks and other institutions; and raising selective taxes on vehicles and property transfer
taxes. The authorities’ estimates of the yield of the components of the proposed reform are
shown in the table.
The proposed tax reform would improve the efficiency and equity of Costa Rica’s tax system.
Adoption of the proposed measures would require modernizing the method to determine the
VAT liability, bringing it in line with international practices. It would also increase the equity of
the system by eliminating exemptions currently benefiting the higher income segments of the
population. The authorities estimate that 60 percent of the additional revenue would be
generated from households in the top 20 percent income bracket.
The government’s strategy also contains measures to reduce tax evasion. Planned actions
include increasing tax compliance controls by 20 percent, fostering the use of debit and credit
card transactions, establishing reference values for a set of imported products, and broadening
the tax regime for small contributors.

Risks to Fiscal Sustainability

Following an important decline through 2008, Costa Rica’s public debt to GDP ratio rose in
the aftermath of the global crisis. From end-2008 to end-2010, the public debt to GDP ratio
increased by about 4 percentage points, to near 40 percent.
The policies envisaged by the current government would not stabilize the public debt to GDP
ratio. The staff’s scenario discussed with the authorities, which assumes that the tax reform is
approved in the second-half of 2011, would result in an increase in the public debt to GDP ratio
of more than 6 percentage points between 2010 and 2016. Even though the scenario assumes
significant increases in tax collection, the expenditure path would leave the fiscal deficit above
debt-stabilizing levels.2
The risks that the public debt to GDP ratio rises faster than in the baseline scenario are high.
Results from a stochastic public debt sustainability exercise, based on an estimated fiscal
reaction function, show that, by end-2016, the median public debt ratio could be in the range
between 50 percent of GDP (panel estimates) and 57 percent (time series estimates). These
results illustrate the challenges that the authorities will confront to maintain the public debt
close to the deterministic trajectory of the baseline scenario under their planned fiscal policies.

The authorities’ estimate of the revenue yield of the tax reform is higher than staff’s (see Box 1),

reducing the deficit to debt-stabilizing levels.

10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
20. There was agreement that the
approval of the proposed tax reform was
critical for fiscal sustainability. A significant
increase in government revenues is necessary
to contain debt dynamics, given the planned
expenditure path (Box 2). Staff noted that the
revenue-enhancing emphasis of the proposed
reform was appropriate given Costa Rica’s
relatively low revenue-to-GDP ratio. The
expected broadening of the tax base and the
emphasis placed on improving the equity of
the tax system also are commendable. While
the tax reform is facing some opposition in
the Legislative Assembly, the authorities
expressed confidence about its approval,
highlighting that the private sector and
political parties are cognizant of the need to
increase public revenues.
Public Sector Debt Trajectory
60

In percent of GDP

21.
A strategy to reduce government
expenditures in percent of GDP over the
medium term is necessary. Although capital
expenditure has remained broadly stable as a
share of GDP in recent years, current
government expenditures, including the wage
bill, have increased sharply, and have reached
levels that are high compared to countries of
similar level of income and government
revenues. The mission noted that the recent
directive to freeze vacancies and reduce
operational expenditures (vis-à-vis the
budget) in 2011 was an important first step,
but stressed that it would not be sufficient to
reduce current expenditures’ share in GDP.
Staff argued that a medium-term expenditure
framework that keeps current expenditure
growth below the (projected) growth rate of
nominal GDP for several years was necessary
to lower the share of current expenditures to
GDP and regain fiscal space.

22.
The mission welcomed the planned
improvements in tax administration. Staff
and the authorities concurred that there is
substantial scope to strengthen tax
administration and reduce tax evasion, and
that the improvements in these areas would
contribute importantly to the fiscal
consolidation strategy. In this connection,
staff welcomed the adoption of a new

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
information system by the tax administration
agency, which would help increase
information crosschecks and tax compliance
controls. Staff estimated that improved tax
administration would generate additional
revenues of about ½ percent of GDP over the
next five years. The authorities, however,
considered that the gains would be
significantly larger.

23.
Other reforms to strengthen the
fiscal frameworks also were discussed. There
was broad agreement that, once fiscal
consolidation was firmly underway, it would
be desirable to develop fiscal rules with
countercyclical elements. Reforms aimed at
lessening budget rigidities, such as revenueearmarking, would also be desirable.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
24. The
mission
encouraged
the
authorities to speed up the transition to an
inflation targeting framework. The mission
acknowledged the important steps taken in
recent years to modernize the monetary
policy
framework
(including
the
announcement of an official inflation target
and the widening of the exchange rate band).
However, it noted that a prolonged transition
process risks losing credibility. To accelerate
the transition, staff recommended:
•
Increasing exchange rate flexibility.
Staff underscored that moving toward a more
flexible exchange rate regime, preferably by
eliminating the band, would clarify the
primacy of the inflation objective, help anchor
inflation expectations, and enhance the
transmission mechanism between policy rates
and market rates. The authorities restated
their intention to eliminate the exchange rate
band before the adoption of full-fledged
inflation targeting, but considered that the
present juncture was not appropriate to take
such step (¶15).
•
Phasing out the interest rate corridor.
There was agreement that the interest rate
corridor established in October 2010 had
enhanced monetary control, and that it would

12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

be advisable to deepen the reform by
adopting a single policy rate. In line with this,
the authorities indicated that they plan to
narrow the corridor for short-term interest
rates and establish the mid-point of such
corridor as the benchmark policy rate.
•
Recapitalizing the central bank. Staff
argued that a stronger capital base for the
central bank would help insulate monetary
policy decisions from balance sheet
considerations. The authorities indicated that
they were examining options to recapitalize
the central bank but considered that fiscal
space in the short run was too tight to make
significant progress in this area.
25. Notwithstanding
the
recent
appreciation, the exchange rate seems
broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. Exchange rate assessments
based on the standard methodologies suggest
an overvaluation of the colón in the order of
2–6 percent, well within the margin of error.
Favorable prospects for foreign direct
investment, which are expected to cover the
non-interest current account deficit over the
medium term, are key for this result.
Nonetheless, staff underscored that a fiscal
consolidation
strategy
centered
on

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
expenditure restraint would help mitigate the
risks of an excessive appreciation of the
colón. In addition, there was agreement that
continued efforts to reduce the costs of doing
business and increase efficiency would be
beneficial for competitiveness.

D. Financial Sector
26. While acknowledging that the financial
system had weathered the crisis well, the
mission discussed enhancements to banking
sector supervision and regulation. It noted
that the legal framework remained weak and
that progress in implementing the
recommendations from the 2008 FSAP had
been slow (Box 3). The mission stressed the
importance of seeking congressional approval
of the legislation submitted in 2004 and 2010
to enhance consolidated supervision,
establish a deposit insurance system and
strengthen the bank resolution framework. It
noted that, while the financial system is
sound, the measures were necessary to
reduce risks to financial stability, as they
would equip the regulatory and supervisory
authorities with the tools and legal
protections to take appropriate actions on a
timely basis if a financial institution faces
difficulties. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to seek approval of the
legislation, but indicated that the tax reform
had the highest priority.
27. The mission welcomed progress to
introduce
risk-based
supervision.
It
encouraged the authorities to supplement
those efforts with enhancements of the
regulatory framework (e.g., issuing norms on
liquidity, operational, country and market
risks) and further strengthen soundness
classification. It also suggested that the
authorities undertake periodic stress tests of

financial institutions. The mission welcomed
the plans to monitor systemic risk and
introduce

III
capital
and
liquidity buffers.

28. The authorities were encouraged to
explore ways to level the playing field
between public and private banks. Staff
noted
that
long-standing
regulatory
distortions of the Costa Rican financial system
have allowed public banks to benefit from
state guarantees on all liabilities, and be
exempt from taxation on their dollardenominated deposits and from contributions
to the development finance system. In
addition, the appointment of their directors
falls outside the purview of the
Superintendency of Financial Institutions
(SUGEF).

Main Recommendations of the 2008 FSAP Update - Status

Principal Recommendations
(By area, excluding financial sector development issues)
A. Prudential Supervision and Regulation
Amend the legal framework in order to provide protection for supervisors while
performing their responsibilities in good faith.
Introduce pertinent laws for the Superintendency of Banks (SUGEF) to be able to supervise
banking groups (including offshore structures) on a consolidated basis. Upon the approval
of such laws the SUGEF should issue without delay operational regulations to ensure its
rapid implementation by the banking system. 2/
Increase supervisory focus on banks’ own risk management systems, in part through
incentives for banks to classify and provision correctly their loans. 3/
Broaden the base of reserve requirements to include short term lines of credit.
Apply higher risk weight ratios to unhedged borrowers for capital adequacy purposes.
The SUGEF should issue a new regulation enhancing the complementarities of the work of
bank supervisors and external auditors.
The National Council of Financial Sector Supervision (CONASSIF) should take into account
IFRS when issuing new regulations. 4/
Modify the funding arrangements for supervision, in line with international best practices.
B. Crisis Management and Bank Crisis Resolution Framework

allow the SUGEF to take an appropriate range of remedial actions and supervisory
decisions.
Improve the early warning system, to allow the adoption of remedial actions in a timely
PI
manner.
NI
Eliminate the emergency loan window and improve the design and operational
arrangements of the ordinary rediscount window, including by establishing prudential
limits in terms of regulatory capital. 5/
Establish a deposit insurance scheme, in line with international best practices.
PL
Amend the bank resolution legal framework to include purchase and assumption type

Enable voluntary, extra-judicial corporate restructuring agreements.
FI
1/ FI: fully implemented; PI: partially implemented; PL: pending legislation; NI: Not implemented.
2/ The draft law on consolidated supervision was submitted to the Legislative Assembly in 2004. The
Superintendency of banks has issued several regulations.
3/ Regulation on overall risk management (approved on June 25, 2010).
4/ Regulation on information of entities and financial conglomerates (last updated on June 15, 2010).
5/ The BCCR strengthened its emergency liquidity toolbox during the crisis by introducing high-access
liquidity lines and improving the design of repo operations. However, the emergency lender of last resort
window has not been discontinued and repo operations are not linked to prudential limits in terms of
regulatory capital.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29. Costa Rica’s recovery is firmly
underway and its economic outlook is
favorable. Real GDP is expected to grow by
more than 4 percent in 2011 and by about
4½ percent over the medium term, supported
by sizable and stable flows of foreign direct
investment. However, a key challenge is to
adopt more flexible and forward-looking
macroeconomic policies.
30. The rise in world food and fuel prices
and lax global financial conditions will
present challenges. Higher commodity prices
will put upward pressures on inflation and
impact more severely the poorer segments of
the population, while abundant global
liquidity will continue to induce private capital
inflows. A coordinated policy response to
mitigate the risks posed by these external
factors would be advisable. Such response
should comprise a tighter fiscal stance than
the one contemplated in the 2011 budget, the
elimination of the exchange rate band, and
readiness to tighten monetary policy before
second round effects of the price shock
materialize. Introducing forward-looking
inflation measures in the indexation
mechanisms controlled by the government
also would be helpful.
31. Given the external environment, the
fiscal stance envisaged for 2011 is too
expansionary. Even assuming that the tax
reform is approved and starts yielding
revenues in 2011, the consolidated public
sector deficit is projected to close the year at
about 5½ percent of GDP, broadly the same
as in 2010. The sustained recovery of private
domestic demand and the sizable increase in
public debt since 2008 would have called for a

significant withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, as
was recommended previously.
32. The proposed tax reform is sound and,
if approved, will be key to safeguard fiscal
sustainability. Broadening the tax base and
improving the equity of the tax system are
strong elements of the proposed reform.
Planned
efforts
to
strengthen
tax
administration also are appropriate and
should be supplemented with mechanisms to
make them permanent.
33. It would be advisable to set more
ambitious targets for fiscal consolidation
centered on expenditure restraint. The
government’s fiscal program may result in a
gradual rise in the public debt ratio and
carries risks. The authorities are encouraged
to reconsider their fiscal program and set
targets aimed at rebuilding the fiscal space
used in recent years. These efforts should be
anchored on a path that lowers the share of
government expenditures (including the wage
bill) on GDP.
34. The upgrading of the monetary policy
framework should receive higher priority.
Costa Rica’s transition to an inflation targeting
framework is taking too long and may
compromise the central bank’s credibility.
Maintaining the exchange rate close to the
appreciated end of the exchange rate band
despite continued capital inflows could raise
doubts about the primary objective of
monetary policy and the authorities’
commitment to transition to inflation
targeting. The authorities are encouraged to
consider an opportune time to abandon the
exchange rate band and deploy an effective
communication strategy to establish the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

COSTA RICA 2011 Article IV Report
primacy of the inflation target. Plans to
narrow the corridor for short-term interest
rates and establish the mid-point of such
corridor as the policy rate are welcome.
35. Although the Costa Rican banking
system remains sound, legislation to further
strengthen supervision and prudential
regulations has not yet been approved. The
authorities are encouraged to seek support
for the approval of the bills submitted in

16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

recent years to enhance consolidated
supervision, establish a deposit insurance
system and strengthen the resolution
framework. In addition, the authorities should
explore ways to level the playing field
between public and private banks.
36. It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

1/ The public sector comprises the central government, decentralized entities, public enterprises (excluding ICE), and the central bank.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency denominated debt;
and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

VII
Exchange Rate Arrangement: Costa Rica’s current exchange arrangement is
classified as other managed arrangement. Since October 2006, the de jure exchange rate
arrangement has been a crawling band with an increasing width. The ceiling and floor of
the band have been adjusted several times, most recently in January 2009, when the crawl
rate of the band’s ceiling has been set at 0.20 colones (previously 0.06 colones) per
business day. The floor of the band has been flat since July 2008. As of May 11, 2011,
the intervention buying and selling exchange rates were 500.00 and 679.65 colones per

3
U.S. dollar respectively. Costa Rica maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation: Concluded on September 23, 2009 (Country
Report No. 09/303). The next Article IV consultation will take place in accordance with
the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.
IX.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs Assessments: The FSAP took place in October
and December 2001, and was updated in February 2008. A data ROSC took place in
July 2001 with a reassessment in April 2009. A fiscal ROSC took place in April 2006.

II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
UNDER THE JMAP
1.
The IMF’s Costa Rica team led by Mr. Piñón (mission chief) has met on
various occasions with the World Bank’s Costa Rica team led by Mr. Lopez (lead
economist and PREM sector leader) to discuss macroeconomic challenges, identify
macrocritical structural reforms, and coordinate the two teams’ work for the period
March 2011–February 2012.

2.
The teams have agreed that Costa Rica’s main macroeconomic challenges
are to safeguard fiscal sustainability, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy,
maintain financial sector stability and enhance competitiveness.
3.
The teams have also discussed the risks to Costa Rica’s inflation outlook
stemming from higher global commodity prices, and the appropriate policy mix to
contain second round effects.
4.
Based on the shared assessment of macroeconomic challenges, the teams
have identified 4 structural reform areas as macrocritical:


Fiscal consolidation. Costa Rica’s fiscal position deteriorated due to larger than
expected revenue losses during the global crisis and higher-than-anticipated
increases in current spending. The priority now is to roll back the fiscal expansion of
recent years and limit the risks to fiscal sustainability. Approval of a tax reform is
critical, but there is also a need for a strategy to reduce current spending as a percent
of GDP.



Monetary policy framework. The transition to inflation targeting and greater
exchange rate flexibility should be accelerated in order to lock in low inflation
achieved recently and limit currency appreciation pressures.



Financial sector stability. Progress has been made in adopting risk-based financial
supervision. Looking ahead, approval of legislation on consolidated supervision,
deposit insurance and banking resolution will be critical to bring the regulatory
framework up to international best practices.



Competitiveness. The country is making progress in addressing issues of universal
coverage and quality in secondary education, and is seeking to develop its scientific and
technological capabilities, which would help position Costa Rica as a knowledge
economy. There is also a high level commitment to improving the business environment
and removing burdensome red tape. Given the sizable investments required to upgrade
infrastructure and a tight fiscal situation, the government is seeking to create the
institutional conditions to engage the private sector in financing, construction and
management of infrastructure projects (public-private partnerships). The government

5
has already begun to open the insurance, electricity and telecommunication sectors to
private investments.
5.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:



Fiscal consolidation. The Fund will continue to provide policy recommendations on
macro-fiscal issues, including the overall strategy of fiscal consolidation and the tax
reform. The government has also requested World Bank technical assistance to
support the use of public-private partnerships as a vehicle to finance key
infrastructure projects.



Monetary policy framework. The Fund will continue to provide policy
recommendations regarding the transition to inflation targeting and a more flexible
exchange rate regime.



Financial sector stability. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate as necessary in
assisting the country in implementing the FSAP recommendations.



Competitiveness. The Bank will continue to work with the government on policy
recommendations in key areas. In terms of lending, the government has requested a
project in higher education that is currently under preparation. The government has
also requested technical assistance from IFC Advisory services to improve the
investment climate.

6.
The teams have the following requests for information from their
counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semiannually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of
macroeconomic policies and prospects.

7.
The attached table lists the teams’ separate and joint work programs during
March 2011–February 2012.

III. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
Recent activities. The IBD´s loan portfolio in Costa Rica has 8 sovereign
guaranteed operations in execution, with an approved amount of US$798.6 million. The
available amount for disbursements is US$697.3 million (87.3% of the approved), and is
concentrated in the areas of Transportation (49.0%), Energy (33.6%) and Water and
Sanitation (11.7%). The average age of the operations is 4.9 years. The IDB still has
three operations pending legislative ratification: a program for water and sanitation, a
cantonal road network program, and a sustainable tourism program. Disbursements of
sovereign guaranteed operations during 2011 are expected to reach around US$102.5
million, concentrated in the areas of Energy (57.1%), Transportation (24.4%) and Reform
and Modernization of the State (18.0%). Currently, there is one operation expected to be
approved by the IDB during 2011, which is the program of Citizen Security
(US$132.4 million).
2.
Future plans. The IDB is currently preparing the Country Strategy 2011–14,
which is expected to be approved by June 2011. During the strategy period, the IDB
intends to be involved mainly in the areas of Transportation, Energy, Citizen Security,
Social Protection and Innovation.

IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES1
As of May 9, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, although it has some
shortcomings in the areas of national accounts, price, government finance and balance of
payments statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts are compiled generally in accordance with the
System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993). However, the reference year for the
series at constant prices (1991) is outdated. Estimation of rentals for owner occupied
dwellings should be improved. Accounting depreciation is used instead of estimating
consumption of fixed capital. Double deflation method is not applied. Changes in
inventories are obtained as residuals and the Chow Lin (without indicator) method is
applied for benchmarking quarterly value added of activities, comprising a third of GDP.
Non-observed/informal activities are not properly covered.
Price Statistics: The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI), in general, employs
concepts and definitions from the 1993 SNA and the international CPI manual. However,
the CPI lacks a market basket component to measure the cost of owner-occupied housing.
Also, the index only covers urban households located in greater San Jose, which
comprises approximately 46 percent of the total population and 72 percent of the urban
population of Costa Rica. Individual price index data are not generally verified against
similar data from other databases such as the producer price index (PPI) and agricultural
price indices. Nevertheless, atypical movements in the data are investigated and corrected
when necessary.
Except for being compiled only by product aggregations and not by economic activity as
well, the PPI is compiled based on concepts and definitions from the 1993 SNA and the
international PPI Manual. However, the weights, the establishment sample, and the
product sample for the PPI that were introduced in 2000 are based on 1997 sales data.
Therefore, the index needs updating. A comprehensive assessment of the source data is
being carried out, and is guiding the production of new source data to update the PPI and
the national accounts. It is expected that the index will be updated in 2011.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS
generally follow the guidelines of the GFSM 1986. However, financing data and
government debt, which use national concepts that combine instruments and holders, are
not in accordance with international standards. A migration path to the GFSM 2001 has
been adopted in the context of the GFS harmonization project for Central America,
Panama, and the Dominican Republic. Monthly fiscal statistics are only compiled and
1

Incorporates the assessment of Costa Rica’s macroeconomic statistics provided by the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) published in February 2010.

10
disseminated for budgetary central government, while annual statistics are compiled and
disseminated for the entire public sector and its subsectors. The place of issue (Costa
Rica or abroad) criterion is followed to classify domestic and foreign debt, instead of the
internationally recommended residency criterion. Fiscal data discrepancies among
national compilers on particular items are not regularly reconciled, although large
fluctuations or discrepancies are investigated. Fiscal statistics are not regularly reconciled
with monetary statistics, or other macroeconomic statistics.
Monetary Statistics: Costa Rica’s monetary statistics are broadly in line with the
methodology of the MFSM. Classification/sectorization follows the MFSM with some
exceptions. The social security system accounts are not presented within the central
government, but aggregated with other public sector accounts. Some financial assets and
liabilities are not disaggregated by economic sector. Accrued interest is not classified
together with its underlying instrument.
Balance of Payments: The balance of payments statistics broadly follow the concepts
and definitions in the BPM5. While generally adequate and derived from sound
collection programs, source data are incomplete to compile some services in the current
account, financial transactions of the nonfinancial private sector, and remuneration of
employees. Foreign direct investment transactions and positions are valued on a cash
basis instead of the recommended accrual basis. Services are recorded at the time the
service is provided. While other income transactions are recorded on an accrual basis,
interest on public external debt is recorded on the due date; no adjustment is made to
convert interest to accrued values. Transfer prices in some cases are not converted to
market prices.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 31, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Costa Rica and Ex-Post Evaluation of Exceptional
Access under the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement
On May 25, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation and Ex-Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access under the 2009 Stand-By
Arrangement with Costa Rica.1
Background
Costa Rica’s economy weathered the global crisis well and its recovery is firmly underway.
Following a 1.3 percent decline in 2009, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by
4.2 percent in 2010, initially led by a recovery in inventories and public consumption and later by
private consumption. Annual inflation increased from 4 percent in 2009 to 4.6 percent at endMarch 2011 (well within the 4-6 percent official target range).
Although the external current account deficit widened in 2010, the surplus in the capital account
increased by more, as the private sector deleveraging observed in 2009 ended and net public
sector inflows increased. As a result, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of
1.5 percent of GDP during the year. This surplus, together with some portfolio rebalancing
toward local currency-denominated assets, pushed the colón to the appreciated end of the

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
exchange rate band in late 2010. In response, the central bank lowered the policy interest rate
and launched a program of foreign exchange purchases.
The fiscal deficit continued to widen during 2010. Tax revenues did not recover the levels
observed prior to the crisis, and government spending, especially wages and current transfers,
continued to increase. As a result, the consolidated public sector deficit rose to 5.5 percent of
GDP, from 4 percent in 2009. Public sector debt at end-2010 reached 39.4 percent of GDP.
Financial sector indicators are strong, with adequate levels of liquidity and capitalization. Credit
to the private sector remained sluggish in 2010 but began to pick up in 2011. Financial
dollarization has resumed a declining trend.
Supported by the global economic recovery and strong inflows of foreign direct investment
(FDI), real GDP is projected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2011 and stabilize at 4.5 percent over the
medium term. Inflation is projected to rise above 7 percent in 2011 pushed by higher world
commodity prices and a one-off impact from the tax reform (assumed to be approved in the
second half of 2011), but is expected to fall gradually thereafter. The external current account
deficit would increase to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2011 and stabilize at about 5.2 percent of GDP
over the medium term, and is expected to be fully financed by FDI and other capital flows.
While the economic outlook is generally positive, some downside risks remain. These stem from
the rise in commodity prices and abundant global liquidity, which pose risks for the inflation
outlook and for macroeconomic policy more generally, particularly if the exchange rate band is
maintained. Risks to the outlook could also arise from a weaker fiscal position, as the
authorities’ fiscal program would result in a gradual decline in the fiscal deficit and a moderate
but steady rise in the public debt ratio.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Costa Rica’s economic recovery and its favorable outlook, and
stressed the importance of gearing macroeconomic policies toward containing domestic
demand pressures. Given the challenges presented by high world commodity prices and
significant capital inflows, Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten fiscal policy, move
toward a more flexible exchange rate, and pursue a vigilant monetary policy.
Directors stressed the importance of safeguarding fiscal sustainability. They welcomed the tax
reform proposal submitted to the Legislative Assembly, underscoring that its approval will be
key. Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to broaden the tax base and improve the equity
of the tax system, as well as the planned actions to strengthen tax administration. Looking
ahead, they advised the authorities to pursue a more ambitious medium-term fiscal
consolidation strategy to help rebuild fiscal buffers. Directors pointed out that the authorities’

3
fiscal program could result in a gradual rise in the public debt ratio, and stressed the need to
exercise further expenditure restraint, particularly on current spending.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. They considered that upgrading the monetary policy framework and completing
the transition to an inflation targeting regime should be key priorities. They welcomed the
authorities’ plans to narrow the corridor for short-term interest rates, and encouraged them to
develop an effective communications strategy to address a move away from the exchange rate
band and make the inflation target the centerpiece of the monetary policy framework. Directors
agreed that recapitalizing the Central Bank is essential to bolstering its credibility.
Directors concurred that the banking system remains sound, and encouraged the authorities to
continue strengthening supervision and prudential regulations. They stressed the importance of
securing approval of the legislation to enhance consolidated supervision, establish a deposit
insurance system, and strengthen the resolution framework. Directors encouraged the
authorities to press ahead with implementing the remaining Financial Sector Assessment
Program recommendations.
Directors welcomed that the authorities’ economic program, supported by the precautionary
Stand-By Arrangement of 2009-10, had successfully met its immediate objective of supporting
macroeconomic stability at a time of global financial turmoil. At the same time, they noted that
the fiscal position had deteriorated, particularly through the enactment of permanent, rather than
temporary measures, and that progress in advancing structural reforms was slow during the
program period.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Luis Liberman, Minister of Finance Fernando Herrero, Central Bank President Rodrigo
Bolaños, other senior officials, members of congress, academics and representatives of the
private sector. At the end of the visit, Marco Piñón, chief of the IMF mission, issued the
following statement:
“Economic activity in Costa Rica recovered in 2010 led by private consumption, while
inflation remained within the official target range. With the normalization of external trade,
the current account deficit widened, but was comfortably financed by large foreign direct
investment (FDI) and other private capital inflows. Reflecting this, the exchange rate
appreciated and moved to the limit of the exchange rate band, despite significant foreign
exchange intervention. In addition, the deficit of the combined public sector increased to
5.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), owing to subdued tax revenues and higher
government expenditures.
“The medium-term economic outlook for Costa Rica is broadly positive, underpinned by the
global recovery and robust FDI inflows. Real GDP growth is expected to hover around
4–4.5 percent in 2011 and over the medium term, while inflation is projected to increase in
2011, pushed by higher global food and fuel prices, but to decline in subsequent years. FDI
and other private capital flows are likely to remain strong.
“Near term risks are mainly related to a higher than expected impact of international food
and fuel prices on inflation. In the medium and long term, the key challenge is to lower the
fiscal deficit significantly. In this regard the mission considers that the draft tax reform
recently sent to Congress is key to secure a higher revenue base that increases the country’s
capacity to respond to adverse shocks. However, efforts on the revenue side will need to be
supplemented by prudent expenditure policies, including through a medium-term framework
to help reduce the share of current government spending over GDP.
“The mission encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening the monetary policy and
financial supervision frameworks. Approval of bills before Congress aimed at enhancing

2

consolidated supervision, establishing a deposit insurance system, and strengthening the
banking resolution framework would help bring Costa Rica’s financial regulation in line with
best international practices, and to protect the stability of the financial system.
"The IMF will continue its close policy dialogue with the authorities of Costa Rica. Upon its
return to Washington, staff will prepare a report to the IMF’s Executive Board, which will
serve as a basis for a Board discussion in late May.”

Statement by Mr. Perez-Verdia and Mr. Gramajo-Marroquin on Costa Rica
Executive Board Meeting
May 25, 2011

We would like to thank staff for their comprehensive set of papers and for the constructive
dialogue with our authorities. We broadly agree with staff’s assessment and
recommendations.
Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access Under the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement.
1.
Although we cannot evaluate outcomes had a program not been in place, we can
ascertain that the program was successful in helping the country maintain confidence in the
government´s response to the crisis by increasing existing liquidity buffers. In this context,
we believe the program helped Costa Rica take advantage of its strong fundamentals to
mitigate the adverse effects stemming from the global crisis and preserve financial stability.
2.
The policy mix during the crisis was adequate. A tighter monetary stance and an
expansionary fiscal policy (using fiscal spaces created before the crisis) helped Costa Rica
face the economic slowdown while safeguarding confidence. As a result, external risks did
not materialize and the economy began to recover quickly after the crisis. We reiterate our
view that IMF support during program discussions and the length of the SBA was
instrumental to face this period successfully.
3.
Ex post evaluation of the quality of the stimulus package is always likely to reveal
weaknesses, but the nature and size of the stimulus package, like in other countries, reflected
operational constraints given the very immediate nature of the challenge. Fiscal deterioration
at the time was mainly driven by lower-than-envisaged tax collections. We believe that the
greatest uncertainty during this period was about the duration and severity of the crisis and
whether the drop in tax collections was permanent or temporary.
4.
Our authorities made efforts to improve monetary policy effectiveness, although the
transition toward inflation targeting did not accelerate. In particular, as staff rightly pointed
out, the single rate crawling peg was replaced by a crawling band, open market operations
were streamlined, the Central Bank established an overnight lending facility (which was
recently complemented with a deposit facility), and a draft law to recapitalize the BCCR was
submitted to Congress.

2

5.
We think that streamlined conditionality in HAPAs allows member countries to
achieve short-term goals more effectively. We have no doubt that Costa Rica’s 2009 SBA
helped withstand the crisis better than a traditional SBA by providing substantial liquidity
buffers thereby effectively insuring the country against external risks. Moreover, there is
evidence of the success of the program: the SBA remained precautionary and on track and the
financial system stayed strong with ample liquidity throughout.
6.
In sum, taking into account the high level of uncertainty during the crisis, we believe
that the modality, design and implementation of the program, were adequate to guarantee its
success.
2011 Article IV Consultation
Recent Developments
After a 1.3 percent decline in 2009, Costa Rica’s economy grew 4.2 percent in 2010 and is
expected to grow 4.3 percent in 2011.
Inflation increased to 5.8 percent in 2010, within the 4-6 target range. Although inflation
decreased to 4.7 percent at end-April 2011, significant risks stem from increases in
international food and fuel prices, which have recently increased inflation expectations and
put at risk the Central Bank’s 2011 inflation target.
As staff pointed out, domestic currency appreciation pressures continue due mainly to higher
private capital inflows and some portfolio rebalancing toward domestic currency
denominated assets.
The current account deficit was 3.6 percent of GDP in 2010, which was more than
compensated by the surplus in the capital account due to private capital inflows. Hence, the
overall balance of payments showed a surplus of more than 1.5 percent of GDP.
The banking sector remains liquid and well capitalized, and nonperforming loans have
stabilized below 2 percent of total loans.
Fiscal Policy
The consolidated public sector deficit for 2011 is projected at 5.6 percent (similar to fiscal
outturn for 2010: 5.5 percent). According to staff’s view, fiscal outturn is still expansionary,
given the strong domestic demand. Our authorities are taking measures this year, such as
freezing employment levels in central administration and reducing operational expenditures
below margins contemplated in the budget, which should generate some savings.
Nevertheless, room for further current expenditure reductions is limited, given existing
rigidities of public expenditures.
Our authorities understand the importance of stabilizing public sector debt at prudent levels.
They presented in January their National Fiscal Sustainability Policy, a comprehensive

3
strategy with the aim of increasing tax revenues and controlling current spending over the
medium term. It contemplates a comprehensive tax reform and tax administration measures,
which authorities expect will yield 2.5 percent of GDP and 1 percent of GDP, respectively.
Our authorities believe that there is significant room to improve tax administration, in
particular by reducing tax evasion. In this sense, they are in the process of adopting a new
information system that would enhance information crosschecks and tax compliance controls.
They are also taking measures to control current expenditure in the short and medium terms.
We believe that the proposed tax reform, submitted in January, will increase efficiency and
enhance equity by eliminating current distortions in the tax system. It modernizes the sales
tax, bringing it more in line with international VAT practices and broadening its base to
include services. While broadening the VAT base, our authorities have protected the most
vulnerable by exempting from the VAT a small consumption basket, basic electricity and
water consumption, as well as some private schools. On income taxes, the tax reform levels
the playing field on capital income by proposing a single tax rate of 15 percent on dividends,
capital gains, and interest income.
Our authorities are aware that achieving their ambitious fiscal strategy is challenging, but
remain confident that it will bring about significant fiscal consolidation with the stabilization
of Costa Rica´s public debt. In the short term, the strategy is expected to reduce the deficit by
about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2011 due to the combination of tax administration improvements
and expenditure cuts. Furthermore, our authorities stand ready to make further efforts on the
expenditure side should it become necessary.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Our authorities remain committed to maintaining low and stable inflation. They kept the 4-6
percent target range for 2011 and have adopted measures to enhance monetary management,
including the establishment of a deposit facility that, jointly with the lending facility,
generated a corridor for short-term interest rates, and introduced new instruments to
neutralize excess liquidity.
Increases in international food and fuel prices and relaxed global financial conditions pose
significant risks to inflation in 2011. In this context, our authorities are willing to tighten the
monetary policy stance as soon as signs of second-round effects are evident.
In line with their inflation objective, authorities share the view that a more flexible exchange
rate would help anchor inflation expectations, and they convey their intention to eliminate the
exchange rate band before the adoption of a full-fledged inflation targeting regime. However,
they consider the current economic environment inappropriate for such shift in the exchange
rate regime. In particular, currently high global liquidity and a significant shift in the portfolio
of Costa Rican residents toward local currency—denominated assets are seen as temporary
factors pressing the exchange rate against the most appreciated side of the band. A more
flexible exchange rate regime would lead to further appreciation—on top of a 14 percent real
appreciation already observed since April 2009—that might very well revert once liquidity
conditions normalize in advanced countries.

Financial Sector
The financial system weathered the global crisis well, but we acknowledge that further
progress on improving financial legislation is warranted, particularly to enhance consolidated
supervision and strengthen the bank resolution framework. In this context, our authorities are
committed to seek approval from the National Assembly of the related draft laws.
Meanwhile, they are working to introduce risk-base supervision and are planning to monitor
system risk and introduce Base III capital and liquidity buffers. Our authorities are of the
view that advances in the adoption of main recommendations of the 2008 FSAP update are
greater than reported by the staff (Box 3).
