KEY ISSUES
Context. Conservative fiscal and financial supervisory policies have helped maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability. However, the adjustment has resulted in sizeable
job losses and a feeble recovery. The economy remains vulnerable due to linkages with
the euro zone, still substantial external debt and rising nonperforming loans.
Outlook and risks. The subdued external environment is limiting near-term growth to a
range of 1 to 1½ percent. Risks to growth emanate from the euro zone, oil price
developments and, over the longer term, aging pressures. These risks call for the
maintenance of prudent policies and high buffers.
Fiscal policy. Little further structural fiscal adjustment remains to reach the 2015 target
of budget balance. Policy makers should safeguard this achievement by resisting
election-related spending pressures in 2013, and improve budget composition by adding
space for infrastructure and ameliorate public services gaps to promote growth.
Financial sector policies. The banking system is stable and liquid but nonperforming
loans are rising. Banks should be encouraged to actively resolve poorly performing
assets, while provisioning should remain conservative. Continued supervisory vigilance,
preemptive actions, and stronger safety nets are priorities in the current environment.
Structural policies. More public investment using European Union funds and
improvements in the insolvency framework would address key growth bottlenecks.
Addressing workers’ skills deficiencies and nominal rigidities in the labor market would
tackle unemployment and over time reduce poverty by raising incomes.
Previous IMF advice. Policy implementation has mostly been consistent with IMF
recommendations. The fiscal deficit has been reduced well below Maastricht and national
limits. Buffers have been bolstered through vigilant financial sector supervision and a
recent eurobond issue that raised the capacity of the fiscal reserve to meet forthcoming
debt repayments. Progress has been made on reforms in pensions and public
administration but not health and corporate debt resolution.

Discussions took place in Sofia from September 20 to October 2. The
staff team comprised Ms. Purfield (head), Messrs. Lakwijk and Gracia
(all EUR), Ms. Weber (FAD), Ms. Nedelescu (MCM), Ms. Rendak and
Mr. Giddings (both LEG), and Mr. Lybek (Resident Representative) and
Ms. Paliova (Resident Representative Office, Economist), with research
assistance from headquarters by Mr. Peterson and administrative
assistance by Ms. Zaffaroni. Mr. Manchev (OED) participated in the
discussions. The mission met with Finance Minister Djankov, Bulgarian
National Bank Governor Iskrov, EU Funds Minister Donchev, other
senior officials, and financial sector and industry representatives. A
press conference concluded the visit. In July 2012, a 1½-day IMF-ILO
consultation on job creation was held in Sofia with participation of the
International Trade Union Confederation and local labor unions. In
addition, the mission had a constructive exchange of views on a broad
range of policy issues with representatives from civil society
organizations and think tanks.

CONTEXT: STABILITY WITH INSUFFICIENT GROWTH
1.
Macroeconomic and financial stability has been maintained in recent years. This owes
to both the policies pursued before the crisis—fiscal surpluses and proactive banking
supervision—and steadfast policy implementation since. The framework of European Union (EU)
membership (from 2007 and anticipated well before) and currency board (since 1997) have
provided legal and monetary stability.
2.
Growth since the crisis has left unemployment high and income levels relatively low.
Per capita GDP growth has been substantial over the last 15 years, but Bulgaria remains the
poorest EU member. The real economy has yet to recover from the crisis, reflecting the unwinding
of the domestic demand boom and headwinds from the euro zone crisis. Unemployment has
continued to rise and emigration and aging
undermine potential growth.

The policy framework, while solid and
resilient to the 2009 crisis, could be tested by
further shocks. The economy has shown its ability
to adjust rapidly within this framework. Flow
imbalances have unwound since the crisis but stock
issues linger (Figure 1). Private external debt has
fallen but a large share is short-term and needs to
be rolled over, and in the banking system, which has
significant buffers, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are
rising. The currency board imposes constraints on
lender of last resort abilities. Large swings in the fiscal
deficit may be difficult to finance now that fiscal buffers
have been reduced. Trade and financial links to the
euro area are strong especially with economies in
difficulty (Annex I).

Growth has been lackluster since the crisis
and output remains below pre-crisis levels
(Tables 1–3). Domestic demand has fallen until recently
while exports, which rose sharply in 2010–11, have
slowed (Figures 2 and 3). GDP growth in the first half
of 2012 was positive but weak at 0.9 percent,

of 2012 with subdued exports and more imports
related to FDI. The overall balance of payments,
however, improved as inflows in the first half of 2012 were 2½ percent of GDP higher than a year
earlier due to higher FDI and slowing financial sector outflows. The international investment
position has improved in line with the fall in external debt (Table 5), reflecting in particular capital
outflows from the financial sector.

7.
The fiscal deficit has continued to decline and public debt is the second lowest in the
EU (Figure 4, Tables 6a–b). The adjustment, which amounted to a cumulative structural
improvement in 2011–12 of 2 percent of GDP, was largely expenditure-based. Pensions and wages
were frozen and a public administration reform reduced public employment by 3 percent
since 2010. Meanwhile, domestic arrears fell from 1 percent of GDP at end-2009 to 0.5 percent of
GDP at end-2011.

5.
Domestic demand has recently shown
signs of revival. Investment is benefitting from
rising foreign direct investment (FDI) and EU funds
absorption—the latter is projected to be some
40 percent higher in 2012 than in 2011 (Tables 3 and
6a). However, significant corporate (nonfinancial)
sector leverage—at 138 percent of GDP in 2010—
remains a drag. Households have been buffeted by
still rising unemployment, declining real estate
prices and tensions in the euro zone that undermined
confidence. Increases in nonperforming mortgages are
evidence of some financial stress but households on
the whole are not in poor financial health. Their bank
deposits are rising, banking debt remains low at
25 percent of GDP, headline inflation has fallen
significantly from pre-crisis highs and real wages have
grown rapidly since 2009, factors that have allowed
consumption to revive.

8.
Credit growth is weak and deposits are rising (Figure 5, Table 7). These developments
represent two sides of the same coin—subdued domestic demand—and increasing domestic
deposits allowed banks to reduce their foreign liabilities and improve their liquidity. The local
financing of Greek banks also improved (their loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 151 percent
in 2009 to 125 percent in mid-2012) and their share of assets has declined (Annex I), but the two
largest Greek banks still account for just over 15 percent of total system assets. The non-bank
financial sector is witnessing moderate growth in the net assets of Supplementary Insurance
Pension Funds, uneven developments in the capital market, and still contracting life and non-life
insurance segments.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND
RISKS
9.
On a baseline of a tepid euro area
recovery, growth is projected to be modest,
around 1–1½ percent, in the near term driven
by EU funds absorption (Tables 2–4). Headline
inflation is expected to reach 2½ percent on
average in 2012 due to higher food and fuel prices
and moderate next year in the absence of demand
pressures. The current account is projected to be in
deficit as imports—driven by rising FDI and EU funds
absorption—outpace exports. Over the medium-term,
growth is projected to gradually increase towards
4½ percent by 2017 and close the output gap,
provided external conditions improve, domestic
demand recovers from the sharp contraction
witnessed during 2009–11, and, equally
crucially, productivity growth increases.
Higher productivity growth will require
stronger EU funds absorption to narrow
the infrastructure gap, improvements in
the business climate, institutions, and
product markets to attract foreign
investment to bolster innovation, as well
as better education, training and active
labor market policies to develop skills.2
Employment is projected to be little
changed as the labor force shrinks due
to aging and emigration.

Bulgaria is vulnerable to adverse external developments and risks remain tilted to
the downside. Large short-term external debt leaves the country vulnerable to rollover risks.
However, both external and fiscal debt are projected to be sustainable to a wide range of shocks
(Appendix I). Staff’s views are summarized in the Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) and focus on:


The key domestic risk is inadequate structural reform. EU funds absorption needs to accelerate
to tackle the infrastructure gap. The predictability of the business environment including the
insolvency framework, judiciary, and governance must be improved, and health care reformed
to counter aging pressures. An additional risk is that the stock of NPLs could constrain credit
availability going forward, especially if deposit growth were also to ease in a context of more
limited parent funding. This risk is not significant in the short-term because of subdued credit
demand. However, to prevent a large stock of NPLs from impeding the recovery once it gains
traction over the medium-term, a strategy to deal with them is required now.



External risks dominate. Severe euro area stress would reduce export demand and Bulgarian
growth. The predominantly European-owned banking system could be affected if parent banks
reduced funding of local subsidiaries thus depressing liquidity. Corporates already struggling
with a debt overhang would be affected as would households through job losses, leading to
increased delinquencies in loan repayment and lower banks’ profits and capital adequacy.



Other external risks include higher energy prices impacting inflation, incomes, and growth as
Bulgaria’s energy intensity of production is five times higher than the EU average and Bulgaria
imports about half of its energy consumption. An increase of 20 percent in the price of oil
raises inflation directly by about 0.8 percentage points.

11.
The authorities agreed that the near term outlook was for modest growth. They did
see room for GDP growth to approach 2 percent next year on the assumption that the euro area
recovers. The return of the current account to deficit was seen as largely related to FDI
developments and thus unproblematic. The authorities recognized that aging constrains future
growth and structural reforms were imperative to boost productivity.
12.
The authorities also saw external spillovers as the key risk to the recovery. They were
confident about the ability of the economy to absorb shocks and maintain stability. They viewed
their banking system as replete with buffers and benefitting from close supervision that would act
preemptively if needed. They see fiscal policy less as a shock absorber than as a support for the
currency board arrangement (CBA). The authorities disagreed that rising NPLs in the near term
could limit credit supply because liquidity was ample and credit demand low. Deleveraging posed
little risk as it was in their view largely driven by the plentiful domestic liquidity amid low credit
demand, and they were also confident that their supervisory powers and on-going collaboration
with home supervisors mitigated remaining risk. On structural reforms and building on some
recent improvements in international competitiveness rankings, they felt that with improved EU
funds absorption, longer-term growth could surprise especially if external uncertainty resolves.
They also saw the need for a push after the elections to tackle insolvency, judicial, and health
reforms to boost growth.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this
report (which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed
is staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source
of risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

POLICY CHALLENGES: SAFEGUARDING STABILITY
AND REVIVING GROWTH
13.
Needed policies to maintain stability and reduce vulnerabilities, while reviving
growth, are twofold. First, fiscal and financial buffers should remain sufficient in view of the
downside risks from the euro zone crisis. This precludes space for looser fiscal and credit policies
placing the onus firmly on structural reform to revive growth. Second, structural policies need to
support growth, investment, and job creation. This includes greater EU funds absorption and
changing the composition of fiscal policy, tackling the legacy of NPLs, and reforms to boost
productivity.

A. The Policy Framework: A Bulwark in Uncertain Times
Background
14.
Bulgaria’s policy framework is
three-pronged and proved its worth in recent
years. First, the CBA which links the lev to the
euro has provided a macroeconomic anchor.
Second, prudent fiscal policies generated
pre-crisis fiscal surpluses and sizeable fiscal
reserves. This did little to dampen the domestic
demand boom but did allow the crisis, when it
came, to be absorbed with moderate fiscal
deficits and public debt. Third, conservative
supervisory policies ensured the building of
buffers in the financial system in pre-crisis years
so that post crisis the system remained sound.
15.
Policy credibility is high at present.
Domestically, the CBA enjoys unquestioned
support. Official reserves, 37 percent of GDP at
mid-2012, are well in excess of the minimum
required. Internationally, Bulgaria was able to
issue a eurobond in July 2012 for €950 million
(2 percent of GDP) with an interest rate of
4¼ percent. Spreads have fallen further since then,
placing Bulgaria more in league with the Baltics than
its geographic neighbors.
16.
The fiscal reserve has been reduced. It
helped fund the budget when it turned from surplus
to deficit following the crisis, and now stands at half
the pre-crisis peak with a large share comprising
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

working balances and pledged funds. The eurobond secured resources for upcoming debt
repayments temporarily boosting the fiscal and international reserves.
17.
Competitiveness has been maintained under the policy framework. The
CGER-valuation range suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals
(table below). Improved export performance and the correction in the current account have
occurred despite rising private sector real
wages and unit labor costs (ULCs). The latter
likely contributed to the sizable reduction in
employment, but may not have harmed
external competiveness given that wage
levels in Bulgaria remain low, with hourly
remuneration just one-third of the EU
median (Section D). More broadly, the
comfortable level of international reserves,
subdued but increasing capital flows,
moderate current account deficit, and improving international investment position reinforce the
notion that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.

Policy Issues
18.
The three policy prongs are mutually reinforcing and need to be well maintained or
even enhanced. The CBA remains the approriate anchor for policies until eventual euro adoption
given the strong on-going support provided by fiscal and financial policies. In the current highly
uncertain environment, the benefit of the fiscal reserve is enhanced as it complements other crisis
management tools and financial system buffers. With the reduction in the fiscal reserve since 2009,
a low probability, large impact shock could prove more difficult to absorb (see Annex II).
19.
Saving any fiscal over performance, proceeding with budgetary plans of domestic
debt issuance, and saving privatization proceeds would strengthen the fiscal reserve. Such
measures have the potential to increase the reserve, without recourse to further external
borrowing, to about 7 percent of GDP in 2016 prior to the bond repayments falling due in 2017.
The recently adopted debt management strategy, which focused on gross debt, should be
complemented with a review of how the fiscal reserve is structured and funded to meet its fiscal
and financial shock absorbtion and savings objectives.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

BULGARIA

20.
The authorities saw limited scope to increase the fiscal reserve via further external
borrowing particularly ahead of the elections. They agreed that the reserve serves a crucial role
in supporting Bulgaria’s policy framework by providing a backstop, particularly now that euro
adoption plans are on hold. They are not letting the fiscal reserve fall further and are setting its
legal minimum at end-2013 nominally unchanged from end-2012 at 5½ percent of GDP. They
emphasized the availability of other tools to resolve any potential liquidity or solvency issues in the
banking system.

21.
Fiscal consolidation continued
in 2011–12. The fiscal deficit is on track to
fall to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2012. On the
revenue side, the combination of
administrative improvements and price
developments boosted VAT collections.
Furthermore, risks from contingent liabilities
in the energy and transport sectors have
been reduced by cancelling the construction
of a nuclear reactor and reforming the
railway system to eliminate public subsidies
by 2013. The latter includes privatizing
freight, closing unprofitable lines, and
laying-off 2,000 workers.

22.
The 2013 budget represents a pause in the consolidation effort. Average pensions are
to increase by 9.3 percent in April 2013 to compensate for inflation during the last three years
while public wages will remain largely frozen for a fourth year. Interest income will be included in
the income tax base and minimum social security contributions thresholds raised by 3.3 percent to
counter under-recording of incomes. Reaching the government’s 2015 target of a balanced
budget will require 0.4 percent of GDP in structural measures. On current projections this would
result in structural balance in 2015, a more ambitious target than the EU’s Fiscal Compact.
23.
A proposed new public finance law incorporates the Fiscal Compact’s structural
budget balance rule. It also puts forward automatic correction mechanisms in case of non
compliance, lists all national and supranational fiscal rules, and introduces monthly general
government financial reporting requirements. The financial management of sub-national
governments remains weak. However, their budgets are small and broadly balanced, and their
debt is low at 1.3 percent of GDP. Moreover, the authorities have established an incentive system
to improve performance, monitoring, and transparency at the municipal level.

Health Reform is lagging. Despite the highest number of hospital beds per capita in the
EU, primary care and preventative services are poor, and large out-of-pocket outlays disadvantage
lower-income patients. A lack of reform momentum could undo recent efforts to contain hospital
costs at a time when pharmaceutical spending is rising fast (10 percent per year).

Policy Issues
26.
Targeting a balanced budget by 2015 appropriately supports Bulgaria’s policy
framework. A small and declining deficit would keep public debt low, preserve the fiscal reserve,
and allow fiscal space to use in the event of potential shocks. The trade-off with short-term growth
would be limited because of the small adjustment and modest multipliers (Annex III). However, if
growth were to slow significantly relative to projections, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate provided adequate financing is available. A pause in the adjustment next year seems
reasonable given the subdued growth outlook and the small structural adjustment remaining
till 2015, but it will be necessary to resist pressures for generalized wage increases.

Pension reform advanced in 2011,
building on the 2010 efforts. Retirement
ages were raised from 2012 (to 65 years for
men by 2017 and 63 years for women
by 2020), pensions indexed to prices, and
requirements for military and police
pensions tightened. The pension deficit
(pillar I) is now projected to decrease
to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2030 before
widening again, with a continued budget
transfer of 3 percent of GDP.

BULGARIA

27.
The composition of fiscal policy should be made more supportive of growth and
quality of spending improved. Higher infrastructure and active labor market policy spending
financed by EU funds as well as improved tax compliance and lower untargeted subsidies hold the
potential to stimulate growth (Annex III). Limiting early retirement, linking it to life expectancy, and
increasing the retirement age of women to that of men would help boost labor force participation
and counter the drag from aging on growth. To safeguard the integrity of the pension system,
social security contribution collections should flow to the relevant funds under new streamlined
collection procedures. At the same time, proposals to reduce fees and strengthen the governance
structure of mandatory private pension funds are welcome given the need to improve these funds’
performance. Spending effectiveness would also be enhanced by a comprehensive health reform
to rationalize hospitals, promote primary care, and improve transparency.
28.
The commitment to fiscal discipline should be complemented by improvements in
public financial management. The proposed law is an important step but further efforts are
needed including reconciling domestic and EU reporting standards and rules, setting up an
independent fiscal council to assess fiscal projections, and disclosing contingent liabilities,
particularly related to State Owned Enterprises.
29.
The authorities are committed to preserving fiscal stability and market credibility.
They are skeptical of the counter cyclical effectiveness of fiscal policy in a downside scenario and
fear the negative impact on credibility of deviating from their 2015 balance target. They see scope
to improve the quality and composition of spending, especially through improved EU funds
absorption.

C. Financial Sector: Fortifying Resilience
Background
30.
The financial system is stable but operating in a challenging low-growth
environment (Table 8, Figure 6). The banking system-wide capital adequacy ratio is high
(16.7 percent in June 2012) with all banks meeting the 12 percent regulatory minimum. Strong
deposit growth and subdued credit demand boosted liquidity (coverage ratio of 26 percent) and
allowed external funding to decline, although the stock of parent funding in some banks remains
sizeable. The difficult economic environment has taken a toll on asset quality and profitability.
31.
Rising asset impairment could impede the recovery. NPLs were 16.9 percent of total
loans in June 2012 and still rising (Figure 7), but there is a high degree of dispersion across the
system. Weak growth, high corporate indebtedness, and a depressed real estate market continue
to pressure asset quality. A large stock of NPLs may constrain credit availability once the recovery
gains traction and savings and related deposit growth ease, and it may also undermine the
efficiency of credit intermediation by locking in resources.

32.
Tight supervisory policies have reinforced buffers. The BNB is closely monitoring banks,
including through frequent onsite inspections, high frequency reporting, and enforcing higher
capital and liquidity buffers in the relatively weaker pockets of the system that could be potentially
exposed to spillovers from the on-going euro-area crisis and where NPLs are higher. Coverage of
NPLs by accounting provisions stands at 45 percent, but additional capital in the form of specific
provisions (22 percent of NPLs) could be used to cushion impairments (Box 1).

Box 1. Provisioning Regulations
In Bulgaria, banks must set up accounting and specific provisions. The distribution between accounting
and specific provisions is uneven across banks depending on their provisioning practices.

Accounting provisions follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), reflect an incurred
loss assessment, and are booked as expenses, thus reducing profits.

Specific provisions are calculated according to a BNB methodology that embeds an expected loss
model and are deducted from regulatory capital. Specific provisions build additional capital buffers which
can be used to absorb losses, including from NPLs, provided that minimum capital adequacy
requirements are not breached.

33.
The institutional framework to discuss financial stability matters is working well. The
Financial Stability Advisory Council meets quarterly and provides a platform of cooperation among
the BNB, the Ministry of Finance, and the Financial Supervision Commission. The BNB also consults
closely with foreign supervisors, but does not participate in the Vienna II Initiative. The Deposit
Guarantee Fund has resources equivalent to 4.7 percent of the covered deposits.

Policy Issues
34.
A comprehensive strategy to address NPLs would allow banks to better support the
recovery. Banks should be encouraged to resolve non-performing assets by loan restructuring,
assets disposals, and write downs. The process should be closely monitored by the BNB, which
should press for conservative provisioning, fair valuation of collateral, and strict recognition of
interest income on NPLs, based on certainty of cash inflows. Accumulated buffers will be helpful in
the resolution process.
35.
Broader measures would facilitate balance sheet repair of both banks and
corporates. Introduction of a fast-track court approval procedure for pre-agreed reorganization
plans could help. This would combine the efficiency of out-of-court negotiations with an
expeditious bind-in of dissenting creditors, thereby reducing costs and delays compared to
recovery proceedings. Out-of-court debt restructuring guidelines could also be explored, which in
other countries have facilitated speedy, cost-effective, and market-friendly settlements, especially
in cases involving multiple creditors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

BULGARIA

36.
Continued vigilance through close bank monitoring and strong safety nets remain
priorities. The BNB should continue to closely monitor banks and intervene preemptively through
targeted requirements to reinforce capital and liquidity buffers in the relatively weaker pockets of
the system. Plans to strengthen the BNB’s bank resolution framework by introducing “purchase
and assumption” and “bridge bank” options should proceed quickly in line with the proposed EU
directive on bank recovery and resolution and the Financial Stability Board’s indications.
37.
The authorities consider the banking system, with high buffers and increased
domestic funding, well placed to cope with risks. They assess the risks to the recovery posed by
NPLs as low since credit demand remains subdued, liquidity high, and buffers adequate. With high
deposit growth and a lack of evidence of parent banks’ forcibly deleveraging, the authorities see
existing cooperation with foreign supervisors and EU colleges working well. They see merit in
fast-track court approval for corporate reorganizations while they view existing out-of-court debt
restructuring as satisfactory.

D. Improving the Environment for Growth
Background
38.
Improvements in the predictability of the business environment, workers’ skills, and
quality of infrastructure would help boost growth. These are areas where Bulgaria lags
internationally and where improvements could make a real difference.4
39.
Regarding the business environment, shortcomings exist in the insolvency
framework, notably the possibility to “backdate” the start of insolvency. This backdating of
the insolvency date by courts, often years before filing, triggers automatic invalidation of a wide
range of transactions, including the validity of collateral and payments made after the insolvency
date. It reduces the predictability of private contract enforcement, raises credit and operational
risks, creates moral hazard, and discourages lending. Other shortcomings include delays in and
costly court processes, lax enforcement of legal provisions on liability for failure to timely file for
insolvency, insufficient expertise, and the uncertain and unpredictable process for reorganizing
firms outside formal insolvency proceedings.
40.
Regarding infrastructure, higher EU funds
absorption is helping tackle gaps. Increased absorption,
almost doubling within one year, resulted from streamlined
administrative procedures, amendments to the public
procurement law, and technical assistance from the World
Bank and EBRD. The full impact of these reforms on
absorption will be realized over the medium-term.
Nonetheless, absorption rates remain low, particularly for

competitiveness programs focusing on the unemployed, while a lack of capacity and poor financial
control at the sub-national level pose challenges.
41.
In the labor market, structural mismatches undermine potential growth. The crisis
exposed large and rising regional, age, and skills mismatches that have resulted in significantly
higher unemployment and a slight increase in poverty and inequality (Box 2 and Figure 8). Average
real wage growth in the private sector since the crisis (2009Q1 to 2012Q1) has surpassed
productivity gains.5 This wage growth partly reflects compositional changes in employment—the
disproportionate lay off of less productive, low wage workers—but also likely reflects increases in
the minimum thresholds for social security contributions. While labor productivity gains help
explain the increase in exports (Annex I), they have come at the expense of jobs (especially low
skilled).
Box 2. Labor Market Developments
The labor market experienced a boom and bust since the mid 2000s that exposed large structural
mismatches. Large increases in employment and the participation rate during 2003–2008 were mostly reversed
after the crisis, with employment down 15 percent. The unemployment rate of 11.5 percent in September 2012
was similar to the 2004 rate and well above the 2008 rate of 5 percent. Unemployment has disproportionately
affected those below 34 years of age (with their employment lower in 2012 than 2003), the low-skilled, and those
in rural areas.
Regional divergence, already present before the crisis, has since intensified. The capital region stands out for
its relatively low unemployment, high participation rates, and high wages. Regional divergences, as measured by
the standard deviation of regional real wages, have doubled since 2008 and tripled since the early-2000s. Average
wage levels in Bulgaria remain low.
The system of minimum thresholds for social security may be making low wage workers more expensive.
More than 600 different minimum thresholds for social security contributions are agreed between social partners
and, if agreement is not reached, administratively determined by the government. The original intention of the
thresholds was to reduce the scope of the grey economy. These thresholds have increased an annual average rate
of 5–6 percent over 2010–11. Employers are allowed to pay a wage below the minimum threshold provided it is
above the minimum wage. Whereas the minimum wage, two thirds below average wages, is not generally binding,
regional average wages in some regions are close to many minimum thresholds. When binding, the thresholds
increase the tax wedge making employment of low wage workers less attractive.

Policy Issues
42.
The backdating of insolvencies should be disallowed. Proposals, such as limiting the
timeframe for back-dating, while not unknown to other legal systems, would not resolve the
problem. A broader review of the existing insolvency framework is also needed to identify
weaknesses in insolvency processes and suggest required legislative amendments. In addition,
improving the capacity of all parties involved in the process is necessary.
5

Real wage growth data vary from 6 percent annually since the crisis (National Accounts) to 9 percent (Labor Force
Survey) and productivity growth from 1 percent (Labor Force Survey) to 4 percent (National Accounts).
Unionization is low and bargaining largely occurs at firm level.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

24

BULGARIA

43.
Boosting EU funds absorption is critical to improve productivity. Additional reforms to
complement those already implemented should focus on improved financial control and capacity
building at the municipal level, and the introduction of a framework law to govern procedures and
processes for EU funds management.
44.
Future wage increases need to be anchored in productivity gains to preserve
competitiveness. The upcoming review of the system of minimum social security contribution
thresholds should identify the adjustments necessary to alleviate their impact on low-wage
workers. Expanded active labor market policies and more targeted education and training would
raise productivity and increase employment.
45.
The authorities recognize that the insolvency framework needs reform and see the
post election period as holding the greatest promise for progress. More broadly, the National
Reform Program sets out policies for addressing structural impediments to growth. It also outlines
programs on social inclusion and poverty reduction including long-term care, Roma integration,
and training for vulnerable groups. Regarding EU funds, the authorities have increased contracts
and implementation and are preparing for the next EU program period.
46.
The authorities see recent developments in private sector wages as largely reflecting
productivity gains and do not consider it a risk for future competiveness. They value the
flexibility of the labor market but recognize that structural bottlenecks are keeping unemployment
high. They are increasing active labor market programs to reduce skills mismatches and increase
productivity. Given regional gaps, they are considering regional minimum wages to complement
the review of social security contribution thresholds.

STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The defining events of recent years for Bulgaria are the ones that did not happen: no
exchange rate crisis, international bailout, bank intervention, or build-up of public debt. This
attests to the strength of the policy framework and policy implementation. However, growth
remains weak and has left unemployment high, while the economy is exposed to risks from the
on-going euro-area crisis.
48.
Boosting growth in an uncertain external environment calls for bolder structural
reform while maintaining prudent policies. Fiscal and financial buffers need to remain sufficient
in view of the downside risks from the euro zone crisis. This precludes space for looser fiscal and
credit policies, placing the onus firmly on structural reform and higher EU funds absorption to
revive growth. Rebuilding the fiscal reserve through saving fiscal over performance or privatization
receipts would further strengthen defenses. Undertaking a review of the fiscal reserve to
appropriately tailor its structure and funding to meet its shock absorbing and saving objectives
would complement the existing debt management strategy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BULGARIA

49.
The fiscal adjustment achieved so far should be preserved but improving the
composition of the budget would support growth. The budget is close to structural balance
and care should be taken in the election year not to squander this achievement. This is all the
more so as little further adjustment remains to meet the 2015 target of budget balance which
safeguards space to allow automatic stabilizers to work in the event of a shock. However,
increasing spending on infrastructure investment and active labor market policies financed via EU
funds absorption, better tax compliance, and reductions in subsidies would stimulate growth while
preserving budget targets.
50.
The financial system is stable with high buffers but the low growth environment
poses challenges. A comprehensive strategy that seeks banks actively addressing non-performing
assets would support the recovery, a process that the BNB should closely monitor by pressing for
conservative provisioning and strict recognition of interest income on NPLs. Out of court debt
restructuring guidelines and fast track court approval process for pre-agreed reorganization plans
could facilitate the strategy. Meanwhile, BNB should remain vigilant and continue to request
preemptively the buildup of capital and liquidity buffers in the weaker pockets of the system. The
BNB’s resolution powers and toolkit should be expanded, as times remain uncertain.
51.
While an external recovery in demand would help restore growth in Bulgaria, some
domestic levers are available through structural reform. The absorption of EU funds is key
given its size, the large grant element, and the potential impact on growth and employment. The
insolvency framework needs to be improved, in particular by eliminating backdating of
insolvencies, to support the business environment. Ensuring that the labor market functions
properly, in particular at the lower end, would help reduce employment and income disparities
and over time contribute to lowering poverty.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bulgaria be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I: INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND SPILLOVERS
FROM THE EURO AREA TO BULGARIA1
With significant and increasing trade links with the euro area (EA), the slowdown in EA growth has a
strong impact on growth in Bulgaria, particularly as its business cycle has become more synchronized
with the core. Increased domestic savings led to rapid domestic deposit growth that allowed banks to
reduce external debt substantially. Spillovers to sovereign debt spreads have also been limited.

A. Trade Channels
1.
Bulgaria’s trade linkages with the euro area are strong (Figure 1). In 2011, exports to
the euro area accounted for 44 percent of Bulgaria’s total exports and 23 percent of the country’s
GDP. Bulgaria’s market share in the euro area trade has increased steadily for 10 years. Real export
growth to the EU–15 since 2010 has been faster than during the pre-crisis years, with growth
touching a 10 year high 24 percent in 2011 as trade with Germany expanded. Exports to the
European Union’s New Member States and the Balkans have also grown rapidly. In 2011, Bulgaria
exported 63 percent of its total exports to the European Union and 77 percent to the combined
European Union and the Balkans. In contrast, Bulgaria’s share in Asian markets has been relatively
flat since 2009.
2.
Therefore, Bulgarian growth is very sensitive to developments in the euro area. The
elasticity of Bulgarian export growth to euro area GDP growth is high: when the euro area GDP
grows by 1 percent, Bulgarian exports grow by 3.5 percent in volume terms. Signs of the effect of
the euro area slowdown are already visible as the volume of goods export growth eased to
16.4 percent year-on-year by end-2011 from 33.1 percent in the first quarter. In addition, the
correlation of the Bulgarian business cycle with the euro area’s has increased over 2008/2011
compared to 2001/2007 period with twice as high an elasticity of Bulgarian GDP growth to the
euro area growth during the latter period.

B. Capital Flows Channel, Increased Domestic Savings and Banking Sector
Deleveraging
3.
The crisis saw a dramatic increase in domestic deposit growth that allowed a rapid
decline in banks’ foreign liabilities while credit growth remained positive. Amid weak credit
demand owing to weak sentiment, the impact on credit supply has been muted with credit growth
to the non-government non-financial sector reaching 3.9 percent in 2011. The rapid growth in
non-financial domestic customer deposits of around 30 percent since 2010 (Figure 2), reflected
rising savings, and has more than offset the decline in commercial banks’ foreign liabilities (which

are registered as a capital outflow in the BOP).
This allowed banks’ total liabilities to grow by
8 percent between end-2009 and end-2011 and
the loan-to-deposit ratio to fall from 120 to
105 percent, with growth in lev deposits
outstripping euro deposit growth. Banks’ funding
is thus shifting from a parent based to a domestic
deposit-based model, with the retrenchment of
some foreign banks benefitting
domestically-owned banks in terms of asset and
deposit market share

4.
As a result of the crisis and the repayment of banks’ external funding lines Bulgaria
has experienced a dramatic fall in capital inflows (Figure 3). Capital flows shifted from inflows
of 44 percent of GDP in 2007 to outflows of 1½ percent of GDP in 2011. This reflects the collapse
in cross-border banking flows by 23 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2011, which in contributed
to the private external debt falling from 94 percent of GDP at end-2008 to 81 percent at end-2011.
Only FDI remained positive but still

The decline in crossborder banking flows is evident
in banks’ net foreign position
that is now closer to balance.
Bulgarian banks’ foreign liabilities
have exhibited a clear downward
trend since the start of the crisis
in 2008, with a level in
December 2011 at 36 percent lower
compared to the 2008 peak, a
decline equivalent to 9 percent
of 2011 GDP. During the same
period, banks’ foreign assets grew
by 28 percent. Consequently,
banks' net foreign liabilities
narrowed to 4.6 percent of GDP in
December 2011 compared to
17.7 percent of GDP in
November 2008 (Figure 4).

Lehman failure when euro area banks, led by Greek
banks, maintained their level of exposures to Bulgaria due to their profitable operations there that
partly offset their losses in home markets. The asset market share of domestic banks increased
from 16 percent in 2009 to 25 percent in 2012Q2 at the expense of particularly Greek banks (their
market share fell from about 30 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in 2012Q2).

7.
Deeper analysis confirms the limited impact of the decline in foreign liabilities on
credit supply. A bank-by-bank panel data regression for Bulgaria shows that funding from credit
institutions, the bulk of which is composed of euro area parent funding, had a significant but
limited effect on credit growth (Table 1). Contrasting the pre and post-crisis periods shows that the
growth in funding from credit institutions has a significant effect on credit growth during the
pre-crisis period only, while non-financial customers’ deposit growth has a significant effect over
the whole period (3rd and 4th columns). By contrast, real GDP growth has a significant and very
large effect in the post-crisis period only, with a one point GDP growth entailing a 1.83 percentage
point increase in credit growth. The results are confirmed by a macro regression using monthly
monetary survey data on credit and deposits.

The results imply that the decline in foreign liabilities had a cumulative negative
effect of 2 percentage points on credit flows during 2010–11. This assumes banks' wholesale
funding is made up exclusively of foreign funding, and uses the average year-on-year growth in
attracted funds from credit institutions over 2010/2011 (-18.8 percent) and the regression
coefficient (column 2 Table 1). The combined effect of the funding from credit institutions variable
and the deposit variable on credit growth is estimated to be equal to 1.4 percentage point each
year over 2010/2012, compared to an average annual credit growth of 3.1 percent, with the
difference reflecting the autoregressive behavior of credit growth as shown in the econometric
results.

C. Financial Markets Linkages
9.
The widening of spreads on Bulgarian debt has been contained compared to regional
peers (Figures 5a and b). The increase in CDS spreads has evolved in line with global risk aversion
and regional peers, remaining below Bulgaria’s March 2009 own crisis high. A correlation analysis
shows that the increase in regional risk aversion has impacted Bulgarian bond spreads and CDS
less negatively than the stock market, as the latter was largely driven by domestic factors. The
correlation between the V2X index (volatility of the Euro Stoxx 50 index) and Sofia stock market
volatility has risen dramatically since the onset of the 2008 crisis. By contrast, the correlation of the
V2X with Bulgarian sovereign CDS spreads and with 10-year sovereign bond spread declined and
even turned negative for bond spreads. A Garch model estimating co-movements in financial
variables confirms that Bulgarian indicators have been less vulnerable than others in the region to
contagion (see Box 1).

Box 1: Co-Movements in Financial Markets: A GARCH Approach


Bulgaria's stock market displays a lower co-movement with the GIIPS equity and Euro Stoxx
than Poland or Hungary (Figure B1). This reflects its underdevelopment and low liquidity even
prior to the crisis.



Bulgaria’s CDS spread co-moves more with Hungary, Poland, and Romania than with the GIIPS
(Figure B2), but Bulgaria does not seem to be more influenced by CDS shocks in the GIIPS than
its neighboring countries. Therefore, a common factor such as rising risk aversion in Europe
seems to be a major driving factor.



Comparing the EMBI spreads of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland against the average GIIPS
10-year bond spread over Germany indicates that Bulgaria has been moving closely to
Hungary and Poland against the 10-year bond spread of the GIIPS during the last 2 years,
expect in the very recent period (Figure B3).

The greater resilience of the sovereign bond and CDS spreads reflects the strict fiscal
discipline enshrined in the CBA. Bulgaria maintains a fiscal reserve as a buffer against external
shocks which helped contain the rise in sovereign spreads. In addition to the limited size of the
Bulgarian bond market and regular domestic issuances, good policies have helped Bulgaria
decouple from the euro area, while the 10-year Bulgarian government bond interest rate has
converged towards the Maastricht criterion showing greater discrimination between emerging
markets by international investors on basis of debt levels (Figures 6a and b).

ANNEX II. THE PURPOSE OF THE FISCAL RESERVE1
This annex explores the reasons for Bulgaria to maintain a fiscal reserve.

2.
The fiscal reserve soon exceeded the
minima related to debt repayments. Public debt
declined rapidly in the 2000’s and the FRA was
boosted inter alia by privatization revenues and
inclusion of the government’s cash resources. Budget
surpluses in the boom years of the mid 2000’s
flowed into the FRA, which subsequently helped
finance budget deficits resulting from the global
crisis that began in 2008.

The fiscal reserve was set up in 1997 at the
inception of the Currency Board Arrangement
(CBA). It was (and is), however, not a formal
requirement of the CBA. The minimum level of the
fiscal reserve was initially fixed at the amount of debt
payments over the next year (around €1 billion or
about 10 percent of GDP).2 Fund programs included a
performance criterion on the minimum balance in the
fiscal reserve account (FRA).3

mid-2012 were 90 percent above the CBA requirement of covering reserve money.
4.

The FRA comprises various sub accounts the use of which is often dedicated:



The FRA includes the State Fund for Guaranteeing the Stability of the State Pension
System (“Silver Fund”). This fund amounted to BGN 2.1 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) at
end-August 2012 or just under one-third of the total FRA. It is dedicated to meeting future
needs in pillar I of the pension system, which restricts the short-term usability of its resources
without legislative changes. The Silver Fund started accumulating resources in 2007, when the
fiscal surplus and FRA were rising, to lock in part of the gain.5



The FRA includes the single treasury account. Use of the FRA has to take into account the
operational needs of the government, which may be around 2–3 months of non-transfer
spending (around BGN 2.5 billion or 3 percent of GDP). The single treasury account also holds
balances of some organizations with budgets that are not part of the state budget, as well as
certain funds.6



An end-year legal minimum for the FRA is specified in the budget. For end-2012 this is set
at BGN 4.5 billion (5.8 percent of 2012 GDP), and the proposed 2013 budget sets the same
nominal minimum for end-2013. No legal minimum applies during the year.

B. The Fiscal Reserve as a Shock Absorber
5.
Bulgaria’s faces certain vulnerabilities. A key vulnerability is the short-term external debt
(25 percent of GDP at mid-2012) which needs to be rolled over within a year. The Risk Assessment
Matrix (see main text) summarizes staff’s views on the major risks facing Bulgaria, and Annex I
discusses its trade and financial interconnections with the euro area as possible channels through
which shocks can spillover to Bulgaria. More generally, Bulgaria is an emerging economy that is
still building credibility: risk premiums have come down but this is a recent development that
cannot be taken for granted. In terms of its policy framework, while the currency board is well
supported by policies, it limits the policy options to address shocks, including the
lender-of-last-resort function. Fiscal policy in the case of a shock may be constrained by limited
financing room (the domestic market is small and the external market may not necessarily be open
when needed), which could force severe short-term budget adjustment.
4

In the case of external borrowing that is placed in the FRA, the effect on international reserves is reduced below
one-for-one to the extent that residents finance part of the external borrowing immediately or soon after (with the
July 2012 eurobond, residents were not allowed as primary purchasers but secondary market purchases did take
place). In the case of fiscal surpluses generating the increase in the FRA, the effect on international reserves
depends on factors such as the reduction in import demand brought about by the fiscal surplus.
5

By law, the Silver Fund receives privatization receipts, 25 percent of each annual budget surplus, revenues from
concessions, and other revenues to be decided (“State Fund for Guaranteeing the Stability of the State Pension
System Act,” Article 11(1)).
6

The “2012 State Budget of the Republic of Bulgaria Act” lists these organizations. Funds in the single treasury
account include the Nuclear Facilities Decommissioning Fund and the Radioactive Waste Fund (see “Safe Use of
Nuclear Energy Act”).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

6.
The fiscal reserve is a tool in Bulgaria’s policy framework that can act as a buffer of
last resort to help absorb shocks in two dimensions. They include shocks to the government
finances and the financial system that could generate liquidity or financing needs. These are
examined in turn.

FRA and Government Finances
7.
A conservative fiscal policy is the first line of defense against the impact of shocks on
government finances. It can (i) reduce the financing needs of unexpected fiscal shocks, (ii) create
space to absorb a shock without breaching national or EU-level fiscal rules, and (iii) build up
savings in good times that can be used to finance the budget in bad times. In the two years
from 2008 to 2010, the (cash) fiscal balance deteriorated to a deficit of only 3.9 percent of GDP
because the starting position was a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP. As a result, the cumulative
financing need was reduced and the fiscal reserve could finance a substantial part of it. Moreover,
it allowed fiscal policy to play a more active role in supporting the economy in the downturn.7
Without the reserve a more abrupt adjustment to curtail the widening of the fiscal deficit would
have been required, which would have compounded the economic downturn.
8.
The anticipated level of the FRA would likely be insufficient to cope with large
shocks to the budget. The FRA’s peak-to-trough decline was about 12 percentage points of GDP,
whereas the FRA by January 2013 will be just around 6 percent of GDP, and only part of it is usable
given the constraints mentioned above. In addition, recent simulations showed a potential funding
need for Bulgaria over a 3-year period in worst-case scenarios amounting to 7 to 9 percent of
GDP.8 Both the recent experience and the simulations provide indications of the amount of liquid,
available FRA resources that might be needed in an adverse downside scenario that caused a
significant shock to growth and the budget balance.
9.
The most natural and least costly way to rebuild the FRA is by using fiscal surpluses
when the economic cycle turns up. This would be consistent with the stabilizing objective of the
FRA over the economic cycle. If future growth accelerates and the output gap becomes positive
again, the appropriate policy response would be to have fiscal surpluses and rebuild the FRA. At a
minimum, limiting the size of the deficit will help preserve the current size of the reserve. But
saving privatization proceeds and any over performance relative to budget targets while adhering
to domestic debt issuance plans would allow for a gradual build-up of the reserve without
increasing net debt.

7

The benefit of using the FRA in terms of smoothing GDP over the cycle depends on the multiplier. For example,
Annex II provides an estimated revenue multiplier in the downturn of 0.5 and in the upturn of 0.4 (with opposite
signs). This implies a small net positive impact on GDP over the cycle from financing a revenue decline in the
downturn and clawing it back in the upturn.
8

See Andritzky, “Evaluating Designs for a Fiscal Rule in Bulgaria” (IMF, WP/11/272, November 2011), Table 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

BULGARIA

10.
In the current international environment, tail risks—unrelated to cyclical factors and
not necessarily Bulgaria-specific—that could involve a severe fiscal deterioration and high
financing requirement cannot be ruled out. The size of the fiscal buffer potentially needed to
finance deficits in such an extreme case could be very large and costly to accumulate and
maintain. Thus, the cost at this time of building up such self-insurance from borrowing, combined
with the low probability of needing it, needs to be weighed against alternatives, including
potential bilateral or multilateral support.

FRA and Financial System
11.
Bulgaria pursues conservative financial supervisory policies as its main defense
against the impact of shocks. The modest size of the financial system in Bulgaria, with total
banking system assets at around 75 percent of GDP, helps contain risks. The stability of the
banking system in recent years, following the unwinding of the domestic demand boom, attests to
the adequate policy framework and its successful implementation. However, given that the
currency board strictly circumscribes the BNB’s ability to act as lender of last resort by limiting the
amount of reserve money to no more than international reserves, strong defenses are appropriate.
12.
Conservative supervisory policies have resulted in high capital, provisions, and
liquidity in the banking system to cope with shocks. Bulgaria sets capital requirements well
above EU minimums and requires banks to set aside additional buffers in the form of specific
provisions. Banks are required to hold a high level of minimum reserves, and at present, hold
additional excess reserves at the BNB. Under certain circumstances, banks can tap the BNB as a
lender of last resort provided they have high-quality collateral to pledge.9 In extremis, the BNB has
strong pre-emptive intervention powers, and the deposit insurance fund holds resources worth
2 percent of GDP (almost 5 percent of covered deposits). Ways to further strengthen the ability of
the financial system to address non-performing assets, including by improving the insolvency
framework as well as strengthening the BNB’s resolution tool-kit in line with the proposed EU
Directive on Bank Resolution and Recovery, are also under consideration.
13.
Given the existing defenses, the potential role of the FRA in backstopping the
financial system is as an additional resource. Existing defenses are supplemented by the
authorities’ preference for private sector involvement. However, without going into the
circumstances and conditions under which public liquidity or capital support may be provided, the
available resources in the FRA are potentially a factor in the degree of flexibility available to the
authorities in their crisis response. The flexibility provided by the FRA is also noted by the rating
agencies.

9

To summarize, in case of liquidity risk the BNB may only extend short-term credits to solvent banks against highly
liquid assets up to the amount of excess international reserves (see “Law on the BNB,” Article 33).

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

C. The Fiscal Reserve as a Saving Vehicle
14.
The FRA could be used as a tool to save and address the financial consequences of
population aging. An aging population puts pressure on government finances which can be
prepared for in part by building up assets. To this end, Bulgaria has established pillar II of the
pension system along traditional lines, with resources being built up and invested with the aim of
generating long-term returns. To complement the state pension system, the Silver Fund (which is
part of the FRA) was established to set aside savings. Although designated as a pension fund, it
does not operate along these lines as its resources are limited, kept very liquid (only short-term
deposits) and, as a consequence of their being liquid, do not generate a return in the current low
interest rate environment.10 More importantly, its structure and legal framework do not conform to
those of a pension fund.
15.
The role of the FRA and the Silver Fund in saving for aging pressures could be
reexamined. A savings fund could be a useful instrument of macro-fiscal management provided
fiscal policy generates enough savings and it is fully integrated in the policy framework. That is to
say, the accumulation of financial assets in a fund with intergenerational objectives should be
derived from the actual fiscal surpluses determined in the policy framework. Significant legal
changes would be required for the Silver Fund to play this role, if it is desired. In this context, the
asset/debt nexus would also need to be examined. Generating savings when net public debt is
positive may seem premature but possibly be defensible if maintaining a gross public debt has
other functions, for example underpinning domestic financial market development.

D. Fiscal Reserve Comparison
16.
Comparisons with other countries are fraught with difficulty because Bulgaria’s
combination of a currency board and fiscal reserve is uncommon. One economy that is
comparable in these respects, although it differs significantly in many respects including size and
level of development, is Hong Kong SAR, which is briefly examined.
17.
For Hong Kong SAR, the Asian crisis illustrated the utility of, and way to manage
fiscal reserves. They were drawn down to help finance budget deficits, and once budget surpluses
returned they were rebuilt. The recent decline in Bulgaria’s fiscal reserve could similarly be
followed by a rebuilding.
18.
Hong Kong SAR’s fiscal reserves are placed with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA), which invests them as part of its management of the international reserves. This is
similar to the present arrangement in Bulgaria. A difference is that the HKMA is explicitly
managing its international reserves partly as a liquid portfolio and partly for the longer term. This
10

Existing room to invest in other than short-term deposits (for example, foreign shares and investment grade
foreign government bonds within limits specified in the law) is not being used (see “State Fund for Guaranteeing
the Stability of the State Pension System Act,” Article 13).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

BULGARIA

reflects the primary role of the international reserves as backing the currency board and also that
Hong Kong SAR has decided to dedicate its fiscal reserves for multiple purposes: they are a buffer
against the volatile public revenues, function as a potential backstop for the financial system (in
addition to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s role as lender of last resort), and are a resource
for anticipated age-related spending. In Bulgaria, if any changes in the investment of the FRA were
to be contemplated, they should be preceded by a re-examination of the purposes of the FRA,
including as a saving vehicle for aging. However, the resources available in the FRA for the shock
absorption functions with respect to the government finances and financial system, discussed
above, would need to be safeguarded.

E. Conclusions
19.
The fiscal reserve is an integral part of Bulgaria’s policy framework that has served
Bulgaria well. In practice, it has a stabilizing backstop financing function which, in uncertain times,
may imply actively using its resources. Its size should be increased through the saving of
privatization proceeds and fiscal over performance, and over the longer-term through fiscal
savings as output strengthens. Its purposes, including as a buffer for aging, are somewhat unclear
and should be further examined to ensure that the FRA is appropriately structured and financed to
meet its multiple objectives.

ANNEX III. MAKING THE FISCAL FRAMEWORK AND
POLICY MORE SUPPORTIVE OF GROWTH1
With fiscal adjustment proceeding quickly in Bulgaria and given the weak economic environment,
there is keen interest in making the budget composition more growth friendly. This annex quantifies
the impact of fiscal policy on economic activity in Bulgaria using an econometric approach,2and
calibrating the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF) for Bulgaria.3 While the
impact has been modest in the past, as can be expected in a small open emerging economy, the
effect on output is not independent of the speed of adjustment and the specific consolidation
measures used. The impact of fiscal policy on economic activity is larger in downturns than in
expansions and capital spending and direct taxes are associated with the largest effects on output,
while non-targeted government transfers and indirect taxes are associated with a smaller impact.

A. Fiscal Multipliers in Bulgaria—an Empirical Approach
1.
The short-term impact of fiscal policy on output is frequently referred to as the fiscal
multiplier. This is defined as the change in output following an exogenous change in the fiscal
deficit with respect to their respective baselines (Spilimbergo and others, 2009). Fiscal multipliers
are smaller in more open economies and when monetary policy offsets the impact of the fiscal
shock. Little research so far has been done to determine fiscal multipliers in emerging economies.
For the advanced economies, Spilimbergo and others (2009) suggest that as a rule of thumb,
government consumption multipliers are 0.5 or less in small open economies, with smaller values
for revenue and transfers and slightly larger ones for investment.
2.
In Bulgaria fiscal multipliers have been modest, especially on the expenditure side
(Table 1). We estimate a structural VAR using quarterly accrual data from 1999 to 2011 on general
government revenues and expenditure, as well as GDP, all deflated with the GDP deflator.4 First
year spending multipliers are found to lie around zero and first year revenue multipliers are 0.3,
but are statistically insignificant. We therefore estimate the same model with monthly 2003–11
cash-based data with industrial production as a proxy for GDP.5 Over the sample, the impact on
GDP growth of revenue measures is now significant with an increase in taxes decreasing economic
activity, while expenditure multipliers remain insignificant. Further splitting the sample into a
pre-and post-EU accession period, shows that prior to 2007 both revenue and expenditure
multipliers were significant and positive with first-year multipliers of 0.4 and 0.2 respectively,
meaning that a rise in spending and cut in taxes had a positive effect on growth and vice versa.

The impact of fiscal policy varies with the business cycle, with multipliers being
larger in downturns than in expansions. This is intuitive since in times of a negative output gap,
the proportion of credit-constrained households

and firms, which adjust spending in response to
a change in disposable income, is higher. The

and others, 2012, Ilzetzki, 2011) that find

multipliers are mostly quite small in emerging
economies.
4.
However, the results for overall multipliers should be treated with caution. For
instance, the spending multiplier captures the effect of productive and unproductive spending on
output and the effects could have opposite directions decreasing the overall multiplier. Moreover,
the results are averages over time and since Bulgaria’s economy has seen significant structural
changes, a model based approach that takes into account the current features of the economy is
needed.

B. Is There a Better Way to Structure the Budget to Support Growth in
Bulgaria in the Future?
5.
With most of the adjustment needed to reach a balanced budget by 2015 already
completed, making the budget composition more growth friendly is the priority. A DSGE
model, such as the IMF’s GIMF, is well suited for this analysis since it is not subject to data
50

constraints and by calibrating the economy around its steady state, it gives us an insight into the
effects of future fiscal consolidation on output going forward.
6.
We use a 3-region model; Bulgaria, the euro area and the rest of the world. The
calibration is based on a variety of sources. We use national account ratios, tax revenues for the
different components, and general lump-sum transfers for 2011 (based on WEO data); trade
decomposition data for 2011 (based on WEO data, direction of trade statistics, and
U.N. COMTRADE data). The debt-to-GDP ratio is chosen to be 16 percent (equal to its
medium-term value). The share of liquidity constraint consumers is set to be 50 percent. We
assume that Bulgaria faces nominal rigidities in line with the rest of the world, unlike the euro area,
where nominal rigidities are 50 percent higher than the rest of the world.
7.
We consider the case where there is a permanent 1 percent of GDP decrease in the
budget balance, financed by one of seven fiscal instruments. On impact, the fiscal instrument
will change by 1 percent of GDP. However, as the fiscal consolidation leads to a lower level of
government debt, interest payments will decrease, providing the government with additional fiscal
space. We assume the government will use that additional fiscal space to reverse as much as
possible the change in the fiscal instrument being used in the consolidation process. In what
follows, we will assume that the fiscal consolidation is credible. The adjustment path under full
credibility is really a lower limit on the short-run costs from fiscal consolidation, as a temporarily
noncredible adjustment will be more costly.
8.
A ranking of the output loss associated with different consolidation measures can be
established based on GIMF. Multipliers differ significantly across instruments (Table 2). On the
spending side, investment has the highest multiplier, as a decrease in government investment in
infrastructure will act as a negative shock to the productivity of the economy. This is followed by
government wages and government purchases, which enter directly into GDP; although there is an
offset provided as there is less crowding out of domestic investment. General (non-targeted)
transfers to households are associated with the lowest output impact among spending
instruments, as this is a decrease in a lump sum instrument, which has the fewest economic

distortions. On the revenue side, corporate income taxes have the most negative effect on GDP,
followed by personal income taxes and consumption taxes have the lowest impact on GDP.
9.
We also investigate an increase in public investment financed by EU funds. More
specifically, the following is simulated: (i) a permanent 2 percent of current GDP increase in public
investment of which 85 percent is financed by grants, since EU-financed investment spending is
subject to a 15 percent co-payment. The 15 percent co-payment is financed in a budget neutral
way by a broadening of the tax base. (ii) The same as above except that the co-payment is
financed by a higher deficit.
10.
Increasing capital expenditure permanently raises real GDP. An increase by 2 percent
in the stock of public infrastructure increases the productivity of factors of production in the
economy and leads to permanent increases in GDP of about 3 percent of GDP after 10 years
(Figure 2). Moreover, a permanent increase in government investment can be more effective than
an increase in private investment, as government investment is typically on infrastructure such as
roads, hospitals, public institutions, etc., which depreciate at a slower rate than the stock of
machinery and equipment. Private investment begins rising immediately. Consumption also
increases since higher productive capacity lowers prices. The currency board means that while
nominal interest rates remain unchanged, real interest rates eventually fall, providing additional
stimulus. As the short-run level of aggregate demand in Bulgaria increases, there are greater
domestic inflationary pressures, leading to an appreciation of the real exchange rate in the
short-run. However, in the long-run there is a significant real depreciation (about 3 percent) since
the increase in government investment behaves the same as a permanent economy-wide increase
in productivity, making Bulgaria-produced goods cheaper to its trading partners.
11.
Financing the increased public investment in a budget neutral way (through a
broadening of the indirect tax base) is preferable to letting the deficit increase. The results
under the two methods of financing are qualitatively the same, but there are some quantitative
differences. In the short-run, consumption will be lower under the broader tax base than under
deficit financing, as the increase in the VAT has a direct impact on consumption. However, in the
medium term, deficit financing will lead to higher government demand for debt in local markets
(crowding out funding for private investment) and also a larger current account deficit, relative to
the case of a broader tax base. Without the downward pressure on investment from the higher
debt load, there is a stronger expansion of the economy’s productive capacity, allowing for higher
wage income and household wealth, and higher consumer spending (despite the drag of the
higher VAT). This is reinforced by the greater depreciation of the real exchange rate resulting from
less Bulgarian demand for foreign funding for its government debt when broadening the tax base.

C. Policy Implications
12.
The fact that multipliers differ significantly by instrument has important implications
for the optimal budget composition. Currently, the Bulgarian budget is growth friendly on the
revenue side: direct taxes rates are low and most revenues are collected through indirect taxes.
However, the tradition of underperforming on capital spending is clearly undesirable. In terms of
future plans, the analysis suggests the undesirability of raising government consumption, whereas
a strategy of increasing indirect tax revenues through base broadening and raising capital
spending has sizeable growth effects over the medium and long-term.
13.

The analysis points to several steps to make the budget more growth friendly:



The authorities should address barriers to EU funds absorption to increase capital spending on
infrastructure. Tackling the large shadow economy to broaden the tax base would also create
resources for higher productive spending on infrastructure.



Subsidies and other non-targeted government transfers need to be reviewed to make room
for more growth enhancing expenditure. Subsidies of SOEs in particular have been growing
over time but are associated with small multipliers.



Further pension reforms that increase the length of working lives will also have a salutary
effect on potential growth (Karam and others, 2010) with a relatively small short term
multiplier while helping contain projected spending increases.

APPENDIX I. EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSES
1.
External debt peaked in 2009 and has since declined. With public external debt falling
marginally from 8 percent of GDP at end-2009 to 7 percent of GDP at the end of 2011, the decline
in total external debt from 108 percent of GDP to 92 percent of GDP over this period was due to
private sector deleveraging. The main contributor was the external debt of banks, which fell from
24 percent of GDP at the end of 2009 to 15 percent of GDP at end-2011.
2.
Intra-company lending has been stable. Amortization falling due has been fully offset by
new lending in 2010 and 2011. As a result, the stock of intercompany lending relative to GDP fell
slightly, from 42 percent of GDP at end-2009 to 38 percent of GDP at end-2011, due to rising
nominal GDP.
3.
The counterpart of the private sector deleveraging was the reduction in the current
account deficit. The current account moved from a deficit of 25 percent of GDP in 2007 and
9 percent of GDP in 2009 to a slight surplus in 2011. Baseline medium-term balance of payments
projections indicate the current account returning to deficit, financed by foreign direct investment
flows.
4.
Projected external debt in the baseline projections declines further. It reaches around
65 percent of GDP by 2017 primarily due to nominal GDP growth, with relatively little change in
nominal external debt (which falls by just 2 percent from 2011 to 2017). In the historical scenario
the denominator effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio is even stronger because historical growth is
higher than projected growth (Figure 1 and Table 1).
5.
The decline in external debt relative to the size of the economy appears well
anchored. Shocks applied to the interest rate, the growth rate and the current account deficit
would shift the trajectory of external debt relative to GDP upwards. However, in these scenarios
the highest level of external debt reached by 2017 is 85 percent of GDP, which would still imply
declines in the ratio of external debt to GDP in coming years.
6.
Public debt remains at very manageable levels. At well below 20 percent of GDP at
present and in the baseline projections, Bulgaria’s indebtedness is small by international standards.
Assuming shocks to the baseline projections, the public debt ratio increases but remains below
30 percent of GDP in all scenarios considered (Figure 2 and Table 2). Risks from unaccounted
contingent liabilities (and worse-than-assumed downside scenarios) could result in higher
outcomes.

IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.

The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional

reforms aimed at Bulgaria’s successful EU integration and convergence. On May 17, 2011 the
Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the Bank which outlined the
roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period 2011–13. The CPS maintains a strong focus
on Bulgaria making the most of its EU membership. It aims to partner with Bulgaria in strengthening
national institutions and capacity to meet EU targets and in accelerating the absorption of EU grant
funds. The objective of the CPS is to support Bulgaria in strengthening institutions and policies to
achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The CPS proposes a program dominated by
knowledge and advisory services complemented by a modest lending program. World Bank

knowledge and advisory services focus on policy reforms, sector strategies and strengthening
institutional capacity for increased EU funds absorption. The Bank continues to undertake
substantial knowledge and advisory services on policy reforms in select sectors and themes of
Bulgaria’s National Reform Program 2011–2015 such as innovation, education, business
regulation, transport, water, climate change, and social inclusion.

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.

The Fund team led by Ms. Purfield (mission chief) meets regularly with the World Bank

Bulgaria team led by Mr. Markus Repnik (Country Manager for Bulgaria, the Czech Republic
and Slovakia), to discuss macro-critical structural reforms and to coordinate the two teams’
work. The most recent meeting took place in late September 2012.
3.

Bulgaria’s main macroeconomic challenges are to maintain stability and enhance

growth in a difficult external environment. Fiscal discipline and growth enhancing public
spending are key to supporting the currency board arrangement and improving growth prospects.
Continued prudent regulation and adequate capital buffers will help maintain financial system
stability, while improvements in the business climate will facilitate more sustainable tradable-based
growth.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

4.

Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified five structural reform areas as

macro critical in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and enhancing growth.


EU funds absorption. Increased absorption of EU funds through improvements of
administrative capacity and upgrading planning, execution, and monitoring systems will play a
vital role in supporting growth and investment. Rationalization of public administration through
elimination of unnecessary or duplicated units and restructuring staff will also be important.



Healthcare reform. Mispricing and other distorted incentives have created financing pressures
for the public health insurance fund, calling for a comprehensive reform focusing on efficiency
and quality of the system—including through rationalizing in-patient care.



Education reform. Building on past achievement, education reforms should focus on improving
results. The areas of reform include measures to enhance the quality of student learning and to
improve access to education.



Improving the environment for growth. Anchoring wage growth in productivity growth and
strengthening the business environment by improving the insolvency framework and reducing
the regulatory costs for doing business are called for.



Development of basic infrastructure and energy. Sustaining development of basic
infrastructure and energy are a high priority to improve the transportation network and
strengthen energy security, and hence improve competitiveness of the economy.

5.

The teams agreed that the Bank and the Fund share responsibility on financial sector

issues, revenue administration, and pension reforms, while the Bank will lead EU funds
absorption, basic infrastructure, business environment, education reforms, and social
inclusion. Both teams will keep the other apprised of upcoming missions and assessments. World
Bank country economists participated in the Article IV Consultations in May 2011 and
September 2012, and IMF staff has assisted with World Bank work on competitiveness.

C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
6.

The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria, discussed by the Bank’s

Board on May 17, 2011, is anchored in Bulgaria’s National Reform Program to implement the
Europe 2020 Strategy and focused on three main pillars: (i) policy reforms for the National Reform
Program to implement Europe 2020 Strategy, (ii) strategies and institutions to accelerate EU funds
absorption, and (iii) complementing EU financing.1
7.

The current active Bank portfolio in Bulgaria consists of 4 operations at the original

loan amount of US$353 million equivalent. The World Bank’s lending program in Bulgaria to date
comprises 46 IBRD operations with a total original commitment of US$3,003 million equivalent,
consisting of 15 adjustment loans (US$1,725.8 million), 24 investment projects (US$1,123 million),
one debt reduction loan (US$125 million), four Bank-managed Global Environmental Fund (GEF)
grants, and two Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) operations. Of these 46 operations,
42 have been completed (of which 13 have been fully or partially cancelled during implementation),
and 4 operations are currently under implementation (Table 1).

As of August, 2012, the IFC had 37 projects (completed and ongoing) in Bulgaria with

total commitments of over US$895 million. The single biggest investment of IFC in the country is
in the field of renewable energy in the form of a loan for the construction of the largest wind park in
Bulgaria. IFC is also involved in the development of the Galata gas field near the Black sea cost. In
line with the IFC’s strategic goals for Bulgaria, IFC has supported a company investing in agricultural
land and promoting land consolidation. In the financial sector, IFC is supporting two specialized SME
banks; it established Bulgaria’s first micro-lending bank and has invested in a venture fund, which is
also targeting the SME sector. In other industries, IFC had contributed to key manufacturing
projects—it has supported the modernization and expansion of an electronics producer, a large
steel mill, and two glass processing plants. Some IFC projects entail an important environmental
component. One of the manufacturing plants, for example, is purchasing equipment which would
reduce its GHG emissions and the electronics producing company is making sensors for cars that
monitor the emission of polluting gases and improve fuel efficiency.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Bulgaria participates in the SDDS since 2003.
Real Sector
1.

The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts,

based on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and the
European System of Accounts 1995. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are compiled
and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. However, government output and final
consumption are estimated on a cash basis. Published national accounts include current and capital
accounts for the five main domestic sectors (general government and its sub-sectors, financial
corporations, non-financial corporations, nonprofit institutions serving households, and households).
The INS publishes financial accounts and balance sheets by institutional sectors and sub-sectors on
an annual basis.
2.

The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure

approaches in current and constant prices since 1994. The preliminary flash estimates of GDP
and its components by production and expenditure side are produced and disseminated 42–44 days
after the reference period, although persistent inconsistencies in the data have limited their usage.
The quarterly updates are disseminated 70 days after the end of the reference quarter with final
figures disseminated after approximately 5 quarters. The annual data are disseminated about 5
quarters after the end of the reference year. The estimates at constant prices, which follow
international standards, use chain-linked indices. Problems remain in the coverage of private sector
activities as well as regarding constant price estimates of capital formation and external trade,
although progress has been made in the development of export and import deflators. Recent IMF
TA advised on improving the seasonal adjustment procedure of quarterly GDP and volume
measures of taxes on products.
3.

Regarding price data, the NSI produces a domestic consumer price index (CPI), a

harmonized consumer price index (HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer
price index (PPI). All are updated monthly. The CPI series begins in 1995, the PPI in 2000 and the
HICP in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The coverage of the consumer price indices
was extended, although they still exclude some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied housing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BULGARIA

and health and life insurance. Since 2004, financial services are included. Work has started on
inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the CPI under a Eurostat project. The geographical coverage
of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas that account for an estimated 65 percent of sales.
4.

The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system

for processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import unit
value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat in this area.
The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of the national
accounts. Each month the Foreign Trade Statistics Department of the NSI is in contact with the BNB
to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data and the
balance of payments data.
5.

The national account data on employment and hours worked are compiled by the NSI

based on a Labor Force Survey and Enterprises’ survey on employment—“Quarterly survey on
employees, hours worked, wages and salaries, and other expenditures paid by the employers” and
“Annual enterprises survey on employment, wages and salaries, and other labor cost” and adjusted
according to the ESA95 methodology. The NSI also obtains current monthly and quarterly estimates
from a quarterly survey of establishments using all public enterprises and a sample of private
employers. The sample includes 13,000 private employers out of approximately 191,000 qualifying
private enterprises. The NSI household labor force survey is an alternative source of data, but
improvements are needed to make it more consistent with the establishment survey, especially
regarding agricultural employment. Since the beginning of 2003 a quarterly continuous Labour
force survey, providing average quarterly results, is implemented.
6.

The NSI also compiles and publishes wage data for various economic sectors. The main

shortcomings include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; and (ii) reporting of average gross
earnings only and not wages by occupation. Since 2002, every four years a survey on earnings is
conducted which provides information about average monthly and hourly earnings by economic
activity, by occupation, by gender and by education. The household budget survey could provide an
alternative source of data for private sector wages.
7.

A Population Census was conducted in early 2001 and is a source for redesigning the

household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the labor
force survey.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

Government finance
8.

In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission and

within the framework of fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, the authorities have
made significant progress on implementing accrual accounting for government, budgetary
and statistical systems. Consolidated data on a cash basis, covering general and central
government operations, are routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook/Annual CD-ROM
and in IFS. In addition, quarterly accrual GFS data for the whole general government are reported for
publication in IFS, through Eurostat. The major part of the GFS data is compiled by NSI and the
transmissions to Eurostat are carried out by NSI. Since September 2008, the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) prepares and submits the SDDS indicators for the central government finances in the IMF’s
GFSM 2001 format. The same indicators are published on the MOF’s website on a monthly and
quarterly basis.
9.

The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated

government budget on a monthly basis, following the national presentation. These data are
not according to GFS standards. Aggregate data on revenue, expenditure, balance of the general
government and composition of financing (in national formats) are published in the monthly bulletin
and posted on the MOF’s website, in addition to the GFSM 2001 data. Progress has been made in
presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including expenditure by functional classification. In
addition, a full economic classification of expenditure is now available, and the authorities have
provided such data on an annual basis back to 1998.
Money and banking statistics
10.

The BNB reports monetary data for publication in IFS based on the ECB framework for the

collection and compilation of monetary data.
Balance of payments
11.

Bulgaria provides quarterly balance of payments (BOP) statistics for dissemination in

IFS on a timely basis. Yearly BOP data are disseminated in the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook up to 2011. The BNB derives other sectors’ investment income data on reinvested
earnings (debit) from the annual direct investment surveys of the NSI, as well as through surveys of
the largest foreign-owned enterprises for preliminary estimates. Starting from 2002, data series on
freight were revised according to a new methodology introduced jointly by the BNB and the NSI.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with
Bulgaria
On November 30, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bulgaria. 1
Background
Growth has been lackluster since the crisis leaving unemployment high and output below its
pre-crisis levels. Real GDP growth in the first half of 2012 was positive, but low—at
0.9 percent. Domestic demand gained some traction on improved EU funds absorption and
consumption, but the slowdown in external demand led to a negative external sector
contribution. With little change foreseen for the second half of 2012, real GDP growth is
expected to grow by 1 percent in 2012 and gain pace in 2013 provided external conditions
improve. The current account, which registered a small surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP
in 2011, has moved into deficit as imports outpace exports. Headline inflation is expected to
average 2½ percent in 2012 due to higher food and fuel prices. The unemployment rate has
continued to rise reaching 11.5 percent in September and, absent strong growth, will stay in
this range.
Strong buffers and steadfast policy implementation have allowed Bulgaria to maintain
stability in a challenging environment. The fiscal deficit has continued to decline and is on

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

track to fall below the budget target of 1.5 percent of GDP; public debt is the second lowest in
the EU. The fiscal adjustment, which amounted to a cumulative structural improvement in 201112 of 2 percent of GDP, was largely expenditure-based. In the financial sector, the difficult
economic environment has worsened profitability and asset quality (non-performing loans
reached 16.9 percent of loans in mid 2012). However, reflecting prudent supervisory policies,
the overall capital adequacy ratio (16.7 percent in June) comfortably exceeds the already large
12 percent regulatory minimum with additional cushions available in the form of specific
provisions.
Some progress has been made in tackling structural bottlenecks to growth but more needs to
be done to boost productivity, raise growth prospects, and create jobs. Reforms of the public
administration and public pension system have contributed to more sustainable public finances
over the long term. Streamlining of administrative processes and the new public procurement
law facilitated a marked step-up in EU funds absorption, particularly for infrastructure. These
reforms combined with a stable macro environment improved Bulgaria’s ranking on some
international competitiveness scoreboards. Still unemployment, particularly among the young
and less skilled, remains very high, labor productivity has lagged real wage growth since the
crisis, and firms are reluctant to hire given the unpredictable business environment and high
debt burden.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ prudent policy implementation, which has
ensured macroeconomic and financial stability in a difficult external environment. Nevertheless,
Directors noted that this subdued external environment is limiting near–term economic growth
and that unemployment remains high, especially among the young and low–skilled. Further,
rollover risks related to private external debt and rising nonperforming bank loans present
vulnerabilities, while aging pressures and the income gap with other European Union members
pose longer-term challenges. Accordingly, Directors emphasized that this uncertain
environment calls for maintaining prudent policies and buffers, and that bolder structural reforms
will be needed to revive growth.
Directors broadly agreed that the currency board arrangement has served Bulgaria well. They
welcomed the fiscal adjustment that has been achieved, with the budget currently close to
structural balance, and encouraged the authorities to preserve this achievement in the
forthcoming election year. Directors viewed the 2015 target of budget balance as appropriate,
and agreed that it provides space for automatic stabilizers to work in the event of a shock. They
considered that rebuilding the fiscal reserve through saving fiscal over-performance or
privatization receipts would strengthen Bulgaria’s defenses, and recommended a review to
appropriately tailor its structure and funding.
Directors observed that the financial system is stable with high buffers but that the low growth
environment poses challenges. They emphasized the need for continued vigilance and
sustained efforts to ensure sufficient capital and liquidity buffers in the weaker pockets of the

3
system. Directors underlined that banks should actively address non-performing loans to
support the recovery, and encouraged the authorities to continue to press for conservative
provisioning and improve in- and out-of-court procedures. Further, the authorities’ resolution
powers and toolkit should be expanded.
Directors considered that improving the composition of the budget, through increased spending
on infrastructure investment and active labor market policies, would support growth. To
preserve budget targets, this should be financed via EU funds absorption, better tax
compliance, and reductions in subsidies. The absorption of EU funds is key, due to their size,
the large grant element, and the potential impact on growth and employment. Directors also
encouraged the improvement of the insolvency framework to support the business environment,
in particular by eliminating backdating of insolvencies. Ensuring the proper functioning of the
labor market, notably at the lower end, would help reduce differences in unemployment and
income, as would more targeted education and training. Finally, Directors welcomed the
upcoming review of social insurance thresholds and minimum wages to encourage job creation,
and underscored that future wage increases should be anchored in productivity gains.

Statement of Mr. Snel and Mr. Manchev on Bulgaria
November 30, 2012
1.
The Bulgarian authorities highly appreciate the constructive dialogue with the Fund
and broadly share the staff’s appraisal. They remain committed to prudent macroeconomic
policies. Bulgaria weathered the crisis relatively well which is testimony to the strength of
the policy framework and its implementation. Under the Currency Board Arrangement, the
authorities will continue implementing strict fiscal policies, stringent prudential regulations,
as well as maintain the financial sector buffers in order to counter potential shocks.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
2.
In view of the adverse external developments since the last Article IV consultation,
the authorities have made substantial policy efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability and
sustainability. They continued with the fiscal consolidation committed under the 2012
Budget Law to further lower the deficit. In July 2012, the authorities took advantage of the
temporary window and successfully issued Eurobonds at a favorable rate. This should secure
smooth repayment of the existing Eurobond in January 2013. Some important structural
reforms were boosted further.
3.
The real economy has yet to recover from the pre crisis output level. The most recent
flash GDP estimates suggested that during the Q3, economic growth remained moderate at
0.5 percent (seasonally adjusted data) compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The
indicator's movement is determined mainly by the increase recorded in the agricultural sector
(by 6.3 percent) and industry (by 3.5 percent). The services sector declined by 1 percent over
the observed period.
4.
During 2012, Bulgaria’s terms of trade deteriorated due to external spillovers.
Between January and September 2012, exports grew modestly by 2.2 percent year-on-year,
compared to 34.2 percent during the same period last year. As a result, the trade deficit
widened and reached EUR 2.7 billion (6.9 percent of GDP) in the first nine months of 2012,
against a deficit of EUR 1.3 billion (3.3 percent of GDP) in January – September 2011.
5.
The competitiveness of the economy has been preserved. Labor productivity
continues to grow after the decline in employment and subsequent moderation in wage
growth. Sustained faster growth rates of productivity in Bulgaria compared to the EU average
attracted foreign investments. However, the seasonal labor market revival decelerated during
the second and third quarters, and remained unable to reverse the negative annual trend in
unemployment. Expectations for labor market developments in 2013 are related to the
stabilization of the main indicators around their 2012 levels.
6.
While showing some signs of recovery, domestic demand remains suppressed.
According to flash GDP estimates, in Q3 the recovery in final consumption decelerated to
2.9 percent (seasonally adjusted data) compared to the same quarter of the previous year, and
down from 3.2 percent in Q2. The still high unemployment rate and uncertainty about future
income were also factors that affected consumer demand.

2

7.
Investment activity appears to be stabilizing, supported mainly by public projects and
some recovery in FDI, especially in the energy sector. After a slowdown in the rate of decline
during the last three quarters, the gross fixed capital formation increased by 1 percent
(seasonally adjusted data) in Q3, compared to the same quarter in 2011. For the first nine
months of 2012, FDI in Bulgaria totaled EUR 971.8 million (2.5 percent of GDP), against
EUR 711.9 million (1.8 percent of GDP) in the same period of 2011. Next year, investment is
expected to be initially supported by public sector projects funded by the EU.
8.
The pressures from the earlier surge in world energy prices are easing, following the
stabilization in international oil prices. Since June 2012, the annual average HICP inflation
remained flat at 2.3 percent. In October, the HICP inflation reached 2.7 percent since the
beginning of the year.
Fiscal Policy
9.
The authorities deserve credit for implementing another round of fiscal consolidation,
and further lowering the deficit during a slow economy in late 2011 and early 2012 (in
seasonally adjusted terms). Bulgaria exited the EU’s excessive deficit procedure in
mid-2012. Performance up till now suggests that the 2012 deficit target of 1.3 percent of
GDP (ESA 95 methodology) will be comfortably met. Bulgaria has now one of the lowest
deficits and public debt ratios in the EU, far below the thresholds set by the Treaty, the new
EU Fiscal Compact, and national limits. As pointed by staff, reaching the 2015 target for a
structurally balanced budget will require only 0.4 percent of GDP in additional structural
measures. This provides the government with some degree of flexibility in the next election
year.
10.
In the current highly uncertain environment, the authorities are well aware that a
strong fiscal policy is critical to sustain macroeconomic stability and ensure stable footing for
growth. The 2011–12 restructuring of the tax and customs administration has already
provided revenue stabilization, greater efficiency of tax collection, and eradication of
financial fraud and tax evasion in key sectors. The tax policy will remain broadly unchanged
until 2015, as part of the strategy to provide a stable and predictable environment for
businesses. On the expenditure side, the authorities will maintain restrictive medium-term
budgetary framework in line with the 2012 Convergence program of the Republic of
Bulgaria. In addition, risks from contingent liabilities in the energy and transport sectors have
been reduced by cancelling the construction of the Belene nuclear power plant, and the
reform of the railway system to eliminate public subsidies by 2013.
11.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy in 2013 is to continue spending optimization in the
national budget in order to release the necessary co-financing for accelerated absorption of
funds under EU programs, in view of the approaching end of the programming period
2007–2013. The increase in the national budget balance by 0.7 percent of GDP due to a
decrease in administrative expenditure will be offset by higher absorption of the EU funds,
which results in a balance deterioration of 0.7 percent of GDP. The overall general
government deficit in 2013 will remain almost unchanged from 2012. Among the priorities

3
of the 2013 budget are some social and growth-enhancing policies. Average pensions will be
indexed by 9.3 percent in April 2013 to compensate for the inflation of the last three years.
Public wages will remain largely frozen for a fourth year. At the same time, interest income
from term bank deposits will be included in the income tax base and the minimum social
security contributions thresholds will be raised by 10 percent to counter under-recording of
incomes.
12.
The authorities welcomed staff’s analysis on fiscal multipliers. They agreed that the
results should be treated with caution, especially when the model-based policy proposals
ought to serve policymakers in such highly uncertain external environment. They also noted
that, in general, the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models are known as being
driven by the pre-analytic belief in validity of a certain model, and subject to a number of
calibration problems. The authorities remain open for further discussions on fiscal
multipliers based on empirical data research and country experiences.
13.
The fiscal reserve has served the authorities well as a liquidity buffer during the
crisis. In their view, it remains sufficient to meet the current liquidity needs of the budget.
The authorities found staff’s analysis on fiscal reserves and its role in the macroeconomic
adjustment consistent with their own long-term policy strategy. They plan to rebuild the
reserves over time, but do not consider a substantial debt issuance in 2013. It is the
authorities’ view that fiscal reserve could do little as a shock absorber, given the high degree
of openness of the Bulgarian economy and the magnitude of external spillovers. In case of a
further deterioration of the external environment or of revenue performance, as a first line of
defense the authorities will consider compensatory expenditure measures, and faster than
initially envisaged optimization in public finance management.
Monetary and Macro-prudential Policies and Financial Sector Development
14.
The strong commitment of all political players to the Currency Board Arrangement
(CBA)—supported by a more than adequate reserve level (coverage of imports of above
6 months)—is an additional buffer against shocks. The CBA has proved its flexibility and
sustainability both during the boom prior to the crisis and in the cyclical downturn. The
authorities agreed with staff that CBA remains the appropriate anchor for policies until the
eventual euro adoption. It also has continuous support from macro—prudential policies
during the current economic adjustment.
15.
The authorities remain vigilant. They are aware that since the global crisis has
erupted, the Bulgarian financial system has operated in a challenging low-growth
environment. The BNB continues its policy from the pre-crisis period towards strengthening
the accumulated capital and liquidity buffers. In return, the financial system, dominated by
the banking sector, remains stable, well capitalized and highly liquid, and so are individual
banks.
16.
The strong and persistent risk-aversion of the supervisory authorities led to a more
diversified funding structure with less reliance on foreign funding in the post-crisis period.
The majority of the banks remained profitable following the restructuring of their operating

4
expenses, which additionally boosted credibility in the system. The authorities intend to
properly address the problems in the existing insolvency framework, in particular those
related to the backdating of insolvencies.
Structural Reforms
17.
The authorities are fully aware that sustainable economic growth requires further
structural reforms. They remain committed to provide strong financial footing to the pension,
healthcare, education and railroad transportation systems. In compliance with the
recommendations from the European Commission’s and the IMF to accelerate pension
reform, a more comprehensive package of policy measures became effective from January 1,
2012. A procedure to privatize the state railroad cargo company has been re-launched.
Progress with other reforms, however, has been limited or is lagging behind due to a
combination of factors like unfavorable market conditions, insufficient institutional capacity,
and constrained financial resources.
