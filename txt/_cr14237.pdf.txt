STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 12, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is being severely tested by the Syria crisis. The refugee influx has
reached one quarter of the population, fueling already high unemployment and poverty.
The political impasse from the presidential elections—following months of negotiations
over a new government—adds to the uncertainty. The economy is meanwhile suffering
from a broad-based deterioration, with subdued growth and widening fiscal imbalances.
Public debt is on the rise. Progress on structural reforms has been limited. On the
positive side, deposit inflows have held up and foreign exchange reserves are sizeable;
and security conditions have significantly improved, lifting tourism prospects.
Key challenges: There is an urgent need for fiscal adjustment to achieve a sustainable
debt reduction, and structural reforms to boost growth and address social inequities.
Key policy recommendations:









Fiscal policy. The immediate priority is to stop the fiscal deterioration and return
to primary surpluses, to avoid a possible loss of market confidence and put debt
on a sustainable path. The consolidation strategy should minimize the impact of a
planned salary increase for the public sector; include broad-based and nondistortionary revenue measures; and rebalance expenditure away from electricity
transfers toward capital and social spending, to promote inclusive growth. Passing
a budget for 2014 would help anchor confidence. Fiscal management should be
strengthened and anchored in a medium-term perspective.
Monetary policy. The Banque du Liban (BdL) should continue to maintain high
foreign exchange reserves as a buffer and signal of commitment to macro-financial
stability. It should gradually withdraw from T-bill auctions, and adopt a strategy to
improve its balance sheet over time.
Financial sector. Capital buffers should be strengthened, and the loan
classification and restructuring rules and the AML/CFT regime further enhanced.
Structural reforms. Reforms in the electricity sector and the labor market are
imperative to address current competitiveness pressures, lay the foundations for
higher-productivity growth, and improve social conditions.
Refugee crisis. Lebanon cannot shoulder the costs of the massive inflow of Syrian
refugees alone, and international budget support is needed. Strong government
commitment to adjustment and reforms—along with a concerted policy
framework to deal with the refugee crisis—would bolster credibility and help
mobilize support.

Discussions took place in Beirut during April 23–May 7, 2014. The staff team
comprised Mses. Fedelino (head), Luca, and Nakhle (local economist),
Messrs. Alshahrani and Parodi (all MCD), Mr. Jarmuzek (FAD), Mr. Lambert
(MCM), and Mr. Takizawa (SPR). Mr. Mazarei (MCD) and Ms. Choueiri (OED)
joined some of the policy discussions. The team met Prime Minister Salam,
Minister of Finance Khalil, Governor of the Banque du Liban (BdL) Salame,
members of parliament, and representatives of the private sector, civil
society, academia and the international community. The team held a
workshop, jointly with the BdL and the ministry of finance, to discuss
background papers covering the impact of the Syria crisis on Lebanon’s
economy; the development of capital and insurance markets; and options
for the design of a fiscal framework for Lebanon’s prospective gas and oil
resources (to be included in the Selected Issue Papers accompanying this
report). The mission issued a concluding statement, published at

CONTEXT
1.
The crisis in Syria is having a dramatic impact on Lebanon. It has created

humanitarian support for the refugees
has been substantial, though regional
and international support to the government and affected host communities has so far been
significantly below the authorities’ estimated needs.
2.
Political uncertainty remains high. The Syria crisis has further exacerbated sectarian
divisions and complicated domestic politics, resulting in prolonged periods of impasse. It took
eleven months to form and ratify (in March) a national unity government. Parliament failed to
elect a new president within the constitutional deadline of May 25. This vacuum could last several
months before consensus on a new president could be reached; it is currently disrupting efforts
to pass legislation—including a much debated salary increase for the public sector, which is
causing repeated strikes. Parliamentary elections in November (already postponed from
June 2013) add to the uncertainty in 2014.

Lebanon has an opportunity to change course. It has a history of weathering severe
shocks, but unlike in the past, pressures are now multi-faceted and prolonged. The government
has shown determination in addressing security conditions, which have significantly improved in
recent months. But the same resolve is also needed to tackle widening imbalances and advance
reforms to promote stronger, sustainable, and more equitable growth. The 2014 Article IV
Consultation provided an opportunity to discuss these themes and identify areas for change.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS
Macroeconomic conditions have suffered a broad-based deterioration since the last Article IV—
largely driven by the Syria crisis—though signs of resilience remain.
5.
Economic growth has remained significantly below pre-Syria crisis levels. Spillovers
from the Syria crisis have weighed on the economy—already in a downturn in 2011—through
far-reaching real, external, and fiscal channels (Box 1 and Selected Issue Paper). Growth stood at
2.5 percent in 2012, and further decelerated to 1.5 percent in 2013 as traditional drivers of
growth—real estate-related activities, construction and tourism—have been affected by
increasing uncertainty and deteriorating security (Figure 1). Tourism, in particular, was badly hit
by the GCC countries’ advisories against travel to Lebanon, in place during the past two years.
Some restrictions were lifted in May, reflecting improved security conditions.
6.
Inflation appears contained, though there are measurement issues. At 4 percent, the
average official CPI for the last two years does not show pressures in housing and food prices,
which have been particularly affected by additional demand from refugees. However, rent
increases were not included until recently in the CPI;1 while in areas where the refugees have
settled, rents have reportedly increased by at least 20 percent last year. Official food inflation has
also not increased, as Syria-related disruptions to transit routes have diverted to domestic
markets food previously exported to regional markets, thus relieving demand pressures.
7.
The external current account deficit has remained large, at about 13 percent of GDP
in both 2012 and 2013 (Figure 1). The trade balance has remained broadly unchanged as a share
of GDP over the two years, as both imports and exports contracted—the latter reflecting a drop
in gold exports and lower exports to the region. Similarly, the service balance has been affected
by a drop in tourism receipts from the GCC countries, though partly contained by additional
spending on services by a growing number of non-resident Syrians.2 Net current transfers have
picked up, reflecting significant humanitarian assistance, as well as lower outflows due to Syrian
workers likely supporting relatives that moved to Lebanon.

1

Housing prices were not regularly surveyed in the past; a survey was conducted in July 2012 after a three-year
break. Since January 2014, the Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) has been compiling a new index, which
now includes monthly housing price surveys.
2

Unregistered refugees are treated as non-residents for balance of payments purposes. Reportedly a large
number of well-off Syrians have moved to Beirut.

Box 1. Spillovers from the Syria Crisis
The conflict in Syria is overshadowing Lebanon. Over 1 million refugees have arrived to Lebanon since
the onset of the conflict. The impact of the crisis has been felt throughout the economy, though
quantification is hampered by the lack of reliable data (see Selected Issues Paper).
The Syria crisis is also having a profound and perhaps long-lasting social impact. The World Bank
estimates that poverty increased by 4 percentage points in 2013,1 and the labor supply will rise by about
50 percent by end-2014, with a pronounced impact on unskilled labor, youth and women.
Lebanon could not create sufficient jobs even
before the Syria crisis. According to the World
Bank, only some 3,800 jobs were generated per
year (one for every six new entrants to the labor
market) in 2005–09.1 Reflecting insufficient job
opportunities, the unemployment rate stood at
11 percent in 2011, slightly above the MENA
average of 10 percent. Like in the MENA region,
unemployment was much higher among the
youth—over one third of labor force participants
aged 15–24 are unemployed. Around half of the
labor force was employed in the informal sector.

.

The influx of refugees has deeply impacted the labor market, potentially increasing unemployment
to about 20 percent. The unemployment rate among refugees is roughly 30 percent.2 More than
60 percent of refugees work in the low-skilled sector (agriculture, personal services and construction), and
are willing to accept much lower wages than Lebanese workers, putting downward pressure on wages and
displacing Lebanese workers.
Illustrative scenarios highlight the challenge of reducing unemployment, even when assuming that
the refugees begin to return to Syria as early as 2016 (see Selected Issue Paper).3 Under the baseline
scenario, unemployment would be reduced only

The authorities have appealed to the international community to help fund the costs of the Syrian
crisis. There has been significant humanitarian support (amounting to close to $1 billion in 2013 alone, see
Selected Issue Paper), though so far budget support, including through a dedicated trust fund established
by the World Bank, has been limited.

Hosting the large refugee population is adding to fiscal strains. The direct budgetary
costs are not known with precision, as there are no dedicated budgetary lines for refugee-related
spending by line ministries; expenditure tracking is further hampered by the fact that refugees
are not concentrated in specific areas or camps. The World Bank estimated the overall fiscal
impact of the Syria crisis at a cumulative $2.6 billion over the period 2012–14 (about 6 percent of
the 2013 GDP), with an additional $2.5 billion needed to return public services to their pre-crisis
quality (Box 1 and Selected Issue Paper).3

Despite the higher risks, T-bill rates have remained broadly unchanged. The

The BdL has proactively sought to maintain stability. Supported by sustained deposit
inflows, the BdL has continued to attract banks’ foreign exchange deposits, keeping gross
reserves at a comfortable $35 billion at end-April—about 11 months of imports or 25 percent of
broad money. The BdL has also

position. Finally, the BdL has supported
credit to the private sector—still growing at an annual rate of 10 percent—by providing $1 billion
in low-cost funds to banks to on-lend to specific economic sectors.5 All these operations have
further weakened its balance sheet.
12.
Foreign exchange and financial markets have been largely resilient. Deposits have
continued to grow at 7–8 percent a year, though with some occasional outflows. Dollarization
declined in 2012, but has been since on an upward trend, reaching 65.8 percent at end-April—
still below the end-2011 level (Figure 3). Eurobond spreads have moved in line with regional
averages and stand at levels similar to end-2011. Standard & Poor’s upgraded the outlook in
April, from negative to stable—on account of the continued resilience of deposit inflows and
improved political conditions following the government formation—while maintaining the rating
for the sovereign and the three largest banks at B-.

5

The BdL has launched another stimulus plan of about $800 million—similar to the $1 billion package for 2013—
and a new scheme for banks of about $400 million to invest in start-ups in the knowledge economy.

Box 2. Public Sector Wages
A substantial increase of public sector wages was set in motion in 2012. This includes three
components: (i) an increase in the minimum wage; (ii) the application of a cost of living adjustment; and (iii)
the adoption of a new salary scale.1 The first two elements were approved in September 2012, effective
February 1, 2012. The salary scale adjustment has been subject to considerable debate and changes, by
cabinet and two parliamentary committees; it still has not been passed by parliament. If approved as per
the latest draft, it would add another LL970 billion annually (1.3 percent of the 2014 GDP) to the wage bill.
If implemented, the salary scale adjustment would
further exacerbate budget rigidities. Lebanon’s
wage bill—while not higher than comparators in the
region—represents a large share of spending and
absorbs more than 30 percent of government revenue.
The planned increase—and its possible impact on
pensions and other personnel costs—would thus
further limit fiscal space.

Focusing on wages only can be misleading. Central
government employees receive about twenty different
allowances and indemnities in addition to their basic
salary—exceeding it in some cases. On average these
represent about one third of basic salary spending.
Over the period 2003–12, allowances and indemnities
amounted to an average of 2.7 percent of GDP,
bringing total personnel costs to around 10 percent
of GDP.

(such as reducing the maximum number of overtime hours; capping bonuses and benefits as a share of
total monthly salaries; and revising the number of years of service for eligibility to retirement) are currently
not under consideration.
Salary increases will directly and permanently impact pensions. Pensions are adjusted in line with salary
increases granted to those in active duty, and not just to reflect cost of living adjustments, as standard
practice in many countries. In addition, pension benefits are also granted to surviving spouses and
unmarried, divorced or widowed daughters of retirees, if unemployed—thus significantly extending the
period over which pension benefits are drawn. All these elements, which add to the costs of the salary
adjustment scale, have not been considered explicitly in the ongoing debate.

The monthly minimum wage was increased to LL675,000 from LL500,000 (equivalent to $448 and $332, respectively). Prior to this
increase, a cost of living adjustment for the public sector was last granted in 1999. A minimum wage increase for the private sector was
implemented in 2008.

Box 3. Policies Since the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Macro policies have been partly in line with staff advice. The 2011 consultation called for fiscal
discipline (preserving a primary surplus position) and a reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. However,
the fiscal position has deteriorated substantially starting in 2012—a primary deficit was recorded in 2012
for the first time since 2006—reflecting weak growth and expansionary policy measures (most notably, the
reduction of excises, the removal of VAT on gasoil, and public sector wage increases). In line with staff
recommendations, the authorities raised in 2012 interest rates on T-bills with maturities less than seven
years to reduce the budget’s reliance on BdL financing.
There was some progress on structural reforms. The 2011 consultation highlighted the need for reforms
toward faster and more inclusive growth and economic resilience. On the positive side, measures included
the approval of the capital markets law and continued strong bank supervision, along with initial steps
toward exploring offshore oil and gas reserves. In addition, the ministry of finance established a macrofiscal unit (which has produced a medium-term expenditure framework), and a public debt directorate
(which has developed a Medium-Term Debt Strategy). There was some progress in implementing the
comprehensive electricity sector strategy (see Box 4). Investment in the electricity sector to increase
capacity is welcome, though it will need to be accompanied in the future by tariff increases toward cost
recovery levels to reduce the sizeable subsidies to the electricity company, once electricity provision
increases. Other reforms have been slow to implement—particularly in telecommunication, the global
income tax and the Treasury Single Account. The provision of statistical information has generally remained
weak, though progress is being made in a number of areas.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Risks remain high given Lebanon’s exposure to developments in Syria, and would be amplified by a
lack of corrective policies.
13.
Without a resolution in Syria, economic performance is expected to remain weak.
Growth is likely to linger at around 2 percent this year, reflecting domestic and regional
uncertainties. For projection purposes, staff assumes that the Syria conflict will be resolved by
2016, when growth will return to potential—a moderate 4 percent—and refugees will start
gradually returning to Syria. Inflation is projected to pick up later this year and next year,
reflecting the impact of a planned wage increase (see next section). The current account deficit is
projected to decline only slightly over the medium term, as a rebound in exports will be to a
large extent offset by higher imports. Financing needs would remain high, reflecting large fiscal
and current account deficits.

further destabilize social
structures and increase economic costs; a prolonged refugee crisis would strain the already-weak
public service provision, with added costs to the budget, put further pressure on the labor and
housing markets, and threaten law and order. Failure to address infrastructure bottlenecks could
reduce Lebanon’s competitiveness and growth potential. Higher-than-expected increases in
global interest rates could push Lebanon into tighter monetary policy, with rising financing costs
negatively affecting the government and the banking sector.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. They
agreed that further spillovers from the Syria crisis present the most serious risk to the economy.
More specifically, they expressed high concern about the impact of the refugees on Lebanon’s
economy and local communities, especially if significant donor budget support fails to
materialize. Some noted that the lack of a government strategy on refugees was taking its toll,
and the open border policy needed to be revisited; consideration of alternative forms of hosting
the refugees (e.g., in designated areas) was taking hold in some political quarters.
16.
The authorities nonetheless remained confident in Lebanon’s ability to withstand
shocks. They underlined the proven resilience of deposits and BdL’s large reserve buffer. Finally,
they also noted the upside potential stemming from Lebanon’s possible involvement in Syria’s
post-conflict reconstruction, which could significantly boost growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Policy discussions centered on the urgent need for credible fiscal adjustment and
structural reforms. The current fiscal deterioration needs to be reversed and the primary surplus
restored, while addressing underlying weaknesses in public service provision and social safety
nets. Tackling these challenges will help ensure fiscal sustainability, anchor market confidence,
and improve equity. Strong commitment to fiscal discipline could also help mobilize budget
support for the costs of the refugee crisis, by providing a policy framework and dispelling
skepticism about the government’s ability to tackle pressures head on.

A. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
Discussions on fiscal policy were overshadowed by the still unresolved debate on a salary scale
adjustment for the public sector and revenue measures to offset its costs. The size, composition, and
timing of the package are still under parliamentary consideration.
18.
Fiscal policy needs an anchor. There have been no approved budgets since 2005 and
accounts have not been officially closed since 1993. Fiscal policy has been lacking a mediumterm perspective, with spending conducted largely through treasury advances and ad-hoc
measures in times of pressures. Despite progress on fiscal reforms, policymaking continues to
fare low in terms of transparency

19.
Large budget rigidities persist.
Over 70 percent of current spending
comprises of transfers to the loss-making
Electricité du Liban (EdL), public sector
wages, and interest payments. Capital
spending—already compressed by
regional standards—has been often cut
to curb deficits, further exacerbating
Lebanon’s infrastructure deficit (Figure 2).

Significant spending pressures are building up. The main increase will stem from a
much debated salary scale adjustment for the public sector, with an estimated cost (excluding
pensions) of 1.3 percent of the 2014 GDP on a permanent basis.6 This increase is part of a salary
package proposed by cabinet in 2012 (Box 2). Parliament approved some elements (including
offsetting revenue measures), before legislative sessions were suspended due to the presidential

6

Staff assumed that the salary increase will start being paid in the second half of 2014, with retroactive payment
as of July 1, 2014 and no installments, as proposed by the latest parliamentary committee. All accompanying
revenue measures would be implemented on January 1, 2015.

elections.7 At the same time, ongoing capital projects in the electricity sector (about 1 percent of
GDP, see below) and additional social spending related to the Syrian refugees (about 0.3 percent
of GDP through 2016) add to spending pressures in the near term. On the positive side, transfers
to EdL are projected to decline, but largely on account of lower oil prices (Box 4). Staff thus noted
that the authorities should not rely on these savings, which are subject to significant oil price
uncertainty; and that without reforms of the electricity sector and increases in tariffs—unchanged
since 1996—EdL will continue to be a significant drag on public finances.
21.
The revenue measures approved so far will be insufficient to offset higher
spending. These measures include: (i) an increase in the interest income tax rate from 5 to
7 percent; (ii) an increase in the corporate income tax rate from 15 to 17 percent; (iii) a new
capital gain tax on real estate transactions; (iv) increases in tobacco excises; and (v) increases in
various stamps and fees. Staff estimated the measures’ annual yield at around 1 percent of the
2015 GDP. Increases in the VAT rate from 10 to 11 percent, and to 15 percent for selected luxury
items; and the application of penalties on illegal seashore buildings are still under discussion.
22.
On current policies, risks to public debt sustainability would increase. The budget
deficit would rise to about 12 percent of GDP in 2015, largely reflecting the salary scale
adjustment, and remain broadly at that level afterwards (text table). The primary position would
reach a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015, and then gradually improve—largely benefitting
from a reduction in transfers to EdL as oil prices are projected to decline over the medium
term—but remain negative. Under this scenario, debt and financing needs would continue to
rise, reaching 155 percent and 40 percent of GDP, respectively, thus exposing Lebanon to
considerable debt vulnerabilities (Annex I).

Box 4. Electricity Sector Reforms
The electricity subsidy absorbs a large share of public spending. The government transferred
4.5 percent of GDP to Electricité du Liban (EdL) in 2013. As electricity tariffs have remained unchanged

percent in non-technical losses—from illegal
connections/theft and uncollected bills).1 In addition, EdL currently has 2,019 MW of installed generating
capacity, compared to a peak demand of 3,195 MW.2 Supply covers only some 18 hours per day on
average, with frequent blackouts. Back-up private generators are extensively used, but at a cost that is
three times the level of EdL tariffs. Seventy five percent of Lebanese firms identify electricity as a major
constraint to business operations (compared to 52 percent in the MENA region).3

Reforms of the electricity sector have long been on the table, but progress has been scant. The
2011 “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” aimed at increasing production to 4,000 MW by 2014, with
an estimated total cost of $6.5 billion, to be funded equally by the government and the private sector.
The plan hinged on increasing generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure; diversifying fuel
sources by converting most plants to natural gas; adopting a new tariff structure; and revising the legal
framework (including ultimately EdL corporatization). Some progress was made to build a new power
plant and rehabilitate existing ones, and launch a Liquefied Natural Gas Public-Private Partnership. Three
private distribution service providers started operations; and two power barges were rented to
supplement power production while power plants are being built. However, demand from refugees is
estimated to equal roughly the electricity supplied by the barges, setting back expected supply
improvements.
On current policies, transfers to EdL are expected to decline on the back of decreasing oil prices.
These declines account for a large reduction in transfers (0.6 percent of GDP in the medium term), but as
the experience in the late 2000s shows, they do not provide sustainable savings.

Raising the average EdL tariff toward cost recovery levels would reduce transfers by an additional
0.8 percent of GDP—and in a more sustainable way. The Ministry of Energy and the EdL have
prepared a proposal, with assistance from the World Bank, which would simplify the structure of tariffs
and safeguard lower-end consumers (who generally have lower income). So far the proposal, while
endorsed by various stakeholders, has not been acted upon. Switching to gas will also generate savings
of 0.2 percent of GDP.

Putting the public debt on a sustainable downward path can only be achieved
through strong fiscal consolidation. Lebanon managed to reduce its debt by an impressive

24.
Staff recommended a fiscal adjustment strategy that is credible, balanced, and
anchored in a multi-year framework. Staff noted that the salary scale adjustment debate had
focused excessively on revenue measures, while the size and composition of spending should be
addressed as well; the debate had also diverted attention away from the need for broader fiscal
consolidation. More specifically, in staff’s view:


Passing a budget is a necessary initial step to anchor fiscal policy. Staff welcomed the
ministry of finance’s renewed efforts to close earlier accounts, especially as a
precondition for parliamentary consideration of a 2014 budget. A budget including all
government spending and revenue plans—and their impact on deficit and debt—will
help policymakers shift to a more comprehensive approach to fiscal policy.



The costs of the salary scale adjustment should be contained. At a minimum, salary
increases should be phased in in installments and without retroactive payments, and
based on clear performance measures. Staff also recommended factoring in all costs of
the scale adjustment, including on pensions (Box 2). Measures to increase public sector
productivity should be adopted; in this regard, staff recommended civil service reform,
noting though that it would take time and political will to implement it.



Reforming electricity tariffs is key to reducing transfers to the EdL in a sustainable
way. There have been proposals to simplify the tariff structure and increase its average
level toward cost recovery, while protecting the lower-tier consumers (Box 4). However,
vested interests and general lack of governance in the electricity sector have prevented
progress. Staff endorsed the tariff reform, noting that its implementation is subject to
cabinet’s decision and could therefore proceed regardless of the parliamentary schedule.
In addition, ongoing projects to switch to cheaper generation should also be properly
funded, monitored, and executed.



Staff sees scope to rebalance spending composition. Higher capital spending is
needed to support growth and reduce infrastructure gaps, starting from planned projects
in the electricity sector. Higher social spending, including through the National Poverty
Targeting Program, would help reduce poverty and address social needs.



Revenue measures should be equitable and minimize distortions. Staff welcomed
efforts to broaden tax bases, though regretted that the removal of the VAT exemption on
gasoil was not being pursued. It advised against applying multiple VAT rates to avoid
complicating tax administration. Instead, staff proposed a gradual increase of the overall
VAT rate to 12 percent in 2015 and 15 percent in 2017, in line with past Fund advice; and
noted the VAT’s sizeable tax base (consumption is about 90 percent of GDP), its
efficiency, and ease of administration. Staff recommended avoiding double taxation.8
Finally, it called for limiting the reliance on fees and stamps, as they would likely generate
low yields while complicating the tax system, noting that previous Fund advice had
recommended their simplification.

25.
Staff’s proposed adjustment would reverse the debt dynamics. The bulk of the
adjustment would come from revenue—and particularly from the still under-tapped VAT
potential—while spending would remain broadly unchanged as a share of GDP, though with a
composition rebalanced in favor of higher capital and social spending. The primary position
would turn into surplus as early as 2015, and reach 2½-3 percent of GDP over the medium term.
There would be some growth dividends, as confidence effects—in an environment where good
policy news have been limited—would drive a rebound in private investment, further enhanced
in the medium term by higher-quality spending and electricity sector reform. Public debt would
thus be put on a downward path, though would still remain above 130 percent of GDP by 2019.

There is a need for a more transparent government financing framework. Last year,
the government reached the cap on new foreign currency borrowing.9 Meanwhile, the gap
between its foreign currency payments (including transfers to the EdL, and interest and some
capital spending payments) and receipts (mainly profit transfers from the telecommunication
company) has been widening. This reflects temporary factors (delays in transfers from Telecom),
but also a structural deterioration (an increase in foreign currency payments). Thus, the
government has been increasingly borrowing in foreign currency from the BdL in overdraft,
which has reached $6.6 billion at end-April (about 14 percent of GDP). Staff welcomed the
authorities’ effort to seek parliamentary approval to raise the cap on new foreign currency
borrowing to reduce the government’s reliance on the BdL; it also recommended returning to
regular and timely Telecom transfers to the budget.
27.
Strong fiscal management should underpin adjustment. Staff welcomed ongoing
capacity building at the ministry of finance. It reiterated the importance of adhering to a budget
calendar and pursuing a medium-term budget framework; and noted the need for greater
transparency of government spending and its funding. Staff also underlined the importance of
strengthening cash management, in particular the transparency and timeliness of transfers to
and from the budget. Finally, staff noted that strengthening revenue administration and
combating reportedly pervasive tax evasion and corruption could generate considerable gains.
28.
Windfalls from prospective gas resources are no substitute for adjustment.
According to recent seismic surveys, Lebanon could benefit from offshore gas resources, though
their size remains uncertain and production is not expected to begin before 2020 (Box 5). The
bidding process for exploration is currently scheduled for August, after repeated delays. Staff
underscored that gas resources represent an asset of the whole country; and that strong policies
and institutions are needed to manage the related revenue stream in a sustainable and equitable
way (Selected Issue Paper). The first step to manage gas resources properly is to define a fiscal
regime that ensures a fair revenue share for the government while encouraging investors’
participation in exploration and production activities. Staff also called for a proper macro-fiscal
anchor to ensure the sustainability of the gas revenue; and strong institutions to manage the gas
wealth responsibly and transparently. In this context, it cautioned that discussions on a sovereign
wealth fund are premature; and earmarking different revenue sources to specific uses would lead
to fiscal fragmentation.

The government can only roll over existing foreign currency debt now, as last done in April. Raising the cap to
allow for new foreign currency borrowing requires parliamentary approval.

Box 5. Designing a Fiscal Framework for a Prospective Commodity Producer:
Options for Lebanon
Lebanon might become a commodity producer over the next decade, with petroleum set to be an
important source of government revenue. Recent seismic surveys suggest that Lebanon’s oil and gas
resources could be in excess of 25 trillion cubic feet (tcf). While not particularly large by international
standards, this estimate still points to the potential for a substantial revenue increase for many years
(though not starting before 2020 at the earliest).
Changing status to a commodity producer introduces challenges to macro-fiscal management.
High dependence on natural resources can result in high volatility of revenues and spending—typically
higher than for non-commodity producers—with associated procyclicality. Indeed, spending in commodity
producers during boom and bust commodity price episodes is found to be more procyclical than in
non-commodity producers. In addition, resource revenue is exhaustible, raising issues of sustainability and
intergenerational equity. This calls for smoothing government consumption over time, and avoiding the
need for massive fiscal adjustment once resource wealth has been depleted.
To address these challenges, Lebanon’s fiscal framework needs to move on three fronts:



Fiscal regime. Appropriate laws and regulations defining the revenue potential from exploration and
production of natural resources should be guided by a number of objectives and design principles:



The state should receive an appropriate share of the economic rents from exploiting natural
resources.



The tax rules applying to the extractive industries should be set out clearly in legislation, to avoid
negotiating project-specific fiscal arrangements.



The government’s take should adjust to price and cost fluctuations, to secure a larger profit share
of the most profitable projects, but impose a lower tax burden in times of low profitability.



The fiscal regime should avoid distorting investment incentives and decisions, especially in the
initial production stages, when governments typically favor early and dependable revenue.



Tax regimes should be competitive relative to those of other countries in attracting investment,
taking account of the relative stage of exploration and discoveries and their expected characteristics.
They should also be simple for taxpayers to comply with and the revenue authority to administer.



Macro-fiscal anchor. As Lebanon’s resource revenues are uncertain at this stage, the government
should conservatively assume a short reserve horizon. Fiscal policy should therefore be guided by
resource exhaustibility considerations, and anchored in a saving strategy for intergenerational equity
reasons. The literature offers guidance on the formulation of fiscal policy in these circumstances (see
Selected Issue Paper). Fiscal targets consistent with the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH)-based
frameworks—whereby a constant share of revenue is consumed every year to preserve resource
wealth—can be useful. Two related frameworks—based on the Modified Permanent Income
Hypothesis and Fiscal Sustainability—allow for scaling up of expenditure to address specific needs (for
example in human and physical investment), while still ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. These
frameworks may be relevant to Lebanon given its infrastructure gaps and social needs.



Institutions. Natural resource windfalls significantly complicate fiscal management, and therefore
strong institutional arrangements are called for. A sound PFM system helps ensure, as part of the
budget process, (i) a transparent and comprehensive presentation of oil revenue and the underlying
non-oil fiscal position; (ii) a sustainable long-term fiscal strategy based on prudent revenue projections,
realistic medium-term fiscal frameworks and a good budget classification; and (iii) transparent
mechanisms for appraisal, selection, and prioritization of investment projects, to ensure that resource
revenue is used to support long-term economic development. In addition, adopting a fiscal
responsibility law could potentially strengthen fiscal discipline by anchoring fiscal decisions in a rulebased framework (see Selected Issue Paper).

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities acknowledged the need to revert the debt dynamics. But political
uncertainty overshadows policy decisions and adjustment could only come over time.
30.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to putting in place a budget for 2014.
They noted that work on closing past accounts was almost complete, and agreed that passing a
budget would send a strong signal.
31.
There was a large degree of uncertainty regarding the parameters of the salary
scale adjustment. The authorities also noted significant implementation uncertainties, in part
related to the presidential vacuum, and felt than an early resolution was less likely.
32.
The authorities felt confident that their proposed revenue measures would more
than offset the salary increases. They stressed that sectors of the economy that had largely
remained outside the tax net should share the adjustment burden. They disagreed, however, with
the mission’s assessment that fees and stamps would generate only limited yield; and noted that
a large and broad-based VAT increase could affect disproportionally the lower segments of the
population, and would be politically difficult to implement.

B. Maintaining Reserves and Activating Market Signals
Discussions centered on the role played by the BdL in maintaining stability, and the need for high
reserves and lower government financing by the BdL.
33.
The exchange rate peg is the nominal anchor for Lebanon. Staff acknowledged the
key role the peg has been playing as lynchpin of financial stability, given the government’s high
debt and debt service in foreign currency, and substantial household and corporate currency
mismatches from the large credit dollarization. Strong and supportive policies are needed to
underpin the continued viability of the peg.
34.
Maintaining high reserves is warranted given large risks and vulnerabilities. Official
foreign exchange reserves are adequate, at 110 percent of the reserve metric at end-2013. The

fiscal and external financing needs under current policies. Going forward, there is a need for a
strategy to gradually strengthen the BdL’s balance sheet.
35.
Staff called for lower government financing by the BdL. Banks have continued to shy
away from T-bills with maturity shorter than 7 years—offered in the regular auctions. To mop up
banks’ pound liquidity and keep T-bill rates

interest rate it pays on banks’ deposits.
Staff encouraged the BdL to go one step further and gradually withdraw from T-bill auctions. It
noted though that rate cuts on BdL’s instruments might only have a marginal effect on the T-bill
market, and T-bill rates will likely have to rise to attract more bank participation in the auctions if
fiscal imbalances are not addressed.
36.
Ending the fiscal dominance and activating market signals require a reduction of
vulnerabilities. Staff underlined that lower government financing by the BdL can only be
sustained if combined with fiscal restraint—key to ensuring a sustainable reduction in
government’s large debt and financing needs. To allow the interest rates to reflect market
conditions and enhance the transparency of government financing, staff also recommended
regularizing the issuances of T-bills with maturities longer than 7 years and making the T-bill
auction process more transparent, including by providing more detailed auction results.
37.
Staff cautioned against the adverse effects of a rise in global interest rates. In this
context, it again recommended maintaining a high level of reserves to signal commitment to
macro-financial stability. It also called for strengthening banks’ capital buffers to absorb potential
losses from an increase in funding costs and a decline in Eurobond prices.

Authorities’ views
38.
There was agreement on the importance of maintaining high reserves. The
authorities felt comfortable with the current level of reserves. While they acknowledged the costs
10

The sharp declines in BdL’s T-bill holdings in June and December 2012 and April 2013 correspond to swaps of
T-bills for Eurobonds (of about LL6 trillion) conducted with the government. The large increases in banks’ T-bill
holdings in the second half of 2012 and in late-2013 reflect placements in 8-, 10-, and 12-year T-bills (of about
LL7 trillion); banks’ holding of T-bills of 7-year or shorter maturity have declined during this period.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

of maintaining high reserves in an environment of low global rates, they felt there was no
alternative in the near term. They noted that in the medium term the BdL’s balance sheet will
benefit from larger remuneration on reserves driven by higher global rates.
39.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s position on government financing and
interest rates, but pointed to limited policy alternatives in the current environment. They
underlined the need to stay vigilant and underpin monetary policy changes by strong fiscal
consolidation. They remained open to further gradual changes in BdL rates if and when
conditions permit, while noting that increases in T-bill rates would likely raise financing costs for
the private sector, as lending rates are generally linked to short-term T-bill rates. The T-bill
auction system was already transparent, in their view, and recent progress was made on debt
management coordination between the BdL and the ministry of finance.11 Finally, they felt that
banks’ capital buffers were sufficient and valuation effects from a rise in global rates likely
limited, as most Eurobonds are held to maturity.

C. Strengthening the Financial System
The resilience of the banking sector in the current challenging environment and the authorities’
plans to develop capital markets were the focus of discussions.

to the sovereign has continued to increase.
Note: Away from center signifies higher risks.
41.
Capital buffers should be further strengthened given banks’ large exposure to the
sovereign. The BdL requires by end-2015 an additional capital buffer of 1.5 percent on top of the
Basel III minimum plus a 2.5 percent conservation buffer. Staff welcomed this measure, though
urged the authorities to have a consistent approach to banks’ exposures to the government and
the central bank in accordance with the Basel capital adequacy framework.12
11

A joint new debt management strategy was launched in May.

12
The risk weight on foreign currency deposits with the BdL has been recently reduced from 100 to 50 percent,
while holdings of Lebanese government debt in foreign currency still carry a 100 percent risk weight. Exposures in
pound to both the BdL and the government carry a zero risk weight.

strengthen the cross-border supervision
of the largest banks.
43.
Staff encouraged progress on the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. A better understanding of the source of deposits
and adequate identification of beneficial owners would allow more effective monitoring of
transactions and strengthening of risk-based supervision—necessary to enhance the integrity of
the financial sector. In this context, staff called also for strengthening the AML/CFT regime,
including by taking the necessary legislative steps to bring the existing AML law and other
related legislation in line with the revised international standards.
44.
Over time, there might be scope to encourage banks to reconsider their business
model, which currently revolves around channeling deposits to the public sector. Staff
estimates that a deposit growth rate of about 8 percent would cover the economy’s financing
needs while keeping reserves high. Banks should thus avoid returning to the double-digit deposit
growth rate experienced in previous years, which would generate high sterilization costs for the
BdL. In this context, banks could lower deposit spreads (relative to international rates) to help
slow deposit growth—if and when needed. At the same time, staff saw a need to reduce over
time banks’ reliance on the sovereign. Banks might have to consider downsizing their balance
sheets if public financing needs decline significantly and regional opportunities remain limited.
45.
Preliminary steps to develop capital markets are welcome. While the banking sector
is almost fourfold the size of GDP, the insurance sector and the stock market remain
underdeveloped (Selected Issue Paper). The newly established Capital Markets Authority (CMA)
issued its first regulations in June 2013; the transfer of part of supervision from the BdL to the
CMA is under way. Staff welcomed progress, noting that developing capital markets to
complement the banking sector could promote growth, but cautioned that tight regulation and
supervision of the financial system are essential to avoid excessive risk taking.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

Authorities’ views
46.
The authorities felt that staff’s assessment underplayed ongoing progress in the
prudential framework. They stressed both the high quality of banks’ capital (mostly core Tier 1)
and the strict bank capital requirements, which go beyond the Basel III minimum. The authorities
justified the different weighting system on the basis of BdL’s conservative investment strategy for
the international reserves. They also emphasized the efforts made to assess capital adequacy
with respect to banks’ cross-border exposures through ongoing stress tests. They considered
that Lebanon’s AML/CFT regime is in practice fully compliant with international standards, while
noting that Lebanon’s financial intelligence unit, the Special Investigation Commission, is
actively cooperating with its foreign counterparts. Finally, they regretted that banks had become
overly-cautious by refusing to open accounts to some foreign nationals instead of classifying
them as high-risk for increased scrutiny.
47.
A few success stories would allow the stock market to take off. The authorities
acknowledged that the development of capital markets might be held back by current
conditions; though they were confident that it could take off if a few large companies
(e.g., Telecom) were to be listed.

D. Structural Reforms for Stronger and More Equitable Growth
Advancing structural reforms is key to raising Lebanon’s growth potential and improving labor
market and social conditions.
48.
Reviving the economy and achieving strong, sustainable, and inclusive growth are
key challenges. The sectors that have traditionally been the main drivers of growth—real estate,
construction, and tourism—are particularly exposed to security and political conditions. In
addition, the refugee crisis has amplified economic and social challenges. There is also a
widespread perception that past episodes of high growth have disproportionally benefitted
selected sectors or groups, and future growth would need to be more inclusive, create jobs, and
make significant inroads to reducing poverty.
49.
Staff underscored the need to advance structural reforms to strengthen the
economy and enhance its resilience to shocks. It noted that Lebanon might have lost some
competitiveness, and the pending wage

exchange rate misalignment (Box 6). Higher and more robust growth would also reduce
Lebanon’s exposure to shocks and help restore debt sustainability.
50.
There is an urgent need to strengthen electricity provision and lower its cost. As
noted above, transfers to EdL absorb a sizeable share of government resources, and inefficient
and inadequate electricity provision adds to the cost of doing business. Staff viewed increases in
average electricity tariffs as the main measure to sustainably address these problems (Box 4)—
though noting that the associated social impact should be properly mitigated. A more reliable
service by EdL would price out expensive private generators, even after tariff increases, and
contribute to more efficiency in the economy at large. Staff also called for improving
transmission and distribution systems to reduce inefficiencies and minimize losses due to theft
and inadequate collections. Finally, it recommended improving governance of the energy sector,
as past reform attempts were stalled by vested interests and a lack of political resolve; and
expressed disappointment that the debate on the salary scale adjustment had missed an
opportunity to put electricity tariff increases and the reform of the sector on the agenda.
51.
More efforts are needed to improve labor markets and support job creation.
Lebanon’s ability to create jobs for new labor market entrants has been traditionally inadequate,
resulting in high unemployment and emigration of highly-educated people. The refugee crisis
has added to these pressures, by increasing the labor force but also shifting the economy toward
lower-productivity sectors as most refugees are lower-skilled (Box 1). This de-skilling process
could become even more pronounced if the refugee crisis continues. Improving economic
prospects could help retain higher-skilled workers and move to higher-productivity sectors.
There is also an immediate need to tackle poverty. Cash-for-work programs, micro-finance
initiatives, and local economic development plans for the most affected communities are among
possible options. Over time, modernizing labor market legislation and improving compliance
with labor laws would limit the informal labor market.
52.
Increased private sector participation in infrastructure investment could lift
Lebanon’s growth potential. The framework law for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) has been
awaiting parliament approval; its passage would clarify the legal framework and pave the way for
better governance and transparency of public projects.

Authorities’ views
53.
The authorities agreed on the importance of structural reforms. Given the
government’s budget constraint, they saw potential from increased private sector participation in
infrastructure projects—though some noted that at times this had happened in the context of a
weak regulatory environment and little cabinet oversight. They acknowledged though that a
number of structural reforms had long been on the agenda, and current political conditions
might not permit advancing it.

deficit is estimated at 12¾ percent of GDP in
2013. Goods exports and tourism-related receipts have declined on account of disruptions to transit routes
and heightened domestic and regional uncertainty; however, these effects were offset by increases in the
number of nonresident Syrians in Lebanon—unregistered Syrian refugees are treated as nonresidents for
balance of payments statistics purposes—and increased humanitarian aid flows. The current account deficit
is projected to narrow to about 10½ percent of GDP over the medium term, as exports of goods and
services recover with subsiding uncertainty.

The extent of the REER misalignment is assessed using Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
(CGER)-type methodologies. Two standard approaches—the macroeconomic balance (MB) and external
sustainability (ES)—are estimated using a new toolkit.1,,2
Lebanon’s exchange rate appears to be moderately overvalued. The assessment is in line with the
finding at the time of the last Article IV consultation.

MB approach. The estimated current account norm is -9.7 percent of GDP and the underlying
current account balance is 10.4 percent of GDP. The REER is estimated to be overvalued by
2.2 percent.



The ES approach. The current account balance that would stabilize Lebanon’s net external asset
position (NEAP) at its estimated end-2012 level of -122 percent of GDP is 7.2 percent of GDP. This
would imply a REER overvaluation of 9.8 percent.3

Structural reforms are needed to improve competitiveness. While temporary factors underline current
weak export performance, no significant improvements in competitiveness can be expected absent
structural reforms to reduce the cost of doing business and boost productivity.
1

The toolkit was developed to facilitate external assessments for countries that are not included in the Consultative Group on Exchange
Rate Issues (CGER) sample; it applies the same analytical approaches as those proposed by the CGER, but to a larger panel spanning
emerging and developing countries, including Lebanon, unlike in earlier assessments. Additional methodological information can be
found at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/dp/2014/dp1401.pdf.
2

A third approach commonly used—the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER)—could not be applied as it relies on labor productivity
data, which are not available for Lebanon. If employment is approximated by a fixed share of the population, the ERER estimation
would suggest that the REER is undervalued by about 1½ percent.
3

While adjusting for multilateral consistency would produce a larger REER overvaluation than suggested by these estimates, the
sizeable discrepancy between the two sets of estimates calls into question the validity of this adjustment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

E. Data Issues
54.
The quality of statistics is improving, but further steps are needed. The Central
Administration of Statistics (CAS) released a new CPI index in March with Fund assistance;13 the
production of national accounts was transferred to CAS from the prime minister’s office, and
quarterly national accounts are under preparation. Staff also noted ongoing efforts to improve
balance of payments statistics and plans to release international investment position data; and
encouraged the authorities to address the longer delays recently experienced in the release of
fiscal data. Adequate and stable funding and high-level support for CAS, along with enhanced
cooperation with other agencies, will help further improve statistics. Finally, staff called for better
data to underpin much needed communication and monitoring of government’s economic plans,
thus contributing to their overall transparency and effectiveness; and to strengthen surveillance.

Authorities’ views
55.
There was some frustration at the challenges involved in data compilation. Technical
staff—at CAS and other institutions—underscored the inadequate cooperation from other
institutions in providing timely inputs; and thought that policymakers need a better appreciation
of the importance of reliable statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
56.
Lebanon’s renowned resilience is being severely tested. When the Syria crisis erupted
in 2011, the economy was already in downturn after four years of strong growth and impressive
reduction in public debt. Lebanon has since remained shackled to spillovers from the Syria crisis
and political paralysis. Growth has sharply decelerated, the primary fiscal balance has turned into
deficit, and public debt has been on an upward trend. The massive refugee population is
straining economic and social structures. Unemployment and poverty have increased.
57.
The outlook remains weak without decisive action. Strong regional and domestic
headwinds will continue to weigh on the economy. Persistent imbalances expose Lebanon to
large downside risks. Absent strong policies and reforms, potential growth will remain subdued.
58.
A comprehensive, balanced, and multi-year fiscal strategy is key for achieving a
sustainable debt reduction. In this context, there is a need to stop urgently the fiscal
deterioration and reestablish primary surpluses. Fiscal adjustment should include both revenue
and spending measures, and tilt the composition of spending away from EdL transfers into
capital and social outlays. It should also include broadening the tax base and strengthening
revenue collections, also by combating evasion and corruption. The authorities’ plan to pass a
budget is a welcome first step in this direction.
13

The CPI was not compiled during January–May last year reflecting lack of funding due to disputes between
CAS and the prime minister’s office. Funding to CAS and data compilation resumed last summer under strong
Fund pressure.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

59.
The budgetary impact of the proposed salary scale adjustment should be contained.
The ongoing debate on salary increases has detracted attention from the need for broader fiscal
consolidation. At a minimum, any salary adjustment should be implemented in installments, with
no retroactive payments, and in conjunction with productivity-enhancing measures.
60.
Stronger fiscal management should support fiscal consolidation. Resuming a regular
budget calendar would promote government accountability and enhance the transparency of
government spending and its funding. In this context, seeking parliamentary approval for new
borrowing in foreign currency would help reduce the government’s reliance on the BdL.
61.
Prospective gas resources are not a substitute for adjustment. There has been
excessive focus on how to use rather than properly manage these resources. It is essential to set
up a transparent fiscal framework and supporting institutions to manage the related revenue
transparently and equitably.
62.
Monetary policy should remain geared to supporting the peg. The peg has served
well as nominal anchor for the economy, and the BdL should continue to maintain high reserves.
As fiscal consolidation gains ground, the BdL should gradually withdraw from T-bill auctions.
Increasing over time the flexibility of T-bill rates and the transparency of T-bill auctions would
lead to interest rates that better reflect the cost of funding the government and to better
allocation of banks’ assets—without jeopardizing financial stability.
63.
BdL’s balance sheet needs to be strengthened. Reserve accumulation, government
financing and quasi-fiscal credit schemes to support the economy—and the associated
sterilization costs—have all taken a toll on the BdL’s finances. Going forward, there is a need for a
strategy to improve them.
64.
Continued efforts to enhance bank regulation and supervision are critical. Capital
buffers should be strengthened, given banks’ large exposure to the sovereign; loan classification
and restructuring rules improved; and the AML/CFT framework further enhanced—to bring it in
line with international standards—by taking necessary legislative steps and strengthening related
risk-based banking supervision. Proper regulation and supervision of the financial system are
also key to avoiding excessive risk taking and fostering a balanced development of capital
markets.
65.
Progress on structural reforms would unlock Lebanon’s growth potential and
address social inequalities. Given the recent loss in competitiveness and the moderately
overvalued real exchange rate, there is a need to lower the cost of doing business. Electricity
sector reform, in particular, could yield immediate benefits. Plans to strengthen generation
capacity, switch to natural gas, and increase average electricity tariffs toward cost recovery
levels—while protecting more vulnerable consumers—should be implemented without further
delay. Social safety nets should be strengthened and unemployment reduced.

Tackling the extremely large refugee crisis requires strong international support.
Absent additional support, the needs of both the Lebanese communities and the refugees will
not be met. Sound government policies—including a concerted policy framework to deal with
refugee issues and a commitment to fiscal discipline—will send credible signals to donors and
will also help mobilize the needed budget support.
67.
Despite ongoing progress, data remain inadequate in some areas. Reliable and timely
statistics are necessary for effectiveness, transparency and accountability of policymaking. Highlevel support for CAS and cooperation across institutions will help secure continued progress.

Gradually increase electricity tariffs to levels
consistent with cost recovery, while

Continue to maintain a high level of
international reserves and further
strengthen banks’ capital buffers (see
above).

High/Short to Medium Term/Medium
Delays in structural
reforms

Failure to address infrastructure bottlenecks,
particularly in the electricity sector, and continued
ad-hoc enforcement of regulations could reduce
Lebanon’s competitiveness and growth potential.
Protracted low growth could worsen debt dynamics
and unemployment and threaten social stability.

Shift spending composition away from EdL
subsidies into capital and social spending.
In this context, increase electricity
production efficiency through electricity
sector reform (see above).

Global Risks
Nature/Source of
Main Threats

Likelihood/Time Horizon/Expected Impact

Recommended Policy Response

High/Medium Term/Medium
Side-effects from
global financial
conditions (surges in
global financial
market volatility)

Higher-than-expected increases in global interest
rates could push Lebanon into a tighter monetary
policy stance, with rising financing costs negatively
affecting the government and the banking sector.
Declines in the price of the sovereign debt could
impact banks' balance sheets.

Strengthen fiscal discipline to maintain
confidence and reduce government’s
financing needs.
Continue to maintain a high level of
international reserves and further
strengthen banks’ capital buffers (see
above).

Medium/Short Term/Low
A sharp increase in
geopolitical tensions
surrounding
Russia/Ukraine that
creates significant
disruptions in global
financial, trade and
commodity markets

Higher costs of fuel imports would lead to higher
electricity subsidies, with negative effects on the
fiscal balance.

Increase electricity production efficiency
through electricity sector reform (see
above).

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that occur materially after the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of the IMF staff). The likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” indicates a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks at the time of the discussions with the
authorities.

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
With public debt already exceeding 140 percent of GDP and gross financing needs around 30 percent of
GDP, Lebanon faces significant risks to public debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, debt and
financing needs will continue to rise as a share of GDP, reaching 155 percent and 40 percent,
respectively. In addition, debt dynamics and financing needs are subject to significant macro-economic
shocks, especially to growth and the interest rate, and contingent liability shocks. Large liquidity buffers
and a captive investor base represent important mitigating factors.
The baseline scenario assumes that the conflict in Syria is resolved by 2016. This is also
underpinned by the following assumptions:


Real GDP growth is projected to stay below 2 percent in 2013 and 2014, mainly as a result of
the impact of the conflict in Syria on Lebanon. Growth is projected to increase to 2.5 percent
in 2015, and return to its potential estimated at 4 percent from 2016 onward.



Inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) is projected to gradually decelerate from 4.6 percent
in 2012 to 2.9 percent on average in 2015–19.



The primary balance will further worsen in 2014 and 2015, but gradually improve starting in
2016. These projections are based on (i) an estimate of the salary scale adjustment; (ii) a
gradual reduction in subsidies to the state-owned electricity company, Electricité du Liban
(EdL); (iii) higher capital spending; and (iv) tax measures encompassing income and profits,
capital gains, selected excises, and some stamp fees and charges.

The baseline assumptions are realistic. Lebanon’s forecast track record is not systematically biased,
as reflected in projection errors not being consistently on one side. The median forecast errors for real
GDP growth and inflation during 2004–12 are generally in line with those observed in other countries.
The median forecast error for the primary balance and its projected level are consistent with
experiences of fiscal adjustments in surveillance countries. While the cumulative change in the primary
balance appears ambitious compared to the track record of comparator group, staff views it within
reach, as it is based on both revenue and expenditure measures.
The deteriorating debt outlook reflects the projected path of fiscal adjustment and positive
interest rate-growth differential. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase from
141 percent in 2013 to 155 percent in 2019. The planned fiscal consolidation, measured by changes in
the primary balance, is assumed to take effect only gradually; however, part of the adjustment is
subject to uncertainty as it is driven by lower transfers to the electricity company due to projected
lower oil prices. While economic growth will make increasing negative contributions to the debt
dynamics over time, these will not be large enough to offset positive contributions from real interest
rates. The gross financing needs-to-GDP ratio is forecast to exceed 30 percent of GDP over the
projection period, with an increase to 40 percent of GDP in 2017. The upward financing needs

trajectory is primarily driven by large fiscal deficits and relatively short average maturity on debt, with
the average maturity of around 3 and 5 years, for domestic and foreign debt, respectively.
The debt and financing needs projections are particularly sensitive to growth and contingent
liability shocks:


Growth shock. Slower growth remains the principal risk to debt sustainability. Assuming a
decline in growth by one standard deviation for 2015 and 2016, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to reach almost 172 percent in 2019. Financing needs are projected to exceed
40 percent of GDP in 2017 and remain at this level until the end of the projection horizon.



Interest rate shock. Higher interest rates also pose a significant risk to debt sustainability.
A shock to the interest rate of 200 basis points results in the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching
164 percent at the end of the projection horizon. Financing needs are projected to reach
44 percent of GDP in 2019.



Macro-fiscal shock. If shocks to growth, interest rate, and primary balance occurred
simultaneously, the debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed 187 percent at the end of the projection
horizon. Financing needs would reach 50 percent of GDP in 2019.



Contingent liability shock. In the absence of concrete estimates of contingent liabilities, a
standardized shock of 10 percent of financial sector assets is used to represent a hypothetical
realization of such contingent liabilities. In such a scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would
exceed 190 percent at the end of the projection horizon. Financing needs would exceed
45 percent of GDP in 2019. The large effect reflects the significant size of Lebanon’s banking
sector relative to the size of its economy.

Lebanon’s debt profile reveals weaknesses. External financing needs are well above the upper riskassessment benchmark, which along with public debt in foreign currency above the lower riskassessment benchmark points to risks in case of pressures on the exchange rate and foreign exchange
reserves. While bond spreads are above the lower risk assessment benchmark, they have been
relatively stable even in times of stress. Public debt held by nonresidents is estimated to be only
slightly above the lower risk assessment benchmark, while the level of, and the change in, short-term
debt are below the lower risk assessment benchmarks.
Risks to debt sustainability need to be weighed against a number of mitigating factors.


Investor base. Debt is held largely by domestic financial institutions that are tightly regulated
in terms of their net open positions and investment strategies. This factor, coupled with
relatively low demand for private sector credit and limited regional investment opportunities,
has resulted in a captive investor base. In turn, domestic financial institutions fund their
positions from deposits largely held by nonresidents, which have shown resilience in times of

stress.2 In addition, a significant share of domestic debt is held by the BdL. Given that the debt
is held predominantly by domestic investors, a metric that better captures risks to debt
sustainability is the public debt-to-broad money ratio. This ratio decreased from 66 percent in
2003 to 45 percent in 2012 and is forecasted to stay below 50 percent over the projection
horizon.


Debt financing profile. The large external financing needs amounting to around 155 percent of
GDP reflect payments related to debt but also, to a significant extent, large nonresident shortterm deposits. The exclusion of nonresident deposits—given their past stability—reduces
external financing needs to around 40 percent of GDP over the projection horizon—still well
above benchmark values but possibly capturing immediate risks more accurately. Although
debt denominated in foreign currency accounts for more than 40 percent of total public debt,
it is held mostly by domestic financial institutions and is underpinned by sizeable external
buffers in the form of international reserves. The level of, and the change in, short-term debt
are very low, substantially reducing refinancing risk.



Buffers. The high level of gross international reserves remains an anchor for investors’
confidence (the real effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued, Annex II). In addition,
banks’ NFA also represent a substantial buffer. Finally, there are also significant cash cushions
in the form of deposits accumulated by the government. The average figure for government
deposits points to around 20 percent of GDP,3 which implies a significantly lower public debtto-GDP ratio on a net basis and coverage of financing needs for more than half a year.

The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s analysis. They noted challenges to formulating a
credible medium-term fiscal framework, while underscoring mitigating factors to debt sustainability
risks. In particular, they singled out the issue of the large external financing needs as an example of an
indicator that does not capture well Lebanon’s specific circumstances.

See IMF (2002) “Lebanon—2011 Article IV Staff Report” IMF Country Report No. 12/39 and Schimmelpfennig
and Gardner (2008),”Weathering the Perfect Storm,” IMF Working Paper 08/17. These sizeable deposits (around
120 percent of GDP) have consistently behaved as long-term deposits, despite their short maturity profile, reflecting
the loyalty of the Lebanese diaspora and other regional investors.

The government’s foreign exchange account has, however, been in overdraft by around 5 percent on average over
the past few years, which reduces the size of the buffer.

Annex II. Lebanon: External Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Lebanon’s external debt will remain high. The external debt is estimated at 174 percent of GDP at
end-2013, an increase from a bottom of 163 percent at end-2010. This increase reflects nonresident
deposits inflows and a large current account deficit in recent years. The bulk of the external debt
(about 77 percent) is accounted for by short-term nonresident deposits in the banking sector. Under
the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to slightly increase to 181 percent of GDP by 2019.
While growth is projected to pick up and the noninterest current account deficit to shrink, a projected
rise of nonresident deposit inflows, together with increases in nominal interest rates, will contribute to
the increase in external debt.
Two main factors mitigate the extent of underlying vulnerabilities from high external debt.


While almost all nonresident deposits are short-term, they are largely owned by the Lebanese
diaspora. These deposits have been relatively stable during past stress episodes. Nonresident
deposits account for about 80 percent of gross external financing needs over the projection
horizon (see also Annex I).



Due to lack of information on maturity, all external non-deposit liabilities of banks and the full
amount of external debt of nonbanks (about 10 percent of gross external financing needs
over the projection horizon) are treated as short-term debt in this analysis. This implies that
gross annual financing needs and short-term external debt are likely overestimated.

Standard bound tests suggest the debt dynamics are sensitive to macroeconomic shocks,
particularly shocks to the exchange rate. A one-time real depreciation of 30 percent of the
exchange rate in 2015 would raise, on impact, the debt level to 276 percent of GDP (Figure 1, panel 6).
This underscores the importance of the exchange rate peg as a linchpin of macroeconomic and
financial stability in Lebanon. In addition, a permanent shock of a ½ standard deviation from past
distribution, relative to the baseline, would lead to the following:


For the interest rate, it would raise the debt ratio to 186 percent of GDP by 2019 (Figure 1,
panel 2);



For the growth rate, it would raise the debt ratio to 197 percent of GDP by 2019 (Figure 1,
panel 3); and



For the noninterest current account balance, it would raise the debt ratio to 193 percent of
GDP by 2019 (Figure 1, panel 4).

A combined permanent shock of a ¼ standard deviation from past distribution, relative to the
baseline, applied to the interest rate, growth rate, and noninterest current account balance would
raise the debt ratio to 198 percent of GDP by 2019 (Figure 1, panel 5).

Safeguards Assessment:
Pursuant to Fund policy, the Banque du Liban (BdL) was subject to a full safeguards assessment
in conjunction with the first Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) in April 2007. The 2008
safeguards assessment report proposed several specific measures for enhancing the BdL’s
financial reporting, audit and control procedures, and recommended an update of the central
bank law. An update safeguards assessment was completed in August 2009 in the context of the
second EPCA. The update noted progress achieved in enhancing procedures for reserve
management and external audit, but recommended further actions to strengthen internal audit,
financial reporting transparency, oversight, and central bank legislation.

Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangement
Lebanon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1993, and maintains
an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The exchange arrangement, which maintains a de-facto peg to the
U.S. dollar, is classified as stabilized. Since October 1999, the BdL has been intervening to keep
the pound around a mid-point parity of LL 1,507.5 per $1, with a bid-ask spread of LL+/-6.5.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2011 Article IV Consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 23, 2012. At
the time, Directors noted that domestic political uncertainty and regional unrest eroded market
confidence, bringing an end to Lebanon’s four-year spell of impressive economic growth. They
underscored the need to maintain fiscal discipline and to reduce government’s reliance on
central bank financing. Directors welcomed the planned investment in the electricity sector, but
stressed that reforms should proceed in parallel to reduce the large budgetary transfers to the
sector.
Financial Sector Assessment Program
Lebanon participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in 1999, and the related report
was presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 1999 Article IV consultation
(FO/DIS/99/113). A Financial System Stability Assessment update was conducted in 2001, and
the related report presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 2001 Article IV
consultation (SM/01/281).
Resident Representative Office
The IMF Resident Representative Office in Lebanon was opened in January 2008 and closed in
August 2011. The Fund maintains a local office hosted by the Middle East Technical Assistance
Center (METAC).
Technical Assistance (TA)
Fiscal area—The Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) has provided advice on introducing the VAT,
reforming customs tariffs and income taxes, strengthening tax and customs administration, and
improving expenditure policy and public expenditure management. A fiscal ROSC was published
in May 2005. During 2008–11, FAD provided assistance on tax policy options and reform
priorities in tax administration and public financial management, and FAD and METAC provided
targeted follow-up support to ongoing initiatives in both tax administration and public financial
management (e.g., tax audit program, treasury single account, and cash management). During
2012–14, FAD provided assistance on the tax regime and revenue administration of oil and gas
resources, PFM reform, the budget system law, public accounting, while METAC continued to
provide TA on tax and customs administration.

Financial area—The Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) has provided TA mainly
in the areas of banking supervision, early warning system, non-bank financial institutions supervision,
and the coordinated direct investment survey.
Statistical area—The Statistics Department has provided TA in national accounts, price and balance
of payments statistics. Several missions on the consumer price index (CPI) were undertaken in 2007
through METAC, and a monthly country-wide CPI was launched in March 2008; a new country-wide
CPI index and regional indices were launched in March this year. TA in building capacity for national
accounts statistics and economic surveys was provided through the resident advisor in real
sector statistics. METAC has been providing assistance on balance of payments and
international investment position statistics, and recommendations on improving work processes in
the Statistics and Economic Research Department of the BdL.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Lebanon teams of the Fund and the World Bank met to discuss macrocritical
structural reforms and coordinate their work in 2014.1 The teams agreed that economic
performance is expected to remain weak without a resolution of the Syria crisis. Lebanon’s main
medium-term macroeconomic challenges are to reduce the very high and growing public debt burden
and secure sustained and inclusive growth. To meet these challenges, Lebanon needs to pursue fiscal
consolidation in the context of a medium-term framework, implement long-delayed structural
reforms, covering in particular the electricity sector, the delivery of social services, and the social safety
net. Finally, the authorities need to continue to protect the financial sector from excessive risks and
maintain sizeable reserve buffers.
2.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural reform
areas as macrocritical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and sustained
growth:


Electricity sector reform: There is an urgent need to strengthen and lower the costs of
electricity provision, and reduce budgetary transfers to the Electricité du Liban (EDL) by
(i) reducing the cost of production, including through reducing systems losses and the
reliance on expensive fuel oil; (ii) increasing revenue collection; (iii) enhancing electricity
supply by making necessary investments; and (iv) gradually adjusting average tariff toward
cost recovery levels, while protecting poor households. These measures should be
accompanied by a comprehensive reform of the regulatory and institutional framework.
Electricity sector reform is macrocritical because the large budgetary transfers to the sector
(4½ percent of GDP in 2013) undermine fiscal sustainability; while insufficient and unreliable
electricity supply adds to the cost of doing business and is an impediment to growth.



Tax reform: Move toward an efficient and equitable tax system by broadening tax bases
and increasing tax rates on capital gains and excisable products. Tax policy reforms should
be accompanied by reforms to restructure and modernize revenue administration and
enhance compliance. Tax reform is macrocritical because it will help support fiscal
adjustment.



Public financial management (PFM) reform: Key reform elements include:
(i) strengthening the macrofiscal unit in the Ministry of Finance; (ii) strengthening budget
preparation, cash and debt management; (iii) strengthening accounting, payment and
auditing functions, including by introducing a Government Financial Management
Information System; and (iv) completing the coverage of the Treasury Single Account. These
reforms are macrocritical because they will improve the management of public finances.

The IMF team was led by Ms. Annalisa Fedelino (mission chief) and the World Bank team by Mr. Ferid Belhaj
(Country Director).

LEBANON



Social services and safety net reform: Social services and the social safety net are weak.
The following reforms would help: (i) health: rationalizing health spending and expanding
health insurance coverage; (ii) pension systems: strengthening financial sustainability and
administration of the National Social Security Fund, reforming the end-of-service indemnity,
and ultimately creating a new pension system for private sector workers; (iii) education:
improving the quality of public education, including strengthening higher education and
vocational training; and (iv) social safety nets: improving targeting to the most needy. These
reforms are macrocritical because they will increase the efficiency of public spending;
enhance the productivity of the workforce and strengthen growth prospects; reduce
inequalities, and generate political support for the needed fiscal consolidation.



Investment climate reform: Lebanon’s corporate sector is held back by the high costs of
doing business, arising from weaknesses in governance, regulatory systems, and contract
enforcement. Reforms in this area are macrocritical because they will improve
competitiveness and help increase the growth potential.



Financial sector stability assessment: Given the very large financial sector and the high
dollarization, financial stability is key for macroeconomic stability. Assessing financial system
stability is macrocritical because it will help identify potential risks and provide suggestions
for addressing them.



Reform of the statistical system: Lebanon’s statistical system suffers from fragmentation
and limited capacity to provide timely and reliable data. Strengthening statistical systems is
macrocritical because timely and reliable data are needed to monitor economic and social
developments and support decision making.

3.

The teams agreed to the following division of labor:



Electricity sector reform: The Bank will continue to elaborate reform options and discuss
them with the authorities. The Country Partnership Strategy of the Bank provides for
technical and possibly financial support to the electricity sector to assist the government in
implementing its strategic plan.



Tax reform: The Fund and the Bank are providing technical assistance (TA) on the fiscal
regime for the oil and gas sector. The Fund is also providing revenue administration
technical assistance in this sector. If requested, the Fund will also provide TA on the design
and implementation of the capital gain tax. If requested, the Bank could build on tax work
available to perform analytical work on growth and welfare impact of fiscal policy options.



Public financial management reform: The Fund is providing TA on (i) capacity building
for the newly-established macro-fiscal department, in collaboration with the World Bank;
(ii) improving the transparency and accountability of public accounts; and (iii) improving
cash management.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON



Social services and safety net reform: The Bank will continue its analytical work in the area
of social safety nets and provide a prioritized list of policy recommendations though the
“Emergency Social Protection Implementation Support Project”.



Investment climate reform: The Bank is planning to conduct an assessment of the
investment climate, with a special focus on the large informal sector.



Financial sector stability assessment: The Fund is providing TA on the supervision of
nonbank financial institutions and the cross-border supervision of banks, including by
establishing supervisory colleges. The Bank is providing TA on the development of the
insurance sector and capital markets. The Bank and the Fund will continue to encourage the
authorities to undertake a Financial System Stability Assessment given the systemic
importance of the banking sector (the last update was done in 2001).



Reform of the statistical system: The Fund will continue to provide TA on the consumer
price index, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. The Bank is providing
advisory services on the national household income and expenditure survey.

4.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the Bank’s work in the above
macrocritical structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least
semi-annually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects, as well as of Fund’s TA in the above reform areas. Timing: in
the context of Article IV Consultation and other missions (and at least semi-annually).



The two teams will continue to exchange views on the macroframework and the results of an
upcoming update for the Economic and Social Impact Assessment of the Syrian Conflict
(planned for September 2014).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Lebanon—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of May 29, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance,
particularly in national accounts and external sector statistics. Lack of timely, comprehensive and
reliable national accounts data and social and labor market indicators undermine economic
analysis.
National accounts: National accounts data are weak, with only annual data publicly available,
currently until 2011; there are plans to start publishing quarterly data. The responsibility of
producing national accounts statistics has been transferred to the Central Administration of
Statistics (CAS) in 2012 for the publication of 2011 accounts. Data sources are still mostly
administrative— despite improvements, including by using quarterly VAT declarations—and the
compilation methods do not conform to best practices. The Fund’s Statistics Department (STA)
will be assisting CAS in reviewing the methodology and data collection for the annual national
accounts, and starting the compilation of quarterly national accounts.
Price statistics: A new Consumer Price Index (CPI), including regional indices and reflecting
improved survey and compilation methods, was released in March 2014 by the CAS with Fund
assistance. Since May 2008, CAS has been compiling and disseminating a monthly CPI following
internationally-accepted methodology. The CPI covers all areas in Lebanon and is disseminated
within three weeks after the end of the reference month. The CPI was not compiled during
January–May last year reflecting disputes with the prime minister’s office over funding for CAS.
Funding to CAS and data compilation resumed last summer under strong Fund pressures.
Housing prices are now surveyed monthly—in the previous index, they were surveyed
infrequently due to lack of funding. There is a need to develop regular and timely statistics on
producer prices, wages, and real estate prices.
Government finance statistics: Significant delays have been recently experienced in the release
of fiscal data. While the dissemination of central government finance statistics (GFS) has
improved in recent years, the coverage of government finance statistics is not comprehensive.
Published monthly data on the central government budgetary accounts do not cover items such
as certain transfers, financing data, foreign-financed capital expenditure, and arrears. Some
(treasury) spending is only identified ex post, and presented in an economic classification with a
lag. These items are nonetheless provided to the Lebanon team in the context of surveillance
activities. Government finance statistics are on a modified cash basis for revenue (transfers from
the Telecom) and budgetary expenditure data (issuance of payment orders). GFS data for
budgetary central government based on Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 are
published on a yearly basis in the IMF publication the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook;
however, these data cover only transactions and no balance sheet data are reported.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

Lebanon—Statistical Issues Appendix (concluded)
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are adequate. At the same time,
sectoralization of institutional units and classification of financial instruments in the data reported
to STA fall short of what is needed for the compilation of Standardized Report Forms. Reflecting
in part restrictions imposed by domestic legislation, the Banque du Liban (BdL) does not publish
externally-audited financial statements, and its reporting practices are not fully compliant with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The lack of a reliable classification of deposits
by residency (also due to bank secrecy) complicates the balance of payments analysis.
Financial sector surveillance: Lebanon is a regular reporter of Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs). All core and eight encouraged FSIs are reported on regular quarterly basis, except for the
two indicators on capital adequacy that are reported on semi-annual basis. Compilation of FSIs
for other sectors (other financial corporations, non-financial corporations, households, real estate
markets) is needed to expand the list of FSIs compiled by Lebanon for macro prudential analysis.
Balance of payments: There have been efforts to improve Balance of Payments (BoP) statistics,
including the quality of surveys through better compliance. However, there remain significant
challenges to compiling reliable BoP data. In particular, there are data issues in the current
account (unrecorded exports and imports, uncertainty with respect to the estimates of private
sector services, workers’ remittances, and investment income), the capital account (grants), and
the financial account (foreign direct investment, equity investment in the nonbank private sector,
and corporate borrowing abroad). A Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) survey is currently in
progress. An International Investment Position (IIP) statement had been completed, but not yet
published. The forms and the reporting requirements for banks and non-banks were amended in
January 2010 and more recently last year to include more comprehensive and detailed breakdown
of BoP components. The lack of effective inter-agency cooperation and data sharing between the
BdL, CAS, and the ministry of finance are among the main factors impeding progress.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Lebanon joined the General Data Dissemination System in January 2003. Metadata and plans for
improvement need to be updated. No Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
for data dissemination is available for Lebanon.
III. Reporting to STA
Lebanon currently reports annual data based on GFSM 2001 to be published in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), but the data suffer from weaknesses, mainly limited coverage.
CAS does not currently report any data to STA. In September 2011, the BdL started regular
submission of core Financial Soundness Indicators data and metadata, and data for 2013 were
posted on the IMF website.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 31, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Lebanon
On June 26, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Lebanon.1
Lebanon is facing a number of difficult challenges. The economy is suffering from
abroad-based deterioration. Growth stood at 2.5 percent in 2012 and decelerated to
1.5 percent in 2013 as traditional drivers of growth—real estate-related activity, construction
and tourism—have been affected by increasing uncertainty and worsening security. Inflation
appears contained, though there are reportedly pressures on housing prices. The external
current account deficit remained large at about 13 percent of GDP in 2012–13.
The crisis in Syria is having a dramatic impact on Lebanon. The refugee influx, according to
United Nations figures, has reached one quarter of the population, fueling already high
unemployment and poverty, and straining local communities and public services. The crisis
has further exacerbated domestic political uncertainties. The term of the president ended in
May, and the presidential vacuum is disrupting efforts to pass legislation, including a salary
increase for the public sector. Parliamentary elections in November (already postponed from
June 2013) add to uncertainty.
Fiscal imbalances have widened. The primary fiscal position turned negative in 2012
and deteriorated to about 1 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting cyclical factors—spending
pressures and revenue declines from weak economic activity—as well as discretionary
policies, namely the introduction of a Value Added Tax exemption on gasoil and a
cost-of-living adjustment for public sector wages in 2012. Hosting the large refugee
population is adding to fiscal strains. As a result, public debt—already one of the highest in
the world as a share of GDP—has been on an upward trajectory since 2012, reaching
141 percent of GDP in 2013.
The Banque du Liban has continued to finance the government and attract commercial
banks’ foreign currency deposits, which brought international reserves to US$35 billion at
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

end-April. It has also supported credit to the private sector by providing low-cost funds to
banks to on-lend to specific economic sectors.
Financial markets have been largely resilient, but the environment is increasingly
challenging. Banks’ profitability has deteriorated, and their high exposure to the sovereign
has continued to increase. Nonperforming loans remain low, but their provisioning has
declined and the use of overdraft facilities is widespread. On the positive side, deposits have
continued to grow at 7–8 percent a year, and liquidity buffers are strong. Eurobond spreads
have moved in line with regional averages and stand at levels similar to those at the end of
2011.
Without a resolution in Syria, economic performance is expected to remain weak, with high
downside risks from a further weakening of public finances and delays in structural reforms.
Growth is likely to be subdued at around 2 percent this year, reflecting domestic and regional
uncertainties, and return only gradually to potential—a moderate 4 percent. Inflation could
pick up with the planned salary increase. Financing needs would remain high, due to large
fiscal and current account deficits.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors noted that the conflict in Syria and domestic political uncertainty are adding stress
to Lebanon’s already difficult economic situation. Growth is subdued, fiscal imbalances are
widening, and public debt is rising. Directors emphasized that commitment to sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms is essential to foster strong and sustainable
growth and improve social conditions.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts for receiving an unprecedented inflow of Syrian
refugees. They recognized, however, that this is straining the economic and social structures
and fueling already high unemployment and poverty. They agreed that Lebanon needs
additional support from the international community to address the adverse impact of the
refugee crisis.
Directors emphasized the importance of a credible and balanced fiscal adjustment strategy to
prevent further fiscal deterioration, reestablish primary surpluses, and put public debt on a
sustainable path. In this context, they urged caution in implementing the planned salary scale
adjustment for public sector employees. Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake
revenue-enhancing measures, such as broadening the tax base and strengthening collection,
while ensuring that they are equitable and minimize distortions. They also underscored the
need to reform the electricity sector by raising average tariffs toward costs recovery, while
mitigating the impact on the poor and rebalancing freed-up resources toward capital and
social spending. In addition, Directors considered that stronger fiscal management, including

adhering to a budget calendar and pursuing a medium-term budget framework, would
contribute to fiscal sustainability.
Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain geared towards maintaining adequate
foreign exchange reserves and supporting the exchange rate peg as a signal of commitment to
macrofinancial stability. They encouraged the authorities to scale back the government’s
reliance on central bank financing as fiscal consolidation advances, and take measures to
further strengthen the central bank’s balance sheet.
Directors noted that the banking sector has been resilient, but is facing an increasingly
challenging environment. They emphasized the need to further strengthen capital buffers and
improve loan classification and restructuring rules. Directors also encouraged further
strengthening of the AML/CFT framework.
Directors emphasized the importance of undertaking structural reforms to unlock Lebanon’s
growth potential and improve social conditions. They called for measures to lower the cost of
doing business and improve services, starting from electricity provision. Additional efforts
are also needed to enhance labor markets and support job creation, while strengthening social
safety nets. Directors encouraged the authorities to take further steps to improve Lebanon’s
statistical system, building on ongoing progress.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on Lebanon
June 26, 2014

1.
On behalf of the Lebanese authorities, I would like to thank staff for the valuable
Article IV discussions and the resulting informative reports. The authorities also wish to
express their appreciation for the continued provision of technical assistance.
Recent Developments and Outlook
2.
The Lebanese economy faces difficult challenges associated with the conflict in
Syria, which exacerbate already difficult domestic conditions. Since the onset of the Syrian
crisis in early 2011, Lebanon has maintained an open border policy and has permitted
refugees to freely settle across the country. Registered Syrian refugees account for about 25
percent of Lebanon’s pre-crisis population; including unregistered refugees raises this ratio to
about 35 percent of the population. This has negatively impacted security and put serious
pressures on virtually all aspects of the economy. As a result, growth is expected to be
subdued in 2014 and the fiscal deficit and public debt are expected to increase. On the
positive side, security conditions have recently improved since the formation of the
government, deposit capital inflows remain resilient and foreign exchange reserves are high.
Reflecting these developments, Standard & Poor’s upgraded Lebanon’s outlook from
negative to stable last March.
3.
The authorities remain committed to policies that ensure macroeconomic stability
while addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and improving social conditions. However,
Lebanon does not have the fiscal space to address the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on
the economy and local communities. Dealing with the refugee crisis requires strong
international support.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
4.
In order to signal their commitment to fiscal discipline, the authorities are committed
to putting in place a budget for 2014 aimed at balancing essential spending needs with
stability goals.
5.
The fiscal impact of the Syrian crisis is extensive. The negative impact on investor
and consumer confidence and the disruption in the trade routes for exports and imports of
goods, tourism, and financial services are placing downward pressure on government
revenues. Combined with rising demand for public services due to the large refugee influx,
this is further damaging Lebanon’s public finances. While the direct budgetary costs are not

2
yet known with precision, the World Bank1 envisaged an immediate negative fiscal impact of
$2.6 billion in 2012–14 (about 6 percent of 2013 GDP) through lower revenue and higher
expenditure. It estimated the stabilization needs to be an additional $2.5 billion.
6.
Large uncertainties surround the salary scale adjustment, which is still under
parliamentary consideration. The authorities are confident, however, that the revenue
measures they envisaged, if passed by parliament in a timely manner, would be sufficient to
offset the cost of the salary scale adjustment. These measures include (i) an increase in the
interest income tax rate from 5 to 7 percent; (ii) an increase in the corporate income tax rate
from 15 to 17 percent; (iii) a new capital gain tax on real estate transactions; (iv) increases in
tobacco excises; and (v) increases in various stamps and fees.
7.
The authorities take note of staff’s work on a fiscal adjustment strategy that would
reverse the debt dynamics. They consider that broadening the tax base and addressing tax
loopholes are preferable to a large increase in VAT, which proved politically difficult to
adopt in the past given its regressive nature.
8.
The authorities do not share staff’s assessment that commitment to fiscal discipline
will help mobilize budget support to deal with the refugee crisis. Fiscal discipline is
necessary in itself in order to avoid a possible loss of market confidence and put debt on a
sustainable path, although the current uncertainty overshadows policy decisions and may
delay fiscal adjustment. In order to deal with the present refugee crisis and its repercussions
on the Lebanese communities, the authorities reiterate their call for support from the
international community.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
9.
Monetary policy helped maintain confidence in the Lebanese financial system, with
the exchange rate peg providing a firm anchor for financial stability. The authorities share
staff’s view on the importance of maintaining a high level of reserves. They are keen on
reducing the Treasury’s reliance on central bank financing and agree with staff that this will
have to be accompanied by a strong fiscal consolidation effort. The central bank remains
open to further gradual reductions in the deposit remuneration rates and to increases in the
Treasury-bill rates if and when conditions permit.
Banking Sector
10.
The banking sector remains resilient despite the challenging environment, which has
limited credit opportunities to the private sector and the banks’ expansion in neighboring

Region, “Lebanon, Economic and Social Impact Assessment”, September 2013.

3
countries. The authorities consider that staff’s assessment does not sufficiently acknowledge
ongoing progress in the regulatory and supervisory framework. The central bank required
banks to hold by end-2015 a supplementary capital buffer of 1.5 percent on top of the Basel
III minimum, in addition to a 2.5 percent conservation buffer. Moreover, supervision was
further enhanced with the establishment of colleges to strengthen the cross-border
supervision of the largest banks. In addition, efforts to assess capital adequacy with respect to
banks’ cross-border exposures through stress tests are ongoing. Lebanon’s AML/CFT regime
is in practice fully compliant with international standards, and Lebanon’s financial
intelligence unit, the Special Investigation Commission, actively cooperates with its foreign
counterparts.
