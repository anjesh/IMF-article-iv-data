STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND SECOND POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Overview: External financing risks are rising in the wake of growth and financial spillovers
from the Eurozone crisis. Stock vulnerabilities remain high while fiscal and external buffers
are under pressure. Meanwhile, obstacles to higher medium-term potential growth–namely
poor investment growth and low labor participation–persist. Unexpected and
interventionist policy measures, many affecting the financial sector, have further increased
policy uncertainty, contributing to elevated risk premia and a weakening of the exchange
rate. Against this background, the authorities have requested precautionary financial
assistance from the IMF and EU. With constrained room for policy accommodation, a policy
mix that builds credibility, strengthens the policy framework, increases competitiveness and
lays the groundwork for sustainable medium-term economic growth will be critical.
Fiscal policy: Ambitious deficit targets remain appropriate, although their attainment may
be jeopardized by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and policy slippages. The
increasingly complex tax system should be revisited to take account of medium-term
growth and distributional aspects, planned structural reforms should be implemented in
full, and distortions in the labor market must be avoided.
Financial sector: Regulators should thoroughly examine banks’ financial health and
continue to proactively prepare them for a weakening in the economic outlook and
possible funding pressures. The government’s efforts to address the foreign currency
mortgage burden have generally been ineffective; the most recent scheme is an
improvement but still falls short of best practice.
Monetary policy: Under current circumstances, the MNB’s tightening bias is justified.
While the output gap remains relatively large, the scope for rate cuts is constrained by the
worsened inflation outlook and the need to avoid a destabilizing weakening of the
exchange rate and capital outflows. Official reserve levels are too modest to provide
additional room for maneuver. Recent initiatives to change the governance structure of the
Central Bank (MNB) raise serious concerns, both in terms of process and content.

HUNGARY

CONTEXT
A. Recent Developments
1.
Hungary’s rebound from the
2008–09 crisis has been modest. After
contracting nearly 7 percent, real output rose
only 1.3 percent in 2010. Exports, helped by
strong links with the resilient German export
sector, were the sole engine of growth as
domestic demand contracted for a second
consecutive year (See text figure). Indeed, in
Eastern Europe, only the Baltics, Croatia and
Ukraine have weaker output relative to the
pre-crisis peak.

2.
This already weak recovery is now
faltering largely due to spillovers from the
eurozone crisis. Private consumption is
constrained by tightening credit, rising foreign
currency (FX) debt service, weak wage growth,
high unemployment, and a sharp decline in
consumer confidence. Meanwhile, fixed
investment, which is particularly important for
medium-term growth, is declining sharply with
little sign of stabilizing amid a volatile policy
environment and ample excess supply. Finally,
the latest stage of the eurozone crisis is now
weighing on Hungary’s external demand, with

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

exports to Europe decelerating since June.
Growth in 2011 is now forecasted to be only
1-1½ percent.
3.
The slower growth and recent
government actions are weighing on the
financial sector. Non-performing loans to firms
and households have risen to 14 percent. The
resulting need to increase provisioning––
compounded by the large bank tax and the
government’s recent early repayment scheme
for FX mortgages––has sharply reduced bank
profits: four of the eight largest banks in
Hungary are now making material losses.
System-wide capital adequacy remains well
above the regulatory minimum but the sharp
losses have necessitated equity increases from
select foreign banks. Meanwhile, liquidity
appears adequate but funding is increasingly
short term and expensive.
4.
Despite the slowing growth, the
authorities have started to tighten fiscal and
monetary policy. In 2010–11, fiscal policy was
expansionary, as significant tax cuts caused a
widening in the structural deficit by around
3 percent of GDP. However, the recently
adopted 2012 budget tightens fiscal policy
substantially. In addition, despite a still large
output gap, the Central Bank recently increased
the policy rate to 6.5 percent given ongoing risks
to both inflation and the financial sector from a
rising risk premium and a weakening exchange
rate.
5.
At the same time, the authorities have
tried to support growth through a mix of
well-received reforms and some more

HUNGARY

controversial policy steps. Some measures,
largely in the context of the Szell Kalman plan
announced in early 2011 (discussed in detail in
IMF Country Report No. 11/137), are aimed at
improving the medium term growth potential
and are in line with recommendations at the last
Article IV consultation. However, other efforts
aimed at supporting output have been more
controversial, such as schemes to aid FX
mortgage holders, highly regressive and
complex changes to the tax regime and intrusive
labor market policies. Furthermore, the
loosening of the fiscal stance in 2010–11 was—
against Fund advice—financed with excessive
special levies on largely foreign-owned sectors
(retail, telecommunication, energy and banking)
and the de facto nationalization of the second
pillar of the pension system.
6.
In this difficult environment,
Hungary’s financial market indicators are

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

deteriorating. Between late-July and
late-December, the forint lost almost 20 percent
against the euro. During the same period, CDS
spreads have widened 160 bps relative to peers
and, at about 600 bps in absolute terms, are
approaching the peak levels seen during
the 2008–09 crisis. Meanwhile, yields on fiveyear government bonds (a proxy for the
marginal cost of government financing) have
risen to around 9 percent, well above the
average nominal interest rate on public debt of
5 percent. Two rating agencies have in recent
months downgraded Hungary to below
investment grade. Nonetheless, based on
available data through September, the share of
domestic government debt held by
non-residents remains high at 37 percent,
suggesting both some resilience on the part of
investors thus far and a significant risk to the
balance of payments in the event risk sentiment
continues to deteriorate.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
The outlook is unusually uncertain
and risks are on the downside. While the
domestic policy mix will be important in
determining both Hungary’s short- and
medium-term prospects, the near term path
for a small open economy like Hungary largely
depends on the extent and duration of the
ongoing Eurozone crisis. To illustrate these
risks, staff discussed with the authorities both
a baseline and an adverse “crisis” scenario.
8.
In the baseline scenario, staff
expects a further slowdown in Europe,
which causes the Hungarian economy to
stagnate in 2012 and recover only gradually
thereafter. Domestic demand declines for a
fourth consecutive year, as credit growth

remains negative, rising inflation undermines
real incomes, and unemployment is high. Even
if the authorities credibly commit to less
interventionist policies, residual uncertainty
may continue to weigh on consumer and
investor confidence. Exports are forecasted to
decelerate in line with developments on
Germany, which is expected to slightly
outperform the eurozone; the current account
will remain in surplus. In this environment,
large external financing needs can still be met,
but at a higher cost and shorter maturity as
non-residents investors’ risk aversion rises and
parent banks continue to deleverage. Public
debt remains broadly sustainable and begins
to fall as growth normalizes and announced

9.
By contrast, in the adverse scenario,
a worsening of the Eurozone crisis triggers
a recession and the emergence of an
external financing gap. The contraction––
which would primarily stem from a sharp fall in
export growth––would likely be less severe
than in 2009 given already weak domestic
demand (See Text Figure and Table 2a). In this
context, an external financing gap would
emerge in 2012–13, largely because nonresidents reduce funding of both sovereign
debt and the banking sector (including off
balance sheet pressures in the FX swap market
as in the 2008–09 crisis). Unlike in the previous
crisis, parent banks may be less likely to
significantly increase their funding to
subsidiaries given the policy environment in
Hungary and pressures in the eurozone. Given

low fiscal and external buffers, such a scenario
could well weaken Hungary’s capacity to meet
its external obligations in 2012–13. Assuming
automatic fiscal stabilizers are allowed to
operate fully, a sharp surge in bond yields, and
only a slow recovery in economic growth,
public debt would continually rise over the
forecast horizon.
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment but saw a low likelihood
of the adverse scenario materializing in its
entirety. They concurred that growth faced
downward risks in the event of a sustained
eurozone crisis. Furthermore, amid rising
global risk aversion, the authorities were
particularly concerned about the spike in
sovereign borrowing needs stemming largely
from the pending repayments to the IMF.
However, they were more upbeat about the
economy’s resilience. On growth, the
government underlined increasing export
capacity, rising trade with non-EU countries,
improving absorption of EU funds, and recent
reductions in impediments to labor
participation as key sources of strength. On
financing, the authorities highlighted the fact
that reserves were twice the level seen before
the last crisis and pointed to large
non-resident holdings of domestic debt as a
sign of confidence in current policies. Staff
countered that reserves are not large
compared to short-term liabilities (see section
D below) and that and that non-resident
investment could quickly reverse, as seen
in 2008.

POLICY CHALLENGES
11.
The core policy challenge for
Hungary going forward is addressing large
debt burdens without choking already weak
growth. In the decade before the 2008–09

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

crisis, economic activity was supported by
substantial foreign borrowing by both the
public and private sectors. As a result, external
and public debt (including inter-company

HUNGARY

loans) surged to 140 percent of GDP and
80 percent of GDP, respectively. However, the
arrival of the crisis was a turning point for
Hungary: as capital flows to Hungary dried up,
the private sector was forced to reverse course,
sharply increasing saving rates and driving a
dramatic correction in the current account (See
Text Figure). As a result, the economy
contracted sharply in 2009, though the
collapse was short-lived due to a fortunate
recovery in external demand. In discussions
with the authorities, staff pointed out that
Hungary may now be at a second critical
juncture. In addition to ongoing headwinds for
private sector spending, external demand is set
to slow sharply, the government is starting to
tighten fiscal policy, and the MNB has
increased policy rates. Thus, like much of
Europe, Hungary now faces the difficult task of
addressing large debt burdens in an
increasingly difficult growth environment. In
this context of constrained options, staff
argued that a policy mix that maintains

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

stability and builds credibility, strengthens
economic institutions, increases
competitiveness and provides growth support
where possible will be critical. With such
conditions in place, backup facilities from
international financial institutions, as recently
requested by the authorities, could support
credibility, provide additional insurance against
external liquidity shocks and help reduce
funding costs.

A. Fiscal Policy: Staying the Course
12.
Staff supported the authorities plan
to consolidate the fiscal stance. The 2012
budget targets a general government deficit of
2½ percent of GDP and implies around
3 percent of GDP in structural fiscal adjustment.
The already announced tightening––which
relies heavily on measures outlined earlier this
year in the Szell-Kalman plan as well as the
more recent sharp increase in VAT (to
27 percent) and excise tax rates––is adequate
to generate small primary surpluses going
forward. Staff agreed that, while ambitious and
pro-cyclical, material adjustment was justified
given that public debt (at close to 80 percent of
GDP) remains high and policy credibility in the

financial markets is low. Furthermore, there is a
real risk that EU commitments concerning
Cohesion Fund could be suspended from 2013
if Hungary remains in violation of the excessive
deficit procedure which inter alia requires a
deficit below 3 percent.
13.
Achieving the authorities’ fiscal
target will in any event be difficult. In
contrast to the authorities forecast, staff
projects the 2012 budget deficit to reach a
looser 3½ percent of GDP, primarily reflecting
more conservative estimates of key
macroeconomic parameters (e.g., growth,
interest rates, and the exchange rate) and
more cautious savings assumptions in regards

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

HUNGARY

to transport sector reforms. Admittedly, even
with staff’s more conservative deficit
projection, fiscal policy is adequate to
gradually reduce the debt burden. However,
implementation risks loom large, particularly
given the weak economic environment.
Furthermore, even on a downward path, the
debt would remain susceptible to shocks and
take many years for the burden to reach
moderate levels by emerging market
standards.
14.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
upfront identify possible corrective
measures in the event that downside risks
materialize. Both the authorities’ and staff’s
forecast include ¾ of percent of GDP in fiscal
“reserves” which are unallocated expenditures:
unless they receive special authorization in
3Q2012 the reserves cannot be spent and thus
would reduce the deficit accordingly. This
cushion may not be adequate, however, to
avoid slippage in the event that the
macroeconomic environment or budget
execution deteriorate materially. In such a case,
the implied outturn could jeopardize Hungary’s
medium term debt sustainability. Staff
suggested that further contingency measures
be identified upfront. In doing so, the
authorities should aim at increasing the
durability of adjustment by focusing on greater
efficiencies in expenditures (e.g. restructuring
state-owned transport companies, rationalizing
public employment on the local level, and
means testing social assistance) rather than
increasing taxes further. Addressing these
issues now could in any event be important
from a medium term perspective: as special
sector taxes on retail, telecommunications, and
energy sectors are expected to be eliminated
in 2013 (contributing to a permanent loss of
revenue from that year), growth may not pick

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

up sufficiently to provide the hoped-for
support to further deficit reduction.
15.
Staff expressed concerns about the
underlying composition of fiscal policy. Staff
pointed out that some recent changes make
the tax and expenditure mix highly regressive,
with negative implications for income
distribution and possibly growth. In addition,
efforts to limit the regressivity of the flat tax
(expanded in 2012 with the elimination of the
basic tax credit), have prompted a large
(18 percent) hike in the minimum wage and
the creation of complex compensation
schemes that considerably increase the
administrative burden of fiscal compliance.
Eliminating special sector levies, revisiting
elements of the flat tax, and rationalizing
related wage and compensation reforms would
minimize adverse effects on medium-term
growth prospects (see section E) and the poor.
16.
Staff called for improvements in
fiscal governance as an added way of
reducing the risk premium. Given already
weak growth, seeking other methods of
building policy credibility could usefully
supplement the necessary fiscal tightening. In
this context, staff suggested a strengthening in
proposed fiscal rules. First, guidelines
restricting the growth in general government
debt should be related to the output gap in
order to avoid excessive pro-cyclical
tightening. And second, with respect to local
governments, more explicit rules-based
borrowing constraints that guide ex-ante
budgeting for individual municipalities and
include formal triggers for non-compliance
would be more effective than current
proposals (See Box 1). In addition, staff
expressed continued concern about the
effectiveness and independence of the
reformed Fiscal Council. At a minimum, it

HUNGARY 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

should be tasked with independent impact
analysis of all fiscal initiatives, including those
with impact outside the current budget cycle.
17.
The authorities pointed to the
improvement in headline fiscal policy
indicators. At a general level, they highlighted
the fact that Hungary’s debt and deficits
compare favorably with the more troubled
countries in the EU periphery. In particular,
the 2011 budget would likely show a surplus.
Furthermore, the recent structural loosening
(i.e. correcting for large one-off revenues due
to the transfer of private pension assets to the

state) was a short-term cost worth paying to
support medium term growth with broader
labor market reform and the “whitening” of the
economy. Looking forward, the authorities
underscored their commitment to meeting
the 2012 deficit target, including the
stipulation in the budget law to not spend the
budget reserves in the event of slippage.
For 2013 and beyond, determination to fully
implement the Szell Kalman plan and
additional yet to be identified measures would
ensure staying within deficit targets under their
Convergence Program.

B. Financial Sector Policies: Increasing Resilience During the Downturn
18.
Both cyclical and structural changes
are weighing on the health of the
Hungarian banking sector. On the one hand,
staff and the authorities agreed that a series of
temporary factors are affecting the banking
sector. The deteriorating economy has
reduced loan demand and undermined
portfolio quality while stress in Europe has
shortened the maturities and increased the
costs of new funding. On the other hand, staff
noted that the banking system may also be
undergoing a more structural change in its
business model, as a combination of the
difficult policy climate in Hungary and
increasing liquidity needs in parent banks’
home countries have triggered a move toward
more locally funded subsidiaries. The decline
in the loan-to-deposit ratio, which fell from a
peak of 170 to 130 percent in September, may
constitute a more structural trend (See Text
Figure). If so, the Hungarian banking sector
faces a sustained and difficult period of
adjustment to a new steady state: though
potentially more stable in the long run, a

financial sector that needs to rely
predominantly on modest local savings for
funding asset growth is likely one in which
funding is more expensive, loan growth is
slower, and profitability is more modest.

In this difficult environment, staff
stressed the importance of safeguarding
near-term stability in the face of the
ongoing crisis in the eurozone. Asset quality

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

HUNGARY

is a particular concern: non-performing loans
to households and firms are high at 14 percent
and are expected to continue to rise over the
coming two years. Meanwhile, amid weak loan
growth, persistent high bank taxes and the
mortgage relief scheme, profitability is likely to
remain low–and in fact negative for some
banks–putting further pressure on capital. Staff
underscored that such challenges call for a
proactive approach by regulators and banks
alike. In this regard, staff welcomed
forthcoming regulations establishing minimum
liquidity ratios and encouraged regulators to
develop contingency plans for sudden
increases in liquidity pressure. In terms of other
buffers, system-wide capital adequacy
continues to be above the regulatory minimum
though there is significant variation among
banks and staff argued that some foreign
owned banks should increase equity
expediently. To provide further safeguards,
staff urged the finalization of a bank resolution
framework as well as creation of a personal
insolvency regime to aid in the process of
addressing distressed debtors and troubled
institutions. Continued and enhanced
cooperation among the government, HFSA,
and the MNB in the context of the Financial
Stability Council would help coordinate the
macro-prudential surveillance.
20.
At the same time, staff argued that
the broader policy framework for the
financial sector needed to adjust to be more
consistent with supporting growth. The
antagonistic policy environment likely
contributed to the far deeper fall in Hungary’s
external funding and credit growth than seen
elsewhere in Eastern Europe (See Text Figure).
While external funding of Hungarian credit
growth may remain permanently lower than
pre-crisis levels, staff called for a policy mix
that provides banks with the incentive to avoid

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

excessive deleveraging. In this regard,
reducing the bank tax to an appropriate size
and avoiding any household debt relief
schemes that put undue burdens on banks
were critical first steps to ensuring adequate
economic growth.
21.
The authorities argued that in many
respects the banking sector was in a much
stronger position than before the last crisis.
Specifically, system-wide capital and liquidity
ratios were considerably stronger and the main
domestic bank without a parent had
considerable buffers and a more benign near
term FX amortization schedule than in
2007–08. The new liquidity ratios referenced
above would help prevent a rapid
deleveraging in the event of an external shock.
And the MNB had improved its tool kit by
creating a short term FX swap facility.

In terms of the more controversial banking
measures, the authorities reiterated their
commitment to cut the banking tax in half
in 2013. However, the government also argued
that banks played a key role in building
vulnerabilities currently weighing on growth
such as Swiss Franc debt and should thus play
a large role in any solution to the problem.

HUNGARY

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

C. Dealing with foreign exchange (FX) Mortgages: Less Government
Intervention
22.
The authorities are focused on
reducing the burden of CHF debt on
households. The government argues that with
two-thirds of all housing-backed debt in Swiss
Francs, the sharp appreciation relative to the
Forint must be a key explanation for the
persistently weak growth in private
consumption. As a result, schemes to reduce
the burden were necessary to resume
economic growth. Staff countered that the
impact of Swiss franc debt on growth was not
clear: only roughly 15 percent of households
have Swiss franc debt and only a subset are
severely liquidity strained, leaving a majority of
households with reasonably healthy balance
sheets (See Box 2); furthermore, there are
several other, possibly greater, headwinds to
private consumption like unemployment, high
interest rates, weak real wage growth, and
falling consumer confidence amid policy
uncertainty.
23.
The authorities did not contest
staff’s assertion that the most recent
measures to address the burden have been,
on the whole, unproductive. There was
agreement that measures taken earlier in the
summer may eventually provide some relief,
such as a National Asset Management
Company to buy properties from insolvent
debtors, an interest rate subsidy scheme, and
the option to rephase mortgage payments by
temporary fixing of the exchange rate used for
debt service at preferred rates (discussed in
IMF Country Report No. 11/137). However, staff
expressed great concern about a far more
interventionist law that was passed in
September. The law allows participating
debtors to pre-pay mortgages at preferred
exchange rates, which implies roughly at

25 percent haircut. This scheme threatened the
stability of the financial sector by reducing
bank capital and triggering further exchange
rate depreciation and FX reserve losses. At the
same time, it provided little relief to the most
distressed borrowers as predominantly well-off
households have access to the forint liquidity
to buy back FX mortgages. More broadly, the
implicit retroactive revision of private contracts
without consulting the banking sector may
have inflicted large and lasting damage on
Hungary’s reputation among investors. In
general, the policy was not consistent with best
practice or recent international experience
(See Box 3).
24.
At the same time, staff conceded
that a voluntary, limited and well designed
restructuring of Swiss franc debt may help
the recovery. The sharp appreciation in the
CHF in the past two years has resulted in acute
pressure on certain households and banks.
Furthermore, despite net debt repayment, the
outstanding liabilities of households have not
fallen due to the valuation effects of FX
depreciation on the debt stock. Staff agreed
with the authorities that thus far, restructuring
initiated by individual banks has not provided
extensive relief. Looking forward, it argued that
regulators should be vigilant and proactive,
ensuring that banks deal with distressed assets
in an expeditious manner. The government
could play an additional role by facilitating
broader and deeper restructuring of distressed
loans throughout the banking sector before
creditors proceed with foreclosure; such loan
modifications could support the economic
recovery and actually increase expected
repayment rates. If the government chose to
play this role, staff argued that three principles
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

HUNGARY

should be respected. First, any policy to
coordinate such relief should be based on
voluntary participation and designed in
conjunction with the banking sector in a way
that respects private contracts. Second, relief
should be targeted at only distressed loans
rather than all CHF debt in order to maximize
support for financial stability and growth while
avoiding the creation of moral hazard. And
third, burden sharing, both across sectors and
time, was appropriate give the severe stress
already hitting bank balance sheets; however,
any costs borne by the government should be
limited and consistent with debt sustainability.
25.
On December 15, the government
reached agreement with the banking sector
association on measures to reduce the
burden of FX mortgages on households. The
agreement includes a 25-percent write off and
conversion into forint for some non-performing
FX loans, flow relief for all debtors current on
their loans, interest subsidies by the
government, and some scope for banks to
deduct losses incurred through the recent early
repayment scheme from the special bank tax
(See Box 4). The scheme’s impact on the

budget depends on participation and the path
of the exchange rate, but appears contained.
Staff pointed out that, as opposed to the early
repayment scheme, the agreement contains
welcome burden sharing and may provide
some relief to distressed debtors, but also
raises some concerns. For example, relief could
be better targeted as all debtors will benefit.
Furthermore, while the final details were
devised in concert with banks, the process as a
whole has not been entirely voluntary.
26.
The repayment, write-off and
conversion of FX loans, in addition to the
halt on new such lending will reduce
currency mismatches. Over time, this will
mitigate an important policy constraint. On
new FX lending, a de facto ban on CHF lending
remains in place and strict prudential
regulations apply to euro-denominated lending
to households (see IMF Country Report
No. 11/137). Recent recommendations by the
ESRB reinforce the authorities’ measures to
curb FX lending.

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Tightening Bias is Appropriate
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that
the constraints facing monetary policy have
increased. For a small open economy with
weak aggregate demand, tightening fiscal
policy, and high real lending rates, a looser
monetary policy stance and a weaker exchange
rate may appear appropriate. But for several
years, underlying vulnerabilities have limited
the MNB’s ability to pursue such countercyclical policy: beyond the constraint provided
by frequent above-target inflation results,
Hungary’s large net external debt implies that
the expansionary impulse from lower lending

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

rates and more competitive exports can be
more than offset by the weaker exchange rate’s
effect on increasing debt service, reducing net
worth, and raising the risk premium. The MNB
noted that the scope for such easing had
nonetheless increased during the summer as
overall risk premia had fallen amid improved
medium–term fiscal prospects in the context of
the Szell Kalman plan. However, since late
August, the situation has reversed course.
External risks from the Eurozone crisis resumed
their upward surge, the FX mortgage
repayment scheme significantly increased

HUNGARY

pressure on the currency, and the planned
sharp increase in indirect taxes pushed inflation
forecasts upwards. In this context, the MNB
argued that stabilizing investor expectations
with tighter policy rates was the most effective
route to attaining their inflation target,
safeguarding financial sector stability and
ultimately supporting the economy.
Nonetheless, the only sustainable solution over
time was one in which risk premia are reduced
via a more consistent policy mix. Staff agreed
with this view.
28.
Foreign exchange reserves do not
provide additional room for maneuver. The
authorities pointed out that while more
reserves would be helpful, the current level is
nearly twice that seen before the last crisis.
Staff noted, however, that short-term external
debt of 45 percent of GDP (on a residual
maturity basis) in a context of rising global risk
aversion suggests a large potential demand on
FX buffers. Furthermore, recent events––
notably the government’s purchase of
EUR 2 billion of shares in the energy company
MOL and the MNB’s provision of FX liquidity
after the recent early mortgage repayment
scheme1––are proof of the unexpected need
for reserves. With respect to the latter, staff
supported the MNB’s decision to provide such
liquidity as it mitigates excessive pressure on
the exchange rate and the particular
agreement with banks included a requirement

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

on their part to reduce short-term external
liabilities.
29.
Staff expressed serious concern
about planned changes in the legal
framework pertaining to the MNB. Without
prior consultation with Fund and EC teams in
Budapest at the time, the authorities on
December 13–14 submitted under expedited
emergency procedures to parliament both a
new Central Bank law and an amendment to
the Constitution which imply fundamental
changes to the institutional structure of the
MNB. Though some amendments were
subsequently made, aspects of both
legislations in staff’s view point toward risks of
a material erosion of Central Bank
independence. More generally, staff warned
that frequent changes to the MNB law—this is
the third in 1½ years—create unnecessary
uncertainties. The Governing Council of the
ECB, in an opinion published on December 22,
voiced similar concerns both on substance and
the process of the proposed legislation. At a
minimum, staff recommended that the
proposals be delayed to allow adequate
discussion both with the IMF and other
partners, including the ECB. The legislation was
nevertheless passed on December 30. Staff
countered that Hungary’s mixed record of
meeting inflation targets (see IMF Country
Report No. 11/35) and still not well anchored
inflation expectations strongly argued against
any steps that may be seen as undermining in
the MNB’s independence.

Fund staff is currently assessing the jurisdictional
implications of this voluntary scheme, which enables
commercial banks to hedge against the exchange rate risk
and the uncertainty in scale of early repayments in HUF at
predetermined and more favorable exchange rates by
FX-denominated mortgage debtors pursuant to a
government-established mechanism. This scheme, which
consists of various transactions, is structured in four
interrelated steps, namely (i) a FX auction, (ii) possibly
multiple daily overnight swaps, (iii) the receipt and use of the
FX, and (iv) a re-exchange of any unused FX.

E. Structural Issues: Address Constraints to Potential Growth
30.
Staff also raised broader concerns
about long-term growth. The authorities shared
staff’s view that potential growth had declined in
Hungary since the mid-2000s and, although
expected to recover going forward, will stay
relatively modest over the forecast horizon. The
MNB in particular highlighted the ongoing weak
corporate credit conditions as posing a risk to
the growth outlook in the medium term. Staff
emphasized obstacles regarding investment and
labor participation as particularly worrisome.
31.
While falling sharply since the crisis,
investment has been in a sustained decline
for roughly a decade. Relative to 2000, Hungary
now has the lowest fixed investment in Eastern
Europe; construction is at only 55 percent of
its 2005 peak. Such low investment has in turn
weighed on real labor productivity which has
stagnated since 2006 and is now the lowest
among regional competitors (See Text Figure).
Staff is concerned both that cyclical factors may
be longer lasting than originally expected and
that the sustained weakness in investment points
to underlying structural factors.

The authorities shared the concern
about investment but argued that continued
strong FDI and EU funds would support
investment going forward. In particular, the

14

authorities pointed to several high-profile
foreign direct investment projects in automobile
manufacturing––expected to total EUR2.3bn
during 2010–13—which will increase export
capacity going forward. Staff conceded this point
but cautioned that total FDI flows remain a
fraction of levels seen in the nineties and earlier
parts of this decade (See Text Figure).
Furthermore, these projects had been planned
over many years and included material tax
incentives suggesting that they may not be
indicative of the broader and more recent
constraints facing foreign direct investment. Staff
did agree that increased absorption of EU funds
would help increase public investment
(forecasted to rise from 3 to 4 percent of GDP)
and could support private sector productivity if
well targeted.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33.
Staff argued that a series of policy
changes could support investment and
increase the competitiveness of the
Hungarian economy, particularly over the
medium term. As noted in Box 5, standard
CGER methodologies find the exchange rate to
be broadly in line with fundaments, although
other indicators (e.g., the Global
Competitiveness Report), suggest that Hungary’s
competitiveness relative to peers has
deteriorated in the last five years. The two most

HUNGARY

problematic factors for doing business are tax
rates and tax regulations. As highlighted in
Section A above, a more systematic approach to
tax and labor market policies would support
growth. The introduction of crisis taxes and
other discriminatory actions in foreign
dominated sectors and regular interventions in
the labor code have reduced both the
receptiveness and the stability of the investment
climate. The third most problematic factor for
doing business relates to access to financing and
is likely getting more difficult at the margin. The
financial sector appears ill-positioned to support
a recovery with affordable local currency lending
given the steady decline in the loan to deposit
ratio, lack of adequate domestic savings, and
high risk premia which in part are policy induced.
Amid such concerns, even a cyclical recovery in
demand may not be adequate to raise fixed
investment to needed levels. In this context, the
reforms referenced in Section B above are
particularly critical.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

female participation rates was around
13 percentage points during the period. Among
other factors, generous benefits have played a
major role in keeping labor participation at such
low levels. However, with the Szell Kalman plan,
the authorities have begun to address such
barriers, namely with changes to the retirement
age and early retirement schemes, disability
pension and sick-pay systems, and social
benefits. Nonetheless, staff argued that certain
aspects of recent reforms–namely the
elimination of the employment tax credit for
minimum wage and increase in employees’
social security contributions-undermine such
progress (See Box 6).

On improving the labor supply, the

progress. For much of the last decade, Hungary

Hungary has yet to recover from
the previous crisis but is now facing
renewed pressure. Falling external demand
and tightening fiscal policy are occurring amid
already weak private sector spending to create
strong headwinds for growth. At the same
time, domestic policy missteps and rising
global risk aversion are weighing on financial
market indicators. Meanwhile, stock
vulnerabilities remain high. In this difficult
environment, Hungary is entering a period of
particularly large borrowing needs due in

large part to pending repayments on
the 2008–09 official sector assistance. While
many of the external factors are beyond
Hungary’s control, a well-crafted policy mix
that avoids the ad hoc interventionist
measures of the past year and strengthens
economic institutions can reduce the
likelihood of an adverse scenario where
Hungary loses market access. It may also lay
the groundwork for a recovery in growth
which has been hampered by deep-seated
constraints to investment and labor supply.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

HUNGARY

36.
Despite the weaker growth
outlook, the planned fiscal tightening is
necessary. Hungary is not in a position to
pursue counter-cyclical fiscal policy due to
high public debt, low policy credibility and
rising financing constraints. An added
constraint is that after eight years in violation
of the EC’s excessive deficit procedure, there is
a real risk that cohesion funds may be
suspended. In this context, the authorities’
deficit target in 2012 of 2½ percent of GDP is
appropriate, even if the somewhat larger
deficit projected by staff is consistent with
debt sustainability. To meet the government’s
targets, more measures should be identified
upfront, despite the implied very ambitious
structural tightening.
37.
The underlying composition of
fiscal policy needs to improve. The
authorities’ commendable efforts to pursue
tighter fiscal policy and reduce bottlenecks
to labor participation have had unintended
adverse consequences. In particular, fiscal
policy has become more regressive,
administratively complex, and distortionary.
This calls for a tax and expenditure mix that
is consistent with debt sustainability but
does not at the same time unnecessarily
undermine growth or burden the most
vulnerable. A more systematic approach
could include revisiting elements of the flat
tax, reducing the outsized crisis taxes,
means-testing universal transfers,
rationalizing public employment (especially
at the local government level), and
restructuring public transport companies.
38.
Strengthening the fiscal
framework would improve governance
on budgetary matters and could reduce
risk premia. The constitutional mandate to
maintain public debt below 50 percent of

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GDP is commendable and recently proposed
rules to achieve this goal over time are a
good first step. These, however, need to be
improved and put in place quickly to be
meaningful and thus increase confidence.
Despite some recent improvements, the
reformed Fiscal Council remains significantly
constrained in its ability to provide an
independent and timely assessment of fiscal
developments; it could be strengthened,
inter alia by legally empowering it with
appropriate resources for independent
analysis on all fiscal matters, including those
with impact outside the current budget
cycle.
39.
With respect to the weakening
financial sector, regulators should
continue to proactively address
prudential concerns. In an environment of
deteriorating portfolio quality, negative
profits, and increasing pressure on funding,
it is important to ensure that banks maintain
adequate provisioning, capital, and liquidity.
The authorities’ forthcoming regulations on
minimum liquidity ratios are welcome.
Meanwhile, some foreign banks should
move more quickly to address capital
shortages. To provide further safeguards,
finalizing a bank resolution framework and
instituting a personal insolvency regime
would help the authorities deal with
distressed institutions and debtors in an
efficient manner. Looking beyond the
immediate stability issues, the legal
framework for the banking sector needs to
become more consistent with promoting
growth by reducing the outsized bank tax
and avoiding interventionist policies to
reduce households’ mortgage debt.
40.
Limited restructuring of Swiss
Franc debt may help the economic

HUNGARY

recovery if designed appropriately. The
impact of mortgage debt in foreign currency
on economic growth may be overstated and
initial efforts to remedy the problem notably
the early repayment scheme, were
detrimental to growth, financial stability and
Hungary’s reputation as a safe place to
invest. There may nonetheless be case for
the government to play a role in facilitating
broader and deeper restructuring of
distressed loans. In doing so, it should
closely coordinate such relief—which should
be voluntary—with all relevant stakeholders,
target only distressed loans, and ensure
adequate burden sharing––both across
sectors and time. The recent agreement with
the banking association is an improvement
on earlier efforts but only partially meets
these standards. In particular, it is not
targeted solely at distressed loans and it is
not voluntary in the strict sense.
41.
The MNB’s tightening bias is
appropriate. Despite weakening output and
high real lending rates, Hungary does not
have the latitude to run counter-cyclical
monetary policy. Though poorly anchored
inflation expectations and above target
inflation are factors, a key near term
constraint are significant currency
mismatches in the economy as reflected in
net external debt of close to 60 percent of
GDP. Furthermore, Hungary lacks the
reserves to ease policy rates and lean
against the pressure on exchange rate as
witnessed in some emerging markets
elsewhere. In this context, an increase in
policy rates that helps stabilize investor
sentiment and the balance of payments is
likely to be the most expedient route to
supporting growth in the near term. This
constraint raises the importance of progress

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

in reducing Hungary’s currency mismatches
and risk premia more broadly.
42.
Changes in the governance
structure of the Central Bank are
worrisome. Though details of the legislation
passed on December 30 still need to be
examined, there are three particular
concerns. First, the frequency with which
changes to the Central Bank law have been
made (nine rounds of amendments in the
last three years) creates an unstable
operating environment for monetary policy.
Second, the rushed process in which the
most recent changes have been submitted
raises serious concerns: there is inadequate
time for comment and consideration by
relevant parties on an issue of considerable
macroeconomic importance. And finally, the
content of the recent proposals themselves
raise questions about the authorities’
commitment to Central Bank independence.
43.
If underpinned by a strong policy
framework, a precautionary Fund
arrangement could relieve some of the
constraints cited above. By increasing
potentially available reserves and anchoring
a stability-oriented policy mix, a Fundsupported program in concert with other
international lenders, may help to relieve
financing constraints and improve investor
confidence. Such external support, which
has been requested by the authorities, will
only be available and effective to the degree
it is based on a strong policy framework and
a sound policy mix with strong ownership
from the authorities.
44.
Staff proposes to hold the next
Article IV consultation on the regular
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Considerations Regarding Hungary’s Recently Proposed Fiscal Rule
In the Constitution passed earlier this year,
Hungary adopted two fiscal rules which
effectively require each subsequent deficit to
reduce the public debt to GDP ratio until it is
below 50 percent and then keep it there. The
authorities are now seeking to make this fiscal
framework more operationally effective with two
new proposals. While broadly consistent with the
EU’s debt reduction objectives, these transitional
rules were developed independently of the
December 9 “fiscal compact” which Hungary has
yet to formally join.
1. Public Debt Growth—Percentage growth of

the nominal debt stock for the next budget
period (d) cannot exceed the difference
between inflation (p) and half the real GDP
growth rate (g): d < (p – ½ g). The rule would
apply to the general government as a whole
but would include intermediate targets for
each level of government. It will only come
into effect in 2016 and the debt reduction is
temporarily suspended if real GDP contracts.
2. Local Government Finances—There are

three key restrictions: (I) no issuance of debt
to finance current deficits; (ii) debt issuance
can be for investment purposes only, and
requires central government approval; (iii)
debt service is to remain below 50 percent of
a local government’s own revenues.
Debt Growth
The key concern about this rule is that it does
not relate the allowed growth in debt to the
size of the output gap. For example, it allows
unlimited borrowing when growth is contracting
even if output is above potential. This latter
element, which is aimed at providing space for a
counter-cyclical fiscal reaction appears overly
blunt. A superior fiscal rule would prevent
excessive borrowing when growth is negative to
anchor creditors’ expectations even in bad times.
Sources: MNB; Staff Estimates

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Local Government Finances
Certain aspects of the proposed restrictions on
local governments are sensible, namely
preventing current deficits, requiring central
government approval for borrowing, and ensuring
that debt incurred is used for investment. However,
the design of the law has a number of
shortcomings, including: (i) the debt service
constraint on local governments may be ineffective
given sensitivity to discount rates; (ii) it is
administratively costly (over three thousand local
entities); (iii) allows significant discretion by the
approving administrators.
The application of the debt growth rule to the
local governments may also prove difficult to
implement. As it applies to the consolidated local
government system rather than each local entity
separately, it raises two key issues: First, it does not
provide guidance for budgeting for any individual
entity, and deviations for the aggregate local
government system could only be discovered expost. And second, it allows a subset of
administrative jurisdictions to remain unsustainable

HUNGARY

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Burden of Swiss Franc Lending for Households
Hungary’s attraction to Swiss franc (CHF) debt
started in 2004. The government had removed a
fiscally unsustainable interest subsidy the previous
year, rendering HUF credit considerably more
expensive. Shortly thereafter, banks responded by
offering CHF-linked products at rates up to
10 percentage points lower than comparable HUF
rates. As a result, lending in CHF soared, mainly to
households, reaching 21 percent of GDP, the
largest such exposure in Eastern Europe (Chart 1).
However, with the crisis, banks’ willingness
(and legal ability) to lend in FX plummeted,
triggering a sharp de facto tightening in lending
conditions much like the subsidy removal in 2003
(Chart 2 and 3). Without a new innovation to
provide cheap credit, households have been
repaying debt in net terms (Chart 4). The
authorities argue that residents’ persistent
indebtedness in Swiss francs explains the sharp
fall in consumption and thus the need for
government intervention.
Debt service for holders of Swiss franc loans
has indeed increased sharply. The Swiss
National Bank’s recently imposed ceiling on the
CHF-EUR exchange rate limited one source of
vulnerability but considerable depreciation has
already occurred and the HUF remains exposed in
movements against the euro. Seventy percent of
CHF debt was incurred at HUF-CHF levels of
145–165 vs current levels of around 240, implying
a 60 percent increase due to the weaker exchange
rate alone. Furthermore, despite monetary easing
in Switzerland, the CHF interest rate burden has
not fallen as it has in Poland––the second largest
holder of CHF loans––due to weaker consumer
protection laws regarding interest rates and
higher risk premia (Chart 5).
Changes in household balance sheets can also
weigh on consumption. The move in the
exchange rate has prevented net debt repayment
from actually reducing the debt stock, meaning

the standard channel for working through a debt
burden is not yet effective (Chart 6).
Meanwhile, though available information on loan
to value ratios does not point to a major concern
about households’ net worth, there is some
reason to believe that the data understates the
full extent of the burden (Chart 7).
However, the importance of the burden to the
broader economy is not clear. First, aggregate
household debt indicators such as debt service to
income are in line with peers and not at stress
levels (Chart 8). Second, household mortgage
and home equity loans, which account for
85 percent of total CHF debt, are held by only
roughly 15 percent of households. And third, the
majority of distressed FX loans are concentrated
in those with lower incomes or those that
received the loans just before the crisis when
lending standards had deteriorated.
Swiss franc debt may therefore be a headwind
for private consumption but is unlikely to be a
key driver of the slowdown. High interest rates
on new lending, still high unemployment, and
falling consumer confidence are major drags for
all households, including the majority that do not
hold CHF debt.
Nonetheless, several principles could guide a
way forward. For example, to the extent there are
government efforts to reduce the burden, the
most effective route would target only the most
distressed households that are more likely to feel
compelled to reduce consumption and/or default
on loans. Over the longer term, what is needed is
higher domestic savings and a lower risk premium
in order to render local currency credit more
affordable without subsidies.

Box 3. Considerations and Experience with “Government Coordinated”
Household Debt Restructuring
Though usually not necessary, government
intervention in household debt restructuring can
be appropriate. Traditionally, banks deal with a nonperforming asset by either modifying the terms of
the loan or writing off the loan altogether and taking
any residual loss after recovering collateral. However,
particularly when the banking system faces a sudden,
sharp, and widespread (systemic) deterioration in
portfolio quality, this normal approach of dealing
with NPLs can become suboptimal. As noted in
Laeven and Laryea (2010), the quantity of needed
restructurings can clog the courts, individual bank
incentives may conflict with helping the economy
recover, and the cost of restructuring can swamp
bank buffers.
Partially to overcome such problems, several
governments in the recent crisis have intervened
in the banking system to coordinate
restructurings. The global economic downturn of
recent years was triggered in part by a bursting of
bubbles in household credit. In the aftermath, fears
that the impact on both the financial sector and the
real economy pressured several governments to
intervene in standard bank procedures and
coordinate top down restructurings.



United States (2008)––Refinancing at subsidized
rates; write-offs to approved loan-to-value
ratios.



United Kingdom (2008)––Payment deferral;
limited government guarantees of deferred
interest payments.



Iceland (2010)––Payment freeze on FX loans;
fast track write off of most of negative equity.



Hungary (July 2011)––Mortgage servicing at
preferred FX rate, reschedule difference; quota
on foreclosures; national asset management
company buys some distressed properties.
Strong Case for
intervention
Collaborative solution
Impact on NPV
Burden sharing



Croatia (2011)––Extension of repayment
period and debt service at preferential FX rate.



Hungary (Sept 2011)––Permitted full
pre-payment of mortgages at preferred FX.

Hungary’s recent proposal contrasts sharply with
the government restructurings conducted
elsewhere. Several key design principles have
emerged that can help the benefits of such
involvement outweigh the costs. Restructuring
should occur when there is a systemic risk to the
economy and provide targeted relief at the most
distressed assets. If borrowers are insolvent, an NPV
negative restructuring is usually needed and burden
sharing with the government can be appropriate
provided it is consistent with debt sustainability.
Finally, the proposals should be designed in
conjunction with the banks and participation should
be voluntary. Measured against these principles,
Hungary’s recent scheme stands out:



Clear Systemic Risk. In the US, nearly 30 percent
of all mortgages are underwater and in Iceland,
household debt is 130 percent of GDP.



Targeted Relief. In Iceland, the focus is reducing
loan to value ratios to sustainable levels. In the
UK, eligibility required income and mortgages
below certain thresholds and proof of payment
difficulties.



Appropriate Burden Sharing. In the UK, the
government guaranteed the deferred interest
payments for banks participating in the
program.



Collaborative solution. Participation in the US,
UK, Croatia, and Iceland schemes was voluntary
both for the banks and the debtors.

Box 4. Agreement Between the Government and the Hungarian Banking Association
On December 15, 2011, the government reached
agreement with the Banking Association on a set of
proposals to guide regulation in the near term, both
with respect to FX loans and the sector more
broadly. Key details of the agreement follow below:
Relief for Banks Who Suffered Losses in Previous
Scheme. In September, the government had
announced a regulation to allow the early repayment
of FX mortgage loans at a preferred exchange rate.
To lessen the impact of this scheme on bank profits,
the government has agreed to allow 30 percent of
the losses to be deducted from the 2011 bank tax.
Relief for Holders of Non-Performing FX
Mortgages. Loans that are more than 90 days
delinquent as of September 30 of 2011 will be
converted into HUF and 25 percent of the
outstanding principle will be forgiven. As the new
HUF loan on the remaining principle will carry a
higher interest rate than the original CHF loans, the
state will provide an interest rate subsidy equivalent
to 50 percent of the benchmark government yield,
declining by 5 percentage points each year for five
years. In an effort to target the benefit to those more
likely in need, eligibility is limited to loans whose
collateral does not exceed a specific threshold. As
with the first pillar described above,
30 percent of banks’ losses related to this debt
cancellation can be deducted from the 2012 bank
tax. The agreement states that the MNB will provide
FX liquidity at market exchange rates to help banks
close the open currency position that results from
the conversion of the loans (note that the MNB has
not separately confirmed its willingness to do this. In
turn, banks will use the FX liquidity to repay short
term external liabilities. In the case of those debtors
who re-default on this subsidized payment scheme,
a National Asset Management Company will buy the
property. The expectation is that the NAMC will
purchase 25,000 properties by 2014, including 8000
by end of 2012.

Relief for Holders of Performing FX Mortgages.
For debtors current on their loans, the scheme
introduced this past summer that fixes monthly debt
service on FX mortgage loans (CHF, EUR, and JPY) at
preferred exchange rates will be extended from
three to five years. However, if the forint depreciates
beyond a certain level, the state will cover all debt
service. For example, if the CHF/HUF rate is between
180 and 270, the debtor will pay 180 but if the
exchange rate goes above 270, the state will pay the
additional principle installments. Meanwhile, similar
to the scheme over the summer, the difference
between the market and preferred exchange rate will
accumulate in the form of a separate loan
denominated in HUF to be repaid by the debtor
after the five years. A new development is that the
interest on the HUF loan will be paid in equal parts
by the bank and the government; the rescheduled
portion is effectively a 5-year interest free loan for
the debtor. To reduce the near-term burden on
banks, the government will temporarily delay the
implementation of a recently passed bill requiring
transparent pricing of interest rates (fixed spreads
over market rates).
Broader Policies for Growth. As previously
expected, the government confirmed that the basis
and rate of the bank tax will remain unchanged
in 2012 but the rate will decrease by 50 percent
in 2013. In 2014, the bank tax will not exceed the
level set by the EU regulation or in the absence of
that, the average of bank tax rates in the EU.
Meanwhile, the government agrees to not submit or
support any further regulation concerning FX
lending unless it is supported by the Banking
Association. With respect to credit growth, any net
increase in the SME portfolio or gross increase in the
retail mortgage portfolio can be deducted from the
basis of the 2012 bank tax, provided the deductions
do not exceed 30 percent of this tax. As of
January 2012, the government and the banking
association will meet quarterly to discuss the
economy and the role of the financial sector in
fostering economic growth. The government will
inform the EC and IMF on the outcome of the
consultations.

Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness of the Hungarian Economy

Improvement of competitiveness would
particularly benefit the manufacturing sector.
Goods exports have been increasingly oriented to
the eurozone, particularly Germany, which
represents more than one third of Hungary’s
external trade. Much potential lies in Hungary’s
further integration in trans-European supply
chains for machinery and transport equipment,
provided weaknesses identified in the GCI can be
addressed and the overall policy environment
remains conducive to foreign investment.

A broader set of indicators suggests some loss
of competitiveness, with implications for
export performance relative to emerging
market peers. The dynamic of competitiveness in
a sample of emerging markets economies is
evaluated by the change in the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness index (GCI) (see
figure). Typically, an increase in the GCI reflects an
improvement in competiveness. From 2006
to 2011, the competiveness of the Hungarian
economy has fallen relative to many emerging
market economies (specifically in East Asia and
Central Europe).

Standard CGER methodologies suggest that,
over the course of 2011, the real effective
exchange rate has been broadly in line with
fundamentals. The ERER approach registered a
material move relative to the fall CGER exercise,
now suggesting no misalignment. This can largely
be explained by the recent sharp depreciation of
the nominal and real exchange rates. This change,
however, appears to be in part driven by recent
fluctuations in investor sentiment and may be
temporary. The MB and ES approaches showed
only marginal changes. Overall, none of the three
approaches reveals a significant misalignment of
the forint for the period.

Change in the Global Competitiviness Index (2006; 2011)

This deterioration appears to have had an
adverse effect on long-term export
performance as measured by the change in
average real export growth. The recent REER
depreciation has induced temporary
competitiveness gains, which are even stronger
when using a PPI-based REER index. Nonetheless,
addressing constraints to doing business,
particularly regarding tax policy, access to capital,
and labor productivity will boost long-term
competitiveness.

Box 6. Measures Affecting the Labor Market
The authorities are taking a host of labor market
measures (see table), with potentially profound
effects. Several policies contradict each other,
introduce long-lasting distortions, and/or not fully
developed yet, making it difficult to assess the overall
effect on the labor market. It is likely, however, that
the measures taken together will increase
unemployment in the short term, essentially making
the government the “employer of last resort”; while
improving labor supply conditions in the long term.
Measures

(i) employers complying with recommended gross wage hike are
compensated for recommended wage increases above 5 percent;
(ii) employees of non-complying emoloyers will be compensated
according to a scheme that is to be specified.
Increase in employees’ social security contribution by 1 percent

Extending public work programs: the 2012 Budget
envisages the doubling of appropriations (to
½ percent of GDP). The government plan
is 200,000 new jobs, but it may not be enough if a
large number of those pushed out of welfare are
unable to find work (FRIB, June 2011).2
Fiscal incentives for employing persons made
unemployed as a result of the government actions:
a social security allowance will be made for
employing former public sector workers and early
retirees. If available only temporarily, this measure
will not increase labor demand but shift demand
towards preferred unemployed groups, creating a
de facto two-tier job-seeking market.

The PIT reform and related ad hoc measures are
likely to be negative for employment, on balance:

 Resulting changes in tax rates seem unfavorable

for employment. An increase in labor supply from
eliminating the super-gross tax base for low
incomes is estimated to be much smaller than a
decline in labor supply due to the repealing of the
employment tax (Benczúr et al).1 A hike in the
worker’s health care contributions will further
depress employment.

 Wage increases (including a minimum wage hike
-

Review of various social benefits will boost labor
supply by reducing disincentives to work.
Implemented measures include significant tightening
of unemployment assistance and capping total social
benefits at below public work wage. There are also
plans, not yet final, to repeal early retirement benefit
(possibly retroactively) and preferential pension
schemes; and to review disability pensions.
Partial-equilibrium simulations by Benczúr et al.
(2011)1 suggest that, if implemented with maximum
rigor, these measures can increase employment by
1 percent in the long-term. Additional incentives to
return to the labor market include: revoking the longterm unemployment support from those who refuse
job offers under the public work programs (see
below), and setting the public work wage well below
the minimum wage (at 70 percent in 2011 and
60 percent in 2012).

of 18 percent) are aimed at compensating workers
negatively affected by PIT changes, but will depress
labor demand. The last minimum wage hike of
similar magnitude, in 2001–02, caused
well-documented employment losses, especially
among low-income.3
The effects of PIT-related wage compensation
scheme is difficult to assess. The scheme to
partially compensate employers for mandatory
and recommended wage hikes, or employees for
tax increases is likely to complicate the tax system
and substantially increase the administrative
burden.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Appendix I. Hungary: Public Debt Sustainability
1.
Under the baseline, Hungary’s
public debt as a percent of GDP is
expected to have peaked in 2010. It is
forecast to decline to around 72 percent of
GDP by 2016 primarily as a result of an
increase in primary surpluses and the
continuation of a relatively small interest
rate-growth differential going forward. To
simply stabilize the debt, a primary surplus of
0.5 percent of GDP is needed, marginally
above the result recorded in recent years.
Nonetheless, given the high level of the debt,
high surpluses are likely necessary in order to
reduce Hungary’s exposure to shocks. Thus,
the authorities’ commitment to meet the
deficit targets spelled out in their March 2011
convergence report is the most important
factor in ensuring debt sustainability in the
medium term.
2.
The main risks to the baseline
scenario stem from the impact of an
escalation of the Eurozone crisis. Under an
adverse scenario, as discussed above, a
recession in the Eurozone weighs heavily on
demand for Hungarian exports while
bottlenecks in the financial sector undermine
a recovery in domestic demand. In particular,
staff assumes that automatic fiscal stabilizers
are allowed to operate fully. Furthermore, the
assumptions include a sharp but temporary
surge in bond yields of 400 basis points,
continued exchange rate weakness and only
a slow recovery in economic growth. In this
context, public and external debt would
continually rise over the medium term. In
order to stabilize the debt under the adverse
scenario, a primary surplus in the range of
1.5-2 percent of GDP is necessary.

3.
In the longer term, fiscal
sustainability may require additional
reforms to the pension system, but the
need for these does not appear
immediate. The de-facto nationalization of
second pillar private pension assets in 2011
provides relief to the pension cash balances
in the near-term, given that new contributors
to the state system will retire only gradually,
as they reach retirement age. The recent
increase in retirement age, the elimination of
early retirement schemes and recent changes
to the pension indexation formula also
contribute to improving the sustainability of
the pension system.
4.
Authorities’ calculations
nonetheless point to additional need for
reform. After these changes to the system
are taken into consideration, the net present
value of net pension expenditures to 2060 is
about -30 percent of GDP (discounted at a
differential of real interest rate and growth of
1 percent). Moreover, some key assumptions
in the authorities’ pension projections appear
optimistic, implying that the need for reform
may be even more significant. First, they
assume an increase of 5 percentage points in
labor participation through the next decade.
Staff estimates indicate that, for example, if
only half of this increase were to materialize,
the authorities’ pension balance would
deteriorate about ½ percent of GDP per year.
Second, the authorities’ projections imply a
sustained decline in the average pension
relative to wages, which may prove
unrealistic for social reasons. Third, the
authorities assume a decline in the number
of pensioners relative to the population at
retirement age after 2040, which appears
difficult to rationalize.

1/ General government gross debt. Estimates based on AKK data.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes. The large residual in 2011 is explained by the transfer of private pension assets to the public sector.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

HUNGARY
Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation and
Second Post-Program Monitoring Discussions—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Martin Mühleisen
January 13, 2012
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report. While the thrust of the staff appraisal remains broadly unchanged, several concerns
raised in the Article IV report have become more pronounced in recent weeks. First, recent
policy steps have added to the already high risks of missing fiscal targets going forward and
reinforced concerns about the quality of fiscal adjustment. Second, the MNB legislation passed
on December 30, 2011 raises serious questions about central bank independence. And third,
new measures that could complete the nationalization of the second pillar pension system begun
last year risk undermining consumer and investor confidence.
On a separate matter, staff recommends that the Executive Board approve multiple currency
practices maintained under the MNB’s scheme of providing foreign exchange (FX) to banks.
The MNB scheme was prompted by the early repayment mechanism for FX mortgages
introduced by the government in September 2011.
Recent Economic Developments
1.
Incoming data point to a further weakening of output. In December, consumer
confidence fell to its lowest level since September 2009, having declined in 11 out of the last
14 months. The deceleration in export growth, which began in early 2011, continued in
November and may moderate the annual current account surplus below forecast levels. Net FDI
was negative for a third consecutive quarter, resulting in an outflow of €1.3bn in the year
through September. Due in part to currency depreciation, end-September external debt and
public debt rose in local currency terms to 146.3 percent and 82.6 percent of GDP, respectively.
2.
In December, the MNB raised the base rate by 50 basis points to 7 percent and
maintained its tightening bias, citing elevated risk premia and inflation concerns.
Consumer price inflation accelerated in November to 4.1 percent year-on-year (versus a
3 percent target) despite a still large output gap. According to preliminary data, the Central
Bank’s FX reserves were higher than expected at end year (€37.8 bn compared to the staff

2
report estimate of €35.2 bn); slightly less than half of the higher result stems from EU funds
while the rest appears to reflect temporary factors that will be reversed in coming months.
3.
Market indicators deteriorated sharply in recent weeks. In the month through
January 6, the forint depreciated by 11 percent to an all-time low against the Euro. During the
same period, bond yields rose to above 10 percent. Meanwhile, five-year CDS spreads exceeded
700 basis points, an increase of more than 100 bps relative to regional peers in one month. Also
in early January, Fitch became the third rating agency to downgrade Hungary’s sovereign rating
to below investment grade with a negative outlook, citing concerns over policy uncertainty, the
medium-term outlook, the weakening of economic governance, and the overall decline in the
investor climate. In recent days, market pressures have moderated amid comments by the
authorities suggesting a greater willingness to reach agreement on a Fund program.
Fiscal Policy
4.
Prior to approving the 2012 budget, the government adopted several measures to
respond to the increasingly difficult macroeconomic outlook. The government revised down
its official GDP growth forecast for 2012 from 1½ to ½ percent, closer to staff’s view of
0.3 percent. To keep the deficit target unchanged at 2½ of GDP, the authorities increased their
fiscal buffers, raising contingency reserves by HUF120bn (roughly 0.4 percent of GDP), to
1.1 percent of GDP. This increase in reserves is financed by (i) making permanent the
redirection of the private pension pillar members’ contributions to the state (HUF 48 bn),
(ii) additional excise taxes on tobacco (HUF 20 bn) and (iii) reclassification of HUF 52 bn in
existing expenditures into reserves. As reserves are considered an expenditure item, the headline
revenue and expenditure numbers have each increased by HUF 68 bn, leaving the deficit
unchanged.
5.
However, other steps taken will have a negative effect on the fiscal balance. First,
more details have emerged after the issuance of the Article IV report on the size of the costs
associated with the agreement with the Banking Association (described in Box 4 of the report).
Given the latest assumptions on participation in the mortgage relief scheme and the level of the
exchange rate, staff estimates that the agreement will cost the government about 0.4 percent of
GDP. This cost is not included in the authorities’ 2012 budget. Second, a government decree
provided more details on the wage compensation scheme which staff now estimates will
increase budgetary costs by a further 0.2 percent of GDP. As noted in the Article IV report, the
scheme provides partial compensation to employers who increase wages for workers hurt by the
flat tax regime. However, to be eligible for such wage compensation, employers must not only
comply with the already implemented mandatory minimum wage hike of 18 percent, but, as
specified in December, also increase all lower end wages (up to just above the average wage) by
an explicit schedule. In addition to the budgetary costs, there is the broader concern that such
large wage increases—while indeed temporarily offsetting the decline in nominal wages due to
tax changes—may have negative effects on employment, especially for new hires for whom no
compensation is provided.

3
6.
At the end of December, Parliament passed the “Financial Stability Law” which
significantly constrains future changes to the composition of fiscal policy. The Financial
Stability Law entrenches several controversial fiscal reforms by being passed as a ‘cardinal’
law, which requires a 2/3 parliamentary majority to change. There are three key components to
this law:


First, it fixes in place the flat average tax structure of the personal income tax
(from 2013) and corporate income tax (from 2015) that was passed late last year.



Second, it completes the de facto nationalization of the second pillar pension system by
permanently diverting all individual contributions to the state and reopening the
possibility of transferring the remaining second pillar pension assets to the state.



Third, the law implements the fiscal responsibility framework described in Box 1 of the
staff report, albeit with some modifications that weaken its effectiveness. For example,
the final version of the fiscal responsibility framework relaxed rules requiring central
government approval of local government borrowing and reduced the frequency at
which the Fiscal Council is required to express its opinions on the budget.

7.
The newly available information worsens staff’s projections of the fiscal outlook
and the quality of fiscal adjustment. Based on an unchanged macroeconomic framework, staff
now forecasts that the deficit will be wider by 0.4 percent of GDP in net terms in both 2012
and 2013 (see table). As noted above, the revisions compared to the staff report primarily stem
from the cost associated with the banking association agreement and the new estimate for the
wage compensation scheme. Without further measures, staff now expects headline deficits
between 3½ and 4 percent of GDP to persist in the medium term, which will cause the
debt-to-GDP ratio to decline more gradually than in the baseline presented in the staff report.
More broadly, the recent measures reinforce staff concerns about the quality of fiscal policy.
For example, the pension reform further undermines the sanctity of contracts and may weigh on
consumer confidence. In addition, an increasingly large portion of the adjustment relies on
unspecified increases in ‘contingency reserves’ which are unallocated expenditures with high
implementation risks as a budget-cutting measure.
8.
Meanwhile, downside risks to the budget outlook have become more substantive. If
recent pressure on the exchange rate is maintained or increased, the size of the interest rate
subsidies (related to the banking association agreement) as well as budgetary interest
expenditures and contributions to the EU would increase. In addition, there is now a statistical
risk (in ESA95 terms) that at least part of the 2011 costs of the banking association agreement
will be recognized in 2012. The European Commission’s recent decision to step up Hungary’s
excessive deficit procedure may imply the loss of EU cohesion funds and negatively affect the
budget outlook from 2013 onwards. On the other hand, if the authorities choose to transfer the
remaining second pillar pension assets to the state, it would improve the measured fiscal
balance. Furthermore, recent improvements in revenue collection, if they persist, would

4
help the fiscal outturn. Finally, second-round effects of the wage compensation scheme and the
banking agreement on gross wages and credit may partially compensate their respective costs.

New Central Bank Legislation
9.
On December 30, parliament adopted a set of amendments to the MNB Act, which
provided the Central Bank with some macroprudential functions. The MNB has become
responsible for the analysis, prevention and mitigation of macro prudential risks inherent in the
financial system. For this purpose, the Act also enables the Governor, in accordance with policy
decisions of the Monetary Council, to issue binding decrees that aim to reduce systemic risk or
prevent their build up in areas not regulated by law or government decrees, such as provisions
preventing the excessive outflows of credit; liquidity criteria preventing the build-up of
systemic liquidity risks; the conditions for the timing, structure and operation of the
anti-cyclical capital buffer; and additional criteria which reduce the probability of bankruptcy
for systemically important institutions.
10.
At the same time, the Act contains several material changes to the governance
structure of the Central Bank. There are at least three key changes:


First, the new law reinstates an Executive Board comprising the Governor and an
increased number of Deputy Governors. The Executive Board’s quorum for making
simple majority decisions only requires the presence of two members and not
necessarily the Governor.



Second, an enlarged MNB Monetary Council (which now is actually its governing
board) has been granted executive powers in addition to its existing policy making
powers: it is responsible for implementing its own policy decisions. In key areas, the

5
extent of the newly created Executive Board’s executive powers depends on how much
power the Monetary Council is willing to delegate—under the previous MNB Act,
executive power was the Governor’s exclusive prerogative.


Third, the Governor’s power to nominate Deputy Governors and to determine their
portfolios has been transferred to, respectively, the Prime Minister and the Monetary
Council.

11.
These changes weaken the autonomy of MNB executives in the current context. The
recent changes are the tenth set of amendments to the MNB act in less than three years; as a
general matter, such a volatile legal environment is not conducive to central bank autonomy.
But the content of the specific measures also raises concerns. For example, the increased
executive powers of the Monetary Council clearly weaken the operational autonomy of the
Executive Board. In addition, according to the MNB, there is no clear operational need for a
third deputy governor right now so the increase in the current context raises concerns about
government influence. And the Governor, not a Monetary Council with membership appointed
by the government, is in the best position to determine the responsibilities of his staff, including
the Deputy Governors. In combination with the government’s recent and frequent criticisms of
monetary policy (including calls for unorthodox uses for FX reserves), these measures raise a
warning flag regarding the independence of the central bank.
12.
A recently passed constitutional amendment may further infringe upon the MNB’s
autonomy. A new provision in the Constitution allows for the possibility of a merger between
the MNB and the HFSA. Although such mergers are not uncommon, the envisaged institutional
arrangement seems to suggest that the current MNB Governor would be demoted and become a
Deputy-Governor in the new entity; accordingly a new Governor would be appointed to head
the new entity. This would entail a removal from office of the current Governor on grounds
other than those enshrined in the MNB Act. Furthermore, it is unclear how the autonomy of the
new entity as a whole and the MNB portion within that entity would be safeguarded with
respect to policy setting and implementation. In the context of the political climate described
above, such a change to the MNB’s governance structure would raise significant additional
concerns.
Exchange System
The early FX mortgage repayment mechanism
13.
In September 2011, the authorities adopted a mechanism by law which enables
debtors to repay early in full FX denominated mortgages at more favorable exchange
rates than current market exchange rates. It is understood that applications by mortgage
debtors to use the mechanism had to be submitted by December 31, 2011. The repayment of the
FX mortgage is made either (i) from the households' own HUF resources or (ii) through new
loans lent to the mortgage debtors in HUF. The special (more favorable) exchange rate is a
reference rate used only to calculate the amounts of HUF needed for the early and full

6
repayment of the FX denominated mortgage and is not available for the conduct of FX
transactions, which continue to be conducted at market exchange rates. Commercial banks need
to absorb the losses resulting from the use of the more favorable exchange rate in the repayment
of the FX denominated mortgages.
14.
The transactions enabled under the government mechanism relate to a capital—
rather than current—transactions. This is because the government mechanism permits the
mortgage debtor to make a single bullet-type full repayment of the FX denominated mortgage.
To date, the Fund has not asserted jurisdiction over MCPs that relate solely to capital
transactions.1 Therefore, MCPs, if any, under the government mechanism would not give rise to
MCPs subject to Fund approval. In any event, however, the government mechanism involves
the use of a special FX rate solely for “reference” purposes and thus, there is no actual exchange
of currencies at this special rate and accordingly does not result in a multiplicity of exchange
rates.
MNB scheme to provide FX to banks
15.
The MNB in early October 2011 put in place a scheme to provide banks with
foreign currency required in the context of the early FX mortgage repayment scheme. The
MNB anticipated that commercial banks would choose to purchase the necessary FX in the FX
market to close their open positions arising from the early repayment of FX denominated
mortgages early on to hedge against the anticipated HUF depreciation. Such action was
perceived by the MNB as having the potential to put additional downward pressure on the HUF
with an adverse macro-economic impact, including on financial stability. To prevent such
downward pressure, the MNB established the FX scheme.
16.
The MNB scheme enables commercial banks—if they so elect—to hedge against
(i) the exchange rate risk (further depreciation) and (ii) the uncertainty in volume of early
repayments in HUF by mortgage debtors pursuant to the government mechanism.
Participation in the MNB’s scheme is voluntary and it will be in place until March 2012. The
MNB scheme consists of a series of interrelated exchange transactions, namely, commercial
banks’ acquisitions of euros at FX multi-price auctions, mandatory daily swaps of the acquired
euros with the MNB using the official exchange rate, and the re-sale of any unused euros back
to the MNB at the original auction rate.
17.
The MNB scheme gives rise to multiple currency practices subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII, Section 3.2 The MNB scheme involves the use of multiple
exchange rates for spot exchange transactions at the same time, such as among accepted auction
bids, between accepted auction bids and the prevailing market rates, the official exchange rate

7
for daily swaps and the prevailing market rates, and the auction rate for the re-sale and the
prevailing market rates. All elements for MCPs under IMF policy are met: (i) The MNB has
established the MNB scheme by way of “terms and conditions.” Thus, it constitutes official
action. (ii) Under the MNB scheme, exchange transactions need to occur in accordance with the
terms of the scheme. Accordingly, the official action is also directly related to FX transactions
(namely, the commercial banks’ acquisitions of euros from the MNB at the weekly multi-price
auctions, the mandatory daily swaps of the acquired euros with the MNB, and the re-sale of any
unused euros back to the MNB). (iii) The official action gives rise to a multiplicity of effective
exchange rates, which can differ from each other by more than two percent at any given time.
18.
Staff recommends that the Executive Board approve the maintenance of these
multiple currency practices. They do not materially impede Hungary’s balance of payments
adjustment and do not harm the interest of other members. The MCPs are also maintained
temporarily (the MNB scheme is scheduled to expire in March 2012) and are
non-discriminatory.

Forthcoming

Principal

The safeguards assessment of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank
(MNB) was finalized on January 28, 2009. The assessment
found that the central bank had a relatively strong
safeguards framework in place. The MNB’s control
environment was well established and the audit and
financial reporting practices adhered to international
standards. The assessment recommended measures to
improve the process of program data reporting to the
Fund and to strengthen audit oversight, especially over
the central bank’s basic tasks.

Since the Informational Annex was issued, the Fund
made jurisdictional findings that Hungary maintains
multiple currency practices subject to the Fund’s
approval under Article VIII, Section 3 arising from the
establishment by the MNB of a foreign exchange
scheme that involves a multiplicity of effective
exchange rates for spot transactions without a
mechanism to ensure that such rates will not deviate
among each other by more than two percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation and Second
Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with Hungary
On January 18, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation and the Second Post-Program Monitoring discussions with Hungary. 1
Background
Economic growth in Hungary is slowing and market perception of recent policy measures has
been negative. After a modest rebound from the 2008–09 crisis, the economic growth is
estimated at about 1¼ percent in 2011; exports, helped by strong links with the resilient German
export sector, were the sole engine of growth as domestic demand contracted for a second
consecutive year.
Growth prospects for the current year are negatively affected by spillovers from the eurozone
crisis and domestic policy missteps. The eurozone crisis is weighing on Hungary’s external
demand, with exports to Europe decelerating since June. Domestically, private consumption is
constrained by tightening credit, rising foreign currency debt service, weak wage growth, high
unemployment, and a sharp decline in consumer confidence. Meanwhile, fixed investment,
which is particularly important for medium-term growth, is declining sharply with little sign of
stabilizing amid a volatile policy environment and ample excess supply.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
Over the past year, the authorities have enacted a number of significant structural reforms and
policy changes. The “Szell Kalman plan” announced in 2011 aimed at improving the medium
term growth potential through structural reforms on the expenditure side. A range of other policy
measures were more controversial, including with financial markets, in particular steps to
support foreign currency mortgage holders, changes to the tax regime and labor market
policies, special levies on largely foreign-owned sectors (retail, telecommunication, energy and
banking) and the de facto nationalization of the second pillar of the pension system.
Fiscal and monetary policy are facing constraints, given financial market pressures and
inflationary pressures. In 2010–11, fiscal policy was expansionary, as permanent tax cuts
caused a widening in the structural deficit by around 3 percent of GDP. The recently adopted
2012 budget tightens fiscal policy substantially, primarily by incorporating elements of the Szell
Kalman plan and raising VAT and excise taxes. In addition, despite a still large output gap, the
Central Bank recently increased the policy rate to 7 percent given ongoing risks to both inflation
and the financial sector from a rising risk premium and a weakening exchange rate.
The slower growth, Europe-wide deleveraging and recent government actions are weighing on
the financial sector. Non-performing loans to firms and households have risen to 14 percent.
The resulting need to increase provisioning–compounded by the large bank tax and the
government’s recent early repayment scheme for foreign currency mortgages–has sharply
reduced bank profits. System-wide capital adequacy remains well above the regulatory
minimum but the sharp losses have necessitated equity increases among select foreign banks.
Meanwhile, liquidity appears adequate but funding is increasingly short term and expensive.
Looking forward, growth is expected to resume gradually from 2013, largely dependent on euro
area growth prospects, but remain below potential for some time. The outlook is subject to
significant downside risks, including possibly the emergence of an external funding gap.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the rebound from the crisis has been modest and vulnerabilities
remain high. Furthermore, concerns about domestic policies and rising global risk aversion are
weighing on sentiments in financial markets. Directors therefore underscored the need for a
well-crafted policy mix that restores confidence in economic governance, anchors the ongoing
adjustment, and strengthens economic institutions.
Directors concurred that, despite the weaker growth outlook, fiscal tightening is necessary given
Hungary’s high public debt and uncertain financing prospects. The authorities’ 2012 deficit
target of 2½ percent of GDP, while ambitious, is broadly appropriate. However, given downside
risks, Directors suggested identifying contingency measures, focusing on durable and
fiscally-sustainable measures that help lay the groundwork for a credible medium-term fiscal

3
stance. Directors also called for a coherent tax and expenditure policy mix that would limit the
impact of fiscal consolidation on growth and protect the most vulnerable sections of the
population.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal sustainability in the recently-passed
constitutional mandate, which requires reducing public debt to below 50 percent of GDP. They
emphasized that lasting improvement in fiscal performance will require a strengthening of fiscal
institutions and governance. In this connection, they underscored that the recently-reformed
Fiscal Council should be significantly strengthened, so it can provide an independent and timely
assessment of fiscal developments.
Regarding the financial sector, Directors noted that in an environment of deteriorating portfolio
quality, negative profits, and increasing pressure on funding, it is important to ensure that banks
maintain adequate buffers. Recent efforts by supervisors to proactively address potential
pressures on banks’ provisioning, capital, and liquidity were therefore appropriate. In particular,
Directors welcomed the forthcoming regulations on minimum liquidity ratios and planned
reduction in the bank tax, and encouraged the finalization of a bank resolution framework.
Directors also noted that the limited restructuring of Swiss franc debt contained in the recent
agreement with the banking sector could help the economic recovery, while suggesting that the
scheme could be better targeted.
Directors agreed that the tightening bias of monetary policy is appropriate at this time
to help contain inflation and better anchor inflation expectations. Monetary tightening, by limiting
exchange rate depreciation, will also support financial sector stability given the large exposure
of banks to foreign-currency household debt. Directors expressed concern that recent
legislation, which changes the governance structure of the central bank, calls into question the
authorities’ commitment to central bank independence.
Directors stressed the importance of tackling the structural bottlenecks that impede investment.
Particular attention must be paid to reforms that improve the business environment,
competitiveness, and labor supply. Directors welcomed recent initiatives to increase labor force
participation rates, while noting that some other labor market reforms need to be better aligned
with this objective.
Directors agreed that a Fund-supported program in concert with other international lenders,
which would require a strengthened policy framework and strong ownership by the authorities,
could relieve some of the constraints facing the Hungarian economy.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Hungary and
Szilard Benk, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
January 18, 2012
The authorities thank staff for the thorough discussions during the Article IV consultation
and for their valuable advice. They agree with the general thrust of the report although
differences of opinion remain on some of staff’s findings. In spite of the challenging external
environment, the authorities are committed to implement prudent macroeconomic policies
and comprehensive structural reforms, including structural fiscal consolidation measures.
Economic Outlook
Economic growth has resumed after the 2008–09 crisis, although the recovery remains
fragile with growth rates below the pre-crisis levels. The recovery was mainly driven by a
rebound in external demand and exports. Internal demand (both consumption and
investments) remains weak.
Renewed risks from the debt crisis in Europe have heightened financial uncertainties,
affecting business and household confidence in major foreign trading partners. The
slowdown in exports negatively affects the Hungarian manufacturing sector, the most
buoyant sector during the recovery, in turn negatively impacting labor demand, households’
disposable income and corporate profits.
Increasing risk premia and tighter credit conditions constrain investment and household
consumption. Even though previously announced major manufacturing investments are
carried out as planned, household investments fall short of previous projections. The
appreciation of the Swiss Franc increased the debt service of households, which is a serious
drag on their disposable income. Moreover, the increased and prolonged uncertainty and
unfavorable unemployment developments structurally reduce households’ propensity to
consume, despite the additional overall net income gained with the introduction of the flat tax
system.
Besides the weak external environment, constrained credit conditions, the weakening of the
exchange rate, the protracted balance sheet adjustment of the private sector and the tightened
fiscal policy, all suggest weaker than expected economic growth. Consequently, the
government has revised its growth projection, and now projects a nearly stagnating economy
for 2012 with a 0.5 percent growth which will only gradually recover in the next few years.
For 2012, inflation is expected to remain above target due to the one-off effect of indirect tax
increases. Inflation is expected to return to around 3 percent in the course of 2013.
Fiscal Policy and Structural Reforms
The government is fully committed to keep the budget deficit below the EU requirement of
3 percent in 2012 and beyond. For this year, the general government deficit target is
2.5 percent of GDP, one of the lowest in the EU. Reaching this target implies a major

2
adjustment in the structural fiscal position of more than 3 percent of GDP. This fiscal
adjustment is based on a broad set of measures, in particular: (i) the growth supporting
measures of the structural reform program announced in March 2011 (Szell Kalman Plan);
(ii) expenditure cuts, in particular cuts in public wage costs, a freeze of social transfers and
other budgetary chapters) and (iii) hikes in VAT rate and excise taxes. The government has
recently taken additional measures due to the weaker growth outlook.
While the authorities prepared the 2012 budget based on a conservative macroeconomic
forecast, they are aware of the risks surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. To ensure that
the 2.5 percent deficit target is achieved even under deteriorating macroeconomic conditions,
high fiscal reserves, now amounting to more than 1 percent of GDP are included in the
budget. Indeed, recent measures have further increased these reserves from the 0.75 percent
of GDP level mentioned in the Staff Report. The government is committed to make every
effort to save these reserves. The budget bill explicitly stipulates that reserves can only be
used in the fourth quarter of 2012 and only to the extent this would not jeopardize reaching
the 2.5 percent deficit target. Under these conditions staff’s deficit projection of 3.5 percent
seems exaggerated, since staff implicitly assumes unrealistically that the full amount of
reserves will be spent.
Structural Reforms
The bulk of the fiscal consolidation in 2012 is based on expenditure measures in the Szell
Kalman Plan. Besides yielding savings equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2012, and an
additional 1 percent of GDP in 2013, the Szell Kalman Plan is expected to stimulate growth
and employment by addressing the key bottlenecks in the Hungarian economy: the
functioning of the labor market, the pension system, public transportation, higher education,
pharmaceutical subsidies, and local government financing. Last December, Parliament has
adopted legislation to implement all structural reforms planned for 2013, including
legislation on local governments, public and higher education, public employment, old-age
pensions, and health care, in particular pharmaceutical subsidies. The review of public
administration institutions and their tasks is ongoing and should be accomplished by April
2012.
Taxation
The government has introduced a new flat tax rate system in 2011. It reduces the marginal
tax rate in order to promote employment. To smooth the transition from the old to the new
system, a set of measures alleviate the uneven impact of the new tax system on various
income groups. The minimum wage has been increased on a one-off basis to compensate for
the tax hike for low-income earners. At the same time, and to preserve employment,
enterprises are compensated for the labor cost increase resulting from the increased minimum
wage. The minimum wage hike, coupled with the compensatory scheme, should also reduce
prevalent tax evasion consisting of only declaring the minimum wage income. Indeed,
compared to the previous general tax credit scheme, the new system is seen as creating
targeted and efficient incentives for unskilled low-income earners to better comply with tax
obligations.

3
The so-called crisis taxes, introduced in 2010 on the telecommunication, energy, and retail
sectors will be phased out as of 2013. The special taxes on the financial sector are reduced in
2012 as stipulated in the recent agreement with the Banking Association (see below). Their
level will be halved in 2013 and should be in line with the average level in the EU countries
from 2014 onwards.
Debt Sustainability and Fiscal Rules
The new constitution, effective January 1, 2012, requires a permanent reduction of the public
debt which is currently close to 80 percent of GDP, to no more than 50 percent of GDP. Until
this target is reached, budget bills must ensure a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, barring special
circumstances such as a severe recession.
The pace of the debt reduction is determined by a countercyclical, simple fiscal rule included
in the recently adopted Stability Act. Under this rule, the allowed debt growth rate is related
to the expected inflation and output growth. Staff observes that the new rule may be
suboptimal under some specific circumstances. However, there is a trade-off between a
simple, easily understandable rule and a rule that fits every circumstance. The government
believes that a parsimonious rule, coupled with the 50 percent debt ceiling serves as an
effective communication tool with market participants, to demonstrate the commitment of the
government to keep the public debt on a sustainably declining path. Experience shows that
the previously more complicated fiscal rule was not well understood by the markets, and
therefore less suitable to build confidence. The government is carefully considering the
staff’s suggestion to relate the allowed debt growth to the output gap instead of the output
growth. This proposal may be justified from a theoretical perspective. However, its practical
implementation faces well-known difficulties, in particular a credible estimation of the output
gap that could lead to policy mistakes.
Monetary Policy and the Central Bank
The authorities concur with staff’s assessment that the current tight monetary policy stance is
appropriate. While the weak internal demand points to little inflationary pressures, the
significant currency mismatch (large stock of FX denominated loans) and the increasing risk
premia leave little room to run a countercyclical monetary policy.
As part of the new constitutional system, a new Central Bank Act has been passed on
December 30, 2011. All comments by the European Central Bank on the draft law have been
taken into serious consideration and most ECB recommendations have been accepted. The
new constitution creates the possibility for merging the financial supervisor and the central
bank. However, no such reorganization will be implemented during the tenure period of the
current central bank governor. The government confirms that it has respected the central
bank independence, and will continue to do so.
Under the new law, the central bank is responsible for the analysis, prevention and mitigation

4
of macroprudential risks, in particular those stemming from the financial system. The Central
Bank Act enables the central bank Governor, in accordance with the decision of the
Monetary Council, to issue binding decrees to reduce systemic risk or prevent their build up
in areas not regulated by law or Government Decrees. Such decrees may for instance aim at
curbing excessive credit growth, and introduce liquidity requirements to avoid the build-up
of systemic liquidity risks. Such measures may also regulate the timing, structure and
operation of the anti-cyclical capital buffers and establish additional requirements to reduce
the risk of failure of systemically important financial institutions.
Financial Sector and FX Mortgage Repayment
Since two-thirds of housing loans are denominated in foreign currency, especially Swiss
Francs, the sharp appreciation of the CHF triggered the adoption of measures to support
households indebted in foreign currency. The measures adopted last summer were generally
well received. They consisted of granting additional credit to finance the increased debt
service due to the appreciation of the foreign currency. However, the measures adopted in
September, allowing full repayment of foreign currency mortgage loans at a preferential
exchange rate, created controversy. They may result in a significant loss for the banking
sector and create pressures in the exchange market. Moreover, the staff argues that the
measures were not sufficiently targeted to borrowers for whom the appreciation of the Swiss
Franc created the most serious difficulties. Therefore, last December, the government has
reached agreement with the Banking Association on a scheme that ensures a more balanced
burden sharing among households, the banking sector and the government, as detailed in Box
4 of the Staff Report. The government agreed to not submit or support any further regulation
concerning FX lending unless it is supported by the Banking Association. Furthermore, this
recent agreement should have a positive impact on growth as it also includes a lowering of
the bank levies according to the amount of new loans that banks extend to small and medium
size enterprises.
Final remarks
Hungary is in the process of implementing long-lasting structural reforms. The aim of the
government is to enhance credibility in the financial markets, preserve macroeconomic
stability and increase the economic growth potential. These ambitious objectives could be
more successfully reached under a program supported by the European Union and the Fund.
Therefore, the authorities have requested from the EU and the Fund a precautionary financial
support arrangement. The authorities are committed to engage in these negotiations in a
constructive manner, ensuring a successful outcome.
