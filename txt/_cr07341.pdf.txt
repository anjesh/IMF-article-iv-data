Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Portugal

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: A modest recovery is finally underway, led by strong external demand.
In response, corporate investment shows signs of strengthening, but overall domestic
demand remains weak. Decisive action is being taken to address fiscal imbalances
accumulated during the 1990s.
Challenges: The underlying economic situation remains difficult: productivity growth
continues to lag, the loss of competitiveness has not been regained, and the income
convergence process with the EU is in reverse. At root, Portugal’s challenges can be
traced to low levels of human capital, investment in R&D, and Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) penetration, but also to shortcomings in the
business environment, insufficient competition in domestic markets, and labor market
rigidities.
Staff views: The current favorable economic setting should be used to further
streamline the public sector and to boost productivity and competitiveness. In
particular, expenditure plans should be adhered to, the revenue overperformance
locked-in, the labor market made more flexible, and the contestability of the
nontradable sector increased.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s analysis, which
overlapped considerably with their own. The authorities concurred with the need to
lock-in the revenue overperformance, though they stressed the need for caution in
setting targets and the uncertainty of the revenue strength. On competitiveness, the
authorities agreed there is a problem but downplayed the significance of the standard
indicators. On the labor market, the authorities intend to increase flexibility, but
thought its rigidity is somewhat overstated.

I. OVERVIEW: BOOM TO BUST
“The Portuguese economy is in serious trouble. Productivity growth is anemic. Growth is
very low. The budget deficit is large. The current account deficit is very large.”
Olivier Blanchard, 2006
1.
Portugal boomed at the end of the 1990s. The prospect of adopting the euro
turbocharged the convergence process as real interest rates plummeted, investment and
consumption (fuelled by borrowing) boomed, and the underlying fiscal stance loosened. The
result was rapid growth of GDP, employment,

wages, debt, and the current account deficit.
GDP Per Capita PPS
90

2.
Boom turned to bust in 2000. Balance
sheets became stretched and, as the expected
productivity gains failed to materialize, corporates
cut investment and employment, and growth
slumped. Reflecting the erosion of competitiveness
and negative external developments, exports flagged,
and the convergence process went into reverse.

Real wage increases have waned, but with
anemic productivity growth, unit labor costs have remained high. Wage growth
moderated to the euro area average as the economy slowed after 2000. However, real wage
increases continued to outpace labor productivity growth, further raising unit labor costs.
Poor productivity growth can be traced to low levels of human capital, investment in R&D
and ICT penetration, but also to shortcomings in the business environment, insufficient
competition in domestic markets, and labor market rigidities.

The sustained large current account
deficit (and the corresponding external
indebtedness) is symptomatic of the
imbalances of the economy. In particular, it
reflects weak competitiveness, sustained high
private sector borrowing1 and declining
household savings, and the large fiscal deficit.
As a member of the euro area with a robust
financial sector, external financing is, however,
readily available.

5.
Recent policies have been impressive, especially on the fiscal front. The
government that came to power in March 2005 (with, for the first time, a single-party
majority) has started expenditure-based fiscal consolidation, reformed the pension system
(both private and public) and improved the business environment.
II. OUTLOOK: A MODEST AND FRAGILE RECOVERY
6.
A modest recovery is finally underway. Growth rose to 1.3 percent in 2006 (still the
lowest in the euro area), led by strong external demand, which is driving a notable rebound in
export growth (Box 1). In response, corporate investment shows signs of strengthening, but
overall domestic demand remains weak as the anticipated retrenchment of households in
response to their debt burden unfolds, and construction activity continues to decline. And
while employment and participation rates have risen, so too has unemployment. Inflation has
remained consistently higher than the euro average despite a still-significant output gap and
sluggish domestic demand, suggesting rigidities in product and labor markets.
7.
Staff’s central scenario is one of continuing but modest structural adjustment
and gradually strengthening growth. With fiscal consolidation broadly as envisaged by the
government’s SGP commitments, modest further structural reforms are projected to prompt a
gradual recovery in competitiveness and productivity. Strong external demand is expected to
lead to a positive contribution from the external sector (though exports are projected to lose
slightly more market share), while domestic demand will likely remain subdued.
Consumption should be constrained by weak employment growth and high indebtedness,
though credit growth has picked up.2 While some corporate balance sheet restructuring has
1

At end-2006, household debt was around 125 percent of disposable income, the second highest in the euro
area.
2

The acceleration in household credit is driven mainly by non-mortgage lending, reflecting the recovery in
economic activity and intensified bank competition. For corporates, survey data suggest that lending is driven by
debt restructuring and M&A activity, rather than investment.

5
occurred, still-high enterprise debt levels may restrain any rebound in investment. Staff
projects growth of around 2 percent in 2007 and 2008, in line with official and Commission
estimates. Over the medium-term, staff foresees growth increasing to around 2¼ percent
leading to a closing of the output gap by 2012—before settling down to potential rates of
about 2 percent.
Box 1. Portugal’s Exports: Blip or Recovery?
After several years of dismal performance, exports of goods and services picked up strongly in 2006,
growing at almost 9 percent in real terms compared to an average of 2½ percent in the previous five
years. What explains this surge, and are there signs it might be a blip or a more permanent recovery?
•

•

•

•

Exports were led by strong demand in Portugal’s main trading partners (especially Spain,
Germany, and the U.S), though smaller
12
Portugal's Export Grow th and Export Share
partners (such as Angola and
(Percent)
Singapore) contributed.
10
The 2006 pick up was mainly due to
faster growth in exports of machinery
and transport equipment, manufactured
material, as well as tourism and
transport services; clothing and
footwear sectors remained stagnant.
The loss of market share in recent years
appears to have stopped (though this
also happened in 2002–03 before falling
again).

On the other hand, a wide range of indicators still suggests Portugal has a significant
competitiveness gap.

Since the beginning of this decade, two trends stand out:
•

•

Portugal continues to move away from
low-tech exports (clothing and
footwear), although the process is
slower than in the 1990s.
Portugal’s export share continues to slip
in the EU market, its largest export
destination, but has been growing
outside the EU (though these markets
are still comparatively small).

As external demand is forecast to remain robust,
the strong response of Portugal’s exports to
world demand since 2006 bodes well for a
gradual recovery. However, given the
competitiveness loss of recent years, it seems
premature to expect any gains in market share.

8.
Risks to near-term growth outlook appear balanced, but are skewed to the
downside further forward. In the short term, private investment may not pick up as
strongly as projected, but exports could grow more strongly, benefiting from more favorable
global demand. In the longer term, the main risk is that the pace of reform will slacken and
balance sheet problems may depress household consumption and investment.
9.
The authorities were more optimistic, especially about the prospects for private
investment, and saw stronger growth over the medium term. The authorities emphasized
that business investment excluding construction grew by 3 percent in 2006, after a long
slump and that substantial foreign investment plans were in the pipeline. Overall, the
authorities saw upside risks to domestic demand in the near-term and growth accelerating to
3 percent by 2010.
III. POLICY CHALLENGES
10.
Staff and officials agreed that raising the economy’s long-term growth potential
requires maintaining the reform momentum, building on the gains already made. The
current favorable economic setting should be used, in particular, to further streamline the
public sector and to boost productivity and competitiveness. Further streamlining the public
sector would help regain competitiveness by moderating wage growth (as in the Netherlands
during the 1980s and 1990s) and improving the efficiency of public services. And greater
competitiveness would spur growth and employment, easing fiscal adjustment. In contrast,
letting the reform effort slip would increase the duration and costs of adjustment.
11.
There was broad agreement that Portugal continues to face a competitiveness
problem. Staff estimates, based on a range of indicators, indicate a real exchange rate
overvaluation of some 10–20 percent.3 While these estimates should be assessed with
caution, the presence of such a gap is consistent with developments in relative unit labor
costs, the current account and export market share. Going forward, fiscal consolidation,
balance sheet adjustment by households, and a series of product market reforms should help
narrow this gap, but at the current juncture, staff considered that, on balance, the real
exchange rate was overvalued.

While agreeing with the challenges facing Portugal, the authorities downplayed
quantitative assessments of competitiveness based on standard indicators. In the
authorities’ view, standard indicators of competitiveness (such as equilibrium real exchange
rates) suffered from significant methodological shortcomings and masked the fundamental
restructuring underway in some sectors of the economy.
A. Streamlining the Public Sector
"Good results only mean that we are...able to reach the end of the path faster. But there is
still road ahead of us."
Prime Minister Sócrates, Budget address, 2007
13.
Much-needed, expenditure-based fiscal consolidation is now firmly underway.
The overall balance improved sharply from a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2005 to
3.9 percent of GDP in 2006 (without one-off measures), compared to a budget target of
4.6 percent of GDP. The improvement was mostly due to lower spending.

Most of the deficit overperformance relative to the budget was driven by revenue
strength towards the end of the year. While such revenue strength is being seen
elsewhere in the euro area, in Portugal’s case, the marked improvement in tax
administration is clearly a contributing factor.

14.
Reflecting stronger-than-expected fiscal outturns, the authorities have updated
their deficit targets for 2007 and 2008. In April 2007, the authorities revised the deficit
targets set at the time of the SGP in

15.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to accelerate the pace of consolidation,
but saw a greater opportunity to further front-load the adjustment. Data through June
suggest that revenues are coming in stronger than envisaged at the time of the revision,
driven primarily by buoyant corporation tax receipts. In staff’s view, somewhat more
ambitious deficit targets for 2007 and 2008 were warranted given the substantial
uncertainties about the budgetary implications of the current fiscal reforms, the growing
pressure to cut taxes, and to make the remaining adjustment in 2009 (an election year) and
2010 to achieve the MTO more credible. Specifically, staff saw a case for maintaining the
envisaged pace of structural deficit reduction, which implies additional tightening by about
¼ percentage point of GDP in both 2007 and 2008. Staff also supported the new mechanism
in place to better monitor budget execution of local government, but noted that any further
large shortfalls of capital spending compared to budget should be carefully monitored.

While agreeing in principle, the authorities pointed to the need for caution in
setting targets. The authorities expressed their concerns about whether the current revenue
buoyancy would last, partly due to high volatility in corporate tax. Nevertheless, they stated
their intention to lower the deficit further to the extent that the revenue overperformance
persists. On spending, officials concurred with staff’s assessment that there may be overrun
risks, in particular, in social transfers, health, and transfers to the public roads company, but
stressed their close monitoring of monthly spending patterns and that a contingency
reduction had been implemented to ensure the targets are met.
17.
Staff recognized that recent reforms had substantially improved long-term
sustainability. The recent fundamental changes to the social security system imply that if the
underlying (i.e., non age-related primary balance) MTO position is achieved and maintained,
public debt would remain below 60 percent of GDP through 2040. However, the debt ratio
would exceed 90 percent of GDP by 2050 (compared to nearly 200 percent of GDP before
the reform), and the SGP reference level for the deficit of 3 percent of GDP would also be
breached in the 2030s. Assumptions in the long-term projections could also prove optimistic,
especially, for example, health-care inflation.

The restructuring of the central administration is making good progress and is
entering a critical phase. The number of central administration structures has been cut by a
quarter, the new public employment framework has been submitted to parliament, and
recruitment has been kept to less than half of departures. Staff and officials recognized that
the process is now entering a critical phase of identifying significant numbers of weakerperforming civil servants and moving them into the special mobility pool (where they will
receive increasingly lower pay as an encouragement to leave).
19.
With fiscal consolidation performing better
than expected, the government has faced pressure
to reduce the tax burden; staff and officials agreed
it should be resisted (Box 2). Given Portugal’s fiscal
situation and the relatively low revenue ratio, no room
exists for a discretionary reduction in the tax burden in
the near term. Nevertheless, some tax laws should be
further simplified and procedures, which could have a
significant impact on competitiveness, especially for
small and medium-sized firms, streamlined.

Fundamental reforms to substantially
enhance the budgetary process are envisaged. The
interim report of the program budgeting committee
envisages moving to performance-based, medium-term budgeting with expenditure ceilings.
Staff agreed that such a reform would greatly enhance the efficiency and quality of public
spending and would make government fiscal programs more transparent and credible, but
suggested that the target of a full roll-out by 2010 may prove unduly demanding.
B. Boosting Productivity and Competitiveness
“The problems have been diagnosed...what the Portuguese expect...is action and more
action...we need to increase our productivity and to be more competitive.”
President Silva, Inaugural Address, 2006
Wage restraint and labor market flexibility
21.
Given the membership in EMU, staff noted that competitiveness needed to be
restored by a combination of factors that includes sustained wage moderation.
Experiences from other economies point to the importance of wage moderation in regaining

17

Box 2. Making the Tax System More Pro-Growth
The current tax system has its roots in the late-1980s tax reform, when the VAT and the income tax were
introduced in preparation for EU accession in 1992. Since then, the tax burden has increased, but remains
low compared to other industrialized countries and below the EU average. The system relies more on
consumption taxes than the European average, which is typically positive for long-term growth, a result
of good (although declining) VAT productivity, but also the low revenue response of income tax (mainly
due to generous base reductions and noncompliance).
Tax administration has recently improved (updated registers; better use of electronic filing; improved
audit results; more reliable databases; and better use of cross-checking), helping bring the administration
more in line with international best practice. But there is considerable scope for the tax administration to
further encourage growth by promoting a fair and less burdensome business environment.
Given the current need for fiscal consolidation, measures to make the tax system more pro-growth
require a balanced approach between policy and administration, such as: strengthening the economic
efficiency of the tax system (through broadening the tax base which, in turn, could create some margin
for revenue-neutral rate reductions); increasing the system’s simplicity and predictability; reducing
administrative and compliance costs; and enhancing tax administration (through greater focus on
taxpayer services and a reduction in noncompliance).

competitiveness and that this process may take considerable time, even with a highly
flexible labor market (Box 3). For Portugal, however, indicators suggest significant labor
market rigidities. Despite high unemployment in recent years and widespread use of
temporary contracts, real wages have not fallen. This in turn may reflect substantial
employment protection of permanent workers and limited movement within employment.
22.
Against this background, staff saw the recent decision to increase the minimum
wage by 5.3 percent a year annually on average between 2007–11 as potentially
problematic. While the minimum wage is only binding for 5 percent of the total
employment, it is substantially higher in sectors facing intensive competitive pressures,
including textiles (15 percent). In staff’s view, the existing high employment protection
combined with a higher floor on wages could make the much-needed restructuring more
challenging. The authorities, however, emphasized that the minimum wage had eroded
significantly in recent years and that poverty remained a pressing issue.
23.
Staff urged the authorities to take the opportunity of the current labor code
review to take steps to make the labor market more flexible. In this context, staff stressed
that it will be important to ease employment protection legislation (especially for
individuals), end the automatic extension of collectively agreed contracts to firms not part of
the agreement, and make procedures less cumbersome.
24.
Officials broadly agreed with the need to make the labor market more flexible,
but some differences emerged. In the authorities’ view, while there is scope for increasing
labor market flexibility, and action will be taken, staff overstated both the problems and the
benefits. The authorities saw the labor market as more flexible than the standard indicators
suggest, especially in practice. They also explained the difficult political economy aspects of
labor market reform, especially in the Portuguese historical context of “solidarity.” In their
view, the focus of reform efforts should be on enhancing labor productivity and human
capital rather than restraining wage growth, which they pointed out has been slightly below
inflation recently.
25.
Progress is being made to support labor market participation and skill
upgrading. Recent changes to the unemployment benefit system to broaden the definition of
“acceptable” employment and to promote more active job-seeking should encourage more
rapid reintegration by the jobless into employment. The authorities indicated that the “New
Opportunities” program has been successful in boosting training and skill level of the labor
force. Staff welcomed the extent of the initial take-up and the outcome of the “New
Opportunities” program, but cautioned that care should be taken to ensure that the quality of
the training does not deteriorate as numbers increase.

19

Box 3. The Importance of Labor Market Flexibility in Regaining Competitiveness
The experiences of Hong Kong SAR and Germany, both
with fixed exchange rates, suggest labor market flexibility is
key to regaining competitiveness, but the adjustment
process can still take many years.
Hong Kong SAR faced a large competitive shock stemming
from the 1997 Asian crisis and integration with the
mainland. Similarly, Germany experienced significant cost
pressures in the early 1990s with unification. In both cases,
the key to adjustment was wage moderation and labor
shedding from manufacturing and low-end services towards
higher value-added services, which lowered unit labor costs.
In Hong Kong SAR, this process took about six years,
involving a sharp contraction in output upfront followed by
sustained deflation. Its highly flexible labor market allowed
nominal wage growth to turn negative, especially in
manufacturing. As a result, the REER depreciated by about
5 percent a year. The economy rebounded strongly and the
trend growth rate increased. In contrast, the adjustment
process took about 12 years in Germany. With less flexible
labor and product markets, the REER depreciated gradually
at about 2 percent a year based on a sustained reduction in
real wages.
Portugal has broadly followed Germany’s path, but its unit
labor cost of manufacturing continues to rise and the REER
has barely moved. A 10–20 percent competitive gap implies
the adjustment could still take about 5–8 years, assuming
equal labor productivity growth but lower nominal wage
growth in Portugal relative to the euro area by 2 percent
annually.

Staff and the authorities concurred that increasing domestic competition in the
nontradable sector was key to improving productivity. Increased competition in the
nontradable sector was critical to ensuring that real wage moderation in the tradable sector
results in lower prices rather than higher mark-ups. Lower prices could also foster support
for labor market reform. Key areas to be addressed include the business environment,
network sectors, and energy.

Staff welcomed the emphasis and progress made on improving the business
environment. All the mission’s interlocutors welcomed the substantial improvement
generated by the government’s “SIMPLEX” program which, for example, greatly eased
procedures to create companies. Initiatives to simplify the permit system, especially at the
local level, should further enhance the business environment.
28.
There was agreement that the Competition Authority should continue to
advocate and enforce competition, as done recently in the pharmaceutical and
telecommunication sectors. In this context, the planned spin-off of the cable network
operator from Portugal Telecom in September was welcome, though staff suggested that its
effectiveness for enhancing competition may be determined by whether the two network
operators share the same ownership structure going forward.
29.
Progress continues to be made on increasing competition in the energy sector
and integration with Spain is accelerating. Electricity consumers have been able to choose
their suppliers since September and the electrical and gas grid company is about to be
privatized. But their immediate impact on electricity prices will be muted by the decision to

pass on to consumers the costs arising from existing electricity supply contracts and the

critical and staff argued that actions such as the recent capping of regulated price increases
should be avoided. In the gas sector, it was agreed that meeting the target of end-2008 for
full liberalization will be important.
Safeguarding financial system soundness
30.
Staff and the authorities agreed that Portugal’s financial system remained
sound. While intensified competition has resulted in banks granting somewhat more
favorable lending terms, and in a slight deterioration in banks’ liquidity ratios, average loanto-value ratios are in line with other EU countries, nonperforming loans remain low, and the
banking sector compares favorably with those of other EU countries in terms of asset quality,
efficiency, and profitability (capital adequacy is about average). Recently, profitability has
been helped by the economic pick-up, and banks have further rationalized operating costs
and enhanced risk management procedures in adopting Basel II. While interest rates have
risen and unemployment inched higher, the increases are modest and the FSAP exercise last
year found that the financial system could withstand even severe macroeconomic
disturbances.4
31.
The authorities have made progress in implementing FSAP recommendations
(Table 8), and the Bank of Portugal is monitoring key risk areas closely. The FSAP last
year found that the financial system was well supervised. Since then, the Bank of Portugal
has further strengthened its supervisory capacity with the adoption of a new risk rating
system, completion of the Household Wealth Survey, and enhanced housing price statistics.
High household and corporate debt remains the main source of risk to the financial system.
In addition, bank lending concentrates on the real estate sector and on a limited number of
large corporates, and banks’ employee pension schemes are exposed to stock market
fluctuations. While the FSAP found risks were well managed, staff stressed the need to
update the results regularly. Therefore staff welcomed the Bank of Portugal’s plan to conduct
bottom-up stress tests every other year, with the next round due early 2008. The forthcoming
results of the wealth survey will also help risk management by identifying key vulnerable
subgroups of households.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Decisive action is being taken to correct the fiscal imbalances accumulated
during the 1990s, and the results are beginning to be seen. In particular, substantial,

4

24
expenditure-based fiscal consolidation is now firmly underway, the pension system has been
reformed, and the business environment has been enhanced.
33.
But the economic situation remains challenging and a significant external
competitiveness gap persists. The income convergence process with the EU has reversed,
and labor market rigidities, coupled with anemic productivity growth, cast doubt about the
ability to substantially lower unit labor costs. To regain competitiveness and increase the
economy’s long-term growth potential, further reforms are needed. This means making the
most of the current favorable economic setting and building on gains already made to further
streamline the public sector and to boost productivity and competitiveness.
34.
The ambitious fiscal deficit reduction target for 2006 was surpassed. This
improvement was mainly driven by expenditure reduction, especially of the wage bill, and to
a lesser extent by unexpected revenue strength in the latter part of the year. This strong
performance reflects the authorities’ determination to stick to tight expenditure targets and to
strictly enforce the new local and regional government financing framework, as well as
recent improvements in tax administration.
35.
The revenue overperformance is continuing and should be saved. The
government’s intention to do so is welcome, but somewhat more ambitious deficit targets for
2007 and 2008 (by about ¼ percent of GDP), front-loading the adjustment, seem warranted
given the continuing revenue boom, the uncertainties about the budgetary implications of the
current fiscal reforms, and the need to make the remaining adjustment in 2009 and 2010 to
achieve the MTO more credible.
36.
Following through on central administration restructuring will be important for
achieving fiscal consolidation goals and improving productivity. Encouraging progress
has been made, and it will be important to follow through in the forthcoming critical phase of
moving significant numbers of civil servants to the special mobility pool.
37.
Pressure to reduce the tax burden in the near term should be resisted. Given
Portugal’s fiscal situation, there is no room for a discretionary reduction in the tax burden in
the near term. But there is scope for further simplifying some tax laws and procedures and
the recent improvement in the efficiency of the tax administration should be built upon.
38.
The plan to move to performance-based budgeting is welcome. Such a move
could greatly improve the efficiency and quality of public spending, though care should be
taken to ensure the timetable is not unduly demanding.
39.
A comprehensive strategy is needed to substantially enhance the economy’s
potential growth. Fiscal adjustment, while necessary, is not sufficient to regain
competitiveness and boost productivity and a comprehensive strategy is needed to avoid
prolonging the recent slump. Strengthening productivity, including by enhancing

25
contestability in the nontradable sector, is a key element in this strategy, but the effect of
policies on productivity is uncertain in both impact and timing. It is thus also essential to
address the cost side of competitiveness through policies that might foster wage moderation.
40.
In this regard, the government’s reform strategy would be strengthened by
addressing labor market rigidities more fully. The government’s intention to consider
reforming the labor market in setting up a commission to study the issue is thus encouraging,
and should be quickly followed by concrete measures. In particular, it will be important to
ease employment protection legislation (especially for individual dismissals), end the
automatic extension of collectively agreed contracts to firms not part of the agreement, and
make procedures less cumbersome. In this context, the impact on labor market functioning of
the recent decision to sharply increase the minimum wage in coming years should be
carefully monitored.
41.
Strengthening ongoing product and service market reform could also
appreciably boost competitiveness and consumer welfare, lending support for reform in
general. Important progress has been made with the SIMPLEX program, and initiatives to
simplify the permit system, especially at the local level, should further enhance the business
environment. Continued progress on increasing competition in domestic markets, especially
in network industries and some service sectors, will also be important. Among other areas,
improving the working of the judicial system should be a priority.
42.
Progress continues to be made on increasing competition in the energy sector.
However, the immediate impact on consumers is likely to be limited and actions, such as the
recent capping of regulated price increases, should be avoided.
43.
The financial system remains sound and well supervised. Some risks have
increased slightly, though the system’s capacity to absorb even severe macroeconomic
disturbances is strong. Close monitoring of key risk areas, as being exercised by the Bank of
Portugal, should help ensure the financial system’s continued health, and in this context, the
progress made on following up on last year’s FSAP is welcome.
44.
Portugal is encouraged to increase its ODA to 0.7 percent of GNI. Statistical data
provision is adequate for surveillance. Nevertheless, improvements in timeliness and quality
of employment and wage compensation data and sectoral balance sheet data should be a
priority (Appendix II).
45.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the standard 12-month cycle.

Table 8. Portugal: Status of Implementation of FSAP Main Recommendations
Recommendation
Short-term stability issues
? Continue to carefully monitor key risk areas:
- household debt, especially toward more vulnerable
sub-groups of household borrowers;
- corporate debt developments;

- banks’ lending concentrations;

- and banks’ external borrowing and the associated
pricing and liquidity risks.

Status

Results of the new round of the wealth survey will become available in the second half
2007.
Refinement of existing statistics for cohorts of corporate sector and development of credit
risk analytical tools were introduced.
Supervisory and macro-prudential attention continues to be dedicated to bank lending
concentration issues, including the development of analytical tools and enhanced
requirements for the measurement and management of concentration risk, as well as for
the public disclosure of banks' policies.
Liquidity risk monitoring and assessment continues to be central in the banking system
financial stability analysis, with an assessment based on both quantitative and qualitative
information.

? Continue to ensure bank capital levels are consistent
with the evolving risk outlook and if necessary impose
additional capital requirements using the discretion
available under Basel II.

Banco de Portugal aims at ensuring the alignment between capital levels and banks' risk
profile on an ongoing basis. The possibility to impose additional capital requirements was
not made available by Basel II as it was already foreseen in Portuguese regulation.

? Improve statistics on housing market, in particular, as
regards property prices.

Private sources resumed the production of house price indexes in October 2006 with
improved raw data and methodology.

? Continue to foster banks’ systems to accurately
measure, monitor, and adequately control risks, and
further strengthen the BdP’s supervisory capacity in this
area.

Banks' risk management systems have been enhanced recently following the adoption of
Basel II. BdP's capacity in this area is also being strengthened namely in the context of
the adoption of a risk rating system (MAR).

? Perform further stress testing on the financial system
at appropriate intervals, taking into account banks’
linkages with the insurance sector and their employee
pension funds.

A new run of stress-tests encompassing the whole range of materially relevant risks to the
banking system is programmed to take place in early 2008.

Structural and longer-term issues
? Improve the judicial framework for debt recovery by
speeding up court processes in particular.

...

? Enhance the financial independence of the securities
and insurance supervisors, Comissão do Mercado de
Valores Mobiliários (CMVM) and the Instituto de Seguros
de Portugal (ISP).

The possibility of the Government to appropriate CMVM surplus was eliminated for 2006,
through the inclusion of a provision in the 2006 Budget Act. This new provision reinforces
the financial independence of the CMVM as it makes it clear that (i) the budget lines of the
CMVM will no longer be subject to freezing (as happened in the 2003–05 period and
which is still the rule applicable to public bodies in general) and (ii) the CMVM is allowed to
spend its surpluses without prior authorization of the Ministery of Finance. There is a
commitment of the Ministery of Finance to include a permanent provision on the subject of
the surplus and a proposal for a revision of the Ministerial Order setting CMVM
supervisory fees. The ISP is preparing a proposal to ammend its charter, enhancing the
financial independence rules. The proposal will be submitted to the government in July
2007.

? Transfer the management of the guarantee fund for
Motor Third Party and workers compensation from the
ISP to other organizations.

There is already a public commitment of the government about this transfer. A decision
about the new operational structure is expected by the end of 2007.

Refinements to supervisory and safety net arrangements
? fully implement the new system for risk profile
assessment of credit institutions and other financial
intermediaries, as planned; and
? in insurance supervision, set appropriate fit and proper
criteria for members of governing bodies of insurance
undertakings and intermediaries, strengthen corporate
governance requirements, and establish rules or
guidelines on market conduct regarding the problem of
fraud.

The implementation of MAR is currently taking place. Banco de Portugal has already
applied the new system to a few institutions and a detailed programme to fully implement
the methodology has already been devised and will be made effective in two stages (end2007 and end-2008).
The ISP is finalizing a proposal to amend the law that lays down the conditions governing
the carrying out of the insurance business on this specific matters. It is expected that this
ammendment will be approved till the end of 2007.

Fundamental reforms to substantially enhance the budgetary
process are envisaged. The plan is to move to performance-based,
medium-term, budgeting with expenditure ceilings.

Strengthen budget planning and control and move toward
comprehensive multiyear budget targets.

Budget planning

The 2003 Labor Code enhanced flexibility by increasing the duration
of fixed-term contracts and easing collective dismissal but did not
address the fundamental difficulty of restrictive employment
protection legislation. The government has set up a commission to
study options for labor market reform.
Significant progress with the SIMPLEX program to cut red tape and
enhance the business environment. Good progress increasing
competition in the energy sector.
In line with the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP, bottom-up
stress tests are now conducted every two years with the next one
due early 2008, banks' risk management systems have been
enhanced, the wealth survey has been conducted to monitor key risk
areas, and house price index has been improved.

Increase flexibility by relaxing employment protection legislation and
collective bargaining arrangements.

Pursue comprehensive range of product market reforms to
strengthen the business environment and increase domestic
competition.

Ensure adequate bank capital under Basel II, improve statistics on
housing market, further strengthen banks’ systems to measure and
control risks, and perform further stress testing.

Product market

Financial sector

Structural reforms
Labor market

The reform of the social security system for the private and public
sectors has significantly improved long-term fiscal sustainability.

Curtail long-term spending pressure from population aging by
additional fiscal adjustment and reforms.

Population aging

Implementation
Deficit reduction target for 2006 was surpassed without one-off
measures. The improvement was driven by expenditure reduction
reflecting the civil service reforms and wage restraint, improvement
in tax administration, and firm application of the new local and
regional government financing framework.

Fund Recommendations

Reduce fiscal deficit to 0.4 percent of GDP by 2010 through
structural expenditure measures without one-off measures, including
civil service reform.

Appendix II. Portugal: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Notwithstanding
some recent improvements, statistical weaknesses continue to hamper the assessment of
economic developments. Portugal subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and the relevant metadata have been posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board. Portugal’s publication policy is characterized by a high degree of openness
and extensive use of the Internet. The Bank of Portugal, Ministry of Finance, and National
Statistics Office (INE) have several websites with long- and short-term economic indicators
and data.
2.
Real sector statistics were improved in the fall of 2000, when INE published a full
set of national accounts based on ESA95 methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates.
Shortcomings in timely and high quality monthly and quarterly data on output, employment,
and total wage compensation hamper the monitoring of within-year developments in the
labor market. Unemployment data also suffer from statistical problems caused, inter alia, by
frequent revisions to the measurement of unemployment and sampling rotations.
3.
Fiscal sector data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to
ESA95, sizably altering revenue and expenditure and hampering comparisons across years.
From 2001 onward, budgets have been presented in a manner consistent with recent changes
in national and fiscal accounting methodology. Intra-year budget data are available only on a
cash basis. In 2002, INE started to publish data for the Social Security Fund on a monthly
basis with a 45 days delay, and in 2003 for the Autonomous Funds on a quarterly basis with a
75 days delay. Except for the local and general government, data broadly meet the SDDS
timeliness standards. Quarterly general government statistics on an accrual basis are available
as derived from the national accounts statistics.
4.
Trade and balance of payments data are provided according to the IMF’s fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The external trade data meet the timeliness
standards, although revisions are frequent and sizeable. The portfolio investment collection
system has a simplified threshold of €500 million, which is relatively high in comparison
with many EU countries. The authorities estimate however, that only about 1.5 percent of
transactions are not captured on a monthly basis by this threshold, and that this reporting
simplification does not significantly hamper the quality of the monthly balance of payments.
Moreover, they believe that all transactions below this threshold are included in the first
release of the annual balance of payments data, and the monthly numbers are revised
accordingly.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 28, 2007

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unaltered.
2.
The economy continues to show signs of modest recovery. Output growth slowed
slightly to 1.6 percent year-on-year in the second quarter (1.9 percent quarter-on-quarter
annualized). Domestic demand strengthened as investment rebounded after nine consecutive
quarters of decline, and private consumption firmed. As expected, export growth, while
remaining robust, slowed somewhat. Unemployment declined to 7.9 percent and labor costs
edged up to 3.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter. The current account deficit
continued to narrow. Short-term indicators remained broadly stable; the coincident indicator
of economic activity was robust in August, though industrial production slowed. Inflation
(harmonized) declined to 1.9 percent year-on-year in August.
3.
As envisaged by staff, the fiscal accounts continue to be buoyed by strong
revenues. Preliminary data through August indicate that revenue collection remained strong,
boosted primarily by corporate tax receipts. Spending remained subdued, in part due to
timing issues, but is likely to pick up in the remainder of the year in line with the budget.
Further progress has been made with identifying civil servants to be moved to the special
mobility pool.
4.
Portugal appears to have weathered the recent tensions in financial markets
relatively well, though risks remain. Financial markets followed similar trends in Germany,
the US and the UK; interbank rates and bank credit default spreads increased and bank equity
prices fell. While the recent decline in Portuguese bank equity prices has been somewhat
more pronounced, they remain above their end-2006 levels due to the sharp gains made
earlier in the year. The Bank of Portugal recently surveyed banks’ liquidity and their
exposure to US sub-prime mortgage markets and to asset-backed commercial paper conduits,
and found their liquidity position to be comfortable and their exposure negligible. Several
banks have also issued new bonds since mid-August. However, as Portuguese banks rely on
significant foreign borrowing, protracted tensions in international capital markets, especially
in the euro area, constitute a risk.
5.
Although real sector indicators are yet to be affected, the recent market tensions
have worsened the growth outlook. While the full implications of the market tensions are
still being played out, current indications are that the impact on real economic activity in
Portugal is likely to be modest⎯staff have revised down the 2008 forecast from 2 percent to
1¾ percent (with no change for 2007). In line with the greater downside risks highlighted in
the current World Economic Outlook, the global growth implications could slow export
growth and protracted tensions in financial markets could tighten credit conditions.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Portugal
and José Cardoso, Advisor to Executive Director
September 28, 2007
1. Introduction
We want to start by thanking the Article IV staff team for their thorough, constructive, and
insightful approach to this consultation. The staff’s report is balanced and broadly
corresponds to the authorities’ own analysis and interpretation of the evidence. The staff’s
recommendations are welcome and also agree with the main guidelines of the Portuguese
authorities, namely in what concerns streamlining the public sector and enhancing overall
productivity growth. The staff’s evaluation of the soundness of the financial system, as well
as the favorable assessment concerning the implementation of FSAP recommendations, is
also to be underlined. As for the Selected Issues Paper, it includes several insightful
contributions on very important topics concerning the Portuguese economy. As always there
are caveats in these exercises which we stress below.
The Portuguese economy is gradually recovering from the protracted period of low growth
observed in the first half of this decade, and converging to the average rates of growth
observed in the EU. The implementation of measures aiming to enhance trend productivity
growth continues to be vital. At the human capital level, potential policy measures tend to
produce visible effects only in the medium to long-term. At the institutional level, reforms
aimed at the correction of the structural imbalance of public accounts and conducive to
improvements in the functioning of goods and labor markets may have significant effects on
productivity over a shorter horizon.
There are several important features of the recent behavior of the Portuguese economy that
deserve being highlighted. Economic activity accelerated, boosted by exports of goods and
services and, more recently, by a recovery of corporate investment. Labor market
conditions remained broadly unchanged, with high rates of unemployment and of long-term
unemployment. The general government deficit declined considerably, more than projected
in the Stability Program, reflecting significant improvements in the structural balance. In
tandem, a number of major reforms were launched, notably the social security reform, which
is likely to bring a notable improvement in the sustainability of public accounts. In turn, the
banking system continued to confirm its capacity of adjustment to the low growth of the
Portuguese economy and strengthened its capacity to absorb adverse shocks in its balance
sheet and profit and loss account.
2. Macroeconomic Overview
The Portuguese economy grew 1.3 percent in 2006 (after 0.5 percent in 2005) and
projections point to a gradual acceleration in 2007 and 2008. The projected outcome in
2007 and 2008 is based, on the one hand, on a significant recovery of total factor productivity
growth and, on the other, on an acceleration of corporate investment, in a context of robust

2
growth of total exports of goods and services. It should be underlined that the projected
acceleration of activity in Portugal is bound to be insufficient to resume the real catching-up
process with the country’s European partners in 2007 and 2008, even though GDP growth is
expected to converge to the level of the euro area in 2009. Moreover, the average economic
growth over the current business cycle has been considerably lower than in previous cycles,
reflecting to a large extent the low level of trend productivity growth.
It should be stressed that the series for GDP per capita corrected for PPP as a percentage of
the EU average presented in the report (pgs. 3 and 6) has a break in 2003. The series break is
referred to in the Eurostat metadata and is due to a change in the methodology used for the
computation of rents, affecting the Portuguese PPP exchange rate series. This methodological
break amplifies the fall observed in GDP per capita corrected for PPP as a percentage of the
EU average. In light of this fact, the sentence in the executive summary mentioning that the
“convergence process with the EU is in reverse” should be qualified.
Exports of goods and services were buoyant in 2006 and, albeit to a lesser extent, in the
first half of 2007. This is in clear contrast with the disappointing performance in the two
previous years, where the Portuguese economy is estimated to have lost 10 p.p. in real export
market shares. The behavior of Portuguese exports must be interpreted in the light of the
gradual process of adaptation to a changing pattern of comparative advantages at a global
level. Among the key features of this process are the geographical diversification of export
markets, the decline in the share of exports in goods from traditional low-tech sectors and
with a poorly qualified labor force, and the higher share of services in total exports. The
available information in nominal terms shows overall positive developments both by groups
of products and by geographic markets. In the export structure by products, it is important to
highlight sales of machinery and appliances and, albeit to a lesser extent, vehicles. In
contrast, exports of clothing and footwear continued to fall. The greatest contributions to
export growth came from some traditional geographic markets, although stress should be laid
on the substantial growth of sales to other markets.
According to the recent trade statistics, nominal exports of goods and services decelerated
from around 14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to around 9 percent in the second
quarter of 2007. This deceleration was concentrated on the exports of goods, from 12.7
percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 7.0 percent in the second quarter of 2007. In turn,
exports of services recorded a year-on-year rate of growth of 15.0 percent in the second
quarter of 2007, broadly unchanged relative to the fourth quarter of 2006. Even though a
deceleration of the exports of goods was fully expected, in line with the deceleration in
activity and in the volume of trade of the main Portuguese trading partners, it is difficult to
assess whether exports will continue in the future to broadly follow global demand growth.
First, exports have been quite volatile in 2006 and in the first half of 2007. Second, the
dynamics of exports have been significantly influenced by the behavior of some specific
sectors, the impact of which cannot be immediately extrapolated into the future. Finally,
relative unit labor costs have continued to rise in Portugal, even though the globalization

3
process and the productive restructuring enhance the difficulties in interpreting these
price-competitiveness indicators. We thus agree with the conclusion of the Selected Issues
Paper I on “Portugal’s Export Rebound in 2006: Recovery or Blip?”, that there is a high
degree of uncertainty concerning the near-term evolution of exports of goods and services.
Regarding the recent recovery in corporate investment, it is important beforehand to place
its evolution in light of the Portuguese economy’s adjustment to a new regime characterized
by structurally lower and less volatile financing costs in the second half of the 90s. This
regime change implied a rise in the ratio of corporate investment to GDP from around 14
percent in 1996 to around 18 percent in 2000. Following this sharp dynamic, one would
expect a gradual slowdown once the transition to the new steady state was complete. The
reduction in growth expectations in the early 00s tended to amplify this adjustment against a
background of growing macroeconomic imbalances, of uncertainty concerning the
implementation of the necessary structural reforms deemed necessary to reinforce economic
competitiveness, and of structural weaknesses in terms of human capital. Corporate
investment thus declined considerably between 2001 and 2005, and the ratio of corporate
investment to GDP declined to around 15 percent in 2005.
The forecasts for 2007 and 2008 point to a significant recovery in corporate investment. This
dynamic is to be supported by an expected robust behavior of global demand, by the gradual
restructuring of the Portuguese productive structure, and by the significant productivity gains
in industry observed since 2000. Moreover, and in contrast to a message reiterated in the
staff’s report, high enterprise debt levels should not constitute by themselves a restraint on
the investment outlook. This conclusion is clearly supported by the Investment Survey
conducted by Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), the Portuguese national institute of
statistics, where financing conditions are reported by firms not to be a relevant limiting factor
to their investment decisions. Furthermore, data on profitability and solvency, as well as the
low number of recorded default situations, also corroborate that conclusion. This
notwithstanding, the recent turmoil in financial markets has tilted the balance of risks
concerning the projections of investment clearly to the downside. The impact of these
developments will depend on the persistence of the current instability in money and credit
markets, on the degree of repricing of credit risk, and on the degree of tightening of credit
availability. These elements are, however, still surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty.
3. Fiscal Policy
3.1 Recent Developments
We fully agree with the staff’s report when it states that decisive action is being taken to
address fiscal imbalances accumulated during the 1990s. When the current government
assumed its functions in March 2005, the government stated that fiscal policy would
abstain from one-off fiscal measures and that the structural causes of fiscal imbalances
would be addressed. A reform program was implemented with ambitious results for the long

4
run and visible results in the short run that surpassed targets.
The background prior to these reforms was characterized by an expansionary fiscal policy
with a clearly pro-cyclical stance until 2000. The continued deterioration of the structural
primary balance resulted mainly from the expansion of primary current expenditure, only
partially offset by an increase in the tax burden. In 2002, the need to correct the budgetary
imbalance led to the implementation of a slightly restrictive and pro-cyclical fiscal policy.
Nevertheless, given that the measures implemented had a one-off and essentially short-term
impact, they were not enough to reverse the upward trend of primary current expenditure, in
particular, pensions expenditure. In the following years until 2005, the fiscal position
deteriorated. These developments were not in line with the guidelines of the Stability and
Growth Pact, according to which until a Member State reaches its medium-term budgetary
objective, a positive change in the structural primary balance is required. In 2005, Portugal
recorded again an excessive deficit situation and the structural primary balance reached its
lowest value since Portugal’s participation in the euro area. In this context, a strong structural
adjustment was necessary. Therefore, in 2006 the budget policy was remarkably more
restrictive than the policy pursued in the euro area countries as a whole and the structural
balance has converged towards the euro area average.
The restrictive stance of the fiscal policy is apparent in the significant reduction in the
structural primary deficit in 2006 (2.4 p.p. of GDP, from 2.8 percent to 0.4 percent of GDP),
reached due to a rise in revenue (in particular tax revenue) and a reduction in primary
expenditure. In this context, it should be noted that, for the first time since 1997, primary
current expenditure as a percentage of GDP decreased (0.7 p.p. of GDP).
The implemented reforms decisively stamped the impressive evolution of the Portuguese
fiscal position in 2006. The general government deficit recorded an expressive reduction
of 2.2 p.p. of GDP (reflecting an increase in revenue of 0.8 p.p. of GDP and a reduction of
expenditure of 1.4 p.p. of GDP), from 6.1 percent to 3.9 percent of GDP, which was much
more favorable than the objective of a deficit of 4.6 percent of GDP laid down in the
Stability Program. This result reflected the reduction of the structural deficit in 2.2 p.p. of
GDP. Therefore, the recommendation of the Council of the EU, setting out an adjustment of
the structural balance by 1.5 percentage points of GDP, was also clearly exceeded,
reflecting the successful fiscal consolidation efforts.
Regarding the fiscal consolidation, some highlights are essential to mention in the field of
current revenue and current expenditure. Current revenue increased significantly in 2006
(7.1 percent), chiefly due to the strong expansion of tax revenue (6.1 percent), which
translated into an increase in this item by 0.7 p.p. of GDP. These developments resulted from
the discontinuing of tax incentives in the 2005 State Budget, the adoption in the personal
income tax of a new marginal rate of 42 percent in the 2006 State Budget, and the increase of
the standard VAT rate from 19 to 21 percent in July 2005. The continued improvements in
the collection procedures by the tax administration also contributed to the revenue increase.

5
The reversal in the trend of primary current expenditure as a percentage of GDP in
2006 resulted mainly from the impact of the fiscal consolidation measures implemented since
mid-2005, in particular those relating to the containment in the government wage bill and
current transfers in kind to households (chiefly due to the enforcement of the new rules
regarding medicine and diagnostic co-payments, and regarding conventions with health
service providers), as pensions expenditure continued to increase at a strong pace.
Following last years’ trend, the strong increase in pensions expenditure resulted both from
the increase in the number of pensioners and in the average pension. Three factors can be
highlighted in 2006 regarding the social security sub-system: (i) the annual increase in
pensions (approximately 2.3 percent in the general contributive system); (ii) the convergence
process of minimum pensions in the general system towards values indexed to the national
minimum wage (a process ended in 2006); and (iii) the composition effect resulting from the
fact that the new pensions are, on average, far higher than pensions ceased to be paid.
The government wage bill decreased by 0.7 p.p. of GDP, due to the net fall in the number of
civil servants, the impact on the average wage resulting from ingoings/outgoings of this
sector, and the freeze of automatic progressions in public administration careers, which were
only very slightly offset by the moderate increase (1.5 percent) in the civil servants wage
scale.
To conclude the analysis of current expenditure, it should be noted that in 2006 the
composition of current expenditure was influenced by the fact that, at the end of 2005, five
hospitals of the National Health Service were converted into or were included in public
corporate entities. Therefore, in 2006 they are already classified in the non-financial
corporate sector, i.e. outside the general government sector. The conversion of these hospitals
led, on the one hand, to a decline in the government wage bill and intermediate consumption
and, on the other, to an increase in transfers in kind from the general government to
households, which include payments for the services rendered by corporate hospitals.
Regarding public debt, notwithstanding the significant reduction in the primary deficit (from
3.4 percent to 1.1 percent of GDP), the persistence of a deficit has kept the still rising trend
of public debt recorded in last years. In 2006, the public debt rose 1.2 p.p. of GDP to 64.8
percent of GDP. In spite of the continued growth of the stock of government debt in the past
few years, expenditure on government debt interest increased only slightly as a percentage of
GDP, due to the fact that the implicit interest rate has remained virtually unchanged. In fact,
due to the high share of government debt issued at a fixed rate and the redemption of
Treasury bonds at rates even higher than those currently prevailing, the rise in euro area
interest rates did not fuel an increase in the implicit interest rate of government debt.
The 2007 State Budget was adopted on November 2006. It targeted a general government
deficit of 3.7% of GDP, confirmed in the December 2006 Stability Program update.
However, in March 2007 the government announced a downward revision in the deficit

6
target of 0.4 p.p. of GDP to 3.3 percent of GDP. The adjustment in the structural budget was
0.4 p.p. of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP. Given the better-than-expected fiscal outturns, the
government has faced strong pressure to reduce taxes. The Portuguese government agreed
with staff that in the near-term there is no room for a discretionary reduction in the tax
burden, and reaffirmed its best efforts to adopt the necessary structural reforms and to avoid
one-off measures, in a credible and sustainable process of fiscal consolidation, towards the
medium-term objective of a structural balance of -0.5 percent of GDP in 2010 set down in
the Stability Program. As the staff’s report quotes, “good results only mean that we are …
able to reach the end of the path faster. But there is still road ahead of us”.
3.2 Tax System
With respect to the section in the report on “Streamlining the Public Sector” and the
Selected Issues Paper II on “Making Portugal’s Tax System More Pro-Growth”, there are a
few clarifying issues that deserve mention, namely related to the outturn of investment
expenditure, the new local and regional government financing framework, and the references
to VAT productivity.
Regarding the reference to under budget developments in local government capital
expenditure (pg. 13 of the report), the outturn of investment expenditure in Portugal is
usually below budget. In this context, the 2006 developments do not constitute an exception.
This notwithstanding, the decline in investment expenditure as a percentage of GDP had a
significant contribution to the improvement in the fiscal position in 2006 and this should
continue to be highlighted.
Several charts (pgs. 14, 15 and 17 of the report) miss the reference to the year the data
depicted and/or the source they are based on. In addition, the chart on pg. 13 of the report
could be changed in order to better illustrate the relative position of Portugal as far as
primary current spending is concerned. Indeed, as the chart presents primary current
expenditure as a percentage of GDP indexed to 1995=100 and given that Portugal had a fast
growth in this item since then, it appears to be significantly above the other countries in the
chart, while actually, in spite of the growing trend, the respective level still lies below some
of them.
The reference to the VAT productivity (pg. 17 of the report and pg. 12 of the Selected Issues)
states that VAT productivity in Portugal in the last few years has been high, although
declining. Concerning the absolute value of this indicator, and given the definition used, it
should be noted that a country with a higher share of VAT receipts stemming from reduced
rates is placed in a worse position in this type of comparison. To avoid this problem, and if
there is information available, only VAT receipts stemming from the standard rate should be
used in the indicator. In addition, the measure is not adequate to assess the evolution of VAT
productivity when there are changes in the rates. Indeed, in Portugal, there was an increase in
the standard rate of VAT from 17 to 19 percent in the middle of 2002 and from 19 to 21

7
percent in the middle of 2005, but the reduced rates were kept unchanged. As such, and
mechanically, the value of the indicator declined, which might lead to the misleading
interpretation of a decline in VAT productivity.
Regarding to the percentage of arrears recovered which were securitized (pg. 17 of the
Selected Issues), the text states that “the value of arrears recovered reached 1 percent of GDP
in 2006. While about 70 percent of the arrears are securitized (…)”. However, the available
information points to a figure close to 0.2 percent of GDP for the value of recovered arrears
which were securitized in 2006.
Finally, with regard to the reference to the municipal surcharge in the corporate income tax
(pg. 19 of the Selected Issues) from 2007 onwards, the municipal surcharge may go up to 1.5
percent of the annual taxable profit and not to 10 percent of the corporate income tax
generated in each municipality as before.
4. Labor Market and Competitiveness
Regarding to the recent developments in the labor market, the unemployment rate stood at
7.9 percent in the second quarter of 2007 (7.3 percent in the same quarter a year earlier and
7.7 percent in 2006 as a whole). Long-term unemployment continued to record very high
levels, accounting for over 49 percent of total unemployment in the second quarter of 2007
(51.7 percent in 2006). The pattern of unemployment may reflect a fault line between the
professional skills of the unemployed and the new job offers within the gradual productive
restructuring which is under way. The high financial coverage of the unemployment benefit
scheme and the significant potential duration of payments may also be contributing to the
increase in long-term unemployment. In this vein, the changes in unemployment benefit
policy introduced in early 2007 should contribute to increase the incentives to job search by
the unemployed with shorter contribution careers. Another measure that should be
highlighted is the “New Opportunities” initiative, which aims to make the upper secondary
level the minimum standard for the qualification of youth and adults. In this regard, two
major targets up to 2010 for the education and training systems were set: (i) to enroll the
youth in vocational education and training courses and (ii) to qualify adults, giving a new
opportunity to those that, due to a sub-investment in education for decades, did not have the
opportunity to carry on longer and qualifying training pathways when younger.
In spite of the continuing increase in the unemployment rate and the proportion of long-term
unemployed in recent years, there has not been a significant adjustment in the private sector’s
aggregate wages. The cyclical behavior of aggregate wages, besides reflecting significant
changes in the sectoral composition of the labor force, have also been affected by the degree
of wage rigidity in Portugal, one of the highest in the EU. In a context of low inflation and
low productivity growth, nominal wage rigidity hinders the ability of firms to adjust to
negative shocks in demand, leading them to adjust the level of employment rather than
wages. In addition, curbs on the capacity to change the number of workers in the light of

8
market conditions are conducive to the closure of firms that could otherwise redeploy
successfully.
In this context, fostering a framework of labor market policies that are compatible with an
increase in corporate efficiency and in the incentives to labor supply are important elements
in enhancing the ability of the economy to adapt to domestic and external shocks. These
elements are particularly relevant at a time when the change in the pattern of comparative
advantages, associated with the globalization process, requires a significant reallocation of
resources in the economy. We therefore concur with the Selected Issues Paper III on
“The Importance of Labor Market Flexibility in Regaining Competitiveness”, regarding the
importance of some labor market reforms. We also highly commend the quality of the
analysis, undertaken in a state-of-the-art multi-country DSGE model. However, in our view,
the attempt in the paper to bridge the issue of improving Portugal’s competitiveness with the
model experiment of changing steady-state mark-ups in the labor and goods markets is not
convincing. In fact, the various model simulations basically imply that a fall in mark-ups is
associated with significant rises in GDP, consumption and hours worked, with some
reallocation of factors between the tradable and non-tradable sectors. However, labor
productivity stays basically unaltered in the steady-state. The exercise and the conclusions in
the paper thus overlook that an increase in competitiveness of the Portuguese economy will
require a gradual change in the specialization pattern of the productive structure and
increases in productivity of the goods and services tradable sector. These ideas should be the
main focus of any study concerning the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy, and are
actually reflected in several sections of the staff’s report. Finally, the paper also presents
several estimates of real exchange rate overvaluation of the Portuguese economy based on
last year’s Selected Issues Paper. In the context of a monetary union, the concept of a real
exchange rate can be an indicator of competitiveness issues and could help highlight the
possible need and scope of policies other than exchange rate policies to improve
competitiveness. Additionally, the report should recognize more fully the methodological
caveats of all these measures and the large uncertainty surrounding them. In particular, this
uncertainty is enhanced in the Portuguese case, given the current context of sectoral
structural change, of financial and monetary integration within the euro area, and of
enhanced global economic integration. Actually, an analogous criticism can be pointed out to
the “Scenario with key variables at their historical averages” presented on Table 7 “External
debt sustainability framework” (pg. 32). In fact, the 10-year historical averages presented in
the exercise include a period prior to the beginning of the euro area, when the
macroeconomic regime was rather different. The results from these exercises must therefore
be interpreted with due caution.
5. Social Security Reform
Among the several reforms that have been implemented in the recent past, the social security
reform deserves being highlighted, given its strong implications in terms of the sustainability
of public finances and of the expectations of the private sector. The four most representative

9
measures of the 2006 social security reform are: (i) earlier transition to the pension formula,
which considers the whole contributive career and increases the accrual rate for lower wages;
(ii) a new rule for updating pensions as a function of consumer inflation, the real growth of
GDP, and the pension amount; (iii) a bigger financial penalty for early retirement, i.e.
retirement prior to the legal retirement age; and (iv) the introduction of a “sustainability
factor” that will relate the calculation of new pensions to the evolution of life expectancy at
age 65. According to estimates by Banco de Portugal, the reform makes a significant
contribution to improving the sustainability of Portuguese public finances and should allow
the reclassification of Portugal from a “high-risk” country” to a “medium-risk” country,
according to the methodology followed by the European Commission. However, it is
important to underline that for Portugal to move into this latter group, it will have to proceed
with the ambitious but necessary budgetary consolidation objectives set out in Portugal’s
Stability Program.
6. Financial System
Due to its importance in the intermediation of funds in the economy, the banking system is a
key element in the assessment of financial stability in Portugal. Developments in the banking
system in the past few years confirmed its capacity for adjustments to the low trend growth
of the Portuguese economy and strengthened its capacity to absorb adverse shocks in its
balance sheet and profit and loss account. According to the stress tests conducted in 2006
under the IMF’s FSAP, the Portuguese banking system has a high level of resilience,
meaning that the level of its own funds is adequate to absorb extreme, but plausible, shocks.
In the course of 2006 and the first half of 2007, the banking system’s profitability remained
high and, in general terms, solvency stood at comfortable levels. In turn, default indicators
remained at low levels, although the flow of non-performing loans increased in the household
sector.
In the Financial Stability Report 2006 published by Banco de Portugal in the beginning of
June 2007, several risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability on a global scale were
identified, namely the persistence of macroeconomic imbalances on a global scale, the
cooling of the real estate market in several countries, the increase in the degree of financial
leveraging of non-financial corporations, the sensitivity of financial markets to abrupt
increases in volatility, and, finally, the growing transfer of credit risk to several participants
in the financial system. During the most recent months, some of these risk factors
materialized, in the context of the financial markets turmoil observed since August.
Since the beginning of August a high level of volatility in the international financial markets
was observed, associated with negative developments in the US sub-prime mortgage and
leveraged loan markets, as well as in other related credit markets. These developments may
have an unfavorable impact on banking activity in the second half of the year, in particular
with respect to the asset portfolio valuation and to possible constraints on the financing of
banks in medium to long run debt markets. In fact, the strong indebtedness of Portuguese

10
banks in the international financial markets is a risk factor that is particularly relevant in the
current context of strong instability on a global scale. Even though the available evidence
suggests that the direct exposure of Portuguese banks to the US sub-prime mortgage segment
is rather limited, the reduction in the available market liquidity and the strong rise in spreads
in the private debt market, if prolonged, it may affect the activity of Portuguese banks. In
fact, despite the relatively comfortable liquidity position of Portuguese banks in shorter
horizons, the continuation of the current instability in international debt markets is likely to
be reflected in a slowdown of credit to the private sector and, conceivably, in a restructuring
of the term structure of granted loans, with a rise in the proportion of short-term loans.
7. Expected Impact of the Current Financial Turmoil on Economic Activity
Projections point to a gradual acceleration of GDP in 2007 and 2008 based, on the one hand,
on a significant recovery of total factor productivity growth and, on the other, on an
acceleration of corporate investment, in the context of robust growth of total exports of goods
and services. The recent turmoil in financial markets has tilted the balance of risks
concerning the projections of investment to the downside. Naturally, the impact of these
developments will depend, on the one hand, on how quickly normalcy returns to money and
credit markets and, on the other hand, on the degree of repricing of credit risk and on the
degree of tightening of credit availability. In particular, a prolonged period of heightened
uncertainty concerning the global demand outlook and of less supportive financial conditions
could materialize in a downward revision of the investment outlook for the Portuguese
economy. Furthermore, the current downside risks to global demand also translate
directly into downside risks for Portuguese exports of goods and services.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Portugal
On September 28, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Portugal.1
Background
A modest recovery is finally underway. Growth rose to 1.3 percent in 2006, led by strong
external demand, which is driving a notable rebound in export growth. In response, corporate
investment shows signs of strengthening, but overall domestic demand remains relatively weak.
While employment and participation rates have risen, unemployment has edged up to
7.9 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Inflation has remained consistently higher than the
euro area average despite a still-significant output gap and sluggish demand. The current
account deficit (including capital transfers) remained around 8½ percent of GDP last year.
Real GDP growth is projected to strengthen to about 1.8 percent in 2007 and 2008, though the
tensions in financial markets have increased the downside risks. Robust external demand is
forecast to lead to a positive contribution from the external sector, while domestic demand is
expected to remain subdued. Private consumption is forecast to remain constrained by weak
employment growth and high indebtedness. While some corporate balance sheet restructuring
has occurred, still-high enterprise debt levels and tighter credit conditions may restrain any

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

rebound in investment. With the envisaged fiscal consolidation, modest further structural
reforms are projected to prompt a gradual recovery in competitiveness and productivity.
The overall fiscal balance improved sharply from a deficit of 6.1 percent of GDP in 2005 to
3.9 percent of GDP in 2006, outperforming the original deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP. The
improvement was mostly driven by much-needed reduction in primary spending. Reflecting
stronger-than-expected fiscal outturns in 2006, the authorities have lowered their deficit targets
for 2007 and 2008. The restructuring of the central administration will play a central role in
achieving fiscal consolidation goals and improving productivity. Recent reforms to the social
security system have significantly improved the long-term sustainability. Important steps to
move to performance-based budgeting are underway.
Portugal’s financial system remains sound and well supervised and appears to have weathered
the recent tensions in financial markets relatively well, though risks remain. While intensified
competition has resulted in a slight deterioration in banks’ liquidity ratios, average loan-to-value
ratios are in line with other EU countries, and nonperforming loans remain low. High household
and corporate debt remains the main source of risk to the financial system, but the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercise last year found that the financial system could
withstand even severe macroeconomic disturbances. In accordance with the Bank of Portugal’s
plans, and also in line with the FSAP recommendations, the Bank of Portugal has further
strengthened its supervisory capacity with the adoption of a new risk rating system, a
Household Wealth Survey has been finished, and housing price statistics have been enhanced.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Portugal’s modest economic recovery in 2006 after several years
of sluggish growth. Directors commended the decisive action taken by the government to
correct fiscal imbalances, reform the social security system, and improve the business
environment.
Nevertheless, Directors recognized that the underlying economic situation remains challenging
and that external competitiveness remains weak. Much remains to be done to achieve higher
trend growth and income convergence with the European Union. Moreover, Directors noted that
downside risks to the near-term outlook have risen recently as a result of the disturbances in
international financial markets and the projected slowdown of growth in the United States. They
emphasized that overcoming Portugal’s imbalances will require that the authorities build on the
reform momentum to further consolidate the public finances, streamline the public sector, and
boost productivity and competitiveness.
Directors commended the authorities for a fiscal deficit reduction that went beyond their already
ambitious target for 2006, without recourse to one-off measures. They particularly welcomed the
expenditure-based nature of the consolidation and the buoyant revenue growth. This strong
performance owes much to the authorities’ commitment to strictly adhere to expenditure targets,
enhance local government finances, and improve tax administration.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to accelerate the pace of fiscal consolidation in
2007 and 2008, and to save any revenue overperformance and take contingency measures in
case of spending overruns. A number of Directors considered that somewhat more ambitious
deficit targets for 2007 and 2008 seem warranted given the continuing revenue boom, and
would enhance the credibility of achieving the government’s medium-term objective of reducing
the structural deficit to half a percent of GDP in 2010.
Directors welcomed progress in restructuring the central administration. They noted that the
process is entering a critical and challenging phase of moving significant numbers of civil
servants to the special mobility pool, and emphasized the importance of following through to
achieve the envisaged fiscal consolidation and to boost productivity.
Directors stressed that there is no room for a discretionary reduction in the tax burden in the
near term. But they saw scope for building on the recent improvement in the efficiency of tax
administration by further simplifying some tax laws and procedures. Directors also welcomed
the plan to move to performance-based budgeting and a medium-term budgeting framework,
which could substantially improve the efficiency of public spending, and recommended that the
timetable not be unduly demanding.
Directors stressed the need for a comprehensive structural reform strategy to significantly
enhance Portugal’s competitiveness and growth. They stressed that key components of this
strategy involve strengthening productivity, including by enhancing contestability in the
nontradable sector, and addressing the cost side of competitiveness through policies that foster
wage moderation.
Directors encouraged the authorities to address labor market rigidities more fully. They
welcomed the “New Opportunities” program to upgrade skills and the establishment of a
commission to consider labor market reform, noting that the latter should be quickly followed up
by concrete measures. In particular, most Directors stressed the need to ease employment
protection legislation, end the automatic extension of collective contracts, and make procedures
less cumbersome. Concern was expressed about the authorities’ recent decision to sharply
increase the minimum wage.
Directors noted that strengthening ongoing product and service market reform could help
support reform in general by boosting competitiveness and consumer welfare. They welcomed
the important progress in enhancing the business environment and increasing competition in
the energy sector, while noting that much more remains to be done. In particular, Directors
emphasized the need to enhance competition in network industries and some service sectors,
and to strengthen the judicial system.
Directors welcomed the finding that the financial system is sound and well supervised, and that
bank liquidity remains adequate despite recent financial market disturbances. They noted,
however, that some risks have risen in light of these disturbances, and advised continued

4
vigilance by the supervisory authorities given the large foreign borrowing by banks and the high
indebtedness of the corporate and household sectors. Directors welcomed the progress made
with implementing last year’s FSAP recommendations.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
