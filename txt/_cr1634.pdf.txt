IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Nicaragua
On January 28, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation 1 with Nicaragua.
Economic developments in 2015 have been broadly positive. Growth, after reaching
4.7 percent in 2014, is expected to moderate owing to the effects of a drought and the decline
in commodity prices; real GDP grew by 3.9 percent in the first half of the year. Inflation
declined to 3 percent in October, mainly reflecting declines in food and transportation costs.
Core inflation remained stable at around 6½ percent.
The consolidated public sector deficit widened to 2 percent in 2014 (1.3 percent of GDP in
2013), largely due to a decline in grants originating from the oil collaboration with
Venezuela. Nevertheless, the public debt ratio declined to about 41 percent of GDP in 2014
from 43 percent in 2013. The fiscal position through August 2015 improved relative to the
same period in 2014. This is largely explained by a better performance at the central
government level that has compensated for the deterioration in the fiscal balance of stateowned enterprises.
The current account deficit improved to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2014, largely due to a smaller
oil bill. However, the current account deficit deteriorated in the first half of 2015 as the
country faced a less favorable external environment. In particular, export performance
weakened as a result of the softening of commodities prices and the expiration of the
preferential trade agreement with the United States in late 2014.
The financial sector appears to remain robust despite still high credit growth. As of August
2015, capital adequacy ratios (13.3 percent) were above the 10 percent regulatory level, and

the non-performing loan ratios, including restructured loans, remained below 3 percent.
Private sector credit growth has slowed but remains high (20 percent), in particular for
consumer and commercial credit, and continues to exceed the growth rate of deposits.
Poverty has fallen sharply and there has been progress in gender equality, but education
attainment remains a drag on growth. The 2014 household survey reveals that 29.6 percent of
the population lives in poverty (42.5 percent in 2009), and 8.3 percent in extreme poverty
(14.6 percent in 2009). Per capita consumption increased by 33 percent, helped by a fall in
the average household size and a rise in per capita remittances. Nicaragua has made inroads
in improving gender equality. However, despite some improvement in primary schoo l
completion rates (from 74 percent in 2005 to 80.4 percent in 2010), surveys of private firms
suggest that labor skills remain a bottleneck to growth.
The medium-term outlook remains broadly favorable. Growth is expected to moderately
accelerate in 2016, owing to the projected recovery in foreign demand and an increase in
election-related spending, which would result in a more expansionary fiscal policy. In the
medium term, staff estimates that growth will converge to its potential of 4 percent. The
current account deficit is expected to widen to 8½ percent of GDP as terms of trade are
projected to deteriorate. To address large infrastructure and social needs, the government
plans to step up spending by over 3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term. As a
result, the public debt ratio is projected to stabilize around 41 percent of GDP by 2020.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the Nicaraguan authorities’ sound policies, which have enhanced
macroeconomic stability and led to strong economic growth and poverty reduction. They
noted, however, that risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, particularly due to
external factors. Against this backdrop, Directors emphasized that, while the policy mix is
broadly appropriate to maintain stability over the near term, the country needs to fortify its
policy framework to sustain strong growth over the medium term.
Directors noted that the fiscal stance will be moderately expansionary in 2016, but that it
remains consistent with the authorities’ plans to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2020.
They considered, however, that building additional fiscal buffers, following the forthcoming
elections, will be essential to insure against potential risks and to put public finances on a
more solid footing. This consolidation could be attained by reducing tax exonerations and
exemptions and improving the targeting of fiscal subsidies, which in turn would strengthen
the efficiency and equity of public finances. From a longer-term perspective, Directors

stressed the importance of improving the financial viability of the social security institute and
loss-making state-owned enterprises.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued interest in strengthening the fiscal accounts.
They emphasized the importance of increasing the institutional coverage of the public sector,
improving the quality of fiscal and public debt statistics, and publishing the public
institutions’ financial statements to enhance transparency.
Directors agreed that rapid credit expansion amid high dollarization warrants close
monitoring, especially in light of possible currency mismatches, persistent U.S. dollar
strength, and the likely increase in U.S. interest rates. In this regard, they noted that macroprudential policies could help mitigate some of these risks. Directors also called for
additional efforts to strengthen banking supervision and enhance regional financial regulatory
cooperation. They encouraged full implementation of the 2009 Safeguards Assessment’s
recommendations and further strengthening the framework for anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism.
Directors agreed that improvements in competitiveness would reduce the economy’s
vulnerability to external shocks, support its diversification, and spur its structural
transformation. In this context, they recommended further improving infrastructure,
enhancing trade networks, investing in human capital, and reducing barriers to entry. Such
reforms would also serve to reduce the size of the informal economy, unemployment, and
poverty.
Directors called for continued improvements in the timeliness, quality, and reliability of
statistics, which will help enhance economic decision-making and transparency. They also
recommended following a consistent communication strategy when methodological changes
are introduced.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 11, 2015
Year

KEY ISSUES
Context. Commitment to macroeconomic stability has characterized government
policies. Over the last three years, real GDP growth has averaged 4.8 percent, one of the
highest in the region, while inflation has remained anchored by the exchange rate
regime. The external current account deficit has declined, reflecting a smaller oil bill due
to both lower oil prices and increased reliance on renewable energy sources.
Outlook and Risks. A moderate deceleration in real growth is projected in 2015
followed by a small pickup in 2016, owing to the projected recovery in foreign demand
and an increase in election-related spending. Poverty has fallen sharply but
unemployment has edged up due in part to a decline in manufacturing activity. The
fiscal stance has become modestly more expansionary and, as a result, public debt
ratios are expected to stabilize in contrast with the reduction envisaged in previous
consultations. Risks are, however, tilted to the downside. A deterioration in the financial
terms or levels of the Venezuela oil cooperation could increase pressures to absorb
quasi-fiscal spending into the budget. Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies and a persistent decline in prices of major export products would
also negatively impact Nicaragua.
Policy Recommendations. The current policy mix is broadly adequate to maintain
macroeconomic stability in the near term, but Nicaragua needs to fortify its policy
framework. In particular, reducing tax exonerations and exemptions and improving the
targeting of fiscal subsidies would strengthen the efficiency and equity of public
finances and contribute to rebuilding fiscal buffers. Greater emphasis needs to be
placed on improving public sector accounting and fiscal transparency. With regard to
the financial sector, the supranational structure and cross-border activities of financial
conglomerates warrant a strengthening of regional cooperation in prudential
supervision. The timeliness, quality, and reliability of statistics need to be improved,
which will help to enhance economic decision-making and transparency. Additional
efforts are needed to improve the investment environment, promote competitiveness,
and strengthen the rule of law.

General elections are scheduled for November 2016. President Ortega’s approval ratings
remain high and with his party’s majority in the National Assembly (61 out of 91 deputies), he has
been able to advance a political agenda that includes a constitutional reform in early 2014 that
increased presidential powers and eliminated term limits on presidency. His high approval ratings
reflect, among others, a sound macroeconomic policy stance and the elimination of widespread
electricity blackouts.
3.
There are changes in the administration of the oil collaboration scheme with
Venezuela.1 First, at the request of the government of Venezuela, all assets and liabilities associated
with the oil cooperation scheme are in the process of being transferred from a private financial
cooperative (CARUNA) to a limited liability Nicaraguan company ALBANISA, co-owned by the
Nicaraguan state petroleum distribution company (49 percent) and the national petroleum company
of Venezuela (PDVSA, 51 percent). The government’s current policy is not to extend public
guarantees on any of the associated liabilities. Second, the number of barrels per day that can be
imported under the oil collaboration was increased in 2013 from 27,000 to 30,000, and will represent
external financing of about 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015 (5.2 percent in 2014).2

Progress in the implementation of Fund recommendations has been mixed. During the

revenue base by implementing the 2012 tax reform, rationalizing public expenditures while
reinforcing the social safety net, and reforming the pension system to ensure its financial viability. In
line with this advice, the authorities enacted a tax reform in 2013 aimed at strengthening revenue
administration and introduced a parametric reform of social security aimed at extending the
solvency of the regime until the end of next decade. However, in late 2014, a new tax reform was
passed that repeals the reductions in tax exonerations and exemptions and corporate income tax
rates that were planned for 2015–17. At the same time, social security spending has increased more
than anticipated, raising doubts about how long the scheme can remain solvent. Progress in the
areas of domestic bond market development, central bank recapitalization, and statistics (in part due
to capacity weaknesses) has been limited.

BACKGROUND
5.
Economic activity accelerated to 4.7 percent in 2014 from 4.5 percent in 2013 owing to
robust external demand that more than compensated for the negative contribution of private
investment (Table 1 and Figure 1). On the supply side, growth has been broad based with the
largest contributions coming from commerce and agriculture. Strong growth has been facilitated by
a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector. Despite a small and positive output gap, inflation
pressures remained subdued owing to developments in commodity prices. Notwithsta nding strong
economic activity, the unemployment rate increased to 6.8 percent in 2014 from 5.7 percent in 2013,
due in part to a decline in employment in the free trade zones (FTZ).
6.
Public finances remained broadly sound, but the fiscal position weakened in 2014. The
central government deficit widened to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 from 0.4 percent in 2013 (Table 2
and Figure 2). This was largely due to a decline in grants funded by the oil collaboration scheme
with Venezuela that had been used to fund a wage bonus.3 The deficit of the consolidated public
sector widened from 1.3 percent in 2013 to 2 percent in 2014, owing to the deterioration of the
operating balance of the social security institute (INSS) and the central bank (Table 3). Nevertheless,
the public debt ratio declined to about 41 percent of GDP in 2014 from 43 percent in 2013.
7.
The external position improved in 2014. The current account deficit for 2014 is estimated
at 7.1 percent of GDP, 4 percent of GDP lower than in 2013 (Table 7, Figure 3). The reduction is
explained by an increase in exports and a smaller oil bill. The current account deficit was financed by
FDI and other investment, particularly from Venezuela. As a result, gross international reserves
reached US$2.1 billion at end-2014, with coverage reaching 4.1 months of non-maquila imports.4

The current account balance is close to its
norm and the real effective exchange rate (REER)
is broadly in line with fundamentals (Appendix I—
External Assessment). The improvement in the
current account balance in 2014 closed the gap with
the estimated current account norm (-6.9 percent of
GDP). Consequently, there is no significant evidence
of misalignment of the REER (1.2 percent
overvaluation as of end-2014).

Poverty has fallen sharply and there has been progress in gender equality, but
education attainment remains a drag on growth (Table 11). The 2014 household survey reveals
that 29.6 percent of the population live in poverty (42.5 percent in 2009), and 8.3 percent in extreme
poverty (14.6 percent in 2009).5 Per capita consumption increased by 33 percent, helped by a fall in
the average household size and a rise in per capita remittances. Nicaragua has made inroads in
improving gender equality. For instance, the proportion of seats held by women in the National
Assembly has doubled in the last five years. However, despite some improvement in primary school
completion rates (from 74 percent in 2005 to 80.4 percent in 2010), surveys of private firms suggest
that labor skills remain a significant bottleneck to growth.

food and transportation costs. Core inflation remains stable at around 6½ percent (yoy).



The fiscal position through August 2015 improved relative to the same period in 2014.
This is explained largely by a better performance at the central government level, with
revenue growing faster than expenditure, aided in part by the decision to transfer some
electricity-related savings onto the budget.6 In 2015, the stronger performance of the central
government has compensated for the deterioration in the fiscal balance of SOEs arising from
higher capital spending in the water and sewage (ENACAL) and the electricity generation
(ENEL) companies. In October, the government enacted a revised budget that aimed at
spending additional tax revenues and loan resources.



The current account deficit deteriorated in the first half of 2015 as the country faced a
less favorable external environment. The current account deficit widened to 3.7 percent of
GDP in 2015H1 from 3.1 percent in 2014H1. This reflects the lackluster performance of
exports as a result of the softening of commodities prices and the expiration of the
preferential trade agreement with the United States in late 2014.7

6

CARUNA provided loans during 2011–13 to allow distributors to keep tariffs for residential consumers at their 2005
levels, with repayment occurring when electricity costs fell below a reference level. This began to occur in 2014, due
to falling oil prices. Under a law passed in 2015, however, only 30 percent of these savings are now directed towards
repayment of CARUNA, while 47 percent will be passed on to the consumer and 23 percent brought onto the budget
to finance poverty-reducing expenditure.

Tariff Preference Level (TPL) under the CAFTA-DR free trade agreement allowed apparel made of certain cotton and
synthetic fiber to enter the U.S. duty free if assembled in Nicaragua’s free trade zones, regardless of the origin of the

The financial sector appears to remain robust despite still high credit growth (Text
Table and Table 8). As of August 2015, capital adequacy ratios (13.3 percent) were above the
10 percent regulatory level, and the NPL ratios, including restructured and reprogrammed
loans, remained below 3 percent. Private sector credit growth has slowed but remains high
(20 percent), in particular for consumer and commercial credit, and continues to exceed the
growth rate of deposits.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Real GDP growth is projected at 4 percent in 2015, with private consumption partially
offsetting the negative contribution of external demand. The fiscal position of the consolidated
public sector is projected to deteriorate to 2.7 percent of GDP, owing in part to increases in capital
spending, while the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 42.6 percent of GDP. The current
account deficit is expected to widen to 8 percent of GDP. Headline inflation is projected at
3.5 percent reflecting an increase in public and private spending toward the end of the year .
13.
The medium-term outlook remains broadly favorable. Staff expects a moderate
acceleration in growth in 2016, owing to the projected recovery in foreign demand and an increase
in election-related spending, which would result in a more expansionary fiscal policy. In the medium
term, staff estimates potential growth at 4 percent. The current account deficit is expected to widen
to 8½ percent of GDP as terms of trade are projected to deteriorate. To address large infrastructure
and social needs, the government plans to step up spending by over 3 percentage points of GDP
over the medium term. As a result, the public debt ratio is projected to stabilize at around
41 percent of GDP by 2020.

14.
Risks are, however, tilted to the downside. A potential deterioration in the financial
conditions or levels of the Venezuela oil cooperation could increase pressures to absorb some
quasi-fiscal spending into the budget. Also, the expansion of credit to the private sector, in the
context of high dollarization, persistent dollar strength, and potential hikes in U.S. interest rates,
could impose strain on dollar borrowers that do not generate dollar revenues. Structurally weak
growth in key advanced and emerging economies and a persistent decline in prices of major export
products would also have negative impacts on Nicaragua.
15.
A potential upside risk is the planned construction of the Gran Canal through
Nicaragua. In 2013, a private Chinese investor was granted a 100-year license for building and
operating a trans-oceanic canal with an estimated construction cost of US$50 billion (more than
4 times Nicaragua’s GDP). While such a large project could change Nicaragua's economic outlook,
the limited information available on the financing, construction timetable, and its likely enclave
features make the assessment of its overall impact difficult. An Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA) finalized in June 2015 by a consulting firm hired by the investor has
recommended additional studies, some of which are expected to be carried out during 2016.8
Moreover, in the context of a conference organized by Nicaragua’s National Academy of Science, a
panel of international specialists concluded after reviewing the ESIA report that the information
made available is insufficient to evaluate fully the net benefits of the canal and that several aspects
of the project design would need to be revised before construction starts .9

High. Fifty percent of the oil-import bill returns

potential impact has diminished significantly
with lower oil prices, the probability has
increased given the deterioration of the

pressures to absorb some projects into the

Sustain fiscal discipline to keep the public debt ratio
falling, and build buffers to face external and fiscal
vulnerabilities.

Low. The direct impact on non-FDI private
capital flows would be modest given Nicaragua’s

Bank credit to the private secto r needs to be monitored
closely.

High. Volatility in energy prices brings
uncertainty about the fiscal cost of electricity
subsidies, which are estimated at about
1¼ percent of GDP.

There is scope for phasing out those subsidies which
do not benefit the poorest households and introduce
mechanisms that target the poor.

High

High. Protracted period of low growth in
advanced and emerging economies would
reduce growth in Nicaragua, particularly if
growth in the U.S. is negatively affected. Lowerthan-expected U.S. growth would lower export

Measures to improve the investment environment,
promote competition, and strengthen the rule of law
will be key to promoting robust and sustainable
economic growth.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
The current policy mix is broadly adequate to maintain macroeconomic stability, but Nicaragua needs
to fortify its policy framework in a number of areas to address risks and promote sustained and more
equitable growth while enhancing the transparency of its fiscal operations. In particular, the authorities
need to build fiscal buffers to keep public debt stable should some of the identified risks materialize
and, given the large debt service obligations faced by the private sector, the policy mix should remain
guided by the need to reduce risks to external stability.

A. Building Fiscal Buffers and Improving Transparency
16.
Building additional fiscal buffers will help insure against downside risks and put public
finances on a more solid footing. The continued uncertainty around the Venezuela oil
collaboration poses important downside risks to public finances. In addition, the financial position of
the INSS has not improved as much as envisaged in the 2014 reform, while the deficits of the stateowned enterprises have weakened the consolidated public sector balance. The 2016 fiscal stance is
moderately expansionary, but broadly consistent with the stabilization of the debt ratio by 2020.
Nicaragua is still assessed as being at moderate risk of external debt distress, with a heightened risk
of overall debt distress.10 In this context, Fund staff recommends building additional buffers through
a fiscal effort of 1 percent of GDP in 2017, following the elections, which is projected to reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 38 percent of GDP by 2020. Alternatively, this effort would allow the authorities
to confront downside risks if these were to materialize, such as increased pressures to absorb some
of the oil-collaboration-funded projects into the budget, while maintaining the debt ratio stable in
the medium term.

17.
Such fiscal consolidation could be achieved by re-introducing key elements of
the 2012 tax reform that were rolled-back in 2014 and by developing a plan to eliminate
electricity subsidies over the medium term.


Tax exonerations and exemptions (Appendix II—A Framework for Future Tax Reform).
Reducing or eliminating tax exonerations and exemptions, particularly in the VAT, would
increase revenue while improving tax efficiency and equity and allow space for reducing the
headline corporate tax rate.11



Electricity subsidies. The current system is complex, costly (about 1¼ percent of GDP), and
tends to disproportionately benefit non-vulnerable groups. While a complete elimination is
politically difficult in the near term, there is ample room to reduce its costs and ensure that
the benefits reach a larger share of poor households. As a first step, the authorities could
focus on the elimination of subsidies that generate the biggest distortions and the largest
fiscal costs (e.g., consumption-based subsidies that are excessively generous and that in
effect represent the highest cost of the existing subsidy system).12 Over time, consideration
should be given to building institutions that can target better the poor (e.g., conditional cash
transfer programs or other means testing mechanisms); once these are in place, the
remaining distortions of the existing system of electricity subsidies should be eliminated.

18.
The finances of the INSS have not improved as expected following the parametric
reform introduced in 2014. The reform included a phased-in increase in employer contributions
and linking pension increases to increases in the average wage, and was calibrated to extend the
sustainability of INSS to 2031. While revenue has improved, this has been outweighed by increased
expenditure due to the introduction of the “reduced pension” in 2013 and a legislated increase in
these pensions in 2015,13 as well as higher than budgeted expenditures on health services, capital
goods, and administration. At the same time, the investment returns of the reserve fund have been
low. On current trends, the INSS is projected to start running persistent deficits by 2017, and the
reserve fund is expected to be depleted by 2024. Staff recommends reining in expenditure on health
and other goods and services to extend the life of the INSS reserve fund. Over the medium term, the
authorities need to consider additional parametric reforms to strengthen the system’s finances.
19.
The SOEs are expected to remain major contributors to the consolidated public sector
deficit over the medium term. The three largest SOEs (ENEL, ENATREL (electricity transmission)
11

Tax expenditures in Nicaragua were estimated at 7.6 percent of GDP (90 percent of which correspond to VAT
exonerations and exemptions) in 2010, one of the highest in the Central American region.
12

Consumption-based electricity subsidies, which amount to about ⅔ of the total cost of electricity subsidies , benefit
households in three consumption categories (0–50 kWh, 50–100 kWh, and 100–150 kWh) for a total cost of 0.8
percent of GDP; however, only 10 percent of these costs benefit the lowest consumption category where there is a
higher concentration of poor households.
13

A reduced pension was granted to INSS members who have between 250 -749 weeks of contributions. Previously,
INSS me mbers had to have at least 750 weeks of contributions to be eligible for an old age pension. The current cost
of the reduced pension is estimated at between ⅓ and ½ percent of GDP annually.

and ENACAL) have large public investment programs and are expected to run deficits through 2020.
In particular, ENACAL requires transfers from the central government to cover its current
expenditure. Efforts are therefore needed to address ENACAL’s structural problems such as large
technical and non-technical losses, and consideration should be given to increasing water tariffs as
these are heavily subsidized.
20.
Improving public sector accounting and monitoring and fiscal transparency should
remain as policy priorities. The authorities need to increase institutional coverage of public sector
information in line with international standards; increase the quality of information through a
consistent application of cash and accrual principles; and improve transparency by publishing the
central government’s and other institutions’ financial statements. Over the longer term, reducing
budget rigidities (i.e. earmarking) is key to enhancing the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness
of public spending and strengthening the budget design process.

B. Strengthening Monetary Framework and Financial Stability
21.
The interbank market remains shallow and the interbank rates volatile. Banks hold
reserves at the central bank that are, on average, far in excess of regulatory requirements as they
internalize their liquidity risks. These large positions could lead to rapid credit growth that eventually
result in higher inflation or international reserves losses. The central bank is moving forward to
strengthen the monetary framework within the confines of the crawling peg. In line with Fund’s TA
advice, the central bank has introduced 7 and 14 day notes to improve short-term liquidity
management. The authorities are encouraged to proceed with the recapitalization of the central
bank as a condition for strengthening its financial autonomy. In this context, the external audit
report for the 2014 audited financial statements of the BCN is qualified due to the uncertainty and
valuation surrounding government debt, and its impact on the BCN’s financial position. Further, the
implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a key recommendation of the
Fund’s 2009 safeguards assessment, remains outstanding (see 2015 Informational Annex).

23.
The rapid credit growth of recent years combined with high dollarization warrant
closer watch. Nicaragua has a highly dollarized

the persistent dollar strength and the likely increase in

However, the limited exposure by local banks to foreign financing helps contain risks . A review of
the macro-prudential tools could strengthen the mitigation of the risks associated with high
dollarization.

In February 2015, Nicaragua exited the Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering (FATF) gray list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. This was the result of
Nicaragua establishment of a legal and regulatory AML/CFT framework, but the country has been
encouraged to continue addressing other deficiencies. Nicaragua’s AML/CFT regime is scheduled to
undergo another full assessment in 2017, under the revised FATF standards, which emphasize the
identificatio n, assessment and understanding of ML/TF risks . Efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT
regime should continue in order to combat organized crime and corruption (e.g., enhancing
measures for politically exposed persons and the suspicious transaction reporting system).

C. Improving External Competitiveness and Buffers
25.
There is room for improvement in Nicaragua's competitiveness (Box 1). The country’s
economy remains exposed to increases in oil prices and declines in non-oil commodity prices, which
could endanger external sustainability. Nicaragua's export quality is below the CAPDR average in all
categories except crude materials. In particular, while the quality of Nicaragua's food and live animal
exports is generally superior, the country is underperforming in the quality of manufactured goods
and behind those countries that export similar products (e.g., Vietnam). Consistent with the cross 14

country analysis conducted by IMF staff, improving infrastructure and trade networks, investing in
human capital (from educational outcomes in primary education to training programs that address
labor skills bottlenecks), and reducing barriers to entry are needed to promote diversification and
structural transformation in low-income countries. Progress in structural reforms in these areas
could help to reduce informality and strengthen Nicaragua’s poverty-reducing efforts.
26.
The rapid increase in private external debt
needs to be closely monitored. Gross financing needs
are projected to increase to 15.9 percent of GDP
in 2015, owing to the large debt service obligations of
the private sector that are reflected in a large negative
net investment position (-116 percent of GDP in 2014).
In particular, the private sector was a net creditor
in 2006 with a positive net financial position of
3 percent of GDP and has now become a net debtor of
about 32 percent of GDP, of which two-thirds
correspond to Venezuela oil-financing collaboration
being administered by ALBANISA and CARUNA.

D. Upgrading Statistical Framework
27.
Nicaragua’s data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are
numerous data shortcomings in national accounts, fiscal, debt, and external sector statistics
(Box 2 and Informational Annex). Fund staff acknowledges the central bank’s efforts to enhance
intra- and inter-government coordination in the elaboration of statistics. However, the authorities
need to continue building on the Fund’s technical assistance to improve the timeliness, quality, and
reliability of statistics. In particular, authorities are encouraged to make progress on two fronts:


Data quality: Introduce regulations to enforce data collection; facilitate exchange of
information across units and institutio ns; establish policies to facilitate personnel rotation
within institutions that will serve to strengthen cross-fertilization in the use of data

E. Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the economic outlook and risks. They
concurred with staff that growth has decelerated due to external factors, but noted that activity is
picking up (they project growth at 4.3 percent or better in 2015). They agreed that growth thus far
has been broad-based, and they remain confident in their ability to achieve higher growth rates by

incentivizing private investment and attracting FDI. They believe their policy framework would serve
to support growth rates averaging 5 percent over the medium term.
29.
They recognize that the fiscal stance is looser than in the last consultation. They agreed
that fiscal buffers would help insure against downside risks, but believe increases in spending are
needed to confront election costs in 2016–17 and support economic activity at a time when the
global economy remains weak. They stressed, however, their continued commitment to sustain
macroeconomic stability and that their fiscal stance is consistent with a stable level of public debt.
Over the medium term, they noted they are willing to consider revenue and expenditure measures if
these are deemed necessary. They shared staff’s view that these could include reductions in tax
exonerations and exemptions and mechanisms to target better electricity subsidies. They also
shared staff’s concern with the financial sustainability of the INSS, but noted that staff’s baseline
does not reflect measures they might implement in the future. In this regard, they stressed that their
intent is to assess the need for policy measures once the full effects of the parametric pension
reform program are known.
30.
In the authorities’ view, Nicaragua still faces external vulnerabilities. They welcomed
staff’s analysis on external competitiveness and noted that there is no significant misalignment on
the real exchange rate and that international reserves exceed the standard benchmarks. They
stressed that progress has been made in reducing external risks through lowering oil import
dependency and stated that the risks of changes in the levels or terms of the oil collaboration with
Venezuela are limited. In this regard, they noted that the oil collaboration has been beneficial,
including through boosting social spending and supporting growth. Moreover, if some of this
spending would need to be absorbed into the budget, they reiterated their commitment to do so,
including through expenditure rationalization, while keeping public debt ratios stable. They also
stressed that it is their policy not to extend public guarantees on this debt.
31.
The authorities recognized that bottlenecks to growth remain. They noted their
commitment to improve infrastructure as reflected in their capital spending plans for the remainder
of the decade and stressed that they are introducing policies to strengthen education. They
highlighted the importance of the dialogue they have developed with the private sector to identify
common ground on growth-supportive policies. They also agreed that informality hampers the
prospects of small and medium-sized firms by weakening the incentives to expand and invest. To
reduce informality, they argued that they have simplified the tax filing systems and are working on
improving transport logistics and business climate reforms.
32.
They agreed that more can be done to strengthen the statistical framework. They
recognized that data collection mechanisms need to be strengthened by improving procedures to
monitor the quality of statistics. The authorities agreed that additional efforts are needed to improve
the quality of public sector operations, including by broadening their coverage and strengthening
the monitoring of the public sector’s liability and asset position. They stressed their commitment to
continue improving their communication strategies and recognized that more information needs to
be provided to the public when methodological changes are introduced. They also welcomed the
Fund’s willingness to support Nicaragua’s continuing efforts to improve its statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The policy mix is broadly adequate to maintain macroeconomic stability in the near
term, but Nicaragua needs to fortify its policy framework. Staff agrees that the moderately
expansionary 2016 fiscal stance is consistent with the stabilization of the debt ratio by 2020. After
the elections in November 2016, authorities are urged to build additional fiscal buffers to insure
against risks. This could be attained by reducing tax exonerations and exemptions and improving
the targeting of fiscal subsidies. This in turn would strengthen the efficiency and equity of public
finances. Looking further ahead, staff strongly recommends identifying economic measures to
strengthen the fina ncial viability of the social security institute.
34.
The authorities’ interest in strengthening fiscal monitoring is welcome. In this context,
staff is ready to support their efforts to increase institutional coverage of public sector information
in line with international standards; and increase the quality of information through a consistent
application of cash and accrual principles. Also, publishing the financial statements of the central
government and other public institutio ns would help to enhance transparency. Over the longer
term, reducing earmarking is key to lessening budget rigidity and strengthening the budget design
process.
35.
The authorities should continue to monitor the rapid growth in credit, strengthen
banking supervision, and promote financial stability. In particular, U.S. dollar lending to
corporations (and households) that do not generate dollar revenue (or income) must be monitored
given persistent dollar strength and the likely increase in U.S. interest rates. Additional efforts are
needed to enhance regional financial regulatory cooperation. Authorities are encouraged to follow
up with the recommendation of the Fund’s 2009 safeguards assessment.
36.
Improvements in competitiveness would reduce vulnerability to external shocks and
spur structural transformation. Nicaragua remains exposed to increases in oil prices and declines
in non-oil commodity prices, which could endanger external sustainability. Improving infrastructure,
enhancing trade networks, investing in human capital (from better educational outcomes in primary
education to training programs that address labor skills bottlenecks), and reducing barriers to entry
are needed to promote diversification and structural transformation. Progress on structural reforms
in these areas could also serve to reduce informality and strengthen Nicaragua’s poverty-reducing
efforts.
37.
The authorities need to continue improving the statistical framework. In particular,
greater efforts are needed in improving the timeliness, quality, and reliability of statistics. This will
help to enhance economic decision-making and transparency. In particular, staff recommends
(i) introducing regulations to enforce data collection; (ii) establishing procedures to monitor quality;
and (iii) following more consistently their communicatio n strategy when methodological changes
are introduced.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Nicaragua be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Nicaragua: Export Diversification and Quality Upgrading 1
Nicaragua is one of the least
diversified countries in the CAPDR
region. In the late 1970s, Nicaragua
was the third most diversified
economy in CAPDR. By 2005–10,
most of the region had diversified at
a faster pace, and Nicaragua ranked
th
6 in terms of export diversification
(Table 1).

in 1975–80 were concentrated in food
and live animals, broadly in line with other CAPDR countries (Figure 1). By 2005–10, most of CAPDR (as well
as Vietnam—a global competitor of Nicaragua) had diversified, including Nicaragua, into sectors such as
manufactured articles and machinery/transport. Meanwhile, food and live animals exports had declined, but
continued to represent a large share of Nicaragua’s exports.
There is room for improvement in
Nicaragua’s export quality,
particularly for its main export
categories. While at par with LMICs in
most categories, Nicaragua’s export
quality is considerably below the
CAPDR average in all categories except
crude materials (Figure 2A). With
respect to major exports, Nicaragua is
doing well in the quality of food and
live animal exports compared to the
rest of the world, but is
underperforming in the quality of
manufactured articles, and is edged
out by Vietnam in the export quality of
travel goods and handbags, clothing,
and footwear (Figure 2B).

Diversification and structural transformation are critical for long-run growth and macroeconomic
stability in LICs. An analysis conducted by IMF staff (2014) suggests that improvements in infrastructure
and trade networks, investing in human capital, encouraging financial depth, and reducing barriers to entry,
are effective in promoting diversification and structural transformation. Furthermore, while diversification
and quality upgrading are mainly focused on the manufacturing sector, about ¼ of Nicaragua’s population
is still employed in agriculture and for the economic benefits from diversification to include all segm ents of
society, agricultural development would need to take a central role, given the productivity and quality gains
that can be achieved.

Box 2. Nicaragua: Data Revisions to National Accounts and Balance of Payments Statistics 1
In March 2015, the Central Bank of Nic aragua (BCN) published revised national accounts (NA) and
balance of payments (BOP) data for 2010– 13. The new data release introduced methodological
refinements by updating trade and producer price indices, using a new employment matrix, and revising
agricultural production.
The data release also addressed discrepancies between NA and the BOP trade data. These had
emerged largely in the export and import data used in the maquila sector. To address these discrepancies,
the BCN harmonized the methodology to process trade data by applying the reporting system that enters
the preparation of NA also in the BOP statistics. Moreover, it updated the directory of maquila firms, which
2
in effect changed both the NA and the BOP statistics.
The impact of these revisions on total GDP was limited, but the changes in the directory of firms
imply that care must be exercised when comparing data before and after 2010. In particular, the
update of the maquila firms’ directory affects the calculation of the value added in the maquila sector.
Specifically, firms are classified into full package (FP; those that own the inputs) or cut, make, and trim (CMT;
those that offer the maquila service). For FP firms, the value of imports and exports is known. In contrast,
CMT firms rely on a second best netting method to estimate manufacturing services on inputs owned by
others. 3 This methodology needs to be improved further, however, and the authorities have committed to
develop more comprehensive surveys that would make further improvements possible.
An additional methodological improvement affects the estimation of the import of services and FDI.
This relates primarily to operations taking place in the energy sector which must be reviewed and mainly
affect the primary income. BCN is exploring the introduction of complementary surveys to identify the
import of services undertaken by FDI enterprises in Nicaragua. Revisions related to these changes impact
both foreign direct investment, import services, and primary income statistics; thus, these are mainly
categorical additions with limited impact on aggregate GDP.
As a result of the harmonization, trade data is now broadly consistent between BOP and NA statistics.
However, given the unchanged GDP, its composition is affected. For instance, on the demand side larger
imports are offset by higher investment, and on the supply side upward revisions mostly in construction,
transport, and communication, and financial intermediation are broadly offset by downward revisions in
manufacturing, electricity, gas and water supply, and housing, among others. While changes to the NA start
in 2010, the BOP is revised beginning in 2006. This resulted in smaller current account deficits and higher
errors and omissions, highlighting the need to investigate further the sources of the latter.

Maquila exports (goods and manufacturing services) represented about 50 percent of total exports of
goods and services in 2014.
3

If exports are higher than imports, then the company is declaring the value of the exported goods and
services, and the difference of exports and imports is equal to the value of the exported services. However, if
exports are lower than imports, then it is assumed that the company is declaring the value of the service,
which is then set equal to the value of the exports.

Appendix I. External Assessment1
The recent improvement in the trade balance contributed to a current account deficit close to its norm
while the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with fundamentals. Similarly, the stock
of gross international reserves is adequate. However, according to staff’s assessment: (i) the business
environment remains weak; (ii) gross financ ing needs are large; and (iii) the net international
investment position continues to deteriorate. Efforts to improve Nicaraguan competitiveness and
structural reforms aimed at upgrading export quality would help to address these vulnerabilities.
Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness
Exchange Rate Assessment 1/

Nicaragua’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is
broadly in line with its fundamentals. Estimates based
on the CGER methodology (macroeconomic balance
approach, external sustainability approach, and
equilibrium real exchange rate approach) and on the
external balance assessment suggest that the exchange
rate is, on average, overvalued by 1.2 percent. This low
average, however, masks substantial uncertainty across
methodologies, which present a range of estimates
between an overvaluation of 6.5 percent and an
undervaluation of 3.9 percent. Consistently, the external
current account deficit is close to the estimated norm.
The average norm for the external current account
deficit is, in fact, 6.9 percent, or 0.2 percent of GDP
higher than the actual deficit in 2014.

Other indicators point to a mixed picture:


Since mid-2011, the REER slightly appreciated and increased its appreciation pace starting in
October 2014. This reflects a real appreciation vis-à-vis two of Nicaragua’s main trading
partners, the U.S. and Mexico. However, Nicaragua’s export market share in the
U.S. remained relatively stable in terms of world exports and gained ground with respect to
other Central American economies and the Dominican Republic, mostly owing to the loss of
market share by Costa Rica.

indicators suggest that Nicaragua performs
particularly poorly in dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, and
getting credit. Nevertheless, Nicaragua remains one of
the safest countries in Latin America. Among Central
American peers, only Costa Rica and Panama enjoy a
better security risk environment.

Reserve Adequacy
The stock of gross international reserves exceeds standard metrics. At about 18 percent of GDP,
gross international reserves exceed the following international benchmarks: 3 months of imports
excluding maquila, 20 percent of broad money, and 100 percent of short-term debt. A model
accounting for Nicaragua’s characteristics, however, may produce a better estimate of optimal
reserve coverage than generic benchmarks. The framework proposed by Dabla -Norris et al (2011)
attempts to measure the benefit of reserves in avoiding crises and in reducing their severity as well
as the costs of reserve holdings.2 The results suggest an optimal level of reserves of about 4 months
of imports, which remains below the coverage of 4.7 months of imports at end -2014.

This model takes into account shocks that are likely to result in an economic crisis (defined as a drop in domestic
absorption). The shock variables (terms of trade, external demand, FDI to GDP, and aid to GDP) were set at the
bottom 10 percent of Nicaragua’s specific distribution over the 2009-14 period, and are intended to estimate
Nicaragua’s vulnerability to crisis events. Nicaragua’s fundamentals (CPIA, fiscal balance, and imports to GDP), are set
at 2014 levels to gauge the potential severity of a crisis event. The frequency of large natural disasters is set at 0.24,
relying on the occurrence of these events over the last 50 years.

Gross Financing Requirements and International Investment Position
Gross financing needs are large. While the oil
price fall contributed to reduce the current
account deficit, the external gross financing
requirements were 14.6 percent of GDP in 2014
and are projected to increase to 15.9 percent of
GDP in 2015, owing mostly to high large debt
service obligations of the private sector. In the
medium term, gross financing requirements are
projected to stabilize around 17 percent of GDP,
reflecting high current account deficits and an
increase in the amortizations on private sector
external debt.

The net international investment position (IIP) remains significantly negative. In 2014, the net
IIP (-116 percent of GDP) was the lowest among Nicaragua’s Central American peers (including
Dominican Republic). After slightly improving in 2014 owing to the large accumulation of reserves,
the net IIP is projected to worsen further to about -139 percent of GDP in the medium term. Large
current account deficits are backed by a fast accumulation of private sector liabilities, mostly
concentrated in foreign direct investment and other investment.

Appendix II. A Framework for Future Tax Reform1
Nicaragua has successfully undertaken a series of tax reforms that have had a positive impact on fiscal
revenues. However, administrative difficulties led the authorities to rescind some of the most recent
reforms. In charting the direction of future tax reform, the authorities need to tackle excessive tax
incentives and exemptions especially under the income tax and value added tax (VAT), which in turn
will improve the equity and efficiency of the tax system. The tax regime for small and medium
enterprises also needs to be reformed, to promote formality and growth.
Nicaragua has undertaken a series of reforms to modernize its tax code. The 2009 Law 712 (Ley
de Equidad Fiscal (LEF)) broadened the income tax base to include capital income and eliminated
exemptions in excise taxes. A further package of reforms came into effect in 2013 (2012 Law 822, Ley
de Concertación Tributaria (LCT)), which aimed to address structural deficiencies in the tax system.
Both of these reforms appear to have had a positive impact on tax revenues, with revenue increasing
more than two percent of GDP over 2010–12 following the introduction of the LEF, driven largely by
corporate income tax (CIT) and VAT gains. Following the 2013 reform, revenue has increased by an
estimated 1 percent of GDP over the 2013–15 period. However, key elements of the 2013 reform
were put on hold by a law in December 2014 on account of administrative implementation
difficulties. The reforms put on hold include the phase-out of business tax incentives and an
extension of the VAT base to import services, as well as the planned reduction of the CIT rate from
30 to 25 percent.

Relative to other Central American countries, Nicaragua raises a higher percentage of GDP in
tax revenue despite having one of the lowest per capita incomes. The strong performance
(Table 1), despite the large number of tax incentives and exemptions in its revenue code, appears

remarkable; however, given the importance of the informal economy, it could also be caused by an
underestimation of GDP. On personal income tax, Nicaragua’s top rate is high for the region, but it
still has high income level thresholds.
In terms of tax efficiency, Nicaragua’s corporate tax efficiency ratio is well above average for
the region despite the large number of tax incentives (Table 2). This could be due to a relatively
high share of corporate profits in GDP and/or to a high level of tax compliance by state -owned
enterprises. By contrast, the consumption or “C-efficiency”2 indicator for Nicaragua’s VAT is more
than 10 percentage points below the regional average. This suggests a narrower VAT base than
other countries as a result of VAT exemptions and exonerations.
This analysis suggests that there is scope for improving the equity and efficiency of the tax
system. In particular, the authorities need to address excessive tax incentives and exemptions under
many different taxes, but especially under the income tax and VAT. Broadening the PIT base by
reducing the minimum income threshold would help to develop revenues from tax, while
broadening the VAT base by reducing exemptions for goods used by wealthier households and
reinstating reverse-charging on import services, would improve progressivity and efficiency.

There is also a need to revisit the regime for small and medium enterprises to encourage
formality and growth. Thus, compliance should be kept simple and rates moderate, avoiding sharp
increases in effective tax rates as business income increases.
Finally, the authorities need to consider reinstating many of the elements of the 2013 reform
that were rescinded; in some cases, this will require modifying the original reform design. In
particular, in considering tax incentives, the authorities should link tax relief to investment
expenditure rather than to profits.

C-efficiency measures the efficiency of the VAT collection and is defined as the ratio of VAT revenue to aggregate
consumption divided by the standard VAT rate.

decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed
at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in
footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key
structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
In December 1995, the Monetary Board of the central bank approved the unification of the exchange rate
system effective January 1, 1996. With the unification of the exchange rate, all previous exchange
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple currency
practices were eliminated. The central bank buys/sells any amount of foreign currency from/to financial
institutions at the official exchange rate, and implements a crawling peg system. Since December 2004,
the monthly crawl has been set at an annual rate of 5 percent. As of November 30, 2015, the official
exchange rate was C$27.8128 per U.S. dollar. Nicaragua has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous consultation was completed by the Executive Board on December 4, 2013 (Country Report
No. 13/377).
Safeguards Assessment:
An updated safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN), required in conjunction with
the September 2008 augmentation of access under the PRGF arrangement, was completed in
January 2009. The assessment noted continued progress at the BCN in the areas of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation and reserve management operations. Timely publication of
the audited financial statements is in place in accordance with the Safeguards Policy. However, while
the 2014 financial statements were audited and published on the BCN’s website, the external audit
opinion is qualified due to the uncertainty and valuation surrounding government debt. Further,
implementation of IFRS remains outstanding. The Safeguards Policy requires strong financial reporting
principles and practices that ensure transparency of the bank's financial statements.

sustainable economic growth, critical infrastructure, and job creation, and helping Nicara gua take
advantage of regional integration opportunities.
The Bank will start working on the first Systemic Country Diagnosis (SCD), expected to be ready by
December 2016. The SCD will identifies the most important challenges and opportunities at the country
level, and will inform the partnership with Nicaragua as established in the new approach to country
engagement—the Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The CPF will take the place of the CAS and
guides the Bank Group's support to a member country.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 15, 2015)
1.
In November 2012, the IADB approved its country strategy for Nicaragua for the
period 2012–2017. It focused on the following sectors: (i) energy; (ii) transportation; (iii) health; and
(iv) comprehensive early childhood development (ECD). The strategy pays particular attention to
rural zones where poverty is concentrated, and where there is potential to develop value chains.
2.
As of October 15th 2015, the portfolio of approved sovereign-guaranteed loans under
execution amounted to US$789.8 million, with an undisbursed balance of US$451.1 million.
3.
The existing sovereign guaranteed portfolio focuses on: (i) health, 29 percent;
(ii) transport, 28 percent; (iii) energy, 14 percent; and (iv) trade, 12 percent. In the private sector, the
IADB has two non-sovereign projects under execution amounting to US$42 million that contribute
to the competitiveness of the country.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 30, 2015)

Assessme nt o f Da ta Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but there are numerous data
shortcomings in national accounts, fiscal, debt, and external sector statistics.
National Accounts. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) changed the base year of the annual
national accounts (NA) to 2006 and is finishing the implementation of the complete set of
integrated economic accounts by institutional sector in accordance with the recommendations of
the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) and the classifications and most relevant
recommendations of the 2008 SNA for which source data are available. In March 2015, while
releasing the 2014 NA data, the BCN revised earlier years, specifically the 2010–13 data. These
revisions introduced a number of refinements (i.e., update of trade and producer price indexes,
use of a new employment matrix, revised agricultural production, and, in particular, addressed
discrepancies between NA and the balance of payments (BOP) trade data in the tax-free zones).
However, these revisions led to some discontinuities in the supply and demand series of the GDP
with earlier years, complicating the analysis of historical economic activity by sector and
subcomponent.
Price and Labor Statistics. The consumer price index (CPI) uses expenditure weights derived
from a 2006/07 household expenditure survey. The CPI covers Managua and eight other cities
and is published monthly. Expenditures (weights) and prices in rural areas are excluded. The
producer price index (PPI) (July 2006=100) covers a sample of small and medium-size
establishments, as well as goods for processing establishments in the maquila sector. There is
also scope for expanding the coverage of the PPI to the service sector.
Labor market statistics are scarce and unemployment figures are available irregularly during the
year.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS). Institutional coverage is not in line with international
standards, given that extra-budgetary institutions such as public universities and all 153
municipalities, with the exception of Managua, are not included in the accounts of the
consolidated public sector. Recording of transactions is mostly on a cash basis but there are
inconsistencies; for example, checks are recorded at the moment of issuance rather than when
the check is cashed. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) compiles fiscal statistics
with a monthly frequency, and remits these to the BCN for publication on their website and for
inclusion into the BCN’s quarterly reports on public finances. Typically these statistics are
published with about a 5-week lag. Separately the MHCP produces its own quarterly report on
the execution of the budget. Annual financial statements of public enterprises are produced, but
are not audited externally or published. Data on the budgetary central government and social
security institute are reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, although with a delay.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

NICARAGUA

The monitoring of fiscal performance from the financing side needs significant improvement, and
is complicated by some idiosyncrasies in classifying expenditure items in the budgetary central
government. There is also a need to strengthen collaboration between the MHCP and the BCN to
derive more accurate and timely estimates of external and domestic financing of the nonfinancial
public sector, including with respect to the monitoring of domestic public debt in the
nonfinancial public sector other than that of the budgetary central government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics. Monetary statistics are, in general, consistent with the
Monetary and Financ ial Statistics Manual (MFSM, 2000). Nicaragua publishes detailed daily,
weekly, and monthly monetary data on its website, and remits monthly monetary data to STA on
a timely basis. In 2015, with technical assistance from the Fund, the coverage of monetary
statistics was enhanced to include insurance companies and microfinance institutions. However,
sectorization is incomplete and data on the microfinance sector does not include the Caja Rural
Nacional (Caruna)—the private cooperative handling until now the Venezuela oil collaboration.
Moreover there are major differences between the data remitted to STA and the monetary data
published on the BCN’s website, which are not consistent with the MFSM 2000. The authorities
are planning to report Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) to STA on a regular basis (quarterly).
However, the coverage of the FSI needs to be extended to include all deposit taking institutions.
External Sector Statistics. Since September 2013, the BOP statistics follow the concepts and
definitions set out in the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6), within the
limits set by the availability of information sources. Resident institutional units are defined in
conformity with BPM6’s concepts of economic territory, residency, and center of economic
interest. However, coverage of the private sector is incomplete for the current and financial
accounts. The BCN is in the process of revising the transactions and positions of FDI and
reinvested earnings from private financial and non-financial companies with the information
available. However, these efforts are hampered by a low survey response ratio and the
submission of inconsistent data by enterprises engaged in FDI. The central bank also needs to
cross check enterprise-by-enterprise trade flows, FDI and external debt to assess any
discrepancies between merchandise trade and financial associated flows. These efforts will help
to address in part the large errors and omissions in the balance of payments which hinder the
assessment of the external sustainability.
Data Dissemination and Quality. Nicaragua has participated in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since February 2005. Data ROSC was published in December 2005.

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
UPDATE

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association

Risk of external debt distress:
Augmented by significant risks stemming
from domestic public and private external
debt

Moderate
Yes

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the full DSA that was conducted in
November 2013. Staff concludes that Nicaragua remains at moderate risk of debt
distress, based on an assessment of public external debt, and that it faces a heightened
overall risk of debt distress. On external debt, a customized contingent liability scenario
and two of the standardized stress scenarios breach the threshold. Further, while lower
oil prices have reduced the risk of debt distress, the magnitude of private external debt
elevates Nicaragua’s risk, as do questions about the continuation of external financing
from Venezuela. On public debt, while macroeconomic management has been prudent,
the fiscal position has become more expansionary and is expected to remain so over the
medium term, worsening public debt dynamics. In addition, the outlook for the social
security institute (INSS) has deteriorated and unless additional reforms are undertaken,
this could pose a significant fiscal burden in the long term. 1

1

Based on its 2015 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score of 3.73, Nicaragua remains
classified as a medium performer.

NICARAGUA

A. Underlying Assumptions
1.
The key assumptions of this DSA are broadly in line with those of the 2013 DSA and in
particular, growth is assumed to stabilize at its medium-term potential level of 4 percent. As
in the past, this analysis considers the consolidated public sector, which includes debt of the
budgetary central government, decentralized entities, social security institute (INSS), the municipality
of Managua, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the central bank. 1 This DSA also assumes (both in
the historical and projection periods) that relief has been obtained on HIPC terms for all eligible
debt where negotiations are still pending. 2
However, differences are most notable in the following areas:


Official statistics: Revisions to the national accounts and balance of payments data have
resulted in lower projections for the current account deficit. On average, the current account
deficit was revised down by 1.2 percent of GDP over the period 2010–14. Moreover, staff
estimates of historical public debt stocks have been revised to consolidate intra -government
debt and to include an estimation of the domestic debt stock of SOEs.



Current account: Compared to the 2013 DSA, exports of goods and services are lower, owing to
a substantial downward revision of many traditional export prices as well as lower estimated
import volumes of Nicaragua’s trading partners. Also, since the 2013 DSA oil price projections
have been revised downwards, including over the medium to long term, and this has lowered
import projections. The net effect has been a reduction in projected current account deficits.
Future loan disbursements linked to the oil collaboration with Venezuela, which are recorded as
private external debt, are also affected by the revised oil price assumptions.



External financing: Assumptions about the availability and terms of new external financing
from multilateral sources have changed, with a higher average real interest rate projected in the
long term. In July 2015, Nicaragua was reclassified from an IDA-only to an IDA-gap country,
which means that it is no longer subject to IDA’s non-concessional borrowing policy and that
the IDA terms are less concessional. Also, access to resources from Nicaragua’s largest creditor,
the Inter-American Development Ba nk, changed in 2015 from a 50–50 ratio of concessional
resources to non-concessional resources to a 40–60 ratio. The trend of a declining grant element
in new loans is expected to continue over the medium to long term. On the positive side, these
developments should also increase the availability of external financing from official sources.
External financing from concessional multilateral and bilateral sources is therefore assumed

1

In spite of the comprehensive institutional coverage of the public sector, Nicaragua’s debt statistics do not cover all
domestic debt of state-owned enterprises. In particular, the public debt statistics used in this report differ slightly
from the authorities’ published numbers due to adjustments by staff to consolidate int ra-government debt and to
estimate the domestic debt stock of SOEs.
2

At end-June 2015, outstanding debt subject to relief stood at US$1 billion, most of this on the books of the central
bank. Since the 2013 DSA, additional debt relief has been obtained amounting to US$500 million. This DSA shows
debt net of pending relief, including for the historical period.

constant at 3.5 percent of GDP from 2020 through 2035, with residual financing needs being
met through domestic bond issuance. 3


Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy has become more expansionary since the 2013 DSA, and the fiscal
anchor has shifted from the goal of a gradual declining debt-to-GDP ratio to maintaining an
overall deficit of the consolidated public sector at about 2.5 percent of GDP. Over the medium
term, fiscal policy is assumed to remain in line with current trends. This results in a higher
primary deficit than what was assumed in the 2013 DSA (1.4 percent of GDP versus 0.3 percent
in the 2015–20). In addition, the reserve fund of the INSS is projected to be depleted by 2024,
following which it is assumed that the central government will transfer resources to INSS to help
finance its deficit. This does not affect the CPS primary balance, as the transfers are between two
government entities and thus consolidated out. Nevertheless, as the INSS fund is exhausted,
these deficits will impact debt dynamics because the central government is required to issue
bonds to finance transfers to INSS. The scenario assumes that the bonds are issued domestically,
a more expensive source of financing. Securing the INSS’s financial sustainability is therefore a
key long-term challenge that needs to be tackled.

B. External Debt Sustainability
2.
External debt as a ratio of GDP is expected to decline marginally over the projection
period from 79 percent at end-2014 to 76 percent in 2035. Private external debt-to-GDP is likely
to continue to increase until the mid-2020s, but at a more gradual pace than has been observed
ever since the Venezuela oil collaboration began in 2007; current projections for oil prices in effect
imply that Venezuela inflows will be lower than anticipated at the time of the 2013 DSA.
3.
Under the baseline scenario, external public debt increases slightly from 33 percent at
end-2014 to 36 percent in 2035. 4 The present value of external public debt is projected to remain

3

authorities in upgrading their debt management practices and developing the domestic debt market.

NICARAGUA

well below all the relevant thresholds in the baseline scenario. The historical scenario, which notably
assumes a higher current account deficit than in the baseline (8.2 percent, based on the average
non-interest current account balance over the past 10 years) results in a breach in the outer years. A
change in the terms of external financing is also projected to result in a significant (and permanent)
increase in the PPG external debt stock. Given that financing from official sources is typically at fixed
interest rates, the risk of such a shock is low; nevertheless, this highlights the need for caution in
considering external borrowing at market rates.5
4.
The rapid increase in private external debt, which includes the debt arising as a result
of the oil collaboration with Venezuela, requires continuous monitoring. While the government
has stressed that it is their policy not to extend public guarantees on this debt, this DSA (as was the
case in the 2013 DSA) includes a scenario whereby the government of Nicaragua absorbs about
60 percent of private external debt6 onto its balance sheet. This results in a breach of the PV of PPG
external debt-to-GDP+remittances threshold of 36 percent, with the ratio increasing to 38 percent
in 2016 (compared to 23 percent in the baseline).7 While the nominal amount of the additional debt
is large (about US$3.2 billion or 25½ percent of GDP), the concessional terms in the debt with
Venezuela imply less of an impact in present value terms.

C. Public Debt
5.
Public debt-to-GDP has decreased slightly since the 2013 DSA, standing at
40.8 percent at end-2014. Under the baseline scenario, public debt-to-GDP is projected to stabilize
at around 41 percent by 2020, or 30 percent in present value terms, comfortably below the
56 percent benchmark. However, in the absence of further policy actions to enhance INSS’s
sustainability, the INSS fund is projected to be fully depleted by 2024.8 If this materializes, the central
government will need to transfer resources to INSS to help cover its obligations, as reflected in the
baseline of this DSA update report (from 32 percent of GDP in PV terms in 2015 to 48 percent
in 2035). Of all the standardized stress scenarios, a shock to real GDP growth in 2016–17—where
growth falls to 1.3 percent in these two years—will result in the least favorable outcome for all
indicators. The unchanged primary balance scenario is also worth noting as it highlights the need for
4

As in the 2013 DSA, remittances are inclu ded in denominator of the baseline and standardized stress scenarios.
Over the past 3 years, remittances have averaged 10 percent of GDP and 22 percent of exports of goods and
services, which is on the borderline of the Fund’s thresholds for taking them in to account in the DSA. However,
excluding remittances has little impact on this assessment.
5

The DSA considers, among other shocks, a scenario where key variables are set at 10-year historical averages, and a
two percentage point increase in the interest rate over the period of the analysis

This private debt includes the obligations of ALBANISA and CARUNA; the former is a limited liability entity jointly
owned by PDVSA and PETRONIC and the latter is a private financial cooperative. The authorities have informed staff
that the credit risk on the oil collaboration debt is borne exclusively by PDVSA.
7

It is assumed that the same concessional terms would apply to this new debt (specifically, 2 percent interest rate,
2 years grace period, 25 year maturity an d a 5 percent discount rate), and that the government will not absorb any
additional debt generated from future oil imports.

fiscal consolidation—if the fiscal policy stance of 2015 is maintained over the long term, public debt
will come close to breaching the benchmark in 2035.
6.
The contingent liability scenario described above in the external DSA is also applied to
the public DSA. The PV of public debt to GDP would increase to 50 percent of GDP
in 2016 compared to 32 percent in the baseline scenario. This scenario would eventually exceed the
benchmark over the longer term. Not considered in this DSA update is the risk that a deterioration
in the financial conditions or levels of the Venezuela oil cooperation could lead to certain projects
currently financed by CARUNA being absorbed by the budget. Staff estimates that these projects
could amount to about 1 percent of GDP. This risk is one of the factors motivating staff’s
recommendation to build fiscal buffers beginning in 2017 and also contributes to the staff’s
assessment that Nicaragua is at a heightened risk of overall debt distress.

D. Conclusion
7.
The staff considers that Nicaragua remains at a moderate risk of external debt distress.
The concessional nature of most of the government’s external borrowing and their track record of
relatively prudent macroeconomic management results in a manageable baseline scenario. However,
the customized scenario and two of the standardized stress scenarios breach the external PPG debt
threshold in present value terms. Staff also considers Nicaragua to be at a heightened risk of overall
debt distress, given the magnitude of private external debt, the quasi-fiscal nature of some of this
debt, and the likelihood that some projects currently financed by Venezuela resources might end up
being absorbed by the budget. Moreover, public debt dynamics have worsened since the previous
DSA due to a more expansionary fiscal policy, and debt could become unsustainable in the event
that no additional action is taken to improve the INSS finances.
8.
The authorities broadly concurred with the findings of the analysis, but noted some
important differences with their own debt sustainability analysis. First, the authorities’ growth
assumptions are more positive, with an average of 4.7 percent over the 2015–19 period and
5 percent thereafter, consistent with their expectation that stepped-up investment in infrastructure
will shift the growth path. Second, the authorities’ fiscal balance projections are more optimistic than
staff’s, owing in particular to higher revenue assumptions. Finally, while the authorities acknowledge
that INSS will need reform to ensure its long-term sustainability, they do not include any central
government transfers to INSS in their analysis, assuming that additional reforms will be undertaken
before any such transfers are required. The authorities reiterated that the debt owed by ALBANISA
and CARUNA to PDVSA is private and staff welcomes that the government’s policy is neither to
absorb nor to extend public guarantees on this debt. They also highlighted the significant progress
made on achieving debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors during 2014 and 2015.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Otaviano Canuto, Executive Director for Nicaragua
and Manuel Coronel, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 28, 2016
On behalf of our Nicaraguan authorities, we thank staff for the useful discussions held in Managua during
the 2015 Article IV mission. The balanced report summarizes appropriately the policy priorities being
pursued by the Nicaraguan government and provides valuable policy advice.
The big picture remains positive. Since the last article IV Board discussion held in December 2013,
Nicaragua has continued to experience a stable macroeconomic environment and robust GDP growth.
Inflation–anchored by the crawling-peg exchange rate system–remains moderate while international
reserves have grown steadily. The fiscal stance has been moderately expansionary, albeit in line with a
stable and sustainable public debt profile. In July 2015, Moody´s upgraded Nicaragua´s credit rating to
B2 from B3 and more recently, in December, Fitch assigned a first-time rating of B+ to the country. On
the back of lower oil prices and increased reliance on renewable energy sources, the external accounts
have strengthened. Over the medium term, the fiscal and external accounts will continue to benefit from
the authorities’ sound and prudent macroeconomic policies. In view of the government’s priority to
promote inclusive growth, poverty levels have receded substantially while social stability as well as
citizen security have further improved.
The fastest growing economy in Central America. GDP growth in 2014, at 4.7 percent, was the highest
among the five economies in Central America. In light of the headwinds stemming from lower
commodity prices and slower-than-expected global growth, both staff and the authorities revised down
the initial 2015 growth projections. Staff now projects last year’s growth at 4 percent while the authorities
have a slightly more positive forecast (4.3 percent). Post-crisis growth (2010-2015) is expected to average
about 4.7 percent, ranking Nicaragua as the highest growing ec onomy in the Central America region since
the great recession. While in 2014 most of the contribution to growth came from the services sector
(retail, hotels and restaurants) as well as robust external demand, in 2015 growth has been propelled by a
surge in private consumption due to lower oil prices and increased activity in the construction sector.
Agriculture–an otherwise significant contributor to growth–has underperformed due to droughts and other
weather-related effects.
Nicaragua’s social fabric has improved in tandem with economic growth. Macroeconomic stability,
fiscal discipline and social inclusion are at the core of Nicaragua’s platform for growth. In the fight
against poverty, prospects have never looked better in recent memory. Continued improvement in the
supply of basic services to the most vulnerable (including health, clean water, and electricity) have
rendered good dividends in the fight against poverty. The results of the national household surveys
compiled by the Nicaraguan Institute of Development Information (INIDE) and World Bank specialists
are encouraging: general and extreme poverty have respectively dropped from 48.3 to 29.6 percent and
17.2 to 8.3 percent in the last 10 years. Notwithstanding the still large informal sector of the economy,
formal job creation was the fastest growing in Latin America in 2014 according to the UN Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). Gender equality constitutes yet another
strong point of Nicaraguan society. The World Economic Forum’s gender-gap index in the last two years
(2014 and 2015) ranks Nicaragua among the top performer in Latin America and the Caribbean and
among the best performers worldwide.
Revisiting staff’s potential growth estimations. As noted in the report, staff estimates Nicaragua’s
potential growth at 4 percent, despite a sustained track-record of GDP growth close to 5 percent per year

2
since 2010. We are of course aware that measuring potential GDP is intrinsically difficult, more so at
times of rapid transformation as being experienced by the Nicaraguan economy. Staff’s assessment
diverges from the latest empirical evidence captured by experts and the authorities. In the authorities’
view, staff’s estimates are somewhat outdated. The last potential growth estimation disclosed by the Fund
that the authorities are aware of was made in 2013 with data series that extended no further than 2011.1 It
is precisely at that time that the Nicaraguan economy started to grow faster and in a sustainable manner
without any signs of overheating. To the authorities, this low potential growth estimation introduces an
undesirable downward bias in the Fund’s medium-term scenario for the country.
Fiscal discipline remains at the core of the government’s economic policy. Nicaragua remains
committed to maintaining fiscal discipline while preserving the social safety net and much needed capital
investment. The authorities use a consolidated public sector deficit of 2½ percent of GDP as their fiscal
anchor. Though the fiscal deficit has averaged 2.4 percent of GDP since 2010 reflecting the government’s
solid fiscal credentials, the administration has increased capital expenditure in 2015 and the deficit is
expected to reach 2.7 percent of GDP. The authorities’ public investment medium-term plan–projected to
peak in 2016–along with the uptick in spending to finance this year’s elections will increase public
expenditure by about ½ percent of GDP in 2016, relative to last year. Under current policies, public debt
is now expected to stabilize at around 40 percent of GDP by 2020, as opposed to a previously projected
38 percent of GDP.
Not the right time to discuss specific consolidation plans. The authorities take note of staff’s
recommendation to undergo a fiscal consolidation plan amounting to 1 percent of GDP in 2017, the postelectoral year. They agree that such a plan is attainable and that it would not only return the debt
trajectory back to the 38 percent of GDP previously estimated by 2020, but it will also create additional
fiscal buffers and reduce fiscal vulnerabilities. However, the authorities believe that the timing for an
open discussion on the matter, let along specific planning, should be left to after the elections. It is this
chair’s opinion that the new elected (or re-elected) government–as well as new Congress–should harness
the initial post-electoral momentum to continue the prudent fiscal stance that the current administration
has consistently pursued. This should include ramping up the financial position of deficit-contributing
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the Social Security Institute.
Monetary policy has been efficient in anchoring inflation, preserving exchange rate stability and
keeping reserve coverage adequate. Inflation has receded significantly in 2015. Due mostly to declining
oil prices and lower domestic price pressures, year-end inflation is estimated at about 3 percent, the
lowest in the decade. The preservation of the crawling peg and the maintenance of an adequate level of
international reserves have been priorities for monetary policy. The authorities consider that the peg
arrangement has successfully anchored inflation while helping to maintain external competiveness over
the years. As confirmed in staff’s external assessment, the real effective exchange rate (REER) remains
broadly aligned with fundamentals. The predictability and stability of the pre-announced crawling peg
arrangement has enhanced business and investor confidence. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN), with
IMF support, continues to make progress in strengthening the monetary policy framework in a manner
consistent with the exchange rate regime, including, for instance, the introduction of short-term notes to
improve liquidity management and reduce interest rate volatility in the interbank market. Gross

international reserves closed 2015 at a historic record high of nearly US$ 2.5 billion (5 months of
imports).
The external sector has continued to strengthen, becoming more diversified and stable. The value of
exports have increased more than twofold and gross FDI inflows have more than quadrupled since 2007.
Exports have significantly diversified in terms of products and export destinations in the last decade.
Gross FDI inflows have also diversified in terms of both country of origin and economic sector. Exports
have grown faster than imports since 2007 but oil dependence still keeps the current account balance
(CAB) negative. As a result of decreasing oil prices and higher exports, the CAB deficit narrowed down
to about 7 percent of GDP in 2014 from 11 percent the previous year. For 2015, however, the CAB deficit
is expected to slightly deteriorate due to a temporary decline in exports and an uptick in non-oil imports
caused by higher consumption by the end of the year. Underpinned by continually strong FDI inflows, the
CAB is projected to remain negative at around 8 percent of GDP over the medium term.
The banking system remains stable, well capitalized, and liquid. Since the last Article IV consultation,
bank’s capital adequacy has remained stable at around 13 percent and credit has grown moderately. At
less than 1 percent of total credit, NPLs are the lowest in Central America while bank’s liquidity and
profitability indicators are the highest in the region. Bank regulation continued to be strengthened,
including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing prevention.
Notwithstanding the positive outlook, the authorities recognize that the Nicaraguan economy
remains subject to significant downside external risks, as highlighted by staff. Among these risks is a
slower recovery of the U.S. economy and the possible effects on financial volatility of the normalization
of the U.S. monetary policy. In the previous two Article IV discussions, Executive Directors have agreed
with staff that a sudden reduction of Venezuelan flows to Nicaragua constituted a potential source of
external risk. Since these inflows are linked to oil prices, such reduction has already materialized and
what could have led to an abrupt external adjustment has turned into a gradual transition. This year’s
external flows expected from Venezuela–reflecting oil price behavior–are less than half with respect to
2013, when the last Article IV discussion was concluded.
Concluding remarks. Nicaragua remains committed to continue implementing coherent macroeconomic
and development policies to remove structural hurdles, achieve higher productivity levels and improve
competitiveness. In this regard, the authorities continue to count on the Fund’s support through policy
advice and capacity building, tailored to Nicaragua’s specific needs and circumstances.
