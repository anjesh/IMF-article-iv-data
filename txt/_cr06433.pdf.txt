EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Armenia’s economy continues to perform strongly. Prudent fiscal and monetary
policies and ongoing structural reforms have contributed to double-digit growth in a
low inflation environment; a continued reduction in poverty; and a notable
improvement in tax performance. The PRGF-supported program is on track.

Focus of discussions
•

Policy discussions centered around the appropriate monetary, exchange rate, and
fiscal policy mix to maintain macroeconomic stability in the context of sizable
foreign exchange inflows and on measures needed over the medium term to sustain
and broaden economic growth.

Main policy recommendations
•

The cautious monetary policy stance in 2006 is appropriate. Inflationary pressures
have increased owing to large foreign exchange inflows and supply shocks. The
credibility of the monetary stance is particularly important in light of the authorities’
move toward a full-fledged inflation targeting regime over the medium term. In this
context, a floating exchange rate regime is essential.

•

The 2006 and 2007 budgets are compatible with PRSP objectives. Fiscal policy
rightly emphasizes improving revenue performance and increasing expenditures for
infrastructure and social services. It is important to increase tax buoyancy without
resorting to ad hoc discretionary measures to increase collection.

•

The focus of fiscal reforms in 2006–07 should continue to be on reducing tax
privileges and loopholes as well as strengthening tax and customs administrations.

•

Financial sector reforms should concentrate on improving corporate governance,
strengthening regulation and supervision, and deepening financial intermediation,
including the development of the nonbank financial sector. The implementation of
these reforms, together with the envisaged entry of foreign banks, should increase
competition and contribute to the narrowing of interest rate spreads.

Risks
•

The program’s prospects remain very good, but there are risks. The appreciation of
the dram has raised serious concerns in the country, and inflationary pressures have
increased. Effective policy coordination between the monetary and fiscal authorities
is needed to maintain macroeconomic stability. A prudent fiscal policy is required in
the run-up to next year’s parliamentary elections.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The performance of the Armenian economy continues to be very strong. Prudent
fiscal and monetary policies, large external inflows, and ongoing structural reforms have
contributed to double-digit growth in a low-inflation environment, a sustainable external
current account and debt position, and a notable reduction in poverty1 and unemployment
(Table 1). Real per capita income in U.S. dollars has tripled since 2000. Nevertheless, the
significant dram appreciation resulting from foreign exchange inflows is weakening external
competitiveness and harming segments of the population that rely on dollar-denominated
remittances and hold savings in dollars.
2.
The PRGF-supported program remains on track. All end-June 2006 quantitative
and structural performance criteria were met and all end-June structural benchmarks were
observed (MEFP, ¶5–6; Tables 2 and 3).2
3.
The political scene is dominated by the parliamentary and presidential elections that
will take place in May 2007 and early 2008, respectively. A new round of talks between
Armenia and Azerbaijan was recently initiated in an attempt to kick-start the deadlocked
peace process over Nagorno-Karabakh.
4.
The discussions on the near-term challenges focused on the appropriate monetary,
exchange rate, and fiscal policy mix to maintain macroeconomic stability in the context of
sizable foreign exchange inflows that are likely to continue (see the accompanying Selected
Issues (SI) Chapter 1). Policy discussions on medium-term issues centered around
measures needed to sustain economic growth and further reduce poverty, in particular:
•

The importance of accelerating fiscal reforms to increase budget revenues in a
transparent and nondiscretionary manner to finance infrastructure projects and expand
essential poverty-reducing services;

•

The need for continued financial sector reforms to improve the quality and depth of
financial intermediation, strengthen monetary policy implementation, and increase
market efficiency.

5.
The authorities have concurred with the thrust of the Fund’s economic assessment
and broadly followed its policy advice (Country Report No. 04/410) to maintain
macroeconomic stability and accelerate structural reforms. On fiscal reforms, important

The most recent household survey from 2004 showed a further decline in poverty, with the headline poverty
rate falling from 56 percent in 1999 to an estimated 34.6 percent in 2004, and extreme poverty declining slightly
in 2004, following the sharp drop in 2003 (Country Report No. 06/196). An update of the authorities’ Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) is expected in early 2007.

The indicative target on the contributions to the State Fund for Social Insurance was missed by a small margin.

progress has been made in strengthening tax and customs administrations, but revenue
mobilization could be further enhanced. On financial sector reforms, prudential regulations
and oversight have been strengthened and reforms undertaken to improve corporate
governance of banks, but financial intermediation is still low.
II. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
A. Recent Growth and Outlook
6.
Real GDP grew by over 12.5 percent in
the first nine months of 2006, driven by strong
growth in the nontradables sector, particularly
the construction sector, which grew by almost
40 percent in real terms and accounted for about
half of total GDP growth. Nevertheless,
agricultural and industrial output declined in real
terms. Gross fixed capital formation increased
by 31 percent year-on-year in the first half of
2006, aided by improved execution of public
investment projects.

7.
Sustaining high economic growth is a key policy challenge. The strengthening of
market institutions and an open trade regime have generated large increases in total factor
productivity (TFP) in recent years (Box 1). The challenge will be to foster significant
increases in high quality, productivity-enhancing investments and to improve the business
climate to promote further growth.3
8.
At the same time, growth has been uneven, driven primarily by buoyant domestic
demand, and underpinned by strong foreign exchange inflows (remittances, foreign aid, and
FDI) and an expansion of the nontradables sector, in particular construction. In contrast, the
contribution of industry has been modest. While exports expanded rapidly until 2005, their
structure is not sufficiently diversified, relying to a large extent on two industries (precious
stones and base metals), which makes export earnings vulnerable to world commodity price
developments and industry-specific shocks.

3

Several recent surveys have shown improvements in the business environment, although important challenges
remain, particularly in the areas of tax administration and access to credit. Armenia ranked 34 out of
175 economies—the highest ranking among CIS countries—in the “ease of doing business” index according to
the World Bank’s Doing Business in 2007. It scored 3.11 out of a highest possible score of 4.33 in the EBRD’s
2005 transition index, also the highest score among CIS countries.

7
Box 1. Sources of Growth
Armenia’s growth performance over the past five years has been impressive. Following the sharp
contraction of the early 90’s, economic growth averaged around 5 percent for the period 1996–2000, before
accelerating to 12 percent during 2001–05. Growth has been driven primarily by buoyant domestic demand,
fueled by strong foreign exchange inflows, and the expansion of nontradable sectors, notably construction and
services. In contrast, the contribution of industry has been modest and, notwithstanding their recent expansion,
exports remain undiversified.

Armenia: Contribution to Growth, 1994-2004

Economic liberalization, privatization, and a
liberal trade regime have generated large total
factor productivity (TFP) gains through a
reallocation of resources since the start of
transition. Growth accounting based on factor shares
suggests that a large share of the recent high growth
originates from TFP gains. However, TFP growth
may reflect an increase in factor utilization following

the collapse of output, and will likely decline in the
coming years. The contribution of capital

lower. Further productivity growth will, therefore,
depend on advancing market reforms and improving the business climate. The potential of labor in ensuring
rapid growth is limited as labor supply is reduced by emigration and the negative incentives on labor supply of
large-scale remittances. As a result, the potential for capital accumulation in boosting growth will become more
important over the medium term.

9.
Demand pressures, stemming from the rapid growth of incomes, appear to have been
limited so far, but there are risks. While strong domestic demand has contributed to an
increase in imports in recent years, the current account deficit narrowed from 6 to 4 percent
of GDP between 2002 and 2005 reflecting trade gains, and the external position remains
sustainable. Moreover, most of the increase in imports has been in intermediate and capital
goods, in part related to foreign-financed public investment programs. Going forward, there
may be risks of overheating (as evidenced by the pick-up in inflation in the second quarter
of 2006 and increasing real estate prices) which will require cautious management of
domestic demand.

8
10.
The authorities believe that medium-term economic prospects continue to be
strong, although they are concerned about the potential negative effects of rapid real
appreciation on growth and external competitiveness. They aim to temper these negative
effects by means of an appropriate economic policy mix focused on macroeconomic stability,
together with structural reforms and investments in infrastructure supportive of private sector
development. These will serve to foster productivity gains and create an environment
conducive to continued robust growth. The authorities place particular emphasis on
promoting the development of rural areas, including rural infrastructure under the aegis of the
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).
11.
Reflecting the solid growth performance in the year to date, the program projects
real GDP to grow by 11 percent in 2006 and 9 percent in 2007 on the back of continued
buoyant activity in the construction and services sectors and an expected recovery in industry
(MEFP, ¶13). Notwithstanding somewhat lower public investment rates, productivity gains
resulting from increased share of private investment and improvements in infrastructure are
expected to generate sustainable growth rates of 6 percent over the medium term.

Progress has been made in strengthening the institutional prerequisites in support of
an inflation targeting (IT) monetary framework. The CBA has significantly improved its
new operational framework (introduced in March 2006), with the support of Fund technical
assistance.5 It has begun issuing quarterly inflation reports and publishing the minutes of its
monthly board meetings on monetary policy. The CBA is also currently in the process of
developing a quarterly inflation projection model, to be used in the first half of 2007.
15.
There is a trade-off between resisting nominal appreciation pressures and
maintaining low inflation. With a large share of the population relying on U.S. dollardenominated remittances and savings, and rising concerns about external competitiveness,

5

The framework relies on the repurchase (repo) rate as the operating target and an interest rate corridor using
standing facilities. During the transition to full-fledged IT, the central bank will maintain elements of its
previous money targeting strategy (NFA floor and NDA ceiling) with a view to a smooth transition to the new
regime.

10
Box 2. Recent Exchange Rate Developments
Since end-2003, the dram has been under appreciation pressure owing to sizable foreign exchange inflows (in
the form of rising remittances, foreign aid, and FDI) and a global weakening of the U.S. dollar. By endSeptember 2006, the dram had appreciated by 33 percent in nominal terms against the U.S. dollar (about
22 percent in real effective terms through July 2006). Periodically, the CBA has engaged in foreign exchange
interventions, but until recently interventions were moderate and two-sided, with no evidence that the CBA has
targeted a specific level or path for the exchange rate.

According to its monetary policy statement, the CBA is committed to conducting “an independently floating
exchange rate regime which is consistent with the principles of liberalized capital account and implementation
of an independent monetary policy.” It recognizes the importance of allowing the exchange rate to be marketdetermined and to limit intervention in the foreign exchange market to “moderating the rate of change and
preventing undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than establishing a level for it.”

pressures to limit the nominal appreciation of the dram are increasing (Box 3). Until recently,
the CBA had largely resisted these demands; however, since June 2006 it has heavily
intervened in the foreign exchange market to limit the appreciation of the dram. Given the
limited potential to sterilize interventions and absorb liquidity through open market
operations, combined with inflationary pressures from both the demand side (strong income
growth) and the supply side (energy and agricultural prices), the original end-year inflation
target of 3 percent is almost certain to be exceeded.

11
Box 3. External Competitiveness—Is Appreciation the Major Concern?
The real appreciation of the dram in recent years appears to have had a limited impact on external
competitiveness so far. Armenia’s share in world exports, which had doubled between 2001 and 2003, is broadly
unchanged after two years of appreciation. Temporary setbacks in diamond exports were due to industry-specific
factors (e.g., supply disruptions) and were quickly offset by rising exports of base metals. The base metal sector
benefited from sizable foreign direct investment and rising world metal prices. The upward trend of other exports
remained intact in 2005 and the first half of 2006.

Log (PPP exchange rate / actual exchange rate)

There is no clear evidence yet that the dram is overvalued. One approach to determine the equilibrium real
exchange rate in Armenia is to estimate the “equilibrium
Armenia: Equilibrium and Actual Real Exchange Rate Path
distance” to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Based on a
0.0
simple loglinear regression for a sample of 180 countries,
-0.2
an equilibrium relationship was estimated between the real

indicate that the real exchange rate is close to equilibrium.
The estimates, which should be treated with caution given the large standard errors, suggest that the dram was
approximately in equilibrium during 1995–98. Between 1998 and 2003, however, the dram became undervalued
because the equilibrium exchange rate appreciated, while the actual real exchange rate remained constant. Since 2003,
the dram has been converging back toward its equilibrium rate.
Factors other than the exchange rate also pose serious threats to Armenia’s overall export performance and
limit the potential for export-led growth. Because of the undiversified structure of exports, the trade balance is
vulnerable to exogenous shocks affecting individual industries, such as supply disruptions in diamond processing or
price volatility in commodity markets. At the same time, the potential for diversification remains limited due to
structural factors (such as high transport costs) and weaknesses relating to technology, management, finance, and
marketing.

12
16.
There is evidence that the CBA’s new operating procedures have led to an increase
in interbank repo volumes, but further development of the money market will be crucial to
strengthen monetary policy transmission. The CBA has been increasingly successful in
maintaining short-term rates at or near the announced policy rate. Nevertheless, there still
appears to be a significant level of excess liquidity in the banking system.
17.
The CBA remains committed to maintaining price stability. However, given
increased inflationary pressures, the authorities were concerned that an overly tight policy
stance would be needed to reach the original end-2006 inflation target of 3 percent. In
particular, the CBA would have to increase aggressively interest rates and conduct largescale foreign exchange sales, which could trigger additional appreciation pressures,
jeopardize financial stability by raising the interest rates on government bonds, deposits and
loans, and eventually harm economic growth. Consequently, the CBA, while mindful of the
implications for monetary policy credibility, proposed to raise the end-year inflation target to
5 percent in 2006 and 4 percent in 2007 (with a band of ±1.5 percentage points). The CBA is
aware of the need to explain the reasons behind changes of the inflation target to the public.
18.
The authorities also underlined their commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime.
Noting the recent strong appreciation pressures, they pointed to the need for periodical
interventions in the foreign exchange market aimed at moderating the rate of change and
preventing undue volatility in the exchange rate, rather than targeting a particular level or
rate. They agreed that their de facto exchange rate regime could be characterized as a
managed float without a predetermined path.
19.
The authorities acknowledged that the substantial excess liquidity in the banking
system impedes monetary policy effectiveness and discourages the development of interbank money markets and secondary markets in government securities. However, they argued
that it would be difficult to reduce this excess liquidity over the short term, as the room for
the issuance of additional CBA securities or for foreign exchange sales for this purpose is
very limited under the current circumstances.
20.
The revised monetary program for the remainder of 2006 envisages reserve and
broad money growth of 25 percent and 27 percent respectively, and end-year inflation of
5 percent (with a band of ±1.5 percentage points) (MEFP, ¶17). The monetary program for
2007 will target end-year inflation of 4 percent with a band of ±1.5 percentage points on
account of inflationary pressures, notably large end-year fiscal expenditures and foreign
exchange inflows, and a rise in telecommunication tariffs in early 2007 (MEFP, ¶18).
Reserve money growth is programmed to slow to 20 percent in 2007, while broad money is
expected to grow by 22.5 percent. During the transition to full-fledged IT, the program will
retain the existing conditionality on monetary targets, in line with the authorities’ approach
(MEFP, ¶19).

13
C. Fiscal Policy
21.
Fiscal performance remained sound in the first half of 2006, with the overall fiscal
deficit on a commitment basis significantly smaller than programmed (AMD 12 billion
compared to AMD 32 billion under the program), largely on account of strong revenue
performance (Table 5). Tax

22.
In April, the authorities entered a new gas delivery contract with Gazprom covering
the period 2006–08, which involves a significant gas price increase. However, the deal was
combined with an implicit and temporary price discount financed by the sale of a power plant
to Gazprom. This discount is being passed on to consumers (see Country Report No. 06/196).
23.
The main challenge for fiscal policy is the need to align additional public spending
with PRSP priorities, and with a fiscal stance that continues to be consistent with low and
stable inflation in an environment of persistent foreign exchange inflows. This highlights the
importance of further raising revenues to finance priority expenditures while at the same time
alleviating the burden on monetary policy, particularly as donor assistance will likely decline
over time. At the same time, raising productivity, including by improving the efficiency of
public spending, will be important for mitigating real appreciation pressures.
24.
The authorities share the objectives of raising revenues and improving expenditure
efficiency. They envisage a reduction in tax exemptions, the development of a unified tax
code, and measures to further strengthen tax administration over the medium term. At the
same time, the authorities noted that extensive social and infrastructure investment needs
preclude a tightening of fiscal policy in the short term. Reflecting this, the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2007–09 targets moderately larger fiscal deficits than in
recent years.

6

The fiscal deficit on a commitment basis was equivalent to 0.4 percent of annual GDP, compared to
1.3 percent of annual GDP under the program (Table 5).The higher revenues and lower expenditures
contributed to a lowering of the deficit-to-GDP ratio by 0.8 percentage points, while the remainder is
attributable to an increased GDP growth projection for 2006.

25.
Accordingly, the authorities intend to spend part of the higher-than-budgeted
revenues in 2006. Some of the additional expenditures will be for defense, which the
authorities explained by the regional security situation. Another priority area is PRSP-related
social spending. The authorities agreed that it would be important to improve the capacity to
efficiently absorb significant increases in social and infrastructure spending. With respect to
the natural gas subsidy introduced in April 2006, the authorities noted that it will end once
the current contract with Gazprom expires at end-2008, resulting in a tariff hike for
consumers. The authorities do not intend to introduce new subsidies, but expect the impact
on the most vulnerable to be mitigated by rising pensions and public sector wages.
26.
Given the rising inflationary pressures, the authorities intend to reduce the 2006
overall deficit from 2.8 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent of GDP, mainly through improving
revenue performance (MEFP, ¶14). The program for 2007 envisages a roughly unchanged
fiscal stance relative to the revised 2006 program (MEFP, ¶15). The draft budget for 2007
projects the tax-to-GDP ratio to rise by 1.0 percentage point.7 The authorities view this target
as ambitious but realistic, and understanding was reached to adjust overall expenditures
downward should tax revenues be lower than budgeted in the first half of 2007.
D. External Sector Issues
27.
The external current account worsened in 2006, largely on account of declining
exports (Table 6). Preliminary data for the first nine months of 2006 show that exports were
about 1 percent lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year, in large part due
to weak international demand for diamonds and one-off factors affecting brandy exports to
Russia. Imports, largely of intermediate and capital goods related to foreign financed public
investment projects, grew by 19½ percent over the same period, leading to a widening in the
trade deficit. Excluding diamonds, exports increased by 3½ percent, while imports surged by
7

It is projected that the gas import price hike will yield additional VAT revenues of 0.25 percent of GDP; the
elimination of VAT exemptions at the border will yield additional 0.15 percent of GDP (MEFP, ¶7); and several
tax policy measures and a tightening of the VAT regime for construction will yield at least an additional 0.2
percent of GDP (MEFP, ¶21–22).

The deterioration of the trade balance is projected to be reversed in the second half
of 2006, as exports of diamonds show signs of recovery. The external current account deficit
for the year, however, is projected to worsen from 4 percent of GDP in 2005 to 5 percent of
GDP in 2006. But the risks to the external balance are on the downside: (i) real exchange rate
appreciation owing to rising foreign exchange inflows favors expenditure-switching toward
imports and may erode competitiveness of Armenia’s less traditional exports (food
processing and textiles); and (ii) world market prices for base metals have recently
weakened.
29.
Armenia’s external debt position is sustainable. The joint Fund-World Bank debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Armenia is at a low risk of debt distress
(Appendix 1). Notwithstanding its conservative assumptions, the DSA reveals that all
external debt indicators are well below the relevant country-specific debt-burden thresholds.
The authorities agreed with the assessment. Moreover, they indicated that at this time they
would prefer to maintain the zero limit on the contracting (or guaranteeing) of new
nonconcessional debt.
III. FISCAL REFORMS
30.
Despite recent progress in increasing revenues and improving tax administration,
a number of obstacles hamper tax collection and undermine the investment climate (See SI,
Chapter 2 and Box 4). Raising the tax-to-GDP ratio and improving tax buoyancy without
resorting to ad hoc discretionary measures to increase collection remains a priority.
Strengthening tax administration will be key to increasing revenues and reducing compliance
costs, while improving incentives for businesses to enter the formal sector. Expenditure
efficiency is also a concern given the increase in spending and insufficient monitoring of the
noncommercial organizations (NCOs) that execute large parts of public spending.

16
Box 4. What Explains the Low Tax-to-GDP Ratio?
Although there has been a notable improvement in tax revenue performance in 2005–06, the tax-to-GDP ratio at
14.4 percent of GDP (excluding social contributions) in 2005, is lower than in most other CIS countries and
falls short of the levels in higher-income transition economies. It is also lower than the PRSP target of
15.8 percent of GDP for 2005.
Low tax-to-GDP ratios can be partly attributed to important tax exemptions, such as (i) tax holidays for foreign
investors, which are due to expire in 2008; (ii) exemptions for large-scale agriculture, to be phased out by 2009
as stipulated in Armenia’s WTO accession agreement; and (iii) wide-ranging exemptions of the construction
sector from taxation.
However, shortcomings in tax administration account for the main part of the lackluster revenue performance.
Tax evasion through under-declaration of VAT, reporting of losses for tax purposes by corporations, and the
underreporting of wages are important factors in explaining weak tax performance. These factors are mainly
rooted in weaknesses in tax audits and more generally a lack of capacity to accurately estimate tax liabilities.
Moreover, revenue losses due to governance problems in the revenue agencies are a concern. Staff estimates
suggest that the contribution of tax administration to the growth in tax revenue was minimal in recent years; its
estimated contribution was actually negative in 2003 and about zero in 2004 (see SI, Chapter 2). However, in
2005, the contribution of tax policy and administration initiatives to revenue growth became substantial,
accounting for 25–35 percent of the increase. This suggests that the tax and customs administration measures
undertaken in recent years, combined with the reduction in access to the simplified tax regime in 2004–05, are
yielding results.

31.
The authorities believe it is important to raise revenues over the medium term and
highlighted the large number of tax policy and administration measures they have
implemented (MEFP ¶7): most exemptions from VAT payment at the border have been
recently abolished or incorporated in the new capital deferral system; tax regulations for the
evasion in the construction sector were tightened; access to the simplified tax and to
deductions under the profit tax has been reduced; and the focus on VAT cross-checks and the
reduction of dubious tax losses and tax arrears has been increased. On the expenditure side,
most measures under the financial management and reporting action plan for NCOs have
been implemented, and program budgeting is expected to be implemented fully within the
next five years.

17
32.
The reform program for the period ahead focuses on measures to broaden the tax
base by reducing privileges and loopholes, in particular indexing of presumptive taxes
(MEFP, ¶21). The establishment of the information technology needed for risk-based
selection for VAT cross-checks, audits, and refunds, and of a network linking all
inspectorates of the State Tax Service in 2007 will constitute a major improvement in tax
administration (MEFP, ¶23). The law on NCOs will be amended to clarify their definition
and activities, and to separate the functions of the management bodies (MEFP, ¶25), with a
view to limiting the possibilities for converting public enterprises into NCOs. The Fund will
continue to cooperate closely with the World Bank on the implementation of reforms in the
customs area (MEFP, ¶24).
IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
33.
Notwithstanding important reforms over the past few years, financial sector
development in Armenia has lagged behind other transition countries (see SI Chapter 3).
Deepening of financial intermediation has been hindered by high cash ratios, credit risk, lack
of competition, and institutional weaknesses. Armenia has a large shadow economy, which
further limits the scope for financial intermediation (Box 5).
34.
Credit to the private sector is still low even by regional standards (8.2 percent of
GDP in 2005), but has grown rapidly in the recent past, reflecting strong economic growth,
increasing personal incomes, and rising confidence. While the level of nonperforming loans
is low and the banking sector generally sound, rapid credit growth, in particular in the
consumer credit segment, may stress local banks’ capacity to monitor and control the
attendant risks.
35.
Reforms to foster financial intermediation and strengthen prudential oversight are
progressing. The authorities noted that they are actively encouraging the entry of additional
reputable international banks with the aim to improve banking sector efficiency. With
technical and financial assistance from various donors, they have initiated a project to
develop the mortgage lending market. In addition, the authorities emphasized their efforts to
encourage dedollarization and the use of bank transactions in the economy so as to facilitate
the legalization of the informal economy and improve monetary policy transmission.
36.
Another focus is the development of the nonbank financial sector, with impending
reforms in insurance, capital markets, and the pension system. At the heart of this reform is
an increase in the pension contribution rate that would generate large funds for investment.
The CBA would like these funds to be managed by reputable international firms. With the
help of Fund technical assistance, the authorities are drafting amendments to the AML/CFT
law to bring it in line with international best practice.

18
Box 5. Financial Sector Development
The financial system remains small and bank dominated. Total assets of the banking sector were 20 percent
of GDP in 2005, substantially below the CIS average of about 30 percent. Armenia has a large shadow
economy, estimated to be about one-third of GDP, that does not rely on the formal financial sector. Firms and
individuals rely to a large extent on cash for transactions, partly to evade taxes. This significantly diminishes the
potential deposit base of the banking system and the market for products offered by banks and other financial
institutions. Foreign currency cash holdings are large and have been roughly estimated up to one-third of GDP
(80 percent of total cash holdings). Remittances from abroad also provide a source of funds that reduces the
need to obtain financing from the financial sector.
Armenian banks are generally well capitalized,
profitable, and liquid with a satisfactory level of asset
quality, although the stock of nonperforming loans has
increased recently (See Country Report No. 05/178 for
FSAP update recommendations). Financial sector
indicators improved, and financial intermediation
expanded in 2005 with credit to the private sector growing
by 32 percent, albeit from a low base. At end-2005,
around 50 percent of banking system assets consisted of
cash, interbank balances, and investments in securities,
and only 40 percent of total assets were loans. The
banking system remains heavily dollarized, with loan and
deposit dollarization ratios of 64 percent and 67 percent at end-2005, respectively.

Banking spreads remain high at over 10 percentage points. Credit risk arising from poor creditor rights
protection, weak auditing and accounting standards, and weaknesses in the institutional framework is a key
factor in explaining high banking spreads in Armenia. A low degree of banking competition due to market
segmentation, as well as bank-specific factors, such as opaque ownership structures with connected lending,
lack of risk-assessment capacity, and comparatively high administrative and funding costs, are additional
factors.

Implementation of the amended Law on Banks and Banking during the first half of
2006 has been smooth (MEFP, ¶8). Going forward, the authorities intend to further improve
bank transparency and accountability by amending the Law on Bank Secrecy (MEFP, ¶26).
Several measures encouraging non-cash transactions are under consideration, which will
contribute to reducing the size of the shadow economy. In addition, measures encouraging
dedollarization will strengthen monetary policy effectiveness (MEFP, ¶27). Regarding
nonbank financial sector reform, a new Insurance Law that is compliant with the standards of
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and a pension framework law are
currently under preparation. The CBA also plans to submit to parliament a new Securities
Market Regulation that corresponds to the standards of the International Organization of
Securities Commissions, and has invited a foreign stock market operator to advise on a plan
to develop the Armenian capital markets with the objective to attract a strategic investor
(MEFP, ¶28).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The Armenian economy continues to perform very well. Prudent monetary and
fiscal policies, strong external inflows, and ongoing structural reforms have contributed to
double-digit growth since 2002, low inflation, and a reduction in unemployment and poverty.
The outlook is for further strong growth in 2007, underpinned by high investment and
remittance inflows.
39.
The major policy challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain
growth in the context of sizable foreign exchange inflows. Sustaining broad-based growth
will hinge not only on continued sound macroeconomic policies but also on fiscal and
financial sector reforms. As foreign savings are expected to decline gradually over the
coming years, higher investment will need to be financed by domestic saving. In this context,
fostering financial services that could help channel more remittances into productive uses
will be important to help promote private-sector growth in the future.
40.
The CBA’s commitment to price stability is to be commended. Staff agrees,
however, that it would be difficult and perhaps costly to reach the CBA’s original end-year
inflation target of 3 percent. Accordingly, it supports the upward revision of the end-year
target to 5 percent in 2006 and 4 percent in 2007. However, frequent revisions to the inflation
target or exceeding the revised inflation targets should be avoided, as this could hurt not only
economic growth, but also the credibility of monetary policy, particularly in light of the
authorities’ intention to move to a full-fledged inflation targeting regime over the medium
term. Given the interrelationship between the fiscal stance, monetary policy, and appreciation
and inflationary pressures, the authorities should continue to strengthen monetary operations,
liquidity management, and coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. To this end,
staff welcomes recent efforts to strengthen monetary operations and liquidity management,
which will help support the move to formal inflation targeting.

20
41.
The flexible exchange rate regime has contributed to price stability. Resisting
nominal appreciation pressures will come at the expense of higher inflation which, in turn,
could hurt the poor and possibly harm growth. Staff supports the central bank’s policy of
focusing on price stability, with foreign exchange intervention used primarily as an
instrument to address excess liquidity in the banking system and to smooth exchange rate
volatility. The exchange rate system, which can be classified as a managed float without a
predetermined path, is consistent with macroeconomic stability. Moreover, there is no clear
evidence that the dram is currently overvalued. Given concerns about exchange rate
appreciation, the CBA needs to intensify its public information campaign to explain its
causes.
42.
The real appreciation of the dram, if sustained, could jeopardize external
competitiveness and cause Dutch disease, unless structural reforms are implemented to
improve productivity. The authorities need to move forcefully with policies to raise
productivity, including by improving the business climate and spurring competition,
particularly among importers. While recent surveys suggest some improvement in the
business climate, more could be done, particularly in the area of tax reforms.
43.
Staff welcomes the tightening of the fiscal stance in 2006 and views the
2007 budget as compatible with macroeconomic stability. The large tax revenue increase
envisaged for 2007 appears feasible given reforms to date, the significant scope for additional
revenue collection through improved administration, and the political commitment to
enhance revenue collection. On the expenditure side, improving the capacity to efficiently
absorb significant increases in social spending should be a priority. Social expenditures
should be progressively raised toward the PRSP target. With respect to the gas subsidy, staff
urges the authorities to (i) ensure full transparency in accounting for the subsidy by
incorporating potential proceeds of any asset transfer to the budget; (ii) avoid general
subsidies to offset higher gas price increases, as they are inefficient and will be difficult to
eliminate; and (iii) develop a credible exit strategy to phase out the subsidy by end-2008 to
ensure full cost-recovery and reduce medium-term fiscal risks.
44.
In the coming years, the authorities will be facing two competing fiscal
objectives, namely (i) maintaining a prudent fiscal stance in support of macroeconomic
stability and (ii) raising expenditures on infrastructure and social services in line with their
poverty reduction strategy. These dual objectives highlight the importance of further raising
revenues to finance priority expenditures while at the same time alleviating the burden on
monetary policy, particularly as donor assistance will likely decline over time.
45.
Fiscal reforms remain key to sustaining growth and reducing poverty. Staff
commends the authorities for the reforms implemented in recent years, which have
contributed to the notable improvement in the tax-to-GDP ratio in 2005–06. Nevertheless, the
tax-to-GDP ratio remains low by regional standards. The estimated shortfall of actual relative
to potential revenue is about 4 percent of GDP. In tax policy, it is important to allow the tax
holiday for foreign investors to expire and expand taxation of the construction sector.

21
Moreover, reliance on presumptive taxes should be reduced and taxation of more economic
activities should be moved to the regular tax regime. In tax administration, the focus should
be on improving the tax authorities’ ability to check transactions and audit taxpayers. On
expenditure efficiency, strengthening internal audit and the monitoring of service delivery
should receive priority treatment.
46.
Further strengthening and streamlining of financial sector regulation as well as
continued strong supervision are warranted to improve bank corporate governance, foster
competition, and reduce the large lending-deposit spreads. At the same time, the authorities
have to strike a balance between safeguarding the integrity of the financial system and
avoiding over-regulation, which could hold back financial development. The root causes of
financial sector underdevelopment are the shadow economy as well as market segmentation
and low bank competition. Progress in tax administration reform will be crucial to reduce the
size of the informal economy. The expected participation of reputable international investors
in the financial sector should spur competition, increase trust of depositors, improve
governance, and bring expertise in credit risk management.
47.
The nonbank financial sector reform agenda is ambitious, but could also pose
some risks. Major legislation is expected later this year and in 2007 to overhaul the pension
system, develop the insurance sector, and promote the securities market. However, the fiscal
impact and effect on overall savings of the pension plan, which has many details that remain
to be decided, are still uncertain.
48.
The program’s prospects remain very bright, but there are risks. Effective policy
coordination between the monetary and fiscal authorities is needed to ensure that low
inflation and fiscal stability are maintained. In this context, it will be important to sustain a
prudent fiscal policy as the campaign for next year’s parliamentary elections picks up.
49.
Armenia’s performance under the PRGF arrangement has been very good.
Based on this track record, and the strong policy program for 2007, staff supports the
authorities’ request for the completion of the third review under the PRGF arrangement.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultations will be held on the standard 24month cycle.

1/ "Prog." refers to the program agreed to in March 2006. Relative to the budget, the staff presentation makes the following adjustments: (i) estimated military wages are reclassified from
Other goods and services to Wages; (ii) external grants, external interest, and external financing are converted at the program exchange rate of AMD 450 per US dollar and AMD 504 per euro.
2/ According to the draft budget as of 10/17/06..
3/ As the SPA is not included in net claims on central government (NCCG), timing differences between the conversion of SPA funds into domestic currency deposits (which are included in NCCG)
and their spending can affect the consistency between the CBA financing in the fiscal accounts and the change in NCCG in the monetary accounts.

Sources: Ministry of Finance and Economy, Central Bank of Armenia, and Fund staff estimates.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) is subject
to a safeguards assessment update in the context of the current arrangement. A safeguards
update of the CBA was completed on November 7, 2005. The update found that the CBA’s
safeguards framework has been strengthened since the previous assessment completed in 2002.
In particular, measures have been put in place to improve data reported to the Fund, to
strengthen controls and reporting on externally managed foreign exchange investments, and to
address weaknesses in the legal framework. Furthermore, the appointment term of the external
audit firm has been lengthened and new regulations and procedures have been put in place to

34
better define the actions and scope of the internal audit function. A number of areas were
identified where further steps could be taken. This includes strengthening controls over
reporting of monetary program data to the Fund, improving oversight of the audit processes
and the internal control systems by establishing an audit committee, and enhancing the CBA’s
internal audit function. The CBA agreed with the specific recommendations and their
implementation schedule.
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

(a) On November 22, 1993, the Republic of Armenia introduced its national currency, the
dram, at a rate of 200 Armenian rubles per dram. The exchange rate has been allowed to float
since then, but in 2005-06, the CBA intervened in the foreign exchange market to smooth out
volatility in the exchange rate. The exchange rate system can be classified as a managed float
without a predetermined path. The official exchange rate is quoted daily as a weighted average
of the previous day’s interbank exchange rates.
(b) Armenia maintains no exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security
reasons, and notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
IX. Article IV Consultations
The 2004 Article IV consultation with Armenia was concluded on December 1, 2004. Armenia
is subject to the 24-month consultation cycle.

APPENDIX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(September 30, 2006)
Country Director: Donna Dowsett-Coirolo
I.

Telephone: (202) 473-0121

IMPLEMENTATION OF STRUCTURAL REFORM MEASURES
A.

Legal Framework

1.
The World Bank has supported the Armenian government to establish the core legal
framework necessary for private sector operations, including the Civil Procedure Code, the
Procurement law, the Business Registration law and the Public Auction law. The fully
restructured and enacted Bankruptcy law is now harmonized with the Civil Code and the
Civil Procedure Code, and strengthens the enforcement mechanisms for bankruptcy
procedures. The Concession law has been enacted and the National Assembly has adopted a
new Labor Code, which is compatible with the requirements of a market economy and is an
important instrument of flexible job-creation. The government also has made significant
progress in drafting the necessary legislation to improve the lending environment through
strengthening the procedures for collateral registration and for foreclosure and enhancing the
knowledge of the judiciary concerning commercial contracts. Specifically, the government
has adopted amendments to civil code, criminal code, civil procedure law, law on
compulsory enforcement, and public auction law.
B.

Business Environment

2.
The World Bank has supported the government to make satisfactory progress in
removing administrative barriers for business and investment and has strengthened the
consultative mechanisms with the business community. The steps taken include, inter alia,
consolidating, downsizing, and clarifying mandates of various government inspections;
enacting the new law on business registration; streamlining licensing procedures; issuing new
accounting recommendations for small and medium-sized enterprises; establishing a
regulatory framework that allows privatization of urban land by business entities; and
adopting simplified procedures for obtaining site development and construction permits. The
capacity of the Armenian Development Agency as a focal point for government’s efforts to
promote investment and exports as well as for identifying the remaining bottlenecks in the
business environment has been strengthened. The functioning of the Business Council has
been improved and the private sector’s awareness of its activities has been enhanced.
3.
The recent business surveys of Armenian entrepreneurs suggest that these efforts
have already resulted in a more positive private sector perception of the business and
investment environment. For example, the average time necessary to get construction and
building renovation permits was reduced from 310 days in 2001 to 112 days in 2006. The
FDI increased by almost 20 percent in 2005 compared with 2003. The State Customs
Committee’s websites became operational and during 2003, on average 467 references per

38
month were made to it. As part of the PRSC I, II and III the Customs introduced a self
declaration system, reduced the role of reference prices and strengthened.
4.
On tax administration, the government strengthened the operation of Large Tax
Payers Unit (LTPU), placed a high priority on reducing the stock of VAT refunds owed to
exporters and ensured that no additional VAT arrears were incurred to exporters. The
government adopted decision announcing its intention to widen participation in the provision
of international civil aviation services, raise efficiency and cut costs and initiated policy
work. Despite these improvements, there is still considerable scope for further reforms in the
areas of competition, deregulation and strengthening of business and investment climate,
especially in commercial debt recovery procedures, improvements in the transparency and
efficiency of the judicial system, tax and customs administrations, improvements in
governance and implementing the anti-corruption strategy. In addition to the above-stated,
further strengthening of both tax and customs administration are at the core of the PRSC III,
in particular implementation of self-assessment systems; adherence to reforms for the Large
Taxpayer Unit and good practices on VAT refund and tax arrears; completion,
implementation and expansion of DTI facilities in major customs and implementation of
intelligence-based system based on risk assessment.
C.

Energy and Infrastructure

5.
Since its privatization in the second half of 2002, the Electricity Distribution
Company has remained in compliance with its licenses agreement as confirmed by making
full payments to the generation and service providers, reporting to the regulator on a timely
basis, and submitting investment plan to the regulator. Supported by the World Bank, the
government has also made satisfactory efforts to improve the legal and regulatory framework
in the energy sector in order to establish a supportive environment for the new private
operator. Budget allocations have been increased to ensure full payments to the energy sector
by the budgetary organizations and public utilities. The government implemented the
Integrated Rehabilitation Plan for state-owned utilities (including energy, irrigation, drinking
water companies and Yerevan metro) with strengthened corporate governance, creation of
electricity market, and cessation of operations of the state electricity wholesale company. In
addition, the Public Sector Regulatory Commission (PSRC) has made considerable progress
in improving utilities regulatory framework and adopted several measures including,
monitoring indicators for electricity service quality and standard. Despite this satisfactory
performance, continued efforts are crucial for improvements in the energy sector through
restructuring the midstream companies and strengthening the regulatory framework to ensure
adequate functioning, transparency, and reliability of this sector.
6.
There has been progress in improving fiscal discipline and reducing losses in the
irrigation and water sectors. The World Bank has been working with the government to:
(i) upgrade the management capacity of public companies in these sectors; (ii) ensure a
gradual increase in tariffs to cost recovery; (iii) provide additional investments to improve
technical efficiency; and (iv) ensure that the budget provides adequate financing for water
consumed by public sector entities. To provide full cost recovery, the government has
adopted a schedule for irrigation tariff increase in 2002–2007 in order to achieve full cost

39
recovery in the irrigation system by 2007. As part of the PRSC III reforms, the Government
has also developed and now considering a step-by-step civil aviation liberalization action
plan. Railway restructuring plan and development of telecommunication regulations are also
underway.
D.

Education and Health

7.
The World Bank has supported reforms in education and health. The government
implemented a major rationalization program during the 2003 school year. As a result, 37
schools were merged or closed and about 9,000 teachers were made redundant. The mediumterm action plan for improving the financial management, accounting, and financial reporting
for higher education institutions was adopted by the government on January 26, 2003.
Accountants at the higher institutions have been trained and special software has been
prepared for use. Since the second quarter of 2003, the new accounting procedures are being
used. The government increased the state budget allocation for primary and secondary
education and improved teachers’ salaries. The government also developed an action plan
and cleared arrears in the education sector and prevented further arrears in this sector. The
ratio of pupils to full-time equivalent teachers increased to over 14 and teacher salaries
increased by 65 percent in 2005. In addition, the government developed a strategy on early
childhood education and options for its piloting in two marzes. The government has also
made initiatives to carry out the three year implementation plan for higher education reforms.
Despite these improvements, there is scope for further reforms in education, including
adoption of new curricula for secondary education, enhancement of standards for higher
education to make it more responsive to employers’ needs, improving preschool systems, and
strengthening monitoring and financial reporting of the noncommercial organizations
(NCOs) in the education sector.
8.
The government adopted the hospital master plan for Yerevan in late 2002. As a
result, the remaining public hospitals in Yerevan were to be merged into smaller number of
hospital networks with necessary steps to be taken to restructure them. The government
adopted a decree on November 21, 2003, identifying the configuration of ten hospital
networks through consolidation of twenty-four public hospitals and thirteen outpatient health
care institutions. Directors for nine of these hospital networks have been appointed. While
the hospital merger process is being implemented, introduction of further appropriate
adjustments may be required. The medium-term action plan for improving financial
management accounting and reporting for the public hospitals was adopted by the
government to prepare new reporting and accounting procedures and cost accounting
manuals.
9.
Implementation progress has been satisfactory and about 200 hospital accountants
have been trained in new accounting procedures. The government developed an action plan
for clearing the accumulated arrears in the health sector and prevented further arrears in this
sector. The government also adopted a decision to introduce further reforms in the Basic
Benefit Package in the health sector. The government undertook measures for financing and
management of the Primary Health Care departments of polyclinic that are included in the
hospital networks. Further reforms are needed in increasing the population overall health

40
status, reducing child and maternal mortality, increasing use of healthcare system by rural
and low-income groups, monitoring public health and promoting better health behavior, and
strengthening monitoring and financial reporting of the noncommercial organizations
(NCOs) in the health sector. The government developed the national strategy on combating
non-communicable diseases and plans to take necessary steps to address the public health
threats from non-communicable diseases through development and implementation of
specific priority programs on non-communicable diseases and through allocation of adequate
public resources in the health care budget.
E.

Social Protection and Insurance

10.
Since 1999, the government has been replacing a range of fragmented cash and noncash benefits and privileges with better-targeted transfers to families. The government has
been supported by the World Bank to complete several important steps to enhance its
capacity for administration of transfers to families, including: (i) re-registration of poverty
benefit recipients; (ii) beneficiary assessment of the existing benefits; and (iii) establishment
of a central database for poverty benefit recipients. Data from the recent household survey
suggest that the system of benefits and transfers to the poor has become an efficient
instrument for reducing extreme poverty. The government introduced differentiation of
benefits within the family poverty benefits. Continued efforts are needed to ensure the
adequacy of the level and administrative capacity of the social protection systems to
guarantee coverage of transfers to people with special needs. Based on the 2004 household
survey results the government plans to evaluate effectiveness of the family poverty benefits.
11.
The law on Public Pension focuses on strengthening and streamlining the
pension system. It provides significant improvements in the pension systems, including:
(i) introduction of an equal retirement age for men and women at age 63; (ii) separation of
social insurance benefits from social pensions; (iii) elimination of most early retirement
provisions; (iv) indexation of pension to inflation; and (v) establishment of more direct links
between benefits and contributions, with adequate provision for a minimum benefit.
Following adoption of the law, the government has made satisfactory progress in its
implementation. The government Decree No. 309 of July 2003, established an inter agency
working group to monitor introduction of the Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) into the
pension system. Additionally, a range of necessary implementation regulations, based on the
Public Pension Law, was developed, including: (i) the documents required for award of
pensions; (ii) rules for awarding and making payments for partial pensions to those with less
than the minimum required length of insurance history; (iii) procedures for making payments
of the survivors’ pensions to children under full state custody; and (iv) procedures for
awarding, computing and making payments of the privileged pensions. While the fiscal
performance of the Sate Pension Fund has improved and as a result, the average pension has
increased, the level, coverage and sustainability of pensions are issues for further elaboration.
Overall, within the PRSC and Social Protection Project , the Bank supported the analytic
work enabling the Government to develop a new Social Protection and Pension package,
with improvements in the family poverty benefit formula.

II.

LENDING

12.
World Bank lending to Armenia as of September 30, 2006 totals US$932.3 million,
of which US$797.3 million has been disbursed. The current Bank portfolio consists of 18
IDA credits with a total commitment of $251.7 million, of which $119.9 million is disbursed.
13.
Building on the major Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper’s (PRSP) themes, the fourth
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Armenia was discussed in the World Bank Board of
Executive Directors on June 10, 2004 to focus on three main objectives of: (i) promoting
private sector led economic growth; (ii) making growth more pro-poor; and (iii) reducing
non-income poverty. Pursuant to agreements reached in the context of IDA-14, country
resource envelopes are determined annually based on the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessments and performance of the ongoing portfolio. Armenia has a very strong IDA
performance rating and as a consequence was eligible for about $58 million in FY06 and $61
million in FY07. Based on a 2006 review of Armenia’s creditworthiness, Armenia will now
be eligible to receive a small amount of IBRD lending beginning in FY08, although it is not
yet decided whether to do so.
14.
The CAS includes four Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) for FY05, 06, 07,
and 08. These will support the PRSP objectives and focus on four main components:
(i) supporting private sector development and governance; (ii) advancing public
infrastructure reforms; (iii) improving core public sector functions; and (iv) enhancing
human development and improving social safety nets. Macroeconomic stability is a
precondition for the PRSC and is vital for facilitating an enabling environment necessary for
successful structural reforms implementation. The PRSC’s preparation is being closely
coordinated with the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The first PRSC
was approved by the World Bank Board on November 18, 2004, became effective and
disbursed in December 2004. The second PRSC in the amount of $20 million equivalent was
approved by the World Bank's Board on January 19, 2006 and fully disbursed in April 2006.
The third PRSC in the amount of USD$20 million is scheduled for Board’s Approval in the
first half of 2007.

APPENDIX III. RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of September 30, 2006)
1.
As of December 31, 2005, the EBRD approved 35 projects in the power, transport,
agribusiness, textile, mining, construction and financial sectors. Total commitments amounted
to EUR 136.3 million.
2.
There are two sovereign projects. First, the EBRD approved a sovereign guaranteed
loan of EUR 54.8 million for construction of the Hrazdan Unit 5 thermal power plant in
March 1993, partly aimed at the eventual closure of Armenia’s nuclear plant in Medzamor.
The government is contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan Unit 5 as the completion of this
plant is constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD had funded technical
assistance for the Hrazdan privatization prospectus and continues to follow the privatization
process. The Hrazdan Thermal Power Complex excluding the unfinished Unit 5 has been
transferred to the Russian Federation in the context of the debt-for-equity deal. Second, in
November 1994, the agreement on a EUR 21.8 million loan to build an air cargo terminal in
Zvartnots airport was signed under a guarantee by the Armenian government. The airport was
transferred to private management in 2002. The new management has prepared a master plan
for the development of the airport, which is expected to generate further cargo traffic for the
cargo terminal.
3.
Most of the Bank’s projects in Armenia are in the private sector. The EBRD has
provided a loan to the Yerevan Brandy Company owned by Pernod Ricard of France
(EUR 16.5 million). In the banking sector, a first equity participation in the Commercial Bank
of Greece-Armenia (EUR 1.1 million) was approved in late 1999 and a second equity
participation in Armeconombank was approved in 2004. The Bank also acquired an equity
stake in an Armenian non-bank financial intermediary, CIRCO, an insurance subsidiary of
Cascade Capital. Moreover, a multi-bank on-lending facility of EUR 10 million was activated
in early 2000. Within the framework of multi-bank facility the Bank currently has credit lines
for micro and small enterprises with three local banks (a total of EUR 8.0 million). The EBRD
is committed to further expanding lending under this facility to other banks. A Trade
Facilitation Program with the purpose to facilitate access of Armenian banks to trade financing
was also made available to four Armenian banks. In 2002, a loan to finance EUR 2.9 million
in working capital expansion was signed with the Armenian Copper Programme (the only
copper smelter in the region), and a new loan (EUR 4.3 million), including the refinancing of
the existing loan, was signed in August 2004. Moreover, the EBRD has launched the Turn
Around Management (TAM) and Business Advisory Service programmes in Armenia in 2003,
originally funded by the EU-Tacis program but now funded from the ETC Fund, to support
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. There were seven new projects completed during
2004 for a total amount of EUR 6.7 million. Two of them are in the banking sector (including
equity investment), one in general industry sector (direct investment in equity of a local
enterprise), one pre-export finance facility with a local company in the extractive industry and
three trade facilitation programmes with local commercial banks. During 2005 the EBRD
signed 11 projects with the total commitments of Euro 18 million. New commitments include
a trade facilitation project with a local bank, two direct lending facility with a small hydro

44
power plant and gold mining company, three new SME loans, three equity investment projects
with a pharmaceutical company, plastic preform manufacturer (under Direct Investment
Facility),an insurance and reinsurance company, and two medium-sized co-financing facility
allowing local banks to share the risk of their selected clients with EBRD.
4.
The key priorities of the EBRD for the coming years are: (i) financial sector; (ii)
enterprise sector, particularly SME and micro-enterprise financing through credit lines to
Armenian banks or direct loans and equity investments, (iii) infrastructure investments in the
development of alternative energy sources and municipal infrastructure projects and (iv)
portfolio monitoring and implementation support. The EBRD’s current country strategy was
approved in February 2006.

45
APPENDIX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data provision for surveillance is adequate overall, further improvements are
needed in real, fiscal, and external sector statistics in order to enhance the design and
monitoring of economic policies. The overall quality, timeliness, and coverage of
macroeconomic statistics in Armenia have improved significantly over the past few years.
The Fund has substantially facilitated this process, through technical assistance from the
Statistics Department, the Fiscal Affairs Department, and the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department. On November 7, 2003 Armenia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) and has since then provided timely data for all SDDS prescribed data
categories.
2.
National accounts and price statistics. The National Statistics Service (NSS) has
made significant changes to the national accounts methodology to bring it in line with best
international practices. Progress has been made in developing estimates of monthly and
(constant price) quarterly GDP that are now published. Basic data collection procedures have
also improved. The national accounts have adopted the concept of gross value added using
transaction prices mostly recorded on an accrual basis. However, progress has been slow in
improving the compilation of national accounts at constant (1998) prices; annual data are still
mainly derived by re-valuing current output and inputs at previous year prices instead of
deflating them by the relevant components of the producer price index. Quarterly GDP
estimates are published at constant and current prices. The CPI covers eleven large
population centers in the Republic of Armenia and the capital city, Yerevan. The base year
and expenditure weights are for 2005. Data on the consumer price index (CPI) and wages are
reported on a timely basis. A ten-day CPI is compiled by the NSS and the Central Bank of
Armenia, though its scope, geographical coverage, and dissemination are limited.
3.
Fiscal statistics. The budget execution reporting system is compiled on a cash basis
and supplemented with monthly reports on arrears and quarterly reports on receivables and
payables. Daily revenue and cash expenditure data for the central government are available
with a lag of one to two days. The Ministry of Finance is undertaking a comprehensive
reform of the treasury system, including the introduction of an internal auditing system in
line ministries and their budgetary institutions. A single treasury account (TSA) was
introduced in 1996, and all bank accounts held by budgetary institutions were closed, except
for Project Implementation Units that are required by donors to operate with commercial
banks’ accounts. Starting in 2002, some budgetary institutions have been converted into
“noncommercial organizations” (NCOs). These units have been taken out of the treasury
system and have their own bank accounts. They have just started reporting data on their
operations to the Ministry of Finance. These exceptions notwithstanding, all government
receipts and payments are processed through the TSA, although there are still shortcomings
on the timeliness and quality of data on the operations of local governments. Classification of
government transactions by function and economic category are generally in line with the

46
Manual on Government Finance Statistics 1986, and monthly data on central government
operations are disseminated within 40 days of the end of the month.
4.
The budget presentation and the classification of items under the economic and
functional classification of expenditures needs to be made more transparent; for instance, the
data have been subject to frequent reclassifications, and wages for military personnel are
reported in the broader category of “other” goods and services rather than as a wage item.
The reconciliation of central government with general government operations is also difficult
because of the need to manually identify transactions among central government, local
government, and the Social Insurance State Fund.
5.
The authorities submitted cash data, converted to the framework of the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001, for publication in the 2006 Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. Although the authorities expected to begin providing data for publication in the
IFS in early 2005, such data have yet to be received. The GFSM 2001 implementation plan is
currently limited to bringing the classification of budgetary central government revenue,
expense, and transactions in nonfinancial assets in line with international practices.
6.
Money and banking statistics. Money and banking statistics are provided on a
timely basis. Daily data on the accounts of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) are provided
weekly with a one-day lag, while weekly data on the monetary survey are provided with a
one-week lag. Monthly interest rate data are provided with an one-week lag. A new chart of
accounts meeting International Accounting Standards (IAS) was introduced in January 1998.
Since then, the balance sheets of the CBA and of the deposit money banks follow IAS
methodology.
7.
Responding to a STA request, the CBA has compiled and submitted a complete set of
monetary data beginning from December 2001 using STA’s Standardized Report Forms
(SRF). STA review validated the resulting monetary aggregates and the data have been
cleared for publication in the December issue of IFS Supplement.
8.
External sector statistics. The coverage of external sector data has improved in
recent years. Trade statistics are provided on a timely basis, and trade data by origin or
destination and by commodity are generally available within a month. Price data for exports
and imports are less readily available. Quarterly balance of payment data are generally
available with a three-month lag. However, the scope of data on private non-guaranteed
external debt needs to be improved, while data on direct investment abroad (available from
2003) and on other capital outflows are likely underestimated. The compilation program that
would enable proper measuring of the remittances data is not in place and that leads to
considerable discrepancies among available source data, where the surveys data are
considerably lower than the data obtained through the banking system. The absence of a
comprehensive, continuously updated business register hampers the coverage of transactions

47
and institutional units. The latest quarterly data on international investment position are
available for 2005.

APPENDIX V. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The IMF-World Bank staffs’ debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Armenia is at a
low risk of debt distress with all debt indicators well bellow the relevant country-specific
debt-burden thresholds. The analysis underlines that continuing the structural reforms and
preserving macroeconomic stability are critical for safeguarding the favorable debt outlook.
1.
The DSA was prepared jointly by Fund and World Bank staffs in consultation
with the authorities, using the joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country Debt
Sustainability Framework.8 Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario
are consistent with the framework presented in the staff report for the 2006 Article IV
consultation and the third review under the PRGF (Box 1). The external debt data used for
this exercise were updated by staffs based on information provided by the authorities and
multilateral institutions.
Structure of debt and developments in 2005
2.
Armenia’s external debt stock of
public and publicly guaranteed debt as of
end-2005 is estimated at $1,099 million
(22 percent of GDP), 89 percent of which
is owed to multilateral international
organizations (Figure 1).9 The outstanding
debts to the World Bank and the Fund
account for 68 percent and 16 percent of
total debt stock, respectively. In addition,
about 2 percent of GDP of public and
publicly guaranteed debt is owed to
domestic creditors.

3.
The external debt outlook improved considerably in 2005. Prudent debt
management combined with robust economic growth and favorable exchange rate dynamics
contributed to a decline of external debt ratio from 33 percent of GDP in 2004 to 22 percent
of GDP in 2005.10
8

Fund and Bank staffs have collaborated previously on debt sustainability issues, including in the context of the
report on “Poverty Reduction, Growth and Debt Sustainability in Low-Income CIS Countries,” February 5,
2002, (refer to www.imf.org) and “Republic of Armenia—First Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement
Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility” (Country Report No. 05/422).
9

The DSA covers the central government as other public sector debt is negligible.

10

Relevant exchange rate dynamics include (i) dram appreciation against U.S. dollar and its impact on U.S.
dollar denominated GDP level and (ii) debt portfolio implications of U.S. dollar appreciation (about 94 percent
of debt outstanding is contracted in currencies other than U.S. dollar).

49
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2006–26
The baseline DSA has been developed on the following set of assumptions.
•

Annual real GDP growth is projected to average around 7 percent over the medium term. It
is projected to decline subsequently to an average of 4 percent. The near-term growth is
supported by (i) robust investment performance on account of significant foreign exchange inflows
to the public sector (Millennium Challenge Account and Lincy Foundation grants) and to the
private sector (private transfers and remittances) and (ii) significant growth in services, led by
development of financial sector.

•

Consistent with the CBA’s target, the inflation rate is assumed to be around 3 percent per
annum. The near term inflation is projected to be somewhat higher, largely on account of higher
food and international oil prices.

•

The external current account deficit is projected to average around 4½ percent of GDP in
2006–11, against the background of strong import growth. Exports are projected to grow robustly
over the medium term, as new investments in food processing, mining, and base metal sectors
become operational. Buoyed by strong income growth in Russia, private transfers will remain large
in the medium term, financing a significant share of the trade deficit. The long-run current account
deficit is envisaged to improve gradually to an average of 2¾ percent of GDP.

•

In 2006–11, net FDI is expected to average about 3¾ percent of GDP, gradually declining from
the high 2005 level of 5 percent of GDP. In the near term, FDI is expected to be concentrated
mostly in traditional sectors, like base metals, food processing, and telecommunication.
Improvements in business climate, however, should yield a more diversified FDI structure, with
new investment going into new industries (e.g., tourism and IT sector). The long-run net FDI is
projected to average around 3 percent of GDP.

•

Central government revenues (excluding grants) are projected at around of 16¾ percent of
GDP in 2006–11, and will gradually increase to about 19 percent by 2026.

•

The overall fiscal deficit is projected at 2.9 percent of GDP through most of the PRSP horizon
of 2015 and 2.3 percent of GDP thereafter.

•

The level of concessionality of new external borrowing is envisaged to decline in the future, as
Armenia’s income increases. The projected disbursements from the World Bank—Armenia’s
largest creditor, accounting for about 70 percent of country’s total external debt stock as of end2005—assume that starting from 2009 Armenia will begin receiving IBRD loans in addition to
IDA credits, gradually shifting to exclusively IBRD borrowing by 2011. Starting 2007, IDA
repayment terms are envisaged to harden, as maturity period shortens to 20 years. This reflects that
Armenia’s per capita income is expected to exceed the IDA eligibility threshold for two consequent
years. Unidentified residual lending for 2017 and beyond is assumed to be on IBRD terms.

•

Consistent with the authorities’ intention, deficit financing is assumed to be increasingly
financed by domestic, rather than external, borrowing. Residual borrowing from domestic
sources reduces risks associated with currency mismatch of debt portfolio and contributes to
deepening of domestic financial markets.

50
The baseline scenario
4.
The baseline scenario shows that
the fiscal position remains sustainable
(Table 1, Table 2a, Figure 2), but debt
service costs will be rising.
Notwithstanding a progressively higher
share of deficit financed by domestic and
external borrowing, the net present value of
public sector debt remains well below the
corresponding thresholds, increasing from
16 percent of GDP in 2006 to 29 percent of
GDP in 2026.11 The debt service in percent
of revenues is projected to increase from 15
percent in 2006 to 20 percent in 2026.

1/ Threshold values are based on the guidelines for low-income country
in which Armenia is considered to be a strong performer.
2/ Refers to public debt.
3/ Refers to external debt.

5.
The external debt outlook is benign (Table 1, Table 3a, Figure 3).12 The net
present value of external debt falls from 11 percent of GDP in 2006 to 8 percent of GDP in
2026, as share of deficit financing by domestic borrowing gradually increases. Similarly, the
net present value of public external debt in percent of exports declines from 47 percent in
2006 to 32 percent in 2026. The external debt service in percent of Armenia’s exports
declines from 4 percent to 2 percent, over the same period.
Stress testing
6.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that Armenia’s debt outlook
is particularly sensitive to a lasting shock to economic growth and dynamics of primary
balance (Table 2b, Table 3b).13 Nevertheless, even in these scenarios, Armenia’s debt
outlook is likely to remain manageable, with debt ratios exceeding relevant thresholds only in
an unlikely scenario of permanently lower GDP growth. However, the historical scenario
(which can be considered as a “no-reform” scenario) and the stress testing indicate that all
debt ratios continue on an upward trend through the projected period, underlining the
importance of continuing the process of structural reform and preserving macroeconomic
stability in order to safeguard the debt outlook.
11

The assumption of increasingly expensive financing implies that the primary balance improves steadily as
interest expenditure rises.

12

To ensure data consistency, the external DSA covers only public and publicly guaranteed debt. To improve
monitoring of private debt, the authorities are preparing the Law on State Debt that provisions obligatory
reporting of foreign debt in excess of AMD 100 million contracted by the private sector. According to current
data, private external debt totaled US$ 240 million at end-2005, about 22 percent of external public and publicly
guaranteed debt.

13

The framework for low-income country DSA incorporates alternative scenarios and bound tests aimed at
identifying the sensitivities of the baseline projection to a range of potential shocks.

51
7.
Armenia’s debt outlook is relatively insensitive to an increase in debt-creating
flows. The staffs also considered the possible impact on debt sustainability of a “significant”
fiscal event, such as assumption by the government of pension liabilities. Assuming such an
event were to occur in 2010 and cost around 10 percent of GDP, the net present value of
public debt to GDP ratio in 2026 would remain manageable at about 32 percent, compared
with 28 percent under the baseline.
8.
The authorities welcomed the finding that Armenia is at a low risk of debt
distress. Sound debt management continues to be a priority for the government. Since 2001,
the Ministry of Finance and Economy has produced an Annual Report on Public Debt of
Armenia, covering both domestic and external debt. This publication reports on the evolution
of debt aggregates and the government’s debt management strategy.

1/ Includes only public sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt (if included) is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

ATTACHMENT I. LETTER OF INTENT
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
November 1, 2006

Dear Mr. de Rato:
In the attached supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, we summarize
progress to date in implementing our PRGF-supported program and set out our economic and
financial policies for the period through June 2007. We request hereby the completion of the third
review and the fourth disbursement under the PRGF arrangement as well as modification of the endDecember quantitative performance criteria.
The PRGF-supported program is on track. The Armenian economy continues to perform very well
and all quantitative and structural performance criteria under the PRGF arrangement for end-June
2006 were observed. Despite the impressive progress achieved in recent years, we recognize that a
number of significant challenges remain to sustain high economic growth and reduce poverty. To this
end, our economic program for the period ahead contains specific measures to address weaknesses in
tax administration, enhance fiscal transparency and expenditure efficiency, and strengthen the
financial system.
The Government of the Republic of Armenia believes that the policies and measures set forth in the
attached supplementary memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but it
stands ready to take any additional measures that may be appropriate for this purpose. The
Government will consult with the IMF in advance on the adoption of these measures in accordance
with the IMF’s policies on such consultation. The Government intends to make these understandings
public and authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached supplementary memorandum, and
the staff report.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Andranik Margaryan
Prime Minister
Republic of Armenia

ATTACHMENT II. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
November 1, 2006
1.
This memorandum reviews recent developments and sets forth the government’s
policies through June 2007. These policies constitute an integral part of the government’s
medium-term poverty reduction strategy, which is expected to be updated by early 2007.
I.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM

2.
The Armenian economy has continued to perform very well thus far in 2006. Real
GDP increased by 11.3 percent in the first eight months of 2006, driven by strong growth in
construction and services, as well as by robust inflows of remittances and other foreign
exchange inflows, which helped to boost domestic demand. The average inflation rate over
the first nine months remained low at 1.5 percent, although the 12-month rate of headline
inflation rose to 5.9 percent in September, largely on account of higher food and international
oil prices. Exports grew by only 2 percent in the first half of 2006, mostly due to weak
international demand for diamonds. During the same period, imports continued to grow
robustly, at 20 percent, leading to a widening in the trade deficit. Nevertheless, gross foreign
exchange reserves increased by $90 million in the first half of 2006 on the back of strong
foreign exchange inflows.
3.
The overall fiscal deficit for the first half of 2006 was smaller than programmed,
largely because of stronger revenue performance. Tax revenue grew by 19 percent during the
first 8 months of the year, relative to the same period in 2005. Value-added and profit taxes
accounted for the majority of the overperformance. Expenditure execution was lower than
expected (by AMD 11 billion), although execution of capital spending improved relative to
previous years.
4.
Year-on-year broad money growth decelerated significantly during the first eight
months of 2006, from 28 percent at end-2005 to 15 percent in August. Despite significant
CBA foreign exchange intervention between June and mid-August (by a cumulative amount
of $62.5 million), year-on-year reserve money growth slowed from 52 percent at end-2005
to 19.4 percent in August, on account of slower cash dedollarization, higher government
deposits with the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), and lower bank excess reserves. The
CBA raised the repurchase rate five times since November 2005, implying an increase from
3 to 4.75 percent. While credit growth continued to be very strong at around 40 percent, this
comes from a very low base, and we do not yet see any risks of a deterioration in credit
quality. In accordance with the law, the CBA was recapitalized in April.
5.
All quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2006 were met. However, the
indicative target on the contributions to the State Fund for Social Insurance was missed by a

60
small margin, despite strong growth in revenues since the transfer of the collection function
to the State Tax Service (STS).
6.
We have continued to make good progress in the area of structural reforms. We
submitted to parliament an amendment to the Law on Insurance that eliminates the limitation
on the range of services that insurance companies with substantial foreign ownership can
provide, which was a structural performance criterion for end-June, and parliament approved
the amendment. In addition, we observed all end-June structural benchmarks.
7.
We have continued our efforts to bolster tax and customs administration and
strengthen budget execution and implementation:
•

In the area of tax policy, parliament approved an amendment to the VAT law that
reduces the list of goods exempt from VAT payment at the border, which became
effective on July 22, 2006. We have also submitted to parliament an amendment to
the law on simplified tax, which narrows access to the simplified tax regime by
excluding activities that require state licenses with annual stamp duties of
AMD 1 million or more. To increase revenue from the construction sector, we have
submitted to parliament a number of amendments to existing legislation, including a
provision that any new property development, regardless of type of ownership, will
be taxed.14 Moreover, we have submitted amendments to the profit tax law which
specify the taxation of foreign currency assets, reduce deductions, and introduce
pooled amortization. Finally, parliament has approved a new law on income and
property declaration by natural persons.

•

In the area of tax administration, we developed a 2006-08 action plan for the STS
on information technology (IT) and acquisition. With the help of this action plan, we
intend to (i) improve our IT management capacity; (ii) implement risk-based selection
criteria in the areas of audits, arrears collection, and VAT refunds; (iii) improve
information sharing between the tax inspectorates and headquarters; and (iv) improve
cross-checking, by establishing a unified database for social contributions, tax
collection, and tax arrears. We have also started to apply universal VAT cross-checks
for all transactions above AMD 100,000. The sanctions for tax evasion in the criminal
code were strengthened. Finally, we continue to implement our annual audit plan for
large enterprises and our action plans for the reduction of tax arrears and reported tax
losses.

•

Regarding customs administration, we have established a dedicated Risk
Management Unit in the State Customs Committee (SCC) that regularly reviews and

14

While we had originally committed to introduce a new presumptive tax on property development (structural
benchmark for end-March 2006), we instead amended existing legislation.

61
updates the examination selectivity criteria. We have also expanded the use of the
selectivity module in ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data) to all
customs houses and customs points.
•

On the expenditure side, we have implemented most measures under the financial
management and reporting action plan for state noncommercial organizations
(NCOs). The main remaining task is to introduce monitoring and supervision of
performance indicators. In addition, we have started to apply program budgeting in
four pilot ministries, and the future format of the budget is currently being discussed.
However, technical and other constraints imply that we will not be able to implement
full program budgeting for at least another five years.

8.
We are continuing to strengthen the banking sector and its regulatory and
supervisory framework. The implementation of the amended Law on Banks and Banking,
which aims to improve bank corporate governance, has been smooth. Two feedback rounds
through July confirmed that banks have been adjusting their charters to comply with the new
legislation. We have also implemented guidelines for a consolidated supervision framework
for monitoring beneficiary owners beyond the licensing stage, which will help us to
determine the appropriate structure of corporate governance and to identify how affiliate
companies and related parties affect bank operations. We expect that these guidelines will be
formalized into a manual by January 2007.
9.
The envisaged entry of foreign banks will contribute to the development of the
financial sector. In September, Credit-Agricole entered the Armenian market. In addition, it
is possible that another foreign bank may buy one of our local banks before the end of the
year. Finally, the Nordic Group of Iceland has recently established a credit organization in
Armenia and is considering plans to increase its capital and to apply for a full banking
license.
10.
In order to improve the supervision of foreign exchange transactions, we created a
new department within the CBA that is responsible for licensing and overseeing foreign
exchange offices. The division has been conducting comprehensive audits, as a result of
which the licenses of a number of foreign exchange offices were revoked, due to
noncompliance with foreign exchange regulations. Further, in close consultation with the
IMF, we are in the process of drafting amendments to the AML/CFT Law to reflect the gaps
identified in the self-study for MONEYVAL.
11.
We are also strengthening the nonbank financial sector and its regulatory and
supervisory framework. Thus far, the CBA has inspected and closed six out of 23 insurance
companies. At our invitation, and as a prerequisite for rating Armenian corporations,
Moody’s and Fitch gave Armenia sovereign ratings of Ba2 and BB-, respectively. We have
invited companies to be rated and to issue securities, and we have announced that the highlyrated paper they issue may be used in monetary operations.

62
12.
We continue to make progress in other areas of structural reforms. In the energy
sector, the audit of Armenergo’s balance sheet and its subsequent liquidation have now been
completed. We leased the Yerevan Water and Sewage Company to a joint stock company
created by a foreign operator, with the aim of eliminating budget support. Overall collection
rates in the water and irrigation sectors have increased. However, transitional problems
associated with the expansion of the water metering program, particularly in areas outside of
Yerevan, resulted in somewhat higher losses in the first half of 2006.
II. THE PROGRAM FOR THE PERIOD JULY 2006–JUNE 2007
13.
We remain committed to our growth and poverty-reduction strategy. For the
remainder of 2006 and 2007, our macroeconomic policies will focus on price stability and
continued tax, customs, and financial sector reforms. Reflecting our strong growth
performance thus far this year, we now project real GDP to grow by 11 percent in 2006.
Average inflation in 2006 is expected to remain within 3 percent, although end-period
inflation for 2006 is now projected to be 5 percent. The economic program for 2007
envisages real GDP growth of 9 percent and end-year inflation of 4 percent. We intend to
revise our medium-term macroeconomic framework in the context of the update of our
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
The 2006 fiscal deficit is likely to be smaller than budgeted, largely reflecting higherthan-expected revenues. While we had originally targeted a deficit of AMD 69.9 billion
(2.8 percent of GDP), we now target a deficit of AMD 60.2 billion (2.3 percent of GDP). On
the revenue side, we will increase the tax revenue target by AMD 13.8 billion to
AMD 378.1 billion to reflect performance to date and the higher-than-expected GDP growth.
This implies an increase in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP from 14.3 percent in 2005 to
14.7 percent in 2006. Moreover, nontax and capital revenues are expected to be substantially
higher than budgeted. On the expenditure side, we intend to also revise upwards the overall
expenditure target by AMD 18.9 billion.
15.
The 2007 budget, which has been approved by government, is based on the following
key parameters that are consistent with our Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
for 2007-09. The overall deficit of the central government (including grants) will not exceed
AMD 68.3 billion (2.3 percent of GDP). Reflecting the fiscal reforms implemented to date
and those specified in paragraphs 21-24, tax revenues are budgeted to increase by 1.0 percent
of GDP to AMD 458.9 billion. Current expenditures will total AMD 401.9 billion, allocating
the largest increases to defense, energy, and health, with overall social expenditures budgeted
to increase from 6.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to 6.8 percent in 2007. At the same time, we
will limit expenditure increases where the efficiency of expenditure is a concern. To ensure a
balanced mix between current and capital spending, capital expenditures are budgeted at
AMD 134.7 billion. To ensure that the deficit target is met, in the event of a shortfall in

63
revenues, expenditures for the year will be reduced if revenue developments during the first
half suggest that the end-year target cannot be met.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
16.
Monetary policy will continue to focus on maintaining price stability and a flexible
exchange rate, with the aim of moving to a full-fledged inflation targeting regime over the
medium term. Foreign exchange interventions will be used as an instrument to manage
liquidity and smooth out exchange rate volatility, without targeting a specific level or path
for the exchange rate.
17.
Inflationary pressures increased in 2006 due to high international energy and raw
material prices, higher prices of agricultural products, strong wage growth, and significant
foreign exchange inflows. Under these circumstances, it will be very difficult to reach our
end-year inflation target of 3 percent. Accordingly, the CBA proposed to increase the
inflation target for 2006 to 5 percent (with a band of ±1.5 percentage points) by amending the
State Budget Law for 2006. Consistent with this target, we aim for a reserve money growth
target of 25.1 percent. We intend to withdraw liquidity by increasing issuance of CBA
securities.
18.
We stand ready to further tighten the monetary policy stance if inflationary pressures
persist. We expect inflationary pressures to remain in 2007, reflecting continued strong
economic growth and foreign exchange inflows, as well as an envisaged increase in
telecommunication tariffs. The monetary program for 2007 targets end-year inflation of
4 percent (with a band of ±1.5 percentage points). To that end, the CBA seeks to limit reserve
money growth to 19.9 percent and a possible buildup in foreign reserves. The government
intends to increase the stock of treasury bills by AMD 8.5 billion, which will contribute to
the development of the domestic government debt market.
19.
Progress has been made in meeting the prerequisites for a full-fledged inflation
targeting regime. With the help of IMF technical assistance, operational changes in liquidity
management were implemented in March 2006. This has contributed to the effectiveness of
monetary policy, and repo operations are now considered as the principal monetary policy
instrument. Commercial banks have improved the management of their correspondent
accounts with the CBA, resulting in lower excess liquidity in the banking system. The CBA
has started publishing quarterly inflation reports, and is currently in the process of developing
a quarterly inflation projection model, to be implemented in the first half of 2007. The CBA
looks forward to receiving further IMF technical assistance to help deepen financial
intermediation.
C. Structural Reforms
20.
We will continue to press ahead with reforms that will improve the collection of tax
and customs revenues and strengthen the financial sector.

64
Fiscal reforms
21.
In the area of tax policy, we aim to take additional measures to broaden the tax base
by reducing privileges and loopholes. In particular, we will:
•

submit to parliament a number of tax policy measures by end-2006 under our
harmonization agreement with the European Union;15

•

submit to parliament legislation to change the calculation of the income tax bases
from cash to accrual in order to unify the calculation period of income tax and social
contributions (structural performance criterion, end-March 2007);

•

submit to parliament amendments to all presumptive tax laws with the goal of
indexing the presumptive tax rates to the CPI (structural benchmark, end-June 2007);

•

complete the general part of the unified tax code in consultation with stakeholders
(structural benchmark, end-June 2007), and subsequently submit it to parliament
(structural benchmark, end-December 2007).

22.
Our medium-term objective is to not introduce any new tax privileges and to reduce
the number of exemptions. In particular, we will allow the profit tax exemptions for foreign
investors to expire in 2008, and we will remove the exemption for agriculture in 2009 under
our agreement with the WTO. We also want to limit the use of the presumptive tax regime,
including by moving large-scale operations from the presumptive tax to the regular tax
regime. Finally, when the capital market develops further, we will consider taxing dividends
paid to resident and non-resident natural persons and legal entities under the income and
profits tax laws.
23.
In tax administration, we will focus on improving tax audits, tax arrears collection,
and the VAT refund system. In particular, we will
•

15

strengthen the IT capacity of the State Tax Service (STS) by (i) establishing an
electronic risk-based selection system for VAT cross-checks, audits, and refunds, and
issuing an STS decree specifying the procedures and a timeline that envisages full
technical implementation by end-2007 (structural benchmark, end-December 2006);
(ii) introducing a unified computer network linking all inspectorates of the STS
(structural benchmark, end-June 2007);

Specifically, we expect parliament to pass amendments to the customs code, the VAT law, the law on excises,
and the law on the presumptive tax on tobacco production.

65
•

submit legislation to parliament that will require the recording of taxpayers at the
location of their main economic activity (structural performance criterion, end-March
2007);

•

issue an STS decree specifying the documentation required from foreign entities in
Armenia for all their transactions and for the entitlement to tax holidays;

•

further accelerate the processing of VAT refunds.

24.
In the area of customs administration, we continue to work with the World Bank
and other development partners on implementing direct trader input (DTI), upgrading our
ASYCUDA software, and introducing an intelligence-based system for risk assessment. To
that end, we have extended the use of DTI facilities at the customs house of Araratsian to a
group of brokers and privileged importers that have demonstrated high standards of
competence and professionalism. Depending on this experience, the extension of DTI to all
other import declarations in Araratsian will take place at a future date. We have also
completed a thorough testing of the customs staff and have discharged more than [90]
employees who failed to satisfy the testing standards. Recruitment and training of new staff
are currently under way. In addition, we plan to open a specialized customs house for
excisable goods by end-2006 so as to further improve the effectiveness of customs
administration.
25.
We intend to make further progress on budget monitoring and control. We will
submit to parliament amendments to the law on state NCOs to clarify their definition and
their activities, and to separate the functions of the management bodies (structural
benchmark, end-December 2006). We will continue implementation of the NCO financial
management and reporting action plan.
Financial sector reforms
26.
We will continue to move forward with financial sector reforms. In the banking
sector, we will submit to parliament an amendment to the law on banking secrecy to allow
the CBA to publish violations of and sanctions against commercial banks that do not comply
with the Law on Banks and Banking (structural benchmark, end-December 2006). In
addition, we are considering several measures to reduce the size of the shadow economy by
encouraging non-cash financial transactions in the economy. These measures include the
introduction of mandatory point of sale outlets at larger retail establishments and the
acceptance of credit card transaction receipts for tax verification purposes.
27.
In order to strengthen monetary policy effectiveness, it is important to encourage
dedollarization. We will, therefore, further strengthen the legislation regarding the
regulation and supervision of foreign exchange bureaus, and we will limit their operations to
the provision of retail services to households. We will also strengthen the enforcement of
prohibitions against foreign cash transactions in the retail sector.

66
28.

We also have several proposals for nonbank financial sector reforms:

•

We view the development of the insurance sector as vital to financial sector
deepening. In this context, we plan to submit to parliament a new Insurance Law
that will address shortcomings in the existing law, including by being fully compliant
with the standards of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors
(structural performance criterion, December 2006).

•

We plan to submit to parliament a new Securities Market Regulation that
corresponds to the standards of the International Organization of Securities
Commissions (structural benchmark, end-March 2007). The Armenian stock
exchange (ARMEX), which is currently a self-regulatory body, will become a joint
stock company. We have invited OMX to do a feasibility study and to advise on a
development plan with the aim of preparing a business case for a potential strategic
investor.. We are in the process of identifying companies that could be potential
issuers of securities and candidates for IPOs as catalysts for securities market
development.

•

With the assistance of the World Bank, we are preparing a pension framework law
that outlines a comprehensive overhaul of the pension system. The new system would
raise the minimum pension, and would require those earning above a certain limit to
invest in private funds to maintain their standard of living after retirement. The
envisaged increase in contribution rates would necessitate significant capacity
increases in asset management and insurance. Record keeping could be outsourced to
the Central Depository.
III. OTHER ISSUES

29.
We have prepared a draft of the Law on State Debt intended to regulate the public
debt management process and to improve monitoring of external debt contracted by private
physical and legal entities. We plan to submit the draft to parliament by [July 2007].
30.
In the energy and water sectors, we will continue with our efforts to improve
efficiency and reduce losses. We also intend to further strengthen the capacity of the water
user associations and to move toward cost recovery in the irrigation sector.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
31.
Program monitoring will be based on semi-annual quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets as well as structural performance criteria and benchmarks. The
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) of October 2005 and the attached
amendment to the TMU define the quantitative targets of Table 1, the program adjustors, and
specific reporting requirements. Completion of the fourth review under the PRGF
arrangement, scheduled for May 16, 2007, will require observance of the revised quantitative

67
performance criteria for end-December 2006, shown in Table 1, as well as the structural
performance criteria listed in Table 2. The completion of the fifth review under the PRGF
arrangement, scheduled for November 16, 2007, will require observance of the quantitative
performance criteria for end-June 2007, shown in Table 1, as well as the March structural
performance criteria listed in Table 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 7, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Armenia
On November 22, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Armenia.1
Background
Armenia’s economy has performed very strongly during the last five years. Average real GDP
growth exceeded 12 percent during 2001–2005, while inflation averaged 3 percent. Real per capita
income in U.S. dollars has tripled since 2000, and notable progress has been made in poverty
reduction and structural reforms.
The strong performance of the economy continued in 2006. In the first nine months of 2006 real
GDP growth was 11 percent. The 12-month rate of inflation rose to 6.1 percent, largely on account
of higher food and energy prices. Average inflation in 2006 is expected to remain within 3 percent,
although end-period inflation is now projected to be 5 percent. The dram has appreciated by 15
percent against the dollar in the first nine months of 2006 on account of robust foreign exchange
inflows.
Fiscal policy has remained sound. Tax revenues through September 2006 increased by 19 percent
over the same period last year. The fiscal deficit in 2006 is projected at 2.3 percent of GDP,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the November 22, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
significantly lower than the budgeted amount of 2.8 percent of GDP, mainly due to higher-thanexpected tax revenues and lower expenditure execution, although execution of capital spending
improved relative to previous years.
Regarding monetary policy, broad money and private sector credit grew by 27 percent and 44
percent in the twelve months through September, respectively. Dollarization of bank deposits
decreased from about 70 to 55 percent during the same period. The central bank raised the
repurchase rate five times since November 2005, by a cumulative 175 basis points to 4.75 percent.
After improving in the previous two years, the external current account is projected to worsen to 4.9
percent in 2006, owing to declining diamond exports and booming imports. Nevertheless, the overall
balance of payments is expected to improve, supported by buoyant capital inflows, and gross
international reserves increased by $104 million through end-September. Armenia’s external debt
position is sustainable, and external debt ratios are projected to decline further in 2006.
Progress continues to be made in the areas of fiscal and financial sector reforms. In particular,
parliament recently approved an amendment to the value-added tax (VAT) law that significantly
reduces the list of goods exempt from VAT payment at the border, and an amendment to the
insurance law that provides a level playing field for domestic and foreign companies. Reforms to
foster financial intermediation and strengthen prudential oversight are progressing, and the
authorities are encouraging the entry of reputable international banks in the Armenian market.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent monetary and fiscal policies which, together
with ongoing structural reforms, have contributed to Armenia’s double-digit growth since 2002, low
inflation, and reduced unemployment and poverty. They welcomed the Armenian authorities’ strong
ownership of reforms and their successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility-supported program. In the context of continuing strong growth prospects, the main
challenges going forward will be to manage the macroeconomic impact of continued large capital
inflows, and to boost tax revenue to finance expenditure increases in infrastructure and social
services.
Directors welcomed the Central Bank of Armenia’s commitment to price stability and its cautious
monetary policy stance. They noted the authorities’ intention to revise upward the end-year inflation
targets for 2006 and 2007, but cautioned that frequent revisions should be avoided. Directors
underscored the importance of proper communication of inflation objectives to the public so as to
maintain the credibility of monetary policy in the transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting regime
over the medium term. They also underlined the importance of more effective policy coordination
between the monetary and fiscal authorities, particularly in the area of domestic debt issuance, in
order to ensure low inflation and a competitive exchange rate in the context of continued fiscal
prudence.
Directors supported the authorities’ maintenance of a flexible exchange rate regime, which has
contributed to price stability. They welcomed the central bank’s policy of limiting foreign exchange

3
market intervention to preventing undue volatility in the exchange rate, rather than targeting a
particular level or rate. In this context, Directors cautioned that resisting nominal appreciation
pressures could come at the expense of higher inflation, thereby possibly hurting the poor and
harming growth. They agreed that there is no clear evidence that the dram is currently overvalued,
and emphasized that competitiveness concerns are best addressed through forceful policies to raise
productivity, including by improving the business climate and spurring competition, which could also
support export diversification.
Directors welcomed the fiscal tightening in 2006, and viewed the 2007 budget as compatible with
macroeconomic stability. They underscored the importance of meeting the 2007 tax revenue target
to maintain a prudent fiscal stance, while raising expenditures on infrastructure and social services
in line with the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy. Directors underscored that progress in the
area of tax administration would also help to reduce the large size of the informal sector. On the
expenditure side, Directors believed that improving the capacity to efficiently absorb higher social
spending should be a priority. They encouraged the authorities to put in place a credible strategy to
phase out the gas subsidy by end-2008 to ensure full cost-recovery and reduce medium-term fiscal
risks. Noncommercial organizations should be closely monitored, as they account for a significant
part of public spending.
Directors considered that fiscal reforms remain key to sustaining growth and reducing poverty. They
commended the authorities for the reforms implemented in recent years, which have contributed to
the notable improvement in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Nevertheless, the ratio remains low by regional
standards. In this context, Directors recommended allowing tax holidays for foreign investors to
expire, expanding taxation in the construction sector, and improving the tax authorities’ ability to
check transactions and audit taxpayers. They also saw scope to increase expenditure efficiency by
strengthening internal audit and monitoring of service delivery.
Directors welcomed efforts to promote financial sector development. They observed that reforms to
foster financial intermediation and further strengthen financial sector regulation will improve bank
corporate governance, encourage competition between banks, and reduce the high lending-deposit
spreads, while also contributing to financial deepening and reducing dollarization. They also
considered that increased participation of reputable international first-tier banks would help in this
regard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 22, 2006

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under PRGF Arrangement for Armenia
and Approves US$4.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third review
of the Republic of Armenia’s economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement.
The completion of the review enables Armenia to draw an amount equivalent to
SDR 3.28 million (about US$4.9 million), which will bring total disbursements under the
arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 13.12 million (about US$19.5 million).
The Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on May 25, 2005 (see Press Release
No. 05/123) for a total amount equivalent to SDR 23 million (about US$34.3 million) to support
the government's economic program through 2008.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“Armenia’s economy continues to perform well under its PRGF-supported program. Prudent
fiscal and monetary policies, large external inflows, and ongoing structural reforms have
contributed to double-digit growth in a low inflation environment and to a sustained reduction in
poverty and unemployment. There has been impressive progress in the areas of fiscal and
financial sector reforms, including through improved tax administration, strengthened prudential
regulations and oversight of the financial sector, and improved corporate governance of banks.
Looking ahead, the focus of the authorities’ policy will be to manage the macroeconomic impact
of continued large capital inflows, and to boost tax revenue to finance expenditure increases in
infrastructure and social services.
“The authorities’ economic program for the remainder of 2006 and 2007 focuses on limiting
inflationary pressures, maintaining a flexible exchange rate arrangement, and improving tax
revenue performance. The draft 2007 budget is compatible with macroeconomic stability and
envisages a significant increase in tax revenues, which will be needed to finance priority
expenditures in infrastructure and social services.

-2-

“Continued fiscal and financial sector reforms remain key to sustaining growth and reducing
poverty. In the fiscal area, the authorities’ reform efforts will focus on broadening the tax base by
reducing exemptions and loopholes and on improving the predictability and efficiency of tax
administration. In the financial sector, reforms in the period ahead will focus on improving
corporate governance, strengthening regulation and supervision, and deepening financial
intermediation, including through the development of the nonbank financial sector,” Mr. Kato
said.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Republic of Armenia
and Lucian Croitoru, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 22, 2006

General
The Armenian authorities agree with the assessment of the staff report, which
accurately describes economic developments and the program implementation so far.
The authorities acknowledge that the report provides a realistic view of the policy challenges,
and broadly agree with staff recommendations. They also think that the program
conditionality is appropriate and are pleased that the program is on track, with all
performance criteria for end-June 2006 met.
Macroeconomic developments are sound. Prudent macroeconomic policies, strong
external inflows, and ongoing structural reforms supported GDP growth to 12.5 percent in
the first nine months of 2006. Growth was driven by the nontradables sector, particularly the
construction sector, which grew by 37 percent in real terms, compensating the decline in
industrial real output and a zero increase in the real agricultural output. Expecting continued
buoyant activity in the construction and services sectors, and recovery in industry, staff now
foresees real GDP growth at 11 percent in 2006 and 9 percent next year. Growth above
10 percent since 2001 allowed the headline poverty rate to decline by 21.5 percentage points
between 1999 and 2004, reaching 34.6 percent in 2004, and to substantially reduce extreme
poverty. The effect of strong domestic demand, including from the rapid growth of incomes,
on the current account deficit is expected to be limited, so that the current account is
projected just below 5 percent of GDP in 2006. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to
almost 6 percent in September on account of higher energy and food prices but is expected to
be 5 percent in December. Given increased inflationary pressures from both demand and
supply, and to partly compensate for its extensive unsterilized foreign exchange intervention
in the face of significant dram appreciation1, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) has raised
the repurchase rate three times, from 4 percent in July to 4.75 percent in October. In March
it also implemented operational changes in liquidity management by adopting the repo rate as
operational target and an interest rate corridor using standard facilities. Credit to the private
sector is still low by regional standards, but has grown rapidly in the recent past. Fiscal
performance remained sound in the first half of the year, with the deficit significantly smaller
than programmed, largely on account of strong revenue performance and lower current
expenditure.
Progress has been made in various areas of structural reform. Actions to
strengthen the tax and custom administration have been taken, including by developing a
2006-08 action plan for the State Tax Service (STS) on information technology and
acquisition, and by establishing a dedicated Risk Management Unit in the State Custom
Committee. In the energy sector, Armenergo’s balance sheet audit and its subsequent

liquidation have been completed. Overall collection rates in the water and irrigation sectors
have increased, and the Yerevan Water and Sewage Company has been leased to a joint stock
company created by a foreign operator. In the banking sector, preliminary steps have been
made to strengthen corporate governance by implementing guidelines for a consolidated
supervision framework for monitoring beneficiary owners beyond the licensing stage. A new
department within the Central Bank of Armenia has been created to improve supervision of
foreign exchange transactions.
Looking forward, the authorities remain committed to implementation of the
Fund-supported program. To sustain growth and further reduce poverty, and also to help
temper the negative effects of rapid real appreciation, the authorities will focus their
economic policy mix on macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, and investment in
infrastructure. With respect to structural reforms, the authorities acknowledge that although
progress has been made in strengthening tax and custom administration, further
improvements in this area and broadening the tax base remain the centerpiece of the fiscal
reform program. They also see the need for increased competition in the banking sector and
will concentrate on improving corporate governance, strengthening regulatory and
supervisory framework, and deepening financial intermediation, including by fostering the
development of the non-bank financial sector.
Fiscal policy
The authorities acknowledge that the main challenge for fiscal policy is to meet
additional infrastructure needs and other PRSP priorities, while maintaining a fiscal
stance consistent with low inflation and persistent capital inflows. Given the present
relatively low tax-to-GDP ratio, and in view of a foreseeable decline in donor support over
time, the authorities’ strategy to deal with the challenge is to increase revenue performance,
improve expenditure efficiency, and spend more in priority areas. This strategy is reflected in
the budgetary framework for 2007-09 by slightly higher deficits as compared with the last
years. However, the overall deficit (including grants) is expected to remain well below
3 percent.
The prospects to increase revenue are promising. Reflecting the results of past
fiscal reforms and also the higher-than-expected GDP growth, the tax-to GDP ratio is
estimated to increase by 0.4 percentage points this year. Additional measures to broaden the
tax base by reducing privileges and loopholes, and also further improvements in tax and
custom administration will allow tax revenue to increase by 1.0 percentage points of GDP in
2007.
To help tame inflationary pressures and alleviate real exchange rate pressures,
the authorities intend to use part of revenue overperformance to reduce the overall
fiscal deficit this year by 0.5 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent of GDP. At the same time,
they will revise upwards the overall expenditure target. A similar policy, with a balanced
mix between current and capital spending increases, will be implemented in 2007, when the
deficit will be contained roughly to the same level as a percent of GDP. However, in case of

3
revenue shortfalls, expenditure for the year will be reduced if revenue developments during
the first semester suggest that the 2007 deficit target otherwise cannot be met.
Monetary policy
The CBA remains committed to maintaining price stability. The authorities
acknowledge that the CBA’s limited potential to sterilize interventions in the foreign
exchange market added to inflationary pressures from both the demand and supply side, and
makes almost certain that the original end-year inflation target will be missed this year. To
avoid overly tightening the policy stance, which could trigger additional appreciation
pressures and jeopardize financial stability, the CBA has chosen to revise up the year-end
inflation target from 3 percent to 5 percent. However, the CBA stays ready to further increase
the policy interest rate should the new inflation target come under pressure or if needed to
secure reaching next year’s inflation target of 4 percent. In addition, the MOF and the CBA
will intensify their efforts to further develop the money market, which is crucial to further
strengthen monetary policy transmission. In 2007 the government intends to increase the
stock of treasury bills by AMD 8.5 billon to further develop the domestic government debt
market. The central bank also remains committed to a flexible exchange rate regime, limiting
its interventions in the foreign exchange market to reducing short-term volatility in the
exchange rate, without targeting a specific level or path.
Preparations to adopt an inflation targeting monetary policy framework over
the medium term continue. In addition to improving its new operational framework, the
CBA has started publishing quarterly inflation reports and the minutes of board meetings.
The central bank is developing a quarterly inflation projection model to be implemented in
the first half of 2007. In pursuing their effort to deepen financial intermediation, the
authorities look forward to receiving further technical assistance from the Fund.
Structural reforms
On the fiscal front reforms will be aimed at improving both the tax policy and
strengthening the tax administration, the latter accounting for the main part of the
lackluster revenue performance. With respect to tax policy, the focus will be to broaden
the tax base by reducing privileges and loopholes. In the short term this will be done mainly
by indexing the presumptive tax rates to the CPI and by changing the calculation of the
income tax basis from cash to accrual. In the medium term, a unified tax code will be
submitted to parliament by the end of 2007, the profit tax exemption for foreign investors
will be allowed to expire (in 2008), and exemptions for agriculture will be removed
(in 2009). The use of presumptive tax will be limited, including by bringing large-tax payers
in agriculture into the regular tax regime, and taxing dividends will be considered in
correlation with further development of the capital market. Regarding the tax administration,
the authorities acknowledge the need for a comprehensive modernization program. They will
focus on improving tax audit, tax arrears collection, and the VAT refund system. To this end,
a major improvement in tax administration will come from the establishment of an electronic

4
risk-based selection system for VAT cross checks, audits, and refunds, and of a unified
computer network linking all inspectorates of STS in 2007. Further progress will be made in
the area of budget monitoring and control by amending the law on noncommercial
organizations (NCOs) to clarify their definition and activities, and to separate the functions of
the management bodies, with a view to limiting the possibilities for converting public
enterprises into NCOs.
In the financial sector, the authorities’ reform efforts will continue to focus on
further strengthening the market infrastructure and the regulatory and legal
framework. After smoothly implementing the Law on Banks and Banking in 2006, the
authorities will submit amendments to the Law on Bank Secrecy to further improve bank
transparency and accountability. To reduce the size of the hidden economy, some measures
are under consideration to encourage non-cash transactions, including the acceptance of
credit card transaction receipts for tax verification purposes. Moreover, to increase monetary
policy effectiveness, the authorities will encourage dedollarization of the economy. To this
end, they will strengthen regulation and supervision of foreign exchange bureaus, limit their
operations to the provision of retail services to households, and strengthen the enforcement of
prohibition against foreign cash transactions in the retail sector.
Reform efforts will also focus on development of the non-bank financial sector and the
pension system. Concerning the latter, a pension framework law that outlines a
comprehensive overhaulof the pension system is currently under preparation. The new
system would increase the minimum pension, and would require those earning above a
certain limit to invest in private funds to secure their living standards after retirement. A new
Insurance Law, fully compliant with the standards of the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors, thus addressing shortcomings in the existing law, will be submitted to
parliament by the end of 2006. Before end-March 2007 the CBA also plans to submit to
parliament a new Security Market Regulations that corresponds to the standards of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions. The authorities have invited OMX to
advise on a plan to develop the Armenian capital market, including by transforming the
Armenian stock exchange into a joint stock company.
