COSTA RICA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Costa Rica
Approved by David J. Robinson and Martin J. Fetherston
January 30, 2008

Discussions. The discussions were held in San José during December 3–14. The
mission met with Minister of the Presidency Rodrigo Arias, Central Bank Governor
Francisco Gutiérrez, Minister of Finance Guillermo Zúñiga, Minister of Foreign Trade
Marco V. Ruiz, other senior public sector officials, parliamentarians, representatives of
the private sector, and think tanks.
Staff team. The mission comprised D. Desruelle (head), R. Cubero, O. Hendrick (all
WHD), and A. Thomas (PDR). A. Schipke (Regional Resident Representative)
assisted the team. R. Zandamela (MCM) and A. Umaña (OED) participated in the final
discussions.
Previous Article IV Consultation. In the last consultation, completed on
October 30, 2006, Executive Directors welcomed efforts to ratify and implement
CAFTA-DR and the decision to introduce a gradually widening exchange rate band.
They called for maintaining a prudent fiscal stance, adopting a broad tax reform, and
addressing remaining financial sector vulnerabilities. The authorities’ economic
policies have been consistent with these recommendations: over the last year, the
authorities have, inter alia, secured ratification of CAFTA-DR, made the exchange
regime more flexible, and reduced further the fiscal deficit.
Focus of the Consultation. In line with the 2007 surveillance decision, the
discussions centered on external stability and the level of the real effective exchange
rate, the authorities’ strategy for disinflation, the short-term fiscal stance and fiscal
reforms, and financial sector issues, based on the FSAP update.
2007 Surveillance Decision. The level of the real effective exchange rate and the
authorities’ exchange rate policies are consistent with the maintenance of external
stability.
Exchange Arrangement. Costa Rica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current account transactions. Costa Rica has had a crawling
band regime since October 2006.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The Costa Rican economy has grown at rapid rates in the last three years,
underpinned by a robust world expansion, sound economic policies, and strong business and
consumer confidence. Rising real incomes and well-targeted social transfers led to a sharp
fall in poverty in 2007. However, the domestic boom is leading to overheating pressures,
private sector credit is growing fast, and inflation is rising. Growth is expected to moderate
in 2008 to slightly below potential. The main risk to the 2008 outlook relates to the intensity
of the slowdown in the U.S. economy.
Challenges: Economic policies have been well oriented. The fiscal position has substantially
improved. Significant steps have been taken toward inflation targeting, though monetary
policy remains constrained by the exchange rate regime. The main short-term policy
challenges are to contain inflationary pressures and to maintain the reform momentum
following ongoing efforts to complete the CAFTA-DR implementation process.
Policy discussions
•

The exchange rate level and policies are consistent with the maintenance of
external stability. Medium-term projections show a sustainable current account
position; the exchange rate level is within its estimated equilibrium range; and the
dynamism of exports suggests that the exports sector remains competitive.

•

Staff and the authorities concurred that a monetary policy tightening and
greater exchange rate flexibility are needed to bring down inflation. An increase
in interest rates should be complemented by greater reliance on market-determined
interest rates as policy instruments, further progress toward greater exchange rate
flexibility, and a recapitalization of the central bank through a one-step transfer of
negotiable treasury securities.

•

Staff supports the neutral policy stance envisaged in the 2008 central
government budget and plans for a substantive tax reform. This fiscal stance
should help disinflation efforts. Continued caution is recommended in the execution
of current expenditure given potential demand pressures from long-delayed capital
spending by public enterprises. Passage of income tax and VAT reforms would allow
higher social and infrastructure spending while preserving a sound overall fiscal
stance.

•

The authorities should push ahead with financial system reforms. FSAP update
recommendations include passing the consolidated supervision bill, issuing
regulations to encourage banks to internalize fully foreign exchange risk and offer
hedging instruments, strengthening the supervisor’s capabilities and improving its
funding model, and revamping the bank intervention and resolution framework.

4

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The Costa Rican economy has continued to grow rapidly, and poverty has
fallen. Real GDP growth reached 8.7 percent in 2006, the highest rate this decade, and is
estimated to have been around 6.8 percent in 2007. This performance can be attributed to
high levels of business and consumer confidence, falling real interest rates, a boom in
construction, and still robust world growth. Soaring private domestic demand fueled growth
in service industries, such as construction and finance, while external demand boosted
manufactured good exports. Rising real incomes and an increase in social transfers pushed
the poverty rate down to a record low of 16.7 percent in 2007 (Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2).
2.

The economy is showing signs of overheating, and inflation has risen recently:

•

After a steady decline through August 2007 (y/y), headline inflation has increased
to 10.8 percent at end-2007, above the central bank’s goal of 8 percent. As in most
Central and South American countries, inflation has been fueled by external factors,
with oil and food price shocks contributing about two-fifths of headline inflation.1
Domestic pressures have also been at play in Costa Rica: core and nontradable
inflation bounced back in the last few months of 2007.

•

Private sector credit is growing fast. Credit to the private sector grew at 35 percent
(y/y) in September 2007, with credit to the construction and other service industries
rising the fastest. This rise in credit has been fueled by rising confidence and by
capital inflows that have pushed lending rates down by 800 basis points since
early 2006 and deposit rates to negative levels in real terms (Table 2 and Figure 3).

•

While domestic demand is booming, supply conditions are tight. Investment and
private consumption have accelerated, with consumer goods imports growing at
26 percent y/y in October 2007. Moreover, economic growth is above trend for a
third consecutive year; unemployment declined to 4.6 percent in 2007, its lowest
level since 1994; and there is anecdotal evidence of labor scarcity in some sectors.

3.
The current account deficit rose to 6 percent of GDP in 2007, but remains fully
financed by FDI inflows. Broad-based export growth and a moderation in free trade zone
imports led to a narrowing of the trade deficit despite the oil shock, but this was more than
offset by a sharp increase in direct investment income payments (Table 3 and Figure 4).
Meanwhile, FDI inflows are expected to reach over 7 percent of GDP in 2007, spurred by
investment in the tourism sector and real estate. Strong capital inflows have led to a
1

Hemisphere and Chapter 1 of the October 2007 World Economic Outlook.

5
continued rise in international reserves to more than US$4 billion in December 2007, double
their level two years earlier.
4.
Fiscal performance has been strong. Thanks to administrative measures and
economic growth, tax revenue grew by over 24 percent per year in the last two years, leading
to an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio of 1½ percentage points over that period (Table 4 and
Figure 6). Higher tax revenue and a lower debt service cost allowed for both higher spending
in priority areas and a reduction in the central government deficit to its lowest level in more
than a decade.2 As a result, public debt dropped from 56 percent of GDP in 2005 to an
estimated 45 percent of GDP by end-2007.
5.
Significant steps were taken in 2007 to make the exchange rate regime more
flexible, though monetary policy remains constrained by the need to defend the
crawling band.
•

The exchange rate band, introduced in October 2006, was widened twice, with a
view to creating more room for monetary policy action. The latest change took place
in November 2007, when the authorities reduced both the level of the band’s floor
(most appreciated end, by 4 percent) and its slope (to turn it negative). However,
persistent capital flows have kept the exchange rate almost continuously pegged to
the band’s floor, forcing the central bank to intervene. The exchange rate regime has
been classified by the Fund as a de facto crawling band.3

At the time of the mission, the 2007 central government deficit was projected to amount to 0.7 percent of GDP,
as shown in Tables 1 and 4. Preliminary revisions by the authorities suggest that the final outcome may have
been even better.

The Fund will review this classification in May/June 2008, taking into consideration the evolution of the
exchange rate in the year since May 2007.

6

•

The authorities lowered the policy interest rate twice during 2007 by 375 basis
points to the current 6 percent. The changes were intended to bring the policy rate—
the rate of a passive window on overnight deposits at the central bank—in line with
market trends, and to reduce capital inflows and the corresponding quasi-fiscal losses
from sterilized intervention.

6.
The recently completed FSAP update found a stronger and more diversified
financial system than in the past, but also highlighted remaining vulnerabilities.
Prudential indicators point to low levels of nonperforming loans and relatively healthy levels
of provisions, capital, and liquid assets (Table 5). Offshore banking operations have shrunk
in importance, though still account for 42 percent of private banks’ assets. Deposit and credit
dollarization have slowly fallen, to around 44 percent as of September 2007. However, the
banking system remains sensitive to interest rate, foreign exchange, and currency-induced
credit risks. So far, Costa Rica has weathered well the recent turbulence in global financial
markets, with capital inflows barely affected. Despite greater reliance on external credit
lines, the main source of funding for banks is domestic deposits: their net foreign assets are
small and positive, while the ratio of loans to deposits, though increasing, is still well below
one. Thus, banks’ high level of liquidity provides some cushion in the event of still tighter
global financial conditions. Information collected by the supervisory authorities has not
revealed direct exposure of the banking system to U.S. sub-prime instruments.
7.
CAFTA-DR was narrowly ratified in an October 7 referendum. The agreement,
however, does not come into effect for Costa Rica unless several implementation bills are
passed by congress. The legislative agenda will be dominated by these bills in the coming
months.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The outlook for 2008 is broadly favorable. Based on current global economic
projections, growth is expected to slow down gradually to about 5 percent by end-2008,
reflecting the downturn in the U.S., a moderation in the global economy, and an expected
tightening of domestic financial conditions. Consumer and business confidence, which was
boosted by the ratification of CAFTA-DR, is expected to remain high. Strong import
demand, coupled with higher oil prices, would keep the current account deficit at around
6 percent of GDP. Based on the current level of core inflation (8.7 percent), the latest
projections of international oil and food prices, and the authorities’ planned disinflation
policies, headline inflation could slow to about 8 percent.
9.
The main risk to the 2008 outlook relates to the intensity of the slowdown in the
U.S. economy. Given that the U.S. is Costa Rica’s main trading partner and its most
important source of FDI, a sharper deceleration in the U.S. would have a direct negative
impact on exports and investment, and would also affect exports to other regional partners.
Staff research suggests that a one percent cyclical fall in U.S. growth leads to a direct
contemporaneous decline of 0.9 percent in Costa Rica’s growth rate, and would also have

7
strong negative effects on growth in El Salvador and Honduras (figure below).4 On the other
hand, domestic activity and external demand from Panama, linked to the expansion of the
Panama Canal, could surprise on the upside. In turn, there is some evidence that continued
robust growth in Costa Rica could support growth in other Central American markets,
particularly through greater demand for labor in the construction and agro-industrial sectors
and ensuing higher remittances.

10.
Over the medium term, staff projects growth of around 5–5½ percent.5 Growth is
projected to be 5 percent between 2008–10, slightly below the country’s estimated potential
growth rate of 5.4 percent, which would allow the current output gap to close by 2010. The
current account deficit would fall to slightly below 6 percent of GDP over the medium term,
on account of a narrowing trade deficit relative to GDP and growing tourism receipts. The
current account deficit would be almost fully financed by FDI inflows, expected to remain at
around 5 percent of GDP. Under this scenario, public debt would gradually fall to about
37 percent of GDP by 2012, while external debt would stabilize at around 20 percent of
GDP. Looking beyond the next five years, the current account would be expected to narrow
on account of a sustained rise in exports of goods and services and current transfers, thanks

The medium-term projections are premised on the following assumptions: (i) full implementation of CAFTADR, and conclusion of other proposed trade negotiations; (ii) a moderate increase in public, social, and
infrastructure spending, and implementation of existing plans to reduce red tape; (iii) completion of the
transition to an inflation targeting framework; and (iv) a one-step recapitalization of the central bank. No tax
reform is assumed, given the uncertainty about its substance and timing, though a rise in tax revenue will be
needed to meet the authorities’ objectives in social and infrastructure spending (see Section III.B). The
projections reflect the fiscal impact of CAFTA-DR, which are estimated to be small (see Chapter III of Central
America: Global Integration and Regional Cooperation, IMF Occasional Paper 243, 2005).

8
in turn to current and projected FDI inflows. FDI indeed largely goes to the (broadly defined)
tradable sector, including manufacturing, upscale tourism projects, or housing for North
American “snowbirds”. In light of the authorities’ medium-term disinflation strategy,
inflation is expected to fall gradually to around 5 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in 2012,
which is consistent with cross-country experience on transitions to an IT regime.6

11.
The main risk to the medium-term outlook resides in domestic political
challenges. Complex legislative procedures may affect passage of further structural reforms,
including a substantive tax reform, which would negatively affect private and public
investment, exports, and growth. Furthermore, should financial sector reforms not be enacted
as currently envisaged, existing vulnerabilities, such as the still high level of foreign
exchange lending to unhedged borrowers, could eventually result in financial sector
difficulties.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Against this background and in line with the 2007 surveillance decision, the
discussions focused on:
•

External stability and the level of the real effective exchange rate;

•
The strategy for reducing inflation in the short term and progress in the transition to
inflation targeting;

6

For example, inflation in Colombia and Israel fell by an average of 5 percentage points to between 5 and
6 percent in the first 3 years following the introduction of IT.

9
•

The short-term fiscal stance and tax reforms; and

•
The recommendations of the recent FSAP update to strengthen financial supervision
and regulation.
A. External Stability and the Real Effective Exchange Rate
13.
Staff considers that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is close to
equilibrium. This conclusion, which is shared by the authorities, is based on the following
elements:
•

The net external position is projected to evolve in a manner consistent with
fundamentals. The current account deficit through 2012 is expected to be roughly at
its debt-stabilizing level. In addition, as indicated in paragraph 10, the increase in
nondebt liabilities arising from FDI inflows over the next five years would be
associated with greater export potential to service such liabilities.

•

Econometric analysis by staff indicates that the REER was below its equilibrium
value in 2007 (by about 6 percent), but well within the 95 percent confidence
interval for the equilibrium estimate. As shown in the figure below, the actual and
equilibrium REER have appreciated in parallel over the last few years. The
appreciation of the equilibrium REER was estimated to be mainly driven by an
increase in relative productivity and a decline in the net foreign liability position
relative to exports.

The export sector remains competitive, as evidenced by standard trade and
competitiveness indicators (Box 1 and Figure 5).

10
Box 1. External Competitiveness
•

The current account deficit has remained broadly unchanged relative to GDP since 2002. A
widening of the trade deficit, partly reflecting the oil price shock, has been offset by a steady and
significant increase in the services balance.

•

Export growth remains strong and broad-based. Exports are rising at above 15 percent in the
year to August. Both traditional (coffee, bananas, beef, sugar) and nontraditional exports (mainly
manufactured goods, pineapples, and melon) are doing well. Despite the rise of China, Costa Rica’s
share in global trade has remained broadly stable and its share in the U.S. market has recovered in
recent years. (The spike in trade shares in 1998–99 are explained by the operations of an Intel plant
in the country).

The country’s position in competitiveness rankings has improved, but remains affected by
red tape. Costa Rica ranks relatively high in the Global Competitiveness Index, reflecting its
traditional strengths (political stability, skilled workforce, relatively low corruption). However, the
country continues to do poorly in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report rankings, which focus
more narrowly on regulatory costs for starting and operating a business.

B. Disinflation
14.
The staff concurred with the authorities on the need for further action to bring
down inflation. Demand pressures, the impact on expectations of the recent increase in
inflation, and inertial factors underscore the need to take further steps to reduce inflation. The
measures to be considered over the next 12 months involve the choice of inflation objectives,
the setting of policy instruments, the evolution of the exchange rate regime, and the
recapitalization of the central bank.
15.
The disinflation effort should be anchored on feasible inflation objectives
for 2008 and 2009. Choosing a feasible inflation target, based on expected external shocks
and the effectiveness of available instruments, is important to consolidate central bank
credibility. Considering the uncertainty about global oil and food price shocks, and in line
with international experience, the mission recommended setting a target range, instead of a
point target.7
16.
The mission recommended tightening monetary policy in 2008 and introducing a
new policy instrument. The authorities should consider increasing the policy interest rate
progressively, so that it returns to positive real levels over the course of 2008. Raising
interest rates would help lower inflationary expectations, reduce overheating pressures, and
stem credit growth. The staff and the authorities agreed on the need to switch in the near term
the policy rate from a passive deposit rate to an active target rate (or range) on repurchase
operations in the inter-bank money market and, generally, to replace central bank deposit
facilities with reverse repos. This would enhance the ability of the central bank to affect
market liquidity, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the policy rate as a policy signal, and
contribute to the development of an efficient money market.
17.
The authorities and the mission agreed that greater reliance on marketdetermined interest rates as policy instruments and, generally, further progress toward
inflation targeting, will require more flexibility in the exchange rate regime. The timing
and nature of measures toward greater exchange rate flexibility would depend on exchange
rate developments and compliance with certain institutional requirements. Thus, it is
important to move rapidly with the issuance of regulations for currency risk hedging
instruments and the definition of transparent rules for exchange market intervention, and to
take determined action to strengthen the financial supervisor (SUGEF)’s ability to monitor
exchange and interest rate risks in the financial system.

7

Most IT countries use a range target as opposed to a point target. See Inflation Targeting in Practice. Strategic
and Operational Issues and Applications to Emerging Market Economies, IMF, 2000; and Implementing
Inflation Targeting, IMF WP/06/278, 2006.

12
18.
The mission welcomed the good progress made by the central bank in preparing
for IT. With Fund technical assistance, the central bank has strengthened its forecasting,
analytical, and communications framework, adapted its organizational structure, and taken
steps to prepare for the conduct of liquidity management operations.
19.
The mission concurs with the authorities on the need to recapitalize the central
bank to underpin the disinflation strategy, and recommends doing it through a one-step
stock operation. In 2007, taking advantage of a legal provision from the late 1990s, the
central government wrote off a portion of its deposits at the central bank for an amount equal
to 0.6 percent of GDP. The authorities intend to submit to congress a bill authorizing a
further recapitalization of the central bank which, under current plans, would aim to cover
the difference between the central bank’s losses and growth in base money demand. The
mission argued that a one-step transfer of negotiable securities from the treasury to the
central bank would have a more permanent impact on the bank’s financial position and, thus,
a stronger effect on inflationary expectations than period-by-period transfers.
C. Fiscal Policy
20.
The mission endorsed the policy stance envisaged in the 2008 central
government budget. The fiscal deficit entailed by the 2008 budget would match the
strong 2007 performance (as projected at the time of the mission). This stance would support
the authorities’ disinflation efforts and permit a further reduction in public debt. The space
generated by higher revenue and a lower interest bill is channeled in the budget to priority
areas such as the hiring of more teachers and policemen, a sustained increase in
noncontributive pensions and conditional cash transfers, and higher capital expenditure (table
below).8, 9
21.
The staff and the authorities concurred on the need for continued caution in the
execution of current expenditure. Despite a further decline in the interest bill, the overall
public sector deficit is projected to increase in 2008 by over 1 percent of GDP.10 This reflects
an increase in long-delayed capital spending, particularly on telecommunications and energy

8

The budget envisages a moderate increase in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, spurred by strong growth in
direct taxes (Table 4). This is consistent with staff research, which points to a high income elasticity of direct
taxes. In addition, administrative measures to be put in place in 2008 are expected to boost income tax
collection, particularly from self-employed professionals.

9

The increase in pension spending in 2008 reflects a legally-mandated, one-off adjustment of payments under
special public sector pension regimes, to bring them in line with past increases in real wages.

10

The interest bill is expected to fall even in the event of a substantial monetary policy tightening given the
sharp reduction of the debt stock.

infrastructure, which is essential to boost the country’s growth potential.11 To avoid any
additional demand pressure, there was agreement that execution of current noninterest
expenditure should be prudent to ensure that the deficit objective be met even if revenue
were to fall short of projections. Staff and the authorities also agreed that any revenue in
excess of budget projections should be saved, as was done in 2007. The mission endorsed the
authorities’ prudent attitude to raising inertial components of current spending, such as
public employment and wages, given the nonnegligible contribution of the economic cycle to
tax revenue (Box 2).
22.
The mission strongly supported the authorities’ plan to pursue tax reforms
in 2008. These reforms are required to finance a substantial increase in public infrastructure
(e.g., roads) and well-targeted social spending (e.g., conditional cash transfers), which would
in turn boost growth, reduce poverty, and improve income distribution. The mission
encouraged the authorities to prioritize passage of bills to widen the bases of the income tax
and the sales tax, and turn the latter into a VAT. In meetings with various stakeholders, the
staff stressed that such a tax and spending reform package would not only be efficient (from
a tax perspective) but also clearly progressive.12
11

This planned increase in public investment is consistent with the recommendations of the Pilot II Country
Study on Public Enterprises and Fiscal Risk, which concluded that ICE, the energy and telecommunications
SOE, did not currently pose large fiscal risks and could be excluded from fiscal indicators (see Section IV of
IMF Country Report No. 06/416.

Box 2. Recent Tax Revenue Growth: Structural vs. Cyclical
The tax to GDP ratio has increased substantially in recent years. Without any legal reforms, the ratio went
up from 13.6 percent in 2005 to a projected 15.1 percent in 2007. Econometric analysis by staff suggests
that the rise in the tax ratio can be attributed to two main causes:
a) The economic expansion. With an estimated long-run income elasticity of total tax revenue of about
1.1, the tax ratio increases as GDP grows. In turn, this growth contribution can be broken down into
structural and cyclical components, depending on whether output is below or above its potential level.
b) An improvement in tax administration and, in particular, the gradual implementation since 2005 of an
automated customs reporting system (TICA) that allows for cross-controls between different types of
taxes. Other unobserved factors, such as a change in tax compliance behaviour, may also be at work.

Source: Fund staff estimates, based on data from the authorities.

Staff research indicates that, of the total tax ratio as of the third quarter of 2007, TICA contributes about
0.8 percent of GDP, while the economic cycle (the output gap) contributes about 0.4 percent of GDP. The
rest is accounted for by potential output and a residual. Evidence for other Latin American countries
indicates that the contribution of the cycle to noncommodity revenues is generally smaller than at present
in Costa Rica, either because income elasticities of tax revenues are close to one, or because the output
gap is narrow even when the long-run elasticity is well above unity (as in El Salvador and Peru).

23.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to develop a medium-term
budget framework, and encouraged them to reduce spending rigidities. The introduction
of multi-year scenarios in the 2008 budget process is a positive first step. A move to a fullfledged medium-term budget framework would help link policy objectives, spending
priorities, and revenue needs, as well as reduce pressures to use revenue earmarking.13 The
mission also encouraged the authorities to follow up on the key recommendations in the 2007
fiscal ROSC.14

13

At its latest meeting in San José, Costa Rica, the Committee of Finance Ministers of Central America,
Panama, and the Dominican Republic discussed how best to work on this issue in the region, with technical
assistance from the Fund and other multilateral institutions.

Country Report No. 07/372.

15
D. Financial Sector
24.
The authorities broadly agreed with the main recommendations on the financial
system by the FSAP update and the Article IV mission, namely:
•

Adopting the consolidated supervision bill, which would provide supervisors with
legal powers to conduct effective consolidated supervision of financial groups and
their offshore subsidiaries, strengthen the legal protection of supervisors, and harden
the sanctions regime for regulatory noncompliance.15 Passage of this bill would
improve Costa Rica’s compliance with a large number of Basel core principles of
financial supervision and regulation.

•

Modifying the prudential regulatory framework so that banks properly internalize
foreign exchange risk, by (i) applying higher risk-weight ratios for capital adequacy
purposes to unhedged foreign currency borrowers; (ii) broadening the base of reserve
requirements to include short-term foreign-currency lines of credit; and
(iii) facilitating financial intermediaries’ operations with hedging instruments under
an adequate prudential regulatory and supervisory framework.

•

Changing the funding arrangements for financial supervision, so that the
supervisory entity (SUGEF) is mostly financed by the supervised institutions. This
would enhance SUGEF’s financial and operational autonomy, and enable it to cope
with the challenges posed by the growing complexity of the financial system.

•

Improving the bank resolution framework by: (i) revamping the prompt corrective
action system, separating the triggers for corrective action from the CAMELS-based
bank assessment criteria for supervision; and (ii) granting SUGEF more legal powers
to intervene and resolve problem banks, including by allowing it to conduct partial
asset transfers to other financial intermediaries, and to require the removal, if needed,
of directors and the internal auditor of intervened public banks.

25.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ current actions and plans to strengthen the
financial system, which would constitute important initial steps in implementing the
above recommendations. These include: (i) efforts to encourage private financial groups to
terminate offshore operations, as well as initiatives to reduce tax and regulatory incentives
for their existence; (ii) seeking passage in 2008 of the consolidated supervision bill; (iii)
issuance of regulations enabling financial institutions to deal with currency risk-hedging
instruments; (iv) plans to strengthen SUGEF’s capabilities to conduct risk-based supervision,

with Fund technical assistance; and (v) strengthening the financial reporting regime of the
supervised entities.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The near-term prospects for the Costa Rican economy remain favorable, but
could be affected by external developments. Buttressed by sound policies and favorable
domestic sentiment while likely to feel the impact of the U.S. slowdown, the economy is set
to expand at a still solid but more moderate pace. The main risk for the short-term outlook
relates to the intensity of the slowdown in the U.S. economy.
27.
The authorities’ main challenges are to bring down inflation and to complete
their well-focused reform agenda. Reform priorities include full implementation of
CAFTA-DR; completing the transition to inflation targeting; passage of a substantial tax
reform; and strengthening of financial regulation and supervision. These reforms would
allow the economy to remain on a high growth path, continue to reduce poverty, and enhance
macroeconomic resilience.
28.
Monetary policy needs to be tightened in the near term. Domestic demand
pressures, the lagged effects of external price shocks, and stubbornly high inflationary
expectations are stoking inflation. To counteract this, short-term interest rates should be
raised gradually to positive real levels. Adopting the overnight money market rate as the
central bank’s intermediate policy target should also be considered.
29.
The authorities and the staff agree that decisive progress toward the adoption of
a full-fledged inflation targeting regime should be made in the next 18 months. The staff
welcomes the steps already taken by the central bank to make the exchange rate regime more
flexible, but notes that more will need to be done to enhance the central bank’s ability to
bring inflation gradually down to low single digits. In this context, it is important to make
rapid progress on the issuance of derivative regulations, the definition of rules for forex
market intervention, and enhanced supervision of exchange risks in the financial system.
Staff welcomes the partial recapitalization of the central bank conducted in 2007, and
recommends that a more permanent recapitalization be pursued through a one-off transfer of
negotiable securities.
30.
The level of the real effective exchange rate and the authorities’ exchange rate
policies are consistent with the maintenance of external stability. Medium-term
projections show a sustainable current account position; the exchange rate level is within its
estimated equilibrium range; and the dynamism of exports suggests that the exports sector
remains competitive.
31.
Staff supports the fiscal stance envisaged in the 2008 budget and the authorities’
plans for a substantive tax reform. The roughly neutral fiscal position envisaged in
the 2008 budget should help disinflation efforts, though continued caution is recommended
in the execution of current expenditure. Passage of income tax and VAT reforms would

17
allow higher social and infrastructure spending while preserving a sound overall fiscal
stance. Staff welcomes the authorities’ interest in developing a medium-term budget
framework.
32.
The authorities should press ahead with reforms to strengthen financial system
supervision. Approval of the consolidated supervision bill should remain a priority. The staff
welcomes ongoing efforts by the authorities to reduce incentives for offshore banking, and
encourages them to introduce regulations to ensure that banks fully internalize foreign
exchange risk. Further reforms should be passed to allow for full financing of SUGEF by the
supervised entities, and for an improved bank intervention and resolution framework.
33.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
COSTA RICA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by David J. Robinson and Adnan Mazarei
February 13, 2008

1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since
the release of the staff report.
2.
Recent information confirms that fiscal performance was strong in 2007 and
that inflation remains high.
•

According to the latest though still preliminary figures, the central government posted
a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2007, its best performance since the mid-1950s,
while the overall public sector closed with a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP.

•

Headline inflation fell slightly from 10.8 percent (year-on-year) in December 2007 to
10.6 percent in January 2008, helped by a fall in transportation and clothing prices.
Core inflation also moderated a bit to 8.5 percent. Inflation expectations for the
12 months ahead rose to 9.4 percent in January, compared to 9.1 percent in
December.

•

Progress has been made in passing CAFTA-DR implementation bills, but fewer than
half of the 12 bills have been approved as of now. The government will ask other
signatory countries for an extension of the end-February deadline.

3.

Growth prospects for 2008 are somewhat weaker than previously expected.

•

In its 2008–09 macroeconomic framework released on January 31, the central bank
forecast a 3.8 percent real GDP growth for 2008.

2
•

Staff also revised down its 2008 growth projections from 5 to 4.5 percent. This takes
into account the recent revision to the U.S. outlook but also the continued boom in
production for the local market. The monthly index of economic activity (IMAE)
showed a slight upward trend in the fourth quarter of 2007 to a growth rate of
7.0 percent (year-on-year)

4.
On January 31, 2008, the central bank announced its inflation objectives
for 2008–09 and reduced substantially the interest rates on its deposit facilities.
•

Mid-point inflation objectives for 2008 and 2009 were set at 8 and 6 percent
respectively, with a range of ±1 percent around these figures.

•

Interest rates on the central bank’s one-night deposit facility were cut from 6 to
3½ percent. Rates on other deposit facilities were similarly reduced.

•

In the first days following this central bank decision, commercial bank deposit rates
fell by 180 basis points to 5.2 percent, while the rate on six-month sovereign bills
came down from 6.4 percent to 4.8 percent.

•

The exchange rate has remained at the floor of the crawling band (the most
appreciated side).

5.
The authorities emphasized that an interest rate cut was necessary given rapidly
increasing foreign inflows, which could undermine their disinflation strategy.
•

This interest rate cut took place following high levels of foreign exchange
intervention: during the first four weeks of January, the central bank bought
US$422 million (2.9 percent of GDP), the highest level since the exchange rate band
was introduced in October 2006. In the authorities’ views, this was due to two recent
and mutually reinforcing developments, the successive reductions in the U.S. Fed
funds rate to 3 percent and increased expectations of a colon appreciation, which
greatly widened yield differentials between domestic and foreign currency
instruments. This compounded the underlying pressure from sustained large FDI
inflows into manufacturing, tourism, and real estate.

•

In the authorities’ view, if left unaddressed, this situation would have undermined
their disinflation strategy, given the public perception that high levels of foreign
exchange intervention translate into an inability to control monetary creation and
inflation. Furthermore, in an environment where the central bank’s quasi-fiscal losses
continue to affect monetary conditions, the central bank saw a trade-off between the
monetary impact of quasi-fiscal losses from sterilized intervention and the potential
impact of lower interest rates.

6.
While the thrust of the staff appraisal is unchanged, the staff is concerned about
the inflationary impact of this interest rate cut, especially given the context of still high
inflation, rapid private sector credit growth, and a tight labor market.
•

The reduction in interest rates will create additional pressures on nontradable
inflation, which, absent further macroeconomic policy adjustments, may push it up to
levels inconsistent with the achievement of the 2008 headline inflation target.

•

The authorities and staff agree that fiscal policy is key to containing demand
pressures under the current monetary and exchange rate framework. In this period,
staff recommends that the central government’s fiscal position should at a minimum
be as strong as the 2007 outcome, which implies a tightening of around 1 percent of
GDP on an annual basis compared to the 2008 budget to be done through expenditure
reductions, and every effort should be made to achieve an even stronger outcome.

•

In addition, the authorities and staff also agree that there is greater urgency to move
toward a regime that would allow greater exchange rate flexibility and the use of
interest rates to bring down inflation. To that end, priority actions include the
issuance of regulations for foreign exchange derivative instruments, the application of
stricter regulatory standards for foreign currency lending to nonforeign-currencyearners, the introduction of liquidity requirements on short-term foreign-currency
lines of credit, and further recapitalization of the central bank.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 10, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Costa Rica
On February 15, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Costa Rica.1
Background
Since the last Article IV Consultation, Costa Rica’s economy has continued to grow rapidly.
Real GDP grew by 8.8 percent in 2006, and economic activity remained strong in 2007 driven
by both domestic and external demand. Early estimates suggest that, for the year as a whole,
growth was close to 7 percent. Unemployment declined to 4.6 percent, the lowest level since
1994.
Inflation steadily declined between late 2006 and mid-2007, thanks in part to the October 2006
switch to a crawling band regime and the subsequent widening of the exchange rate band.
However, inflation rebounded in the second half of 2007, partly because of sharp rises in
international oil and food prices, and ended at 10.8 percent in December 2007.
The current account deficit widened to 6.0 percent in 2007, driven by a surge in nonresident
income on foreign direct investment. Both exports and imports grew strongly during the year.
The current account was more than fully financed by foreign direct investment inflows. Net
international reserves reached a historical high of over US$4 billion in December 2007.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Public finances continued to improve in 2007. According to the latest preliminary figures, the
central government closed with a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP, the best performance since
1957, while the overall public sector posted a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP. In parallel, public
debt fell to about 43 percent of GDP at end-2007. These results stemmed mainly from strong
revenue growth due to administrative measures and the economic expansion.
Monetary aggregates have kept expanding rapidly. Private sector credit has been growing at
over 30 percent (y/y) in 2007, fueled by a construction sector boom and strong consumption
demand. Driven in part by sustained capital inflows, lending rates declined sharply, and deposit
rates became negative in real terms.
The financial system has become stronger and more diversified, though important vulnerabilities
remain. Judging by traditional prudential indicators, banks appear well capitalized, profitable,
and highly liquid. Recent acquisitions of domestic private banks by large foreign banks have
intensified the process of consolidation in the sector. Vulnerabilities include high dollarization of
assets and liabilities, and still large offshore banking activities.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for the strong performance of the Costa Rican economy
in 2007, reflecting the continued implementation of sound economic policies. Directors
welcomed the ratification of the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade
Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and the reduction in the poverty rate to a historical low. The near-term
prospects for the Costa Rican economy remain favorable, based on robust domestic demand.
At the same time, Directors stressed the need to be vigilant to downside risks, mainly related to
the intensity of the slowdown in the U.S. economy.
Directors considered that the main policy challenges will be to lower inflation and take forward
the authorities’ well-focused structural reform agenda. Reform priorities include fully
implementing CAFTA-DR, completing the transition to inflation targeting, passing legislation for
a substantial tax reform, and strengthening financial regulation and supervision.
Directors praised the authorities for their impressive fiscal performance, which resulted from
effective tax administration efforts and tight control of nonpriority spending. This policy has also
contributed to a substantial reduction in public debt. Looking ahead, Directors considered that a
prudent fiscal policy will be key to containing demand pressures. They encouraged the
authorities to maintain the fiscal stance achieved in 2007—or even improve on it—to support
the disinflation objective. Directors supported the authorities’ plans for a substantial tax reform,
which would permit higher spending in priority areas―including social and infrastructure
spending―while preserving a sound overall fiscal stance. They welcomed the authorities’
interest in developing a full-fledged medium-term budget framework.
Directors welcomed the steps already taken by the central bank toward greater exchange rate
flexibility in the context of a gradual transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting framework.

3
They acknowledged the constraints on monetary policy imposed by continued large capital
inflows under the current crawling band exchange rate regime, the appreciation pressures on
the colón, and falling U.S. dollar interest rates. However, most Directors stressed that the recent
substantial cut in interest rates—which has made interest rates even more negative in real
terms—could give further impetus to the already robust level of aggregate demand, and
compromise efforts to reduce inflation and subdue inflationary expectations. These Directors
encouraged the authorities to put in place institutional conditions for greater exchange rate
flexibility, including the adoption of regulations for hedging instruments, which would permit a
needed monetary policy tightening. A few other Directors cautioned that raising interest rates
could trigger further capital inflows and increase the pressure on the exchange rate.
Directors welcomed the initial step taken in 2007 to recapitalize the central bank, and called for
a permanent recapitalization through a one-step stock operation that would also underpin the
disinflation strategy.
Directors observed that the current account position is projected to be sustainable over the
medium term, and that the real effective exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals
and within the margins of the staff’s estimated equilibrium range. The good performance of
nontraditional exports and the diversification of export products and markets suggest that
competitiveness is being maintained.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of the financial sector. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities
remain, including risks associated with the relatively high level of dollarization and the lack of
effective consolidated supervision of financial groups. Directors called on the authorities to
move expeditiously to implement the remaining recommendations of the FSAP update. They
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the approval of the consolidated supervision bill
and with the introduction of regulations to ensure that banks fully internalize foreign exchange
risks. They supported reforms to change the funding arrangements for financial supervision and
improve the bank resolution framework.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Costa Rica is also available.

Statement by José Rojas, Executive Director for Costa Rica
and Alvaro Umaña, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 15, 2008
On behalf of the Costa Rican authorities we would like to convey our deep appreciation to
the IMF staff and management for the constructive policy dialogue and valuable technical
assistance that were provided by the Fund during last year. The discussions of the Article IV
consultations were held in the first half of December of 2007. Since then, important decisions
taken by the Federal Reserve of the United States, Costa Rica’s main economic partner, have
had a significant impact on capital inflows and this has required policy responses by the
authorities that were not foreseen at the time of the Article IV discussions.
The authorities agree with staff that sound economic policies, as well as strong business and
consumer confidence have allowed Costa Rica to benefit from world economic expansion
and grow at its highest rate for a decade. During 2006 and 2007, the economy grew by 8.8
and 6.8 percent, respectively, while unemployment decreased to 4.6 percent, the lowest in a
decade. Real wages and incomes rose significantly to levels above the Latin American
average and poverty was reduced to a record low of 16.7 percent. This was achieved through
economic growth and well targeted social transfers, including pensions and subsidies to poor
families with children enrolled in secondary school. Inequality remains the lowest in Central
America and well below the Latin American average. Costa Rica ranks well in the Human
Development Index and life expectancy at birth has reached 79 years, a level comparable to
developed nations.
Growth has been fueled by both internal demand and net exports, which are well diversified
in terms of composition and destination, although the United States is by far its most
important trading partner and source of FDI. Tourism continued its upward trend, and
domestic demand in services such as construction and finance supported growth, in addition
to strong external demand in agro industrial goods and electronics. The economic slowdown
in the US is expected to generate an almost one-to-one decrease in Costa Rica’s growth rate.
The authorities agree with the staff that this slowdown in the US economy is the most
important short-term risk.
The economy has been growing beyond its potential during the last two years and inflation
rose above 10 percent in 2007. External factors such as rising food and fuel prices were
significant in this increase but domestic factors also contributed. Private sector credit grew
considerably and foreign direct investment (FDI) continued its upward trend, surpassing
7 percent of GDP in 2007. Although the current account deficit rose in 2007, it remains fully
financed by FDI flows. International reserves have more than doubled during the last two
years and presently stand at close to $4.5 billion.

2
Fiscal performance has been particularly strong in 2007 and tax revenues rose by over
25 percent in the last two years. The central government generated a surplus for the first time
in fifty years. Public debt has dropped considerably and is expected to continue in this
downward trend over the medium-term, reaching 37 percent in 2012. Given that the fiscal
performance was even stronger than expected, as explained in the staff report’s supplement,
the authorities agree with the need to maintain a responsible fiscal policy in 2008. A
substantive tax reform, including income tax and VAT will be pursued by the government
during 2008. Also, a medium-term budget framework is being introduced this year.
We agree with the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate and exchange rate
policies are consistent with external stability. Costa Rica has been moving towards a more
flexible exchange rate system since 2006 when an exchange rate band was introduced. In the
medium-term the country is moving to an inflation targeting regime. In 2007 the exchange
rate band was widened twice, but capital inflows have continued to keep the exchange rate
pegged to the band’s floor and forcing the central bank to intervene.
The authorities are committed to move to an inflation targeting regime, but they recognize
the existence of several prerequisites that need to be met before the central bank can do it.
These include, among others, adoption of derivative regulations, hedging instruments, rules
for forex market intervention and enhanced supervision of risks in the financial system. In
the short term, given the current exchange rate regime, the quasi-fiscal problem of the central
bank and the recent decision by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, the possibility of
monetary tightening is limited.
The authorities agree with the outlook for 2008 and the medium-term. Growth is expected to
be under 5 percent with an inflation target of 8 percent, and growth will remain near that
level until 2010, while inflation decreases to 6 percent in 2009 and below that level in 2010.
The current account deficit is expected to fall below 6 percent and FDI levels inflows are
expected to remain near 5 percent of GDP
The authorities agree that the financial system has become stronger and more diversified and
will move to start implementing the recommendations of the recently completed FSAP,
some of which require legislative approval, like passage of a consolidated supervision bill.
Other remaining tasks include issuing regulations to encourage banks to fully internalize
foreign exchange risks and offer hedging instruments, providing the supervisor (SUGEF)
with the capabilities and funding to take carry out the expanded responsibilities, and
revamping the bank intervention and resolution framework.
The medium-term risks are associated with the passage of structural reforms and key
legislation including substantive tax reform and financial sector reform. Efforts to increase
competitiveness and reduce red tape are also important. CAFTA was approved by the first
referendum in Costa Rica’s history in October of 2007, but some of the legislation required

3
to implement CAFTA is still under discussion in Congress. The legislation under discussion
includes, among others, new laws opening the insurance and telecommunications sectors. It
is expected that the Executive will request an extension from CAFTA signatories before the
deadline expires on February 29, 2008. After approval of CAFTA related legislation, the
government intends to seek a program of capitalization of the central bank.
