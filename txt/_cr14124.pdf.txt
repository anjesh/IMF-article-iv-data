STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 23, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Reviving Growth. Croatia remains stuck in an unusually drawn out recession, with real
GDP contracting for the 5th consecutive year in 2013. Domestic demand is depressed
as corporations and households struggle with excessive debts accumulated in the
2000s. Exports and FDI are also weak, reflecting poor trading partner growth and
structural weaknesses. With traditional fiscal and monetary policy responses out of
reach (see below), private sector debt restructuring and measures to attract FDI
provide the best prospect to revive growth in the short to medium term. Further, labor
market reforms are critical to strengthen the economy’s capacity to adapt to external
conditions.
Restoring Fiscal Sustainability. High fiscal deficits, rapidly increasing public debt and
elevated risk spreads demand sustained fiscal consolidation. Adjustment should be
stretched over several years, with an emphasis on low multiplier measures—including
on the revenue side–during the early phase of consolidation.
Safeguarding Monetary and Financial Stability. Monetary policy aims at stability of
the kuna-euro exchange, to prevent that a depreciation trigger a contractionary
revaluation of FX-indexed debts. The central bank has defended the arrangement with
limited but effective instruments, notably FX liquidity and required reserves regulation.
The banking system has remained stable in spite of the protracted recession, owing in
large measure to the central bank’s aggressive capitalization policy.
Previous Staff Advice. Since the 2012 Article IV consultation, the authorities have
made progress with reforms to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for
investments and to enhance the labor market’s adaptive capacity. Fiscal policy slipped
in 2013, but a renewed effort at consolidation has been made recently with a revised
2014 budget. The 2014 effort remains to be integrated into a coherent, multi-year
strategy.

BACKGROUND
A. The Setting
1.
Croatia remains stuck in an unusually drawn out
recession (Tables 1–4, Figures 1–4). In 2013, real GDP contracted
for the 5th consecutive year, and stands now at less than
90 percent of the end-2008 level. Unemployment has risen to
17 percent. Domestic demand remains depressed as corporations
and households focus on reducing excess debt levels
accumulated in the 2000s; a task that is being complicated by the
re-emergence of deflation in early 2014. Exports and FDI are also
feeble, reflecting deep-seated structural weaknesses and poor
trading partner growth. Macro-policies that could revive growth
rapidly are beyond reach: fiscal policy has run out of space (see
below), while monetary policy is constrained by the need to keep
the kuna-euro exchange rate stable, lest a depreciation cause a
revaluation of euro-indexed debts.
2.
The recession is putting pressure on the public
finances. In 2013 the deficit (cash basis) widened to around
5½ percent of GDP, owing to weak revenues and the assumption
of debts and arrears from state-owned enterprises. Public debt
now exceeds 60 percent of GDP and is increasing rapidly.
Reflecting these developments, all major rating agencies have
downgraded Croatia to sub-investment grade.

The government has started tackling long-standing
structural issues, with many measures in line with previous IMF
advice (Appendix I). Steps include the restructuring and/or
privatization of state-owned enterprises, passage of laws that
facilitate investments, the introduction of an out-of-court
settlement procedure for insolvent corporations, the reduction of
work force restructuring costs, and the easing of hiring
restrictions.

should eventually be able to benefit from substantial EU structural funds, EU membership fees have

Real GDP contracted by one percent in 2013, owing to

policy uncertainty weighed on investment and
consumption. Despite a good tourist season, exports
were also weak, reflecting feeble trading partner growth
and the restructuring of the shipbuilding industry.

The debt overhang that accumulated in the mid- to
late 2000s continues to weigh on demand. Corporations have
reduced debt levels somewhat from the peak reached in 2010,
amid a sharp decline in private investment. Household debt has
also started to recede, and some households have accumulated
substantial assets, notably bank deposits. Amid high
unemployment, private consumption has remained feeble,

Weak FDI owes much to a poor business environment, as
evidenced by Croatia’s chronically low ratings in business
climate surveys. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a large
part of the problem is with ineffective government at the
municipal level. Large state-owned enterprises (SOE)—a
legacy issue of Yugoslavian times—also hamper
investment and productivity growth, and leave Croatia
with an outdated infrastructure in sectors such as rail
transport. As a result, Croatia has thus far been unable

Exports: Sub-par export performance owes in large part
to weak trading partner growth, as three out of four of
Croatia’s main trading partners—Italy, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and Slovenia—went through economic
difficulties of their own in recent years (Appendix III).
Difficulties have been exacerbated by export industries in
structural decline, such as ship building. The quasi-peg to
the euro and a rigid labor market—preventing adjustment
of unit labor cost through wages—have stood in the way
of a rapid price response to these shocks. Staff estimates
that the REER is overvalued by about 10 percent, based
on a cross-country comparison of unit labor cost (Box 3).

to take advantage of its unique geographic location: at the
sea and yet close to Central European markets.


As regards longer-term obstacles to growth, low labor
market participation—the second lowest in the EU after
Greece—stands out (Appendix IV). A plethora of factors—
including generous early retirement schemes, work
disincentives from poorly targeted benefits, and skill
mismatches—contribute to this outcome. The low
employment ratio puts pressure on pension systems, even
though replacement rates are not particularly high.

11.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s diagnostic, although the central bank argued that
household balance sheets had strengthened enough to support a recovery. It saw the core of the
problem in weak investment. The authorities also agreed that Croatia’s economy continues to face
considerable competitiveness challenges.
12.
There was agreement that standard macro-policy responses to weak demand are out
of reach.


Monetary policy is constrained by the use of the kuna-euro exchange rate as nominal
anchor. The central bank argued forcefully that the quasi-peg needs to be maintained, as the
contractionary impulse of a revaluation of FX-indexed debts and its impact on the financial
system would far outweigh any stimulus from depreciation on the (relatively small) tradable
sector. It also pointed to experiences in the 1990s, when devaluations had harmed financial
stability without sustained improvements in competitiveness. Staff agreed that large
exchange rate fluctuations are undesirable, but noted that exchange rate rigidity increased
the pressure on structural and wage policies to adjust.1



Fiscal policy space is exhausted—the challenge ahead is to advance fiscal consolidation
without unduly harming growth (see below).

13.
The authorities and staff agreed that private debt restructuring was the main available
tool to accelerate a recovery in domestic demand. The authorities pointed to the pre-bankruptcy
settlement procedure introduced in 2012 to speed up the restructuring of corporate debt, and
argued that after some early difficulties, the procedure was working smoothly. Thus far, it has
allowed writing off of corporate debts of 2 percent of GDP (Appendix V). Staff agreed that the prebankruptcy procedure was a useful tool, and suggested a similar mechanism for private households,
1

With three quarters of corporate debt denominated in or linked to foreign currency, and corporate non-equity
liabilities already exceeding 130 percent of GDP, a sizeable devaluation would reinforce the sector’s debt overhang,
curtailing further domestic demand (a similar argument applies to households, although arguably to a lesser degree
as debt levels are lower and some households are hedged due to sizeable FX deposits). There would also be knockon effects on the financial sector, and a difficult-to-quantify impact on confidence from abandoning Croatia’s longstanding monetary anchor. At the same time, with Croatia’s goods exports accounting for only 15 percent of GDP, a
relatively small portion of the economy would immediately benefit from better competitiveness.

while being mindful of fair burden sharing between creditors and debtors. The authorities explained
that they are working on a personal bankruptcy regime for implementation later in 2014.
14.
Staff commended the authorities for substantial progress with growth enhancing
structural reforms. Many of these have been taken in the context of a World Bank Development
Loan (DPL).


A strategic investment law enacted in late 2013 and accompanying regulatory measures
remove administrative hurdles at the local level and shift responsibility to the central
government. Further, an investment promotion law improves investment incentives. The
authorities noted that these reforms were already having an impact, pointing to a pipeline of
projects—mostly prepared by non-resident investors—that were expected to materialize the
latest from 2015. Staff argued that additional steps to strengthen the investment climate
should include swift implementation of judicial reform and further restructuring of stateowned enterprises (see below).



A labor market reform currently in front of the assembly would lower the cost of work
force restructuring and enhance working hour flexibility. According to World Bank
computations, the reform—together with legislation enacted earlier in 2013 to ease hiring
restrictions—would place Croatia in the mid-range of the OECD’s employment protection
ranking, from displaying one of the highest levels of rigidity in 2011. The authorities and
staff agreed that the reform is critical to enhance the economy’s ability to adapt to external
conditions, although it would arguably take some time until benefits materialize in terms of
higher growth and employment. 2



A welfare reform enacted in December 2013 merged several social benefits administrated
by the Ministry of Youth and Social Welfare, and capped total benefit receipt at the gross
minimum wage. Staff argued that the reform could only be a first step to reduce
disincentives to work from the design of benefit schemes. Further measures were needed,
such as eliminating overlap of transfers granted by the central and local governments, and
extending means-testing to other programs, including for war veterans. More progress was
also called for in reducing incentives for early retirement.

B. Regaining Control over Fiscal Policy
Diagnostic
15.
Attempts to control the fiscal deficit have been frustrated by the recession and costly
initiatives to support the economy. After a good attempt at consolidation in 2012, the deficit
(cash basis) widened again in 2013 to around 5½ percent of GDP, reflecting weak revenues and the
break on re-invested earnings turned out more costly than anticipated, without boosting investment

2

In the short term, the reform increases uncertainty for some employees and is therefore understandably contested,
notably by labor unions. The employers’ association considered the labor reform a modest step, although in the right
direction.

as expected.3 Public debt—below 30 percent of GDP as recently as 2008—now exceeds 60 percent
of GDP (75 percent including guarantees) and is increasing rapidly.
16.
The government is largely pre-financed for 2014. More than 80 percent of the central
government’s financing needs are expected to be covered from domestic sources, in particular
banks and pension funds. As for external financing, the

Policy Discussions
17.
Staff argued—and the authorities agreed—that
fiscal consolidation was critical to strengthen confidence in
macro-economic management and retain the economy’s
access to financing at acceptable conditions. Given the
deterioration in Croatia’s standing in credit markets and the
prospect of tighter global financing conditions ahead,
adjustment could not be delayed further. Consolidation would
have to be designed in a way that would both signal clearly that
Croatia was getting its public finances under control and limit
the short-term contractionary impact on an already weak
economy. Specifically, staff advocated the following parameters:






Overall adjustment. A structural reduction in the
general government deficit of about three percent of
GDP within a foreseeable timeframe was called for to
ensure the return to a sustainable fiscal stance.
Phasing. The government argued strongly against
excessively frontloaded adjustment lest to harm the
incipient recovery. Staff recommended stretching
adjustment over three years in roughly equal annual
portions.
Composition. Staff advocated an emphasis on the
revenue side in 2014—in view of the lower short-term
growth multiplier of revenue measures—and a gradual
switch to expenditure consolidation in 2015 and 2016. 4

2/ Staff advice assumes continued fiscal adjustment after the EDP

While the authorities and staff broadly agreed on the composition of adjustment, parts of Croatia’s academic
community—such as the Institute for Public Finance—saw the revised 2014 budget as a lost opportunity to curtail
wasteful spending. The employers’ association took a similar view.



For the medium term, staff recommended restoring structural balance gradually, to achieve
a sustained reduction in public sector debt and regain flexibility to react to economic shocks.

18.
Staff noted that the revised 2014 budget currently under the assembly’s consideration
frontloads adjustment relative to these parameters.


Amount of adjustment. Staff estimates net structural adjustment contained in the
government’s first draft of a revised budget presented in early March at 0.6–0.8 percent of
GDP (full-year impact 0.8–1.1 percent), with two-thirds of adjustment on the revenue side
(Box 4). Staff assessed that this pace of adjustment struck an adequate balance between the
need to nurture the recovery and restore credibility. Since then, the government has
announced a second revision containing an additional 0.4 percent of GDP in measures (fullyear impact 0.5. percent), in order to comply with the EDP. The authorities and staff agreed
that the additional tightening front-loaded adjustment risked a further weakening of activity



Composition. Staff argued that the largest
adjustment measure—a hike in health contributions that reverses a reduction enacted in
2012—was suboptimal, as it raises labor cost and thus undermines efforts to strengthen cost
competitiveness. Alternative revenue measures that the government had considered at some
point—such as introducing a modern property tax, revoking the tax credit for reinvested
profits, taxing interest income, or broadening the base for personal income tax—would have
been superior. The authorities argued that for a property tax, more preparatory work was
required.

19.
More generally, staff advocated embedding the revised 2014 budget into a
comprehensive three-year plan, so as to render consolidation predictable and maximize the
impact on confidence. This would help counter a perception that fiscal measures were taken often
only in reaction to external pressure (such as the EDP), chosen on the basis of political expediency,
and subject to frequent reversals. Expenditure reductions and tax reforms to be implemented in
2015/16 should, at least in broad terms, be identified already now. In some areas, structural reforms
should support sustained reductions in spending; for example, local government reform to
permanently reduce the government wage bill (Box 5). The authorities replied that their
convergence program—to be published in due course—would specify measures for the entire
period of 2014–16, including, on the revenue side, a tax on savings in 2015 and a full-fledged
property tax in 2016.
20.
Staff stressed that the health sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) required
immediate attention to avoid contingent fiscal liabilities.



State-owned hospitals have accumulated sizeable arrears in recent years that required
clearance by the central government. The authorities argued that they had taken steps to
prevent the problem from reemerging, notably taking over the administration of hospitals
whose arrears were cleared, and developing a hospital master plan to restructure the sector.
Staff voiced doubts, however, whether administrative steps alone would suffice to restore the
sector’s financial balance, and recommended considering revenue measures—such as boosting
receipts from co-payments and/or expenditure cuts—including by increasing the efficiency of
health services.



As for loss-making SOEs, staff commended the authorities for progress with tackling some of
the most difficult cases, such as shipyards, railways, and air and road transportation—even
though restructuring and privatization has often been possible only at substantial costs to the
government, notably the assumption of SOE debts. Staff urged to continue with restructuring
and resolution efforts, based on a comprehensive review of state-owned enterprises’ finances.

C. Maintaining Monetary and Financial Stability
Diagnostic
21.
Monetary policy is anchored by the kuna-euro exchange rates and conducted with a
relatively limited but effective set of instruments.


Variations in reserves and liquidity regulations. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) has
repeatedly lowered mandatory reserve requirements and thus created substantial excess
liquidity in the banking system to keep kuna financing conditions accommodative. Banks
have invested much of the additional liquidity in government paper.



Macro-prudential tools. The CNB has conditioned
some reductions in reserve requirements on higher
corporate lending. With weak aggregate demand,
credit to the private sector has remained subdued,
however.

interventions react to larger-than-usual movements in
the exchange rate, to keep expectations anchored.
There is no announced exchange rate level or tolerance

At end-2013, the banking system’s aggregate capital adequacy ratio was, at almost
21 percent, the region’s highest.5 Non-performing loans stood at 15.6 percent, are
concentrated in the corporate sector, and, amid weak growth, are still rising.



Specific loan-loss provisions are modest compared to peers. However, staff computations
suggest that even in an extreme scenario—where all non-provisioned non-performing loans
would have to be written off in full—losses could be absorbed out of capital buffers
(Appendix VII).



Profitability has remained positive throughout the
recession, reflecting in part the near-doubling of
banks’ holdings of government securities since
2008. In 2013, return-on-equity halved, however,
reflecting inter alia changes to loan classification
rules and correspondingly higher provisioning cost.
Profitability is likely to remain subdued going
forward, reflecting higher loan-loss provisions, the
difficult operating environment, and fewer options
to invest in government paper in the context of
fiscal consolidation.

The Croatian subsidiary of Hypo Alpe Adria (HAA)—Croatia’s 5th largest bank by assets—is
awaiting the modalities of the dissolution HAA group in line with EC requirements. The CNB
underscored that HAA Croatia is a viable bank for which a new owner can be found.

Policy Discussion
23.
Staff acknowledged that CNB’s set of monetary policy instruments is appropriate at
this juncture, but encouraged the central bank to adapt its toolkit going forward as needed. In
particular, in case financial or inflationary pressures were to reemerge at some stage, fine-tuning of
liquidity could be conducted more flexibly and accurately through open market operations than
regulatory instruments. The CNB broadly agreed.
24.
Further, staff noted that FX reserves remain below standard adequacy metrics, with sat
oddly with the importance of the exchange rate for Croatia’s monetary policy framework. The CNB
argued that it was able to control all main FX pressure points regardless, and that this was well
understood by the markets. The potential for shortening the kuna was limited by the small size of
the FX market, and corresponding attempts easily combated by modest FX interventions if needed.
Parent bank funding was subject to tight FX liquidity regulations. Further, there was no sizeable

participation of non-resident investors in kuna asset markets, nor
FX mismatches in the banking system exposing banks to the FX
swap market—both phenomena that in other countries had given
rise to FX pressures in times of financial strain. This said, the CNB
recognized the value of being in line with standard reserves
adequacy metrics, and noted that to this end it was purchasing FX
from government debt issuances. Staff raised the possibility of
buying FX in the market—either pre-announced or opportunistic—
but the CNB argued that the existing intervention technique had
proven successful in both anchoring exchange rate expectations
and accumulating reserves.

25.
Staff commended the CNB for safeguarding high
capital and liquidity buffers in the financial system, providing assurances that risks to the
sovereign from the banking sector are contained, although some smaller banks require careful
monitoring. The CNB and staff agreed that legal amendments in effect since October 2013 to
tighten loan classification rules are a welcome step to encourage banks to build gradually more
specific provisions. At the same time, banks’ ample capital buffers were already providing lossabsorbing capacity. Staff argued that caution was warranted regarding the recent increase in bank
loans to state-owned enterprises, lest to under appreciate risks to both banks and the government.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Croatia’s short-term economic outlook remains difficult, with no immediate signs of
economic recovery after five consecutive years of real contraction. Domestic demand remains
depressed as the repair of private sector balance sheets from the excesses of the 2000s is still
ongoing—a task that is being complicated by the re-emergence of deflation in early 2014—while
the economy has been unable to benefit from stronger exports, related in part to unfavorable
developments in trading partner countries. Looking ahead, headwinds from fiscal consolidation and
the prospect of more challenging external financing conditions are bound to complicate macroeconomic management further.
27.
Reviving growth is a priority, given that many of Croatia’s economic problems are rooted
in the protracted recession. With traditional fiscal or monetary policy responses beyond reach, the
best prospect for reviving growth is via accelerated private sector debt restructuring to revive
domestic demand, and measures steps to attract foreign direct investment. The establishment of a
pre-bankruptcy settlement procedure is an important and innovative step to facilitate the write-off
of unrecoverable loans and allow over-indebted but viable corporations a fresh start. Plans to
establish a similar regime for over-indebted households are well placed. As for the investment
climate, a first step has been made with the investment legislation passed last year.
28.
Reforms need to enhance the economy’s ability to adjust to external shocks. Given the
rigid exchange rate regime, much of the adjustment burden falls on the labor market and improving
the still weak investment climate. The labor legislation currently with the assembly could mark a
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

breakthrough to render Croatia’s labor market more adaptable. The economy also needs to make
better use of its labor force: Croatia’s chronically low level of employment curtails not only living
standards, it also amplifies pressures on tax, pension and other social welfare systems. The social
welfare act passed last year can only be a first step to enhance the targeting of benefits and
strengthen work incentives. Tasks ahead are eliminating incentives for early retirement, reducing
benefits for privileged groups, and eliminating overlap between benefits granted by different levels
of government. Such efforts would best be placed in the context of a reform of Croatia’s local
government finances. More progress is also needed on strengthening the business climate,
including through judicial reform, and on restructuring state-owned enterprises.
29.
Credible and sustained fiscal consolidation is critical to strengthen confidence in
macro-economic management. Consolidation should not be delayed any further, given the
deterioration in Croatia’s sovereign credit and the prospect of a more challenging external financing
environment ahead. Given the protracted economic weakness, it is adequate to stretch adjustment
and start with steps least harmful to demand, such as revenue measures. Against this yardstick, the
revised 2014 budget front-loads the adjustment. While a more balanced consolidation path would
have been preferable on economic grounds, the authorities’ decision is understandable in order to
preserve the benefits from staying within the EC’s policy support framework.
30.
To reduce policy uncertainty and maximize the impact on confidence, the government
should embed this year’s fiscal effort should into a coherent medium-term plan. This plan
would usefully be spelled out in the authorities’ convergence and national reform programs, and
feature measures and a concrete timetable for accompanying steps, such as preparations for a
modern property tax and a reform of municipalities. Steps to restore financial balance in the health
sector as well as restructure or resolve state-owned enterprises are key to ensuring that
consolidation would not be undermined by contingent government liabilities.
31.
The quasi-peg to the euro reflects the authorities’ concern about contractionary
balance sheet effects that a depreciation would trigger, given the high degree of liability
euroization. The rigid arrangement prevents addressing competitiveness gaps through devaluation,
however, increasing pressure for labor markets and structural policies to adjust. The central bank has
maintained confidence in exchange rate stability through a set of effective, direct instruments,
keeping a tight grip over possible FX pressure points and discouraging position-taking against the
kuna. The central bank should seek to accumulate more FX reserves, however, until coverage is fully
in line with standard adequacy metrics. Further, it should stand ready to expand its toolkit to indirect
instruments once financial or inflationary pressures reemerge.
32.
The stability of Croatia’s banking system is impressive against the background of the
protracted recession. Relative strength owes much to the central bank’s aggressive bank
capitalization policy, ensuring that banks possess ample cushions against shocks to profitability and
credit quality. Looking ahead, risks to banks and the government from loans to state-owned
enterprises need to be watched carefully.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Croatia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Croatia belongs to the financially more open economies in Emerging Europe, using both foreign loans and
external market funding to cover financing needs. This structure renders Croatia vulnerable to both changes in

In Croatia’s specific situation, all CGER approaches have flaws.


The macroeconomic balance approach compares staff’s projected current account balance with a current
account norm. A strong projected external balance is interpreted as a sign of strong exports, and therefore a
competitive real exchange rate. However, at this juncture Croatia’s current account is in surplus because of
private sector debt reduction, and this will put upward pressure on the external position also throughout
the projection period. Thus, the relatively strong external position reflects weak demand and
correspondingly compressed imports rather than strong exports.



Similarly, the external sustainability approach compares Croatia’s projected net foreign asset position with a
sustainable NFA. As private sector deleveraging is expected to restore a sustainable NFA eventually, the
approach shows broadly fair valuation.



Finally, the equilibrium exchange rate approach is not robust to the inclusion of different explanatory
variables (such as the current and lagged NFA position). As a result, it delivers a broad range of estimates.

Staff’s preferred competitiveness estimate is instead based on a comparison of unit labor cost relative to
peers. These data suggest that Croatia’s REER remains some 10 percent overvalued. While some adjustment has
taken place since 2008/09, it is not enough to correct the loss in competitiveness in the preceding years.

Box 4. Parameters of the Revised 2014 Budget
The cabinet approved a revised budget in early March. The budget still has to be approved by the assembly. Further,
it does not yet include possible restructuring cost for the state cargo railway company, as the restructuring plan is
subject to EU approval.
With these caveats, staff estimates net structural adjustment contained in the revised budget at
1/

0.8–1.1 percent of GDP (annual impact) , resulting in a projected 2014 cash deficit of around 4½ percent of GDP.
Specifically, the budget contains:



Structural (i.e. durable) adjustment measures of 1.1–1.3 percent of GDP (full-year impact
1.3–1.6 percent), two-thirds of which are on the revenue side. The largest individual measure is an increase
in health insurance contributions; others include cuts in subsidies and rationalization measures in public
hospitals. These structural savings need to be assessed against arrears in the health sector, however, that
are accumulating at a pace of about ½ of a percent of GDP per year and represent permanent spending,
unless addressed through a reform restoring financial balance within the sector.



Measures whose structural character is less clear of 0.7–0.9 percent of GDP, such as cuts in capital and
material expenditures, and the repatriation of dividends from state-owned enterprises. Again, these savings
need to be reduced by the one-off clearance of additional health sector arrears amounting to ½ of a
percent of GDP.



The transfer of assets of the pillar II pension fund in an amount 0.9 percent of GDP into the budget. The
2/

transfer is related to privileged pensions. While the transfer is formally recorded as revenue and thus
reduces the headline cash deficit, it is substantially a financing operation.
A second revision of the 2014 budget is currently under preparation, with revenue measures of 0.2 percent of GDP
(0.3 percent full-year impact) consisting of higher fuel excises and a tax on telecommunications services; and
expenditure cuts of another 0.2 percent, mostly subsidies and capital spending. While the revenue measures should
be structural, this is less clear for the expenditure component.
1/ Some measures take effect only from the second quarter, hence the net structural impact for 2014 is estimated at
0.6–0.8 percent.
2/ According to the government, the transfer corrects a financial imbalance within the pension system: privileged pensions
are typically paid out at a younger age than standard pensions, creating a disproportionate burden for the budget.
Previously, this imbalance was accounted for by transferring money from the Pillar II fund into the budget at retirement.
Under the new regime, privileged pensioners pay a larger portion of their contributions into the Pillar I scheme from the
start; the budget transfer of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2014 serves to correct for past “excess” payments into the Pillar II fund. A
second (and final) transfer of assets of about 0.7 percent of GDP is planned for 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 5. Options for Fiscal Adjustment
Croatia’s fiscal adjustment need is large, amounting to close to 3 percent of GDP to bring public debt on a
sustained downward path, and around 5 percent of GDP to restore a balanced budget. With adjustment starting in
an environment of contracting private demand, proper sequencing of adjustment and a focus, in the short-term, on
measures with a low multiplier are critical. The measures below could be considered in addition to those already
included in the planned 2014 budget revision.
On the revenue side, staff sees scope in the following areas:


The re-introduction of the tax on retained profit and a new tax on interest earnings to tap savings could
yield together 1 percent of GDP.



A full-fledge value-based property tax could yield up to 1 percent of GDP.



Broadening the base for personal income tax—including by means-testing child allowance, and taxing
contractual income at the same rate as normal salaries—could yield around 0.5 percent of GDP.



Reducing the C-inefficiency in VAT by bringing the reduced rates closer to the full rate could also support
fiscal adjustment at a relatively low cost for growth. Increasing the reduced VAT rate from 13 to 15 percent
would bring about 0.2 percent of GDP.



Excise rates on fuel and tobacco could be aligned with EU minimum requirements, yielding at least
0.1 percent of GDP.

On the expenditure side, rationalization of current spending should be the priority.


Possible measures include better targeting of social benefits through stronger means-testing and a
reduction of public sector employment through attrition and a reform of local governments



A continued reduction of subsidies in areas such as agriculture and transport could complete
rationalization.

At the same time, spending adjustment should protect much needed capital expenditures.

Appendix II. EU Funds
As a new member of the EU, Croatia can expect to benefit from substantial financial assistance in the years
ahead. EU grants—mainly structural and cohesion funds, and support through the common agricultural policy—
could eventually exceed 3 percent of GDP per year. This compares to an annual contribution to the EU budget of 1
percent of GDP. However, in the short-term the financial balance with the EU is less favorable, as time is required to
prepare projects and gain sufficient experience with EU procedures. To reduce the risk of new member states
becoming net contributors, the EU has established a special “Cash Flow Facility”.
Some EU grants have to be used within a specified time period, or they may be lost. At end-January 2014, Croatia
had contracted 73 percent of its pre-accession funds (in total €1.1 billion). Due to membership (July 1, 2013) late in
the EU’s 2007–13 Program Period, structural, cohesion and rural development funds for this program period can be
used until end-2016.
EU grants entail fiscal costs. Structural funds are subject to the “additionality principle”—funds finance projects in
addition to what would anyway be in the budget. However, this principle has been interpreted leniently recently.
Further, many projects from EU funds require national co-financing, to ensure commitment to the project. Cofinancing is typically around 15 percent. In addition, some project costs are not eligible for EU reimbursement. As a
result, the effective domestic contribution can be as high as 40–50 percent.

Appendix III. Explaining the Decline in Croatia’s Exports
Between 2008 and 2012, Croatia’s share in the worlds’ exports of goods fell from 0.045 to 0.038 percent—
1/

one of the highest declines in a sample of 13 emerging European economies. There are several possible
explanations: weak trading partner growth, an unfavorable structure of goods exports, and/or a further deterioration
in competitiveness compared to 2008.
This box uses shift-share analysis and UN Comtrade data to distinguish between these factors, exploiting the
following decomposition: 2/

With

- the change in the value of country A’s export between periods 1 and 2
- the change in the value of country A’s export of product to country between periods 1 and 2
- the percentage change in world exports between period 1 and 2
- the percentage change in world exports of product between period 1 and 2
- the percentage change in world exports of product to country between periods 1 and 2

The drop in the trading partners’ demand emerges as the principal factor behind the fall in Croatia’s exports,
led by Italy and Bosnia. For Italy, it reflects in particular falling demand for transport goods such as ships.
Interestingly, Croatia has been unable to benefit from stronger German demand, in contrast to other countries in the
region.

Appendix IV. Labor Market Reforms prior to 2013

Croatia’s labor market is characterized by very low participation—
second in the EU after Greece—and high structural unemployment,
estimated at around 13–15 percent according to EC methodology.
Reportedly, more than half of the unemployed have been without work
for more than a year. A number of factors account for these outcomes:
strong work disincentives emanating from poorly targeted social
benefits, generous special pensions and early retirement scheme, rigid
employment protection legislation, qualification mismatches, and
informal activity.

1/

However, since 2010 various reforms have been enacted to
strengthen the labor market. In 2010, the cap on unemployment
benefits after 90 days of unemployment was reduced from 50 percent to
35 percent of the national average net salary. In the first 90 days of
unemployment, the unemployment benefit is 70 percent of insured's
average wage in the last three months, up to a maximum of 70 percent
of the national average net salary. Also in 2010, the government limited the receipt of unemployment benefits prior to
retirement to 5 years, from unlimited duration for men with 32 years of service and women with 30 years of service.
Changes in pension legislation gradually increased the retirement age for women.
In 2012, several legal amendments changed collective bargaining and reduced labor market rigidity. The
unlimited duration of collective agreements was abolished and the legislation now allows for unilateral cancellation
of agreement under special conditions. The government has since renegotiated collective agreements in the public
sector to reduce fringe benefits and bonuses. Rules were put in place which unions are entitled to negotiate, a step
that may have reduced the influence of smaller trade unions. The Employment Incentives Law was amended to
facilitate the formalization of seasonal employment in agriculture.

Appendix V. The Corporate Pre-Bankruptcy Settlement Procedure (PBSP)
A Pre-Bankruptcy Settlement Law came into force on October 1, 2012 to permit prompt reorganization of
potentially viable companies—similar to the Chapter 11 legislation in the US.
Under the law, a company is required to initiate pre-bankruptcy settlement proceedings within 60 days of the
onset of illiquidity and 21 days of the onset of insolvency. During the first phase, which is typically completed within
120 days, creditors are requested to submit their claims for verification. A restructuring plan is proposed that the
creditors need to agree to; otherwise the regular

Staff encountered various criticisms of the
procedure. These include:


Too little participation by banks. A recent modification of the regulation on asset classification and
provisioning, however, increases incentives for banks to participate by facilitating the transition to
performing category for restructured loans under this procedure.



Too large a cut on tax-debt owed to the government. Staff was not able to verify the substance of these
claims. However, it seems relevant that with full bankruptcy, companies are less likely to be restructured and
the government loses typically a larger portion of tax debt.



Many companies participating in the procedure operate in real estate, a sector with significant excess
capacity. The procedure would thus save companies that should not be saved and stood in the way of
corporate reorientation toward the tradable sector. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that many
restructured corporations under this procedure started outside real estate, but expanded into the sector
during the real estate boom of the 2000s. Restructuring allows these companies to re-focus on their core
business. This said, staff agrees that companies without a viable business model should be closed instead of
restructured—as has indeed been the case in the majority of cases.



Involvement of the commercial courts at a too late stage. Amendments to the law that are currently being
prepared involve the commercial courts at the initiation stage, leading to a minor prolongation of the first
phase (by about a month).

1/ There are three groups of creditors: public authorities and state-owned companies, financial institutions, and other
creditors. Approval requires either more than half of creditors’ votes within each category, or more than two-thirds of all
creditors’ votes.

Appendix VI. Conversion of Government Balances from Cash to ESA 95
The Ministry of Finance produces budget figures using its chart of accounts. These figures are converted into
GFS 2001 classification (cash basis).
Since 2013, past budget figures are also converted into accrual terms (ESA 95) for surveillance purposes with
the European Commission. There are conceptual two differences to cash figures. First, the definition of the
government is slightly different: under ESA 95 a unit is classified as part of the government sector only if (i) it
performs a government function or it is controlled by another public unit and (ii) it charges prices that cover
less than 50 percent of its production costs. Second, the ESA 95 methodology records transactions on an
accrual basis, i.e., when claims and obligations arise, are transformed or are cancelled. For instance, interest
payments are recorded in the accounting period when they accrue, regardless of whether or not they are
actually paid in that period. Tax payments are also time-adjusted, in order to record taxes when the activity
took place to generate the tax liability or when the tax amount was determined for some income taxes.
Given the recent and on-going restructuring of public companies, the assumption of debt, including through
called guarantees, is a critical issue in Croatia. ESA 95 records debt assumptions when the liability is actually
removed from the debtor’s balance sheet to the government’s balance sheet. The full amount of the
outstanding debt that is assumed is recorded as capital expenditure. The table below illustrates the conversion
of the government cash deficit into the ESA 95 classification.1/

1/ From September 2014 EU Member States will be required to transmit their data under a new European System of
National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010). The ESA 2010 differs in scope and concepts from its predecessor (ESA
95). For instance, super dividends paid by public corporations will be treated as exceptional payments and
withdrawals from equity. New rules will also be introduced to record pension entitlements at a set date.

Appendix VII. Non-Performing Loans
High Non-performing loans (NPLs) are a legacy of the
credit boom prior of the 2000s. The NPL rate has
increased from close to 5 percent prior to the crisis (Q3
2008) to around 15 percent in Q3 2013, broadly in line
with the Croatia’s peers. The increase was especially
pronounced for corporate loans (27 percent NPL rate in

Q3, 2013), accounting for roughly 70 percent of all NPLs.
The construction sector has a disproportionately high NPL

10

ratio of around 50 percent. By contrast, NPL rates are

5

much lower in the household sector (10.6 percent).

NPLs denominated in CHF are especially high,

September 2013, the NPL rate of CHF denominated home
loans was 11.3 percent , while the NPL rate of euro denominated home loans was only 4.5 percent. As a result, the
government took steps in 2013 to assist CHF borrowers by ex-post adjusting interest rates. Corpoate loans
denominated in CHF fared even worse (NPLs of 53 percent in September 2013). However, the overall impact of
CHF denominated loans on asset quality has been limited by their modest market share (around 9 percent of the
total NPLs, September 2013).
Capital Adequacy and Specific Provisions

While banks’ specific provision are relatively low,

22

banks’ capital buffers compensate. At around

20

43 percent of impaired loans in Q3 2013, specific

18

provisions are below peers. However, capital net of

16

unprovisioned NPLs is around 12 percent of assets, simlar

14

to Poland (13.5 percent) and Romania (12 percent), and

12

higher than in Hungary (9.5 percent). Further, new asset
classifcation rules that came into effect in October should
bring provisions closer in line with peers.

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt has increased rapidly in recent years, reflecting elevated deficits, Croatia’s persistent
economic contraction, and the assumption of debt from formerly state-owned enterprises such as
shipyards. Gross financing needs are relatively large, at about 15 percent of GDP. Significant fiscal
adjustment is needed to bring public debt as a share of GDP on a downward path. Public debt and
gross financing needs are vulnerable to a variety of shocks, particularly growth shocks.
Baseline and Realism of Projections
The baseline scenario assumes a structural fiscal adjustment close to 3 percent of GDP during
2014–16. It is underpinned by the following assumptions:



Fiscal consolidation: From around 5½ percent of GDP in 2013, the general government
deficit is expected to decline to 4 percent of GDP in 2014, 2.9 percent in 2015, and
2.7 percent in 2016. This corresponds to structural adjustment of around 3 percent of GDP,
distributed over the three years.



Growth: Reflecting the implementation of adjustment and the corresponding impact on
domestic demand, real GDP is projected to contract by 0.8 in 2014. From 2015, real GDP
growth is projected to recover gradually, and to converge to around 2 percent in the
medium to long term.

The fiscal path is challenging even under the baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio
will increase from 60 percent in 2013 to 67 percent in 2016, before starting to decline after 2017.
The temporary deterioration reflects primarily a positive interest rate-growth differential. Gross
financing needs are projected to exceed 23 percent of GDP in 2019 due to large fiscal deficits
accumulated since 2009 and the relatively short maturity of public debt (around five years).
Risks are large and, in the short term, mostly tilted to the downside.



The 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance as specified under the
baseline is in the top quartile of the historical experience for high-debt market access
countries. Implementation risks are significant. Significant deviations from the adjustment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

path would risk undermining confidence and increasing country risk (see alternative
scenarios).



Further, since 2009 real GDP growth forecast have erred on the upside, reflecting the
unusually protracted slump in domestic demand. Staff projects currently that domestic
demand would start normalizing in 2015, but this forecast is subject to large uncertainties.

Shocks and Stress Tests
Negative growth shocks are the main risk to debt sustainability. If real GDP growth were to
undershoot the baseline by one standard deviation in 2015 and 2016, the primary deficit would
deteriorate to around 3 percent—reflecting lower nominal revenues (while spending is assumed to
remain unchanged)—before improving over the medium-term. The weaker primary balance would
trigger a slight increase in risk premiums and a rapid increase in public debt, stabilizing at
82 percent of GDP after 2016. Gross financing needs would increase to 24 percent of GDP.
A combination of macro-fiscal shocks further illustrates the sensibility of public debt and
gross financing needs to adversity. Assuming that shocks to real GDP growth, the primary
balance, the real exchange rate, and the real interest rate would occur simultaneously, public debt
would increase sharply and stabilize at 90 percent of GDP. Gross financing needs would also climb
and exceed 26 percent of GDP in 2019.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian dinar as its
sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna on May 30, 1994.
The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank market,
with tight management by the CNB. Croatia’s de jure exchange rate is a managed float
without a predetermined path. Croatia’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a
crawl like arrangement from April 30, 2011. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and
SDRs. On April 1, 2014 the official exchange rate was kuna 7.653406 per euro (middle rate).
Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for the preservation of
national or international security that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive
Board Decision 144 (52/51).
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on November 7, 2012 (IMF
Country Report No. 12/302 available at: http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm).
Croatia is on the 12-month consultation cycle.
FSAP:
An FSAP Update mission took place in October–November 2007. The FSSA Update was
published (IMF Country Report No. 160 available at:
http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm).
The original FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on
August 5, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in April 2001 and September 2001.
The FSSA was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/180).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
CROATIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of March 27, 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some shortcomings. The key data

shortcomings are in national accounts and related to data coverage and reliability. Progress to
resolve these shortcomings are impeded by insufficient resources and a lack of coordination among
government agencies.
National Accounts: The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few

years. The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices and at
prices of the previous year for the main categories of expenditure and main economic activities.
Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between expenditure-based and
value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of coordination between the CBS and
the Croatian National Bank (CNB) in reconciling tourism receipts estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage
of unincorporated businesses and the self-employed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (iii)
inadequate data for measuring changes in inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage of the informal
sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector.
Wages and Employment: The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and

employment by sector. Earning data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are based
on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each industrial
category. They do not cover a significant part of the working population, including persons
employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, farmers, and the military and police.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A preliminary
Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first time in 1996 on
7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is now being conducted
on a regular basis. The CBS released semi-annual results from 1998, and began releasing quarterly
results in 2007 with a lag of about four months.
Price Statistics: The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a 2005 Household Budget Survey. Between rebasing, the
weights are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are collected at different
time periods in the month for different product groups, but in all cases between the thirteenth and
the twenty-first day of each month. The indices are released around the fifteenth day of the
following month. The price collection is confined to nine towns, but the weights are based on a
sample of households in the whole country. A harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also
calculated in line with Eurostat methodology, but is not released for the time being to avoid
6

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

CROATIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX (CONTINUED)
As of March 27, 2014

confusion. A core CPI is also calculated based on a methodology developed by the CNB. The CBS
also releases a monthly producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following month.
The weighting system of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is changed
every five years, while weights are partially corrected every year.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities have started presenting budget plans based on the

ESA 95 framework, but government finance statistics produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM
framework (GFS) have been available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). Data normally come with a lag of about one quarter. Revenue data are reliable, and
expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic and
functional) for the central budget and the budgetary funds. According to the latest Cooperation
Agreement in the field of national accounts of general government and related statistics (signed on
July 31, 2013 between Croatian Bureau of Statistics, Croatian National Bank (CNB) and Ministry of
Finance), the CNB took over the responsibility for the compilation of general government debt
statistics. The CNB is compiling general government debt according to the ESA95 and EDP
definitions and publishes these data in the CNB Monthly Bulletin. Also, data showing the level of
central government guaranteed debt are presented as a part of the reporting table in the CNB
Monthly Bulletin.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are available on
a quarterly basis. Local government data are partial, as they include the operations of the 53 largest
municipalities.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Starting with the data for July 2013, the CNB compiles and reports

monetary data for publication in IFS in accordance with the 1995 ESA standards and the European
Central Bank’s framework for monetary statistics using the national residency approach. For
December 2001 to June 2013, monetary statistics in IFS are based on the Standardized Report Forms
developed by the IMF Statistics Department, which accord with the concepts and definitions in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000. For December 2010 through June 2013, the CNB has
reported revised data for other depository corporations covering money market funds in addition to
the licensed banks, savings banks and housing savings banks, which represent other monetary
financial institutions in accordance with the 1995 ESA standards.
Financial sector surveillance: The CNB is the banking supervisor and publishes selected

financial soundness indicators (FSI) on its website and provides IMF staff with a broad range of
FSIs. A general description of the stress testing methodologies of the Croatian banking system
is included in the CNB’ Financial Stability Report published twice a year. Summary balance
sheets and profit and loss statements of individual banks are reported in the Banking Bulletin,
published twice a year, with a data lag of about six to nine months.

CROATIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX (CONCLUDED)
As of March 27, 2014
External Sector Statistics: Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data

are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth edition of the IMF’s fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). Croatia plans to implement the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in 2014. Data are generally available with a lag
of three months and are subject to revisions in subsequent releases. Net errors and omissions have
ranged from 1 to 3½ percent of GDP since 2005, and are negative. The coverage and quality of
portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and accurate. Croatia participates in the
Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and plans to participate in the Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey (CPIS) after the new security database becomes operational toward the end of
2014. Data on the International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity (Reserve Data Template) are
available with a lag of one to two months. Croatia compiles external debt data according to the
requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users, 2003, and began
disseminating external debt data in the first quarter of 2004.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Croatia has been a subscriber to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
since May 1996, and met all SDDS requirements
in March 2001.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.

The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia for

fiscal years (FY) 2014–17 in June 2013, with the goal to assist Croatia's convergence with the EU
through an engagement that is focused on key reform-based outcomes. For the World Bank Group
(WBG), priority will be placed on aspects of the Europe 2020 “smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth” strategy and the Government’s new reform agenda that focuses on the economic
management, state institutions, business environment, and responsibility toward shared regional
assets. In pursuing these goals, the Bank Group program aims at contributing in the following three
areas:

2.



Fiscal adjustment through reforms at the sector level;



Innovation and trade competitiveness for growth and shared prosperity;



Helping maximize the economic benefits of becoming an EU member state.

The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$800 million in

lending. For the FY14-17 lending program, DPLs will continue to play an important role based on
the need to combine policy reform with budget finance. At the same time, Croatia and the Bank,
intend to explore the use of new investment financing instruments like results-based operations, as
the share of traditional investment financing decreases during the CPS period. The lending program
has been based on and complemented by analytical work, particularly in the areas of public
expenditure reform, governance, EU preparedness, investment climate, education and social sector.
3.

In FY 13, the Bank’s Board has approved two loans amounting to US$87.6 million, to help

mitigate the impact of ongoing recession and provide funding for the private sector, through a
credit line of about EUR50 million for exporters, and through a Second Science and Technology
Project of EUR20 million. In addition, the Bank approved Export Financing Guarantee Operation in
an amount of EUR250 million to support exporters and foreign exchange earners in Croatia by
enhancing Croatian Reconstruction and Development Bank’s capability to mobilize medium and longterm financing. Projects under preparation for FY14 are the Second Economic Recovery DPL (EUR150

million with the Board set for April 29, 2014), Health System and Quality Efficiency Improvement
Program-for-Results (EUR75 million, scheduled for Board Approval on May 7, 2014), and GEF Adriatic Sea
Environmental Pollution Control Project ($6.8 million, scheduled for Board in May 2014). Projects under
preparation for FY15 are Social Protection System Modernization Project (indicative EUR70 million) and

Sustainable Croatian Railways in Europe (EUR75 million). Currently, the World Bank finances 11
operations in a wide range of sectors with a commitment of about US$750 million. During the next four
years, IFC expects to invest in Croatia up to US$600 million from its own account. MIGA's outstanding

gross exposure in Croatia as of February 28, 2013 was US$943.6 million in support of financial
institutions and a retail sector.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Croatia
On May 14, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with the Republic of Croatia.
Croatia remains stuck in an unusually drawn out recession. In 2013, real GDP contracted for the
5th consecutive year, and stands now at less than 90 percent of the end-2008 level.
Unemployment has risen to 17 percent. Domestic demand remains depressed as corporations and
households focus on reducing excessive debts accumulated in the 2000s. Exports and Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) are also feeble, reflecting deep-seated structural weaknesses and poor
trading partner growth. Macro-policies that could revive growth rapidly are beyond reach: fiscal
policy has run out of space, while monetary policy is constrained by the need to keep the kunaeuro exchange rate stable, lest a depreciation cause a revaluation of euro-indexed debts.
The recession is putting pressure on the public finances. In 2013 the deficit (cash basis) widened
to around 5½ percent of GDP, owing to weak revenues and the assumption of debts and arrears
from state-owned enterprises. Public debt now exceeds 60 percent of GDP and is increasing
rapidly. Reflecting these developments, all major rating agencies have downgraded Croatia to
sub-investment grade. From this year, fiscal policy is subject to the European Union’s Excessive
Deficit Procedure.
The government has started tackling long-standing structural issues, such as restructuring and/or
privatization of state-owned enterprises, passage of laws that facilitate investments, the
introduction of an out-of-court settlement procedure for insolvent corporations, the reduction of
work force restructuring costs, and the easing of hiring restrictions.
The outlook is for another contraction in 2014 of almost 1 percent. Real domestic demand would
remain feeble, reflecting both weak private sector demand and fiscal consolidation, while exports

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
would benefit somewhat from the projected pick up in the euro area. Inflation would remain low.
In 2015 a tepid recovery would set in, as the impact of private sector deleveraging would begin
to recede and external demand strengthens further. Long-term potential growth is projected at
around 2 percent.
With traditional fiscal and monetary policy responses out of reach, private sector debt
restructuring and measures to attract FDI provide the best prospect to revive growth in the shortto medium term. Credible and sustained fiscal consolidation is needed to strengthen confidence
in macro-economic management. Given the protracted economic weakness, it is adequate to
stretch fiscal adjustment and start with steps least harmful to demand. The central bank has
maintained confidence in exchange rate stability through a limited but effective set of
instruments, but should continue accumulating foreign exchange reserves until coverage is fully
in line with standard adequacy metrics.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Croatian economy remains in recession, unemployment is
widespread, the fiscal position has worsened, and downside risks weigh on the near-term
outlook. With countercyclical responses limited by the exchange rate regime and lack of fiscal
space, Directors encouraged the authorities to rebuild fiscal buffers and to undertake deeper
institutional and structural reforms to revive growth and reduce vulnerabilities, including by
accelerating private sector debt restructuring.
Directors agreed that sustained fiscal consolidation is needed to secure debt sustainability.
Noting the front-loaded adjustment in the context of the European Commission’s Excessive
Deficit Procedure, they stressed that fiscal policy for the period ahead needs to manage a difficult
tradeoff between the speed of consolidation and its drag on economic activity. More broadly,
Directors advised the authorities to develop comprehensive plans to frame fiscal adjustment over
the medium term, in order to reduce policy uncertainty and maximize the impact of consolidation
on confidence. Such a plan should give consideration to both revenues and expenditures
measures, including a modern property tax and an overhaul of the public finances at lower levels
of government.
Directors generally supported the authorities’ plans to use monetary policy to safeguard their
exchange rate objectives and to maintain adequate reserves. They also took note of the staff’s
assessment that the real effective exchange rate may be modestly overvalued but underscored the
uncertainty surrounding such assessment.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors commended the central bank for its bank capitalization policy, which has bolstered the
stability of the financial system by ensuring that banks possess ample loss-absorbing capacity.
Nonetheless, Directors encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant against risks to both banks
and the sovereign from loans to state-owned enterprises.
Directors welcomed the progress made in structural reforms but highlighted that further efforts
are necessary to enhance external competitiveness and facilitate balance-sheet repair in the
private sector. They underscored the need for reforms to raise labor force participation, address
labor market rigidities, restructure state-owned enterprises, and improve the business and
investment climate, particularly through judicial reform. The labor legislation currently under
parliamentary consideration could strengthen the labor market’s capacity to adapt to shocks.
Continued efforts should also be made to ensure the rapid and efficient absorption of EU funds.

Statement by Mr. Snel and Ms. Cudina on the Republic of Croatia
May 14, 2014

The Croatian authorities thank staff for the constructive and candid dialogue during their
mission in Croatia. They appreciate staff’s comprehensive and objective analysis of the
macroeconomic situation and agree with their assessments and policy recommendations.
Policy discussions have helped the authorities to set the right policy mix needed to support
the economic recovery.
Economic developments and outlook
The Croatian economy has been in recession for five consecutive years. In 2013, GDP
contracted by 1 percent, as domestic demand remained depressed by high unemployment and
private debt overhang. The annual inflation slowed to 2.2 percent, and the declining
commodity prices in the global market are likely to keep it subdued going forward.
The export performance has also been weak, reflecting structural weaknesses and adverse
economic developments in the main trading partner countries. Also, exporters have still not
taken full advantage of the EU membership, while the access to the traditional CEFTA
markets has become more difficult after the EU accession. With large adjustments on the
imports side over the last few years, the current account ended in surplus of about 1 percent
of GDP in 2013. Previous imbalances, however, have hiked external debt in excess of 100
percent of current GDP.
With respect to the GDP forecast for 2014, the authorities are somewhat more optimistic than
staff. Recent data show that the decline bottomed out in the second half of 2013 and high
frequency data point to modest recovery in the first quarter of 2014. The structural reforms
and debt restructuring will moderate the current negative trends, although the necessary fiscal
consolidation will dampen the growth prospects in the short term. Looking forward, the
gradual economic recovery will be based on the restoration of investment, financed largely
through the EU funds, and the improvement in export of goods and services as the economy
catches up in terms of competitiveness.
Fiscal policy
The prolonged recession has led to deep fiscal imbalances. Despite the government’s
consolidation efforts, the budget deficit remained high in 2013, contributing to a significant
increase in public debt. Apart from the weak economic activity, the EU accession initially
had a negative impact on the budget (revenues from custom duties were permanently lost,
VAT collection was delayed, and the membership fee was paid). However, a positive impact
of the EU membership on the budget will take place in the coming years when the EU funds
bring positive growth effects. The overall fiscal discipline and tax collection have improved,
due to a series of measures, including the introduction of the Fiscal Cash Register Act.
Budget expenditures increased in 2013 due to the settlement of arrears in the healthcare

2
sector and fiscal transfer to the EU budget. This was partly offset by nominal savings in most
categories of expenditures, including the public wage bill and subsidies to companies.
In January 2014 the Council of the European Union opened the excessive deficit procedure
(EDP) for Croatia, as the budget deficit and the public debt at end-2013 were above the
reference values. The Council’s recommendation was to impose structural measures in the
amount of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014 and 1 percent of GDP in both 2015 and 2016 in order
to achieve the targeted levels of deficit. The Croatian authorities are committed to comply
with these recommendations, despite a negative short-term impact of strong fiscal adjustment
on economic activity. The EU policy framework will help to enhance fiscal governance and
growth prospects, which will ensure fiscal sustainability and improve the financing
conditions. To this end, the state budget was revised in March 2014, containing a
comprehensive set of structural consolidation measures in the recommended amount.
In order to minimize the negative impact of strong fiscal consolidation, a balanced approach
including measures on both the revenue and expenditure side is envisaged as the
consolidation plan for 2014-2016. The largest structural measure in 2014 on the revenues
side is restoring the rate of the compulsory health insurance contribution to 15 percent. Later
on the authorities plan to introduce a tax on interest earnings and a property tax. They will
also continue with the activities aimed at increasing fiscal discipline and tax collection.
Measures on the expenditure side will aim at rationalizing the current expenditures, while
maintaining adequate social protection and capital spending partly supported by the EU
funds. Better targeting of social transfers and further rationalization of capital transfers is also
envisaged.
Monetary policy and financial system
The monetary authorities continue to be firmly committed to maintaining exchange rate
stability. This policy provided an anchor for inflation expectations and financial stability in
the context of widespread euroization. In view of the sizable foreign currency exposure of
both the private and public sector (150 percent of GDP), even a moderate exchange rate
depreciation would cause strong negative balance sheet effects and credit losses. Though one
can find Croatia's monetary policy constrained, it is important to note that such an exchange
rate regime has been determined by specific economic circumstances, and has served the
country well. Moreover, the benefits to competitiveness from a more flexible exchange rate
(even if it would be possible) are uncertain in case of a small and open economy such as
Croatia. Regardless of the exchange rate regime, the productivity enhancing fiscal and
structural reform policies are essential to fix the competitiveness problem, and there is simply
no alternative to that.
Such an exchange rate regime, combined with high euroization and the existing external
vulnerabilities, requires adequate reserve buffers. The central bank has been steadily
increasing international reserves over time, also during the recent times of lower capital
inflows, and considers the current level of reserves adequate. With regards to the reserves
adequacy matrix, international reserves currently exceed the amount of reserve money by a
large margin (close to 160 percent) and cover more than 8 months of imports. The short-term

3
debt coverage is somewhat lower (around 90 percent) than the IMF metric, but if
intercompany bank debt and FDI-related short-term liabilities, which are significant in
Croatia and have proven to be relatively stable, are excluded, then the coverage reaches 160
percent. Nonetheless, the central bank will continue to gradually accumulate reserves,
depending on capital flows dynamics and in line with the underlying exchange rate policy.
The Croatian banking system continues to demonstrate high resilience, despite previous
adverse external shocks (both the U.S. subprime crisis and the euro area crisis) and a 5-year
long domestic recession, mainly thanks to sound fundamentals and macroprudential
measures implemented in the pre-crisis period. The system-wide capital adequacy ratio
remains robust, currently close to 21 percent, and is adequate. It can also hypothetically
sustain the entire NPL's write-off (net of provisions), and still remain at about 12 percent.
With regard to banks' profitability, although headline figures are pointing to a decline in
profitability over the last year, banks' operational profitability on average has not changed at
all, which can be explained by a more active provisioning policy encouraged by the central
bank. Thanks to that, during 2013, the coverage of NPLs by specific loan-loss provisions
increased by almost 4 percentage points to 46 percent, and it is expected that with such a
provisioning policy in place, loan-loss provisions of the Croatian banking system will reach
those of its peers on average over the next two years.
Competitiveness and structural reforms
Staff’s assessment of Croatia's real effective exchange rate points to a 10 percent
overvaluation. The authorities, however, would like to point to methodological shortcomings
of their approach (the comparability of the data and the countries in the sample can be
questioned). The authorities’ own calculations, based on the application of the same
methodology for a more comparable set of countries (EU member states), suggest a range
from 2 percent overvaluation to 8 percent undervaluation. Therefore, no strong conclusion on
the exchange rate misalignments could be made.
Nevertheless, Croatia’s competitiveness position is weak, although continuous improvements
in the price-competitiveness became apparent in recent years, particularly in REER deflated
by nominal unit labor costs. Regardless, Croatia is lagging behind in export performance,
which is evident in the persistent erosion of market share of Croatian exporters on the world
market. The underlying factors are not clear, while relative prices and costs might play a role,
other non-price factors may be even more important. Some of these factors are long-existing
structural problems, like the unfavorable product specialization and geographic orientation,
labor market rigidities, weak business environment, and other bottlenecks that discourage
investments (both domestic and foreign) and deter exports.
In this respect, the Croatian authorities see the need for a fast implementation of structural
reforms to tackle the lack of competitiveness. They have already addressed some areas. More
direct support is being provided from the central government to foreign direct investors to
help revive FDI inflows. The pre-bankruptcy settlement procedures are being intensified,
bringing debt relief to companies, and similar measures are being developed to help overindebted households. As noted in the National Reform Program that was published in April

4
2014, the authorities will proceed with the restructuring and privatization process,
prioritizing on the transportation sector. A comprehensive set of measures to improve the
healthcare system and increase the labor market flexibility is also being implemented.
Despite the many challenges ahead, the Croatian authorities believe that these measures will
help improve competitiveness, and pave the road to sustainable and more inclusive growth.
