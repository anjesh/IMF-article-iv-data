EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Chad’s chronic instability has hindered growth and poverty reduction. Despite collecting
sizeable oil revenues since 2003, Chad remains among the poorest countries in the world and
has made little progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The security
situation is improving, thanks to a recent rapprochement between Chad and Sudan, but
uncertainties remain.
Output contracted by 2 percent in 2009 because of a large drop in agricultural production due
to poor rainfall and the trend decrease of oil production. Inflation reached 10 percent in 2009,
but has started to wane in the aftermath of the fuel and food crisis.
The poor harvest could imply food shortages for up to 2 million people (18 percent of the
population). The need for additional food is estimated at between 80,000-100,000 metric
tons, which the government has started to meet in cooperation with donors.
The global financial crisis affected Chad mainly through the decline in oil prices. The fiscal
position deteriorated sharply in 2009 as the government increased spending levels in the face
of a fall-off in oil revenues by depleting its oil savings and borrowing from the regional
central bank. The level of spending over 2008-09 was not sustainable; oil savings declined
considerably and debt increased significantly during this period.
Medium-term fiscal policy needs to be set with an eye to the trend decline of oil resources
over the next 20 years. Notwithstanding possible additional oil discoveries, the future trend
in oil production is almost certainly downward. The staff recommends a fiscal adjustment
strategy based on achieving a steady reduction of the non-oil primary deficit while focusing
spending on priority areas. Absent a fiscal adjustment, the debt would rapidly reach
unsustainable levels.
In 2010, the authorities should adopt a supplementary budget that accommodates underfunded priority spending while still targeting a significant reduction in the non-oil primary
deficit. Further adjustment will be needed in 2011 given financing constraints.
Across-the-board improvement in public financial management is needed to transform oil
resources into a higher level of human and physical capital than before the oil era. Improving
the functioning of the judicial system, strengthening the financial sector, and reforming the
state-owned cotton and utility companies are among the key measures needed to promote
non-oil growth.

5
I. KEY CHALLENGES
1.
Chad’s chronically unstable security situation hinders growth and poverty
reduction. Chad is among the poorest countries in the world and has, as yet, made little
progress towards the MDGs (Figure 2 and Table 9). It has experienced conflict for most of
the past thirty years. The Darfur crisis and instability in the Central African Republic have
driven about 300,000 refugees into Chad, adding to some 180,000 internally displaced
persons. The recent rapprochement between Chad and Sudan has improved security, but
uncertainties remain. Legislative elections are scheduled for November 2010 and presidential
elections for April 2011.
2.
Chad’s key medium term
challenge is to seize the opportunity
provided by oil revenues to increase
growth of the non-oil sector and
reduce poverty. Seizing this
opportunity requires prudent fiscal
policy, anchored in a medium term
framework, and strong public financial
management. Rapid progress is needed
because oil revenue is temporary, as
production from the Doba basin is
expected to diminish gradually until it
becomes negligible by 2032 (Figure 1).

3.
So far, the oil-revenue windfall has set public expenditure on an unsustainable
path (Figure 3). Annual public expenditure has doubled (in percent of non-oil GDP) since
2003, reaching 46 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009. Oil revenue has fueled an increase not
only in priority spending highlighted in the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) but also in
security outlays. The non-oil primary deficit has reached a level (28 percent of non-oil GDP
in 2009) that is much higher than the long-run sustainable level (estimated in the low single
digits) that would allow the transformation of the remaining oil bonanza of the next two
decades into a permanent income stream.1

This fiscal expansion has strained absorptive capacity and public financial
management (PFM) and raised governance concerns. Concerns over absorptive capacity
are prompted by the conjunction of fast growth of investment spending and the insufficient
attention given to the multi-year implications of investment decisions, including allocations
for recurrent spending in health and education. Concerns over PFM relate to weak links
between annual budgets and the PRS, and the limited role of line ministries in elaborating
their budgets. Concerns over governance are due to weak procurement practices and the
frequent bypassing of normal budget procedures (Figure 3).
5.
In recent years, Chad’s performance under Fund-supported programs has been
weak, while relations with some important development partners have been difficult.
The last arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (now Extended
Credit Facility), which covered the period February 2005-May 2008, expired without the
completion of any review, reflecting recurring fiscal slippages and poor performance in
strengthening PFM. A Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) covering April-October 2009 went
off-track because of large spending overruns (¶11). Following differences on the scale and
quality of spending financed by oil revenues, the World Bank asked Chad to prepay all oil
pipeline-related loans in September 2008. The Bank has begun to re-engage with the
authorities outside the oil sector.2 Weak macroeconomic policy performance and limited
progress towards other triggers have prevented Chad from reaching the completion point
under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative.

7.
Chad’s overall business
environment is very difficult. In
international rankings, Chad
persistently ranks among the
bottom 10 percent of countries
(Text Table 1).

monetization is low and credit to

The government adopted a new PRS in April 2008. The PRS highlights the
importance of restoring security, fiscal sustainability, sound public financial management,
and high-quality spending to promote diversification of the economy and reduce poverty. 3
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
9.
Output dropped in 2009 and inflation has started to decline (Tables 1-2 and
Figure 5). Real GDP contracted by 2 percent because of a sharp reduction in agricultural
production due to poor rainfall and the trend decrease of oil production (Figure 2). Inflation
(up from 8 percent on average in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009) has started to wane in the
aftermath of the fuel and food crisis. Developments in rainfall, public spending, trading
partner prices, and exchange rate movements have been the main determinants of inflation
over time (Box 1).
10.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated over the past several
years, reflecting the effects of a strong euro and surging public spending levels (Figure 5).
Recent euro weakening (if sustained) and eventual fiscal adjustment (¶22) will likely yield

real depreciation in the coming years. 4 Application of conventional methodologies does not
point to significant overvaluation vis-à-vis fundamentals (Box 2).
11.
The fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2009 as the government increased
spending levels while oil revenues fell (Text Table 2, Tables 3-4 and Figure 3).


Oil revenues fell sharply (from 38 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008 to 13 percent in
2009) because of the drop in world oil prices and the advancement of oil tax
payments from 2009 to 2008 as agreed with the oil consortium.5



Expenditure increased (from 43 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008 to 46 percent in
2009) and exceeded (by large margins) the expenditure ceilings under both the initial
budget approved in December 2008 and the supplementary budget approved in
August 2009 under the SMP.



The overall fiscal balance moved from a sizeable surplus (some 7 percent of non-oil
GDP) in 2008 to a large deficit (about 21 percent of non-oil GDP) in 2009, which was
financed by a mix of: (i) depletion of oil savings held at the BEAC; (ii) increased
borrowing from BEAC (including the counterpart of Chad’s new SDR allocation6);
and (iii) significant increased foreign financing (mainly grants) to finance projects
implemented by donors.



The non-oil primary balance improved marginally in 2009 (by less than 1 percent of
non-oil GDP), helped by improvement in non-oil tax revenues.



The alignment of spending with PRS priorities (as measured by the share of priority
spending in total primary spending) deteriorated in 2009 on account of a further
increase in security outlays.

12.
Chad’s compliance with the macroeconomic convergence criteria of the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) has deteriorated since 2007,
due to the worsening of its fiscal position and high inflation (Text Table 3).

4

A recent regional external sustainability assessment also found that the CEMAC region’s REER’s alignment
with fundamentals hinges on fiscal adjustment.

Chad benefitted from an additional SDR allocation of SDR 44.2 million (CFA 32 billion or 1.4 percent of nonoil GDP) as a result of the US$ 250 billion general SDR allocation and the fourth amendment of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement; funding in this amount was then lent to the Government of Chad by BEAC.

Chad’s balance of payments weakened in 2009 (Table 5 and Figure 5). The fall in
oil prices induced a sharp increase of the current account deficit, a deterioration of the
overall balance and a reduction of imputed gross official reserves (to 3 months of imports of
goods and services, net of oil sector imports).7
14.
Broad money contracted slightly in 2009 (Table 6), in part reflecting the drop in
economic activity.
15.
There are pockets of vulnerability in the financial system (Table 7). The balance
sheets of the eight banks, most of which are foreign-owned, have not been directly impacted
by the crisis in advanced countries, given their limited exposure to international financial
markets. But the banking sector remains subject to vulnerabilities, stemming from its lack of
depth, high credit concentration, the fragile situation of some banks, insufficient on-site
supervision, the poor functioning of the judiciary system, and, more broadly, the
underdevelopment of financial markets in the CEMAC.
16.
Progress in microeconomic reforms has been limited. The state-owned cotton
company continued to need budget transfers (in an amount of 1.3 percent of non-oil GDP in
2009) to absorb losses stemming from low international cotton prices, declining production,
and weak management. The state water and electricity company also needed budget
transfers (of 0.8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009) to cover losses stemming from low
collections, uncompetitive oil procurement, and poor overall management that contributed
to frequent power outages.

7

Given that the oil consortium finances its large imports needs for developing the oil field with its own means,
the relevant metric for monitoring the level of imputed foreign exchange reserves is imports of goods and
services excluding oil sector imports.

Box 1. Chad: Inflation Determinants
On average inflation has been moderate but has increased recently. Inflation averaged 5 percent per
annum during 1983–2009, although with sizeable year-to-year fluctuations (Figure A). Food prices have risen
relative to non-food prices over the past three years (Figure B).

Rainfall, public spending, changes in trading partner prices, and exchange rate movements have been
the main determinants of inflation. Rainfall affects domestic prices (with a three quarter lag) through its
impact on agriculture. The start of oil production in 2003 fueled public spending which has a significant
impact on inflation (with a one quarter lag) through demand pressures on nontradables. Changes in trading
partner prices and nominal effective exchange rate movements are passed through in domestic prices via
imports (with a one quarter lag).

Box 2. Chad: Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff examined the appropriateness of the prevailing real exchange rate using the CGER
methodologies, adapted to the characteristics of Chad, a low-income oil producer.1 The results
suggest that the current level of the REER is not substantially misaligned; the medium-term
scenario on which the conclusions are based assumes significant fiscal adjustment over time
(¶22) to ensure fiscal sustainability:


Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Approach. Regressions of the REER on a set of
fundamentals suggest that, based on the current values of fundamentals, the REER exceeded
its estimated equilibrium value by about 4 percent in 2009.



Macroeconomic Balance Approach. Estimations using this approach suggest an
overvaluation of the REER of some 6-8 percent, which is the size of the depreciation
needed to align the underlying current account balance with its estimated medium-term
norm.



External Sustainability Approach. Estimations using this approach point to an overvaluation
of the REER of some 5-8 percent. This is the size of the depreciation needed to close the
gap between the underlying current account balance and a benchmark level that would
stabilize the net foreign liability position at an assumed medium-term norm.

The results come with caveats in the case of Chad, given the projected depletion of oil revenues and
the ensuing challenge of specifying appropriate medium-term norms for the current account balance
and the net foreign liability position.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
The Article IV consultation discussions centered on five main themes: (i) measures to
address food shortages; (ii) the medium-term macroeconomic outlook; (iii) anchoring fiscal
policy in a medium-term framework that recognizes the temporary nature of oil resources;
(iv) improving public financial management for transforming oil resources into higher nonoil growth and lower poverty; and (v) fostering non-oil sector growth.
A. Measures to Address Food Shortages
18.
Both short-term measures to address the immediate food shortage and long term
action to improve agricultural productivity are needed. As in other Sahel countries, Chad
is facing severe food shortages in 2010 in the aftermath of the poor rainfall in 2009.
Agricultural production fell by one third in 2009 (¶9). Accordingly, about 2 million people
(18 percent of the population) could face severe food shortages during the coming months,
unless the shortfall of 80,000-100,000 tons of food is made up by that time. The government

16
has started using its stock of 10,000 tons of food and ordered about 33,000 tons of food, at a
cost of CFA 20 billion (about 0.8 percent of non-oil GDP), to be included in the 2010
supplementary budget (¶24). The World Food Program is coordinating the importation of
47,000 tons of food, at an estimated cost of $65 million, to be financed by the donor
community. The staff welcomed the authorities’ prompt reaction to the crisis, while also
pointing to the need for further efforts, assisted by donors, to improve agricultural
productivity over the medium term.
B. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook
19.
The macroeconomic outlook is shaped by the expected rebound of agriculture,
the construction of a second oil project, the gradual recovery of oil prices, and the need
for fiscal adjustment in response to financing constraints (Text Table 4).


Non-oil growth will be boosted by the expected rebound of agriculture and major
construction projects, including a second oil project (about one third the size of the
project initiated in 2003), an oil refinery, and a power plant.



Inflation should converge toward the CEMAC target of 3 percent in 2011, with
improved agricultural production, new roads facilitating trade, and fiscal
consolidation.



The overall balance of payments should strengthen on account of higher oil prices
and capital inflows to finance the second oil project.



The overall fiscal balance is expected to improve owing to the recovery of oil prices
in 2010 and to fiscal adjustment responding to financing constraints starting in 2011.
While the authorities have secured the financing to increase spending in 2010 (¶24),
a severe fiscal adjustment is looming in 2011 as, absent a surge in oil prices, there are
few financing options (¶21).



While agreeing with staff on the outlook for 2010, the authorities had not yet formed
a view on the outer years.

C. Anchoring Fiscal Policy in a Medium-Term Framework
Fiscal policy in the medium-term
20.
For staff, the central feature of Chad’s medium- and long-term macroeconomic
outlook is the steady decline of annual oil production during the next twenty years. The
annual production of the Doba oil field reached its peak in 2005 and is projected to decrease
steadily over the next twenty years and become negligible after 2030 (Figure 1). The decline
of oil production will be reflected in falling government revenue (Figure 6). Improvements in
non-oil tax policy and revenue collection could attenuate the reduction of oil revenue.
However, even after taking feasible improvements into account, total government revenue in
Chad would still decline from about 37 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 to about 20 percent
in 2030 (based on current oil price assumptions in the WEO).8
21.
The absence of fiscal adjustment in response to the decline of oil production
would lead to a sharp increase in debt, were it financeable. In fact, financing options to
avoid fiscal adjustment are limited as a result of the near-exhaustion of oil savings and
central bank statutory advances (¶11), the underdevelopment of financial markets in the
CEMAC, and the absence of sustained external financing for budget support (¶5). However,
if the authorities were able to secure financing to maintain the current level of spending, the
resulting debt path would increase steeply, leading to an unmanageable debt and debt-service
burden (Box 3).
22.
To address the trend decline of annual oil production, staff proposed
undertaking a fiscal adjustment strategy based on achieving a steady improvement over
time in the non-oil primary balance (NOPB). A prudent fiscal policy that reduces the nonoil primary deficit to a sustainable level over the medium term would allow both the
transformation of oil revenue into a higher level of physical and human capital than before
the oil era and the accumulation of savings to support consumption levels in the post-oil
period. In order to build up meaningful savings by the end of the oil period, the NOPB would
need to reach its sustainable level (¶3) by about 2020 (Figure 7). Fiscal consolidation need
not come at the expense of development priorities if spending focuses on priority areas.

8

The successful exploitation of the second oil field under construction (¶19) would not significantly alter the
downward path of oil revenue, as this oil field is only about one third of the size of the Doba oil field.
Moreover, a positive impact on public finances of this oil field hinges on the resolution of outstanding
questions, such as the access of oil production to export markets and the profitability of the oil refinery.

The updated DSA points to the urgent need for fiscal consolidation and a cautious approach to incurring
new debt. If the current spending level were maintained and additional financing could be secured, the resulting
debt path would increase steeply, leading to an unmanageable debt and debt-service burden (“Without Fiscal
Adjustment”). If domestically financed spending were adjusted in parallel with oil revenue declines, the
resulting debt path would be sustainable (“With Fiscal Adjustment”).
While remaining moderate owing to the still low level of debt, Chad’s debt vulnerabilities have increased
since last year’s DSA because total public debt is increasing steeply. Total debt is rising fast (from 24
percent of GDP in 2008 to 34 percent of GDP in 2010) on account of two large external loans and credit from
the regional central bank. The authorities have secured a $300 million loan with a grant element of 15 percent
from an official creditor to finance the budget. They have also guaranteed a loan of about €232 million on
commercial terms to finance the government’s share (40 percent) of a new oil refinery, now under construction,
to be operated in a joint venture with a Chinese oil company.

23.
While the authorities acknowledged that the fiscal situation had become very
tight, they expressed more optimism about the medium-term outlook and argued that
higher investment levels were needed to facilitate longer term development. In light of
the sharp reduction of government deposits at the BEAC and the near-exhaustion of their
ceiling on statutory advances from BEAC (Tables 3-4), the authorities noted that their shortterm financial situation had become very tight. They attributed most of the deterioration in
their fiscal position to the security outlays needed to defeat rebel attacks in 2008-09. Going
forward, they expected that the improvement in the security situation (¶1) would boost nonoil economic activity and non-oil revenue and allow a decline of security spending. They also
noted that higher-than-expected oil prices or the discovery of new oil fields or other natural
resources would improve the outlook. Finally, they argued that higher investment levels were
necessary to meet the country’s pressing development needs.
Fiscal policy in 2010
24.
The authorities and staff agreed that a supplementary budget was needed to
respond to under-funded priority outlays, but held different views on the scale of the
revision that was warranted.


The 2010 budget approved by parliament in December 2009 envisaged a major
reduction of the non-oil primary deficit from the unsustainable highs of 2008-09 and
a significant improvement in the composition of expenditure (Text Table 5 and
Tables 3-4).



The authorities now face significant spending pressures owing to food shortages
(¶18), the upcoming elections, ongoing investments, arrears, and other liabilities.
Hence, staff and the authorities agreed on the need to prepare a supplementary budget
that would accommodate some of the spending pressures.



However views differed on the level of total spending. While the authorities and staff
agreed on the need to accommodate spending pressure in an amount of about 4
percent of non-oil GDP, the authorities felt it necessary to add further spending in an
amount of about 11 percent of non-oil GDP, much of it for security purposes.



While the authorities’ plan could be financed by using the full amount of a loan in an
amount of $300 million secured from an official creditor (Box 3), staff recommended
a tighter fiscal stance in order to reduce the non-oil primary deficit without further
delay and to limit the scale of the adjustment needed in 2011.

D. Improving Public Financial Management for Transforming Oil Resources
into Higher Non-Oil Growth and Lower Poverty
25.
The staff and the authorities agreed that across-the-board improvement in
public financial management is needed. As to specific reforms:


The exemplary transparency of the interim petroleum revenue management
mechanism in tracking oil revenue should be preserved once the authorities start
receiving royalties in kind rather than cash.



Actions underway to implement the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative will
help to maintain revenue transparency.



Non-oil tax revenue performance needs to be improved by expanding nascent reforms
at the tax administration and simplifying the tax and customs codes.



Budget preparation needs to be enhanced by aligning the budget more closely with
the PRS, improving investment preparation and monitoring, and providing sufficient
resources for current spending in health and education to make operational the many
schools, hospitals, and health centers already built or under construction.

22


Budget execution needs to be tightened by adhering to normal budget procedures,
using competitive bidding, and regularly monitoring budget execution.
E. Fostering Non-Oil Sector Growth

26.
Improving the environment for private business is essential for medium-term
growth prospects. The authorities noted, and staff agreed, that the ongoing improvement in
the security situation, if maintained, would provide a vital boost to business confidence.
Staff called for government leadership and early actions in the following priority areas:


Improving the judiciary is essential for developing the financial sector and the
non-oil economy at large. As an illustration, private sector representatives noted that
companies keep their bank deposits at a minimum out of fear of asset seizures
flowing from frivolous law suits.



Close cooperation with the regional bank supervisor is needed to restructure a
sizable bank that faces solvency problems. Non-performing loans need to be
written off and the bank needs to be recapitalized or wound down in an orderly
manner.



Reforming the energy and cotton sector companies is overdue. As a first step, the
accounts of these and other state-owned companies should be audited to lay the
ground for reforms and published to foster transparency and accountability.
IV. RELATIONS WITH THE FUND

27.
The policy response to key issues raised in recent Article IV consultations has
been limited. Little progress has been made in improving the sustainability of fiscal policy,
PFM, or the quality of public spending.
28.
Performance under the 2009 SMP was mixed. The authorities took some
measures to resume normal budget procedures under the SMP (Table 11), but sizeable
spending overruns on security and public investment pushed the SMP well off track
(¶11 and Table 10) and the planned review of the SMP was not completed.
29.
The authorities and staff discussed the possibility of a new SMP that would
cover most of 2010, but agreement could not be reached on the appropriate level of
budgetary outlays for the year (¶24). Staff noted that a SMP covering 2011 could be
discussed next year: key objectives of a SMP would be to ensure that budgetary outlays
remained within targets and that all non-security outlays were executed in accordance with
budget procedures.

23
30.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are
most serious in public finance data, the balance of payments, and national accounts.9 The
authorities have been working with the Central African Regional Technical Assistance
Center and the Fund’s Statistics Department to improve statistics in these areas. The staff
recommended allocating more resources to statistical collection and analysis.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The global financial crisis affected Chad mainly through the decline in oil
prices. The fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2009 as the government increased
spending levels in the face of a fall-off in oil revenues by depleting its oil savings and
borrowing from the central bank.
32.
Prompt reaction to the pressing food shortage needs to be complemented by
measures to increase agriculture productivity. The authorities have been quick to
mobilize internal and external resources to import food. In the medium term, measures to
improve agricultural yields are needed.
33.
The current fiscal stance is unsustainable. In 2009, expenditure exceeded (by
large margins) the expenditure ceilings under both the initial budget approved in December
2008 and the supplementary budget approved in August 2009. Oil savings have vanished
and public debt has increased significantly since 2008. Two large non-concessional loans
have increased debt vulnerabilities.
34.
Fiscal policy needs to be tightened within a medium-term framework that
factors in the trend decline of oil production over the next 20 years. The non-oil primary
deficit should be steadily reduced, while focusing spending on priority areas, to allow
accumulation of some savings before oil depletion. Absent a fiscal adjustment, the debt
would rapidly reach unsustainable levels.
35.
In 2010, the authorities should adopt a supplementary budget that substantially
reduces the non-oil primary deficit while accommodating priority spending. This would
limit the scale of the adjustment needed in 2011.
36.
Improving public financial management is key to transforming oil resources
into higher non-oil sector growth and lower poverty. Preserving the exemplary
transparency of oil revenue, expanding recent improvements in tax administration, aligning
spending with the PRS, and improving public investment planning and procurement are
among the main priorities.

24
37.
Acceleration of non-oil growth will require substantial improvements in the
business climate. Priority measures include strengthening the functioning of the judicial
system, deepening the financial sector while addressing problem banks, and reforming the
state-owned cotton and utility companies.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was
completed on July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment indicate that
implementation of previous safeguards recommendations on financial reporting,
internal audit, and internal control has been limited, and that the changing risk profile
of the BEAC foreign exchange holdings requires further actions to strengthen
safeguards at the BEAC. Subsequent to revelation of Paris office fraud, a series of
initial measures and longer term safeguard measures were agreed between IMF and
BEAC in order to continue with country programs. In December 2009, BEAC adopted
an action plan with the aim of reforming its own governance, and strengthening key
safeguards. A number of special audits are being conducted as well as part of this
action plan. There have been delays in conducting the audits and implementing the
action plan.

5
IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement
The exchange system common to all members of the BEAC has been free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The BEAC
common currency is the CFA franc, which was formerly pegged to the French franc.
Repurchase of CFA franc banknotes exported outside the BEAC zone was suspended
on August 2, 1993. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued by
50 percent in foreign currency terms, and the exchange rate was adjusted from
F 1 = CFAF 50 to F 1 = CFAF 100. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has been
pegged to the euro at the rate of EUR 1 = CFAF 655.97.

CHAD—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of May -19, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most serious
in government finance, balance of payments, and national accounts. The 2007 Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) found that the statistical system continues to be weak and to suffer from a
shortage of both financial and human resources. More specifically the 2007 ROSC found the following
weaknesses: weak source data for national accounts; insufficient coverage of government finance and monetary
statistics; inadequate sectoral classification of public entities in all datasets; absence of dissemination of
government finance statistics by the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and generally limited data and metadata
accessibility. In addition, the country participates in the GDDS since 2002, but its metadata needs to be
updated.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. Also the
methodology is not current (SNA 1968). Moreover compilation remains weak due to inadequate funding for the
Institut National de la Statistique, des Etudes Economiques et Démographiques (INSEED). In addition,
dissemination of data and metadata to the public could be improved by more timely releases and more detailed
information.
Price statistics: Despite a new Harmonized Consumer Price Index (IHPC) covering the capital city that
replaced the old consumer price index (CPI) in January 2008, significant work is still needed to improve the
reliability of the IHPC. The last Central-AFRITAC mission of August 2008 agreed on a short-term program
with the INSEED including actions to be undertaken for the improvement of the index.
Government finance statistics: A working group prepares a quarterly Tableau des opérations financières de
l’État (TOFE) and monthly debt statistics, mainly for the purpose of the Fund-supported program, which is
based on several disparate sources. Only an annual TOFE is disseminated. Chad has not yet been able to resume
reporting of detailed data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Annual fiscal data
through 2001 have been reported and are included in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) database.
However, significant discrepancies between the deficit and total financing exist.
Monetary statistics: A key shortcoming is insufficient institutional coverage, which is limited to the central
bank and commercial banks, whereas microfinance corporations, a growing source of finance in the country, are
not covered by the depository corporations’ survey. Therefore, monetary and fiscal indicators on net credit to
government cannot be easily reconciled, owing to differences in the institutional coverage and grouping of units
in general government and the public sector.
In addition, the accuracy of monetary statistics may be affected by large cross-border movements of Banque des
Etats de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) issued banknotes among Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC) member countries. About 38 percent of banknotes issued in Chad by the BEAC national
directorate circulate in Cameroon, while currency in circulation in Chad includes some 10 percent of banknotes
from Cameroon and 5 percent of banknotes from the Central African Republic.
The BEAC has yet to submit test data using the standardized report forms.
Balance of payments: The poor quality of external sector statistics is likely to be related to inadequacies in
staffing and in provision of material resources dedicated to compilation. The foreign trade data, compiled by the
INSEED on the basis of customs declarations are often unreliable, and suffer from coverage problems; in
addition, they are inconsistent with those used in the compilation of national accounts and prevent meaningful
analysis. Consequently, they are not fully used by the BEAC in the compilation of balance of payments data.
Data on exports are estimated based on data provided by ministries. Even considering the difficulty of

10
collecting data on informal border trade between Chad and its neighboring countries, many improvements could
be made on such items as imports, cotton and cattle exports, freight, and public transfers. STA has
recommended tighter coordination among the CEMAC, INSEED, and other agencies in order to improve the
data coverage.

June 1, 2010
Chad’s risk of debt distress remains moderate provided that the authorities adjust the fiscal
stance to the decline in oil production. If current policies were continued, the resulting debt
path would increase steeply, leading to an unmanageable debt and debt-service burden.
Compared to last year’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), Chad’s debt vulnerabilities
have increased because the authorities have used central bank financing and contracted two
large nonconcessional external loans.1
I. BACKGROUND
A. Recent Developments in Public External Debt
1.
Chad’s external debt burden diminished considerably over the past decade
thanks to strong oil sector-driven growth and limited borrowing. The nominal stock of
external debt declined from 63 percent of GDP in 2001 to 24 percent in 2009 (Text Table 1,
Tables 1a and 1b). All of Chad’s external debt is public, and the bulk is owed to multilateral
creditors, mainly the International Development Association (IDA) and the African
Development Bank (AfDB). This includes debts incurred or guaranteed by the central
government. The analysis is conducted on a gross basis. Nominal debt levels trended
downward as Chad reduced its use of external loans, amortized debt as scheduled, and
prepaid IBRD and IDA loans associated with the financing of the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline
Project in September 2008.

The DSA has been produced jointly by World Bank and Fund staffs in consultation with the staff of the
African Development Bank.

2.
Notwithstanding a sharp deterioration of the fiscal position in 2009, external
public debt decreased further in nominal terms. The international economic and financial
crisis triggered a steep drop in oil revenue and a large increase in the fiscal deficit (to about
21 percent of non-oil GDP). This sharp deterioration of Chad’s fiscal position was financed
by the depletion of government savings accumulated at the central bank and by the use of
central bank statutory advances.
B. Recent Developments in Public Domestic Debt
3.
Chad has a small stock of public domestic debt resulting from the accumulation
of past arrears and the recent use of central bank statutory advances. Chad’s domestic
debt is estimated at about CFA 250 billion (7.7 percent of GDP) at end-2009 (Text Table 2).
The public domestic debt includes central bank statutory advances (avances statutaires);
treasury arrears (arriérés comptables) from previous budget years; rescheduled debt (dettes
conventionnées); legal payment obligations (engagements juridiques); and one small public
borrowing. The authorities view settlement of all verified arrears and debts as an opportunity
to improve the public sector’s credit standing and increase private sector confidence.

C. Status of Implementation of Debt Relief Initiatives
4.
Poor macroeconomic policy performance and limited progress towards other
triggers have prevented Chad from reaching the completion point under the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. Chad’s inability to meet agreed fiscal
targets and to satisfactorily implement a program under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) has been the principal obstacle. The 2005 PRGF expired in 2008
without any reviews being concluded. Subsequent efforts to achieve fiscal stability with the
support of Staff-Monitored Programs (SMP) were also derailed by fiscal slippages. Progress
towards other completion point triggers2 has either been slow, or early gains have been
followed by subsequent deterioration.3
5.
Meeting the conditions for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) would cut external debt in half. MDRI
relief would cover the full stock of debt owed to three multilateral creditors (IDA, IMF, and
the African Development Fund (AfDF)) that remains after Enhanced HIPC relief on
disbursements before end-2004 in the case of IMF and AfDF, and before end-2003 in the
case of IDA. In nominal terms, this could total over $1 billion and would imply a reduction
in debt service of about $40 million per year.

II. BASELINE SCENARIO UNDERLYING THE DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
7.
The central feature of Chad’s medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook is
the steady decline of annual oil production foreseen over the next twenty years.
Production at the Doba oil field started in 2003, reached its peak of 61 million barrels in
2004, with annual output set to decline steadily to a negligible level beyond 2030. Long-term
oil export projections are based on this gradual depletion of the Doba field. Due to its quality,
Chad’s oil sells at a discount, usually of $10-15 per barrel relative to the international
reference price, reflecting a quality discount and transport cost. For the medium term (to
2015) the Chadian price is assumed to grow at the same rate as assumed in the IMF’s World
Economic Outlook (WEO); for the longer term (2015 to 2030), at the growth rate of the
International Energy Agency’s (IEA) reference price. Work has started to exploit a second oil
field, about one third the size of the Doba oil field. Modest output from the second field is
intended to supply the joint-venture refinery in N’djamena, once the refinery and the needed
pipeline are completed in 2012. This second oil field is projected to reduce Chad’s imports of
refined petroleum products, but not to increase oil exports or fiscal revenues.
8.
The oil production decline will necessitate a fiscal adjustment because financing
options are limited. Dwindling oil revenues will drive a steady decline of total government
revenue (from 37 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 to 20 percent in 2030). The successful

5
Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
The primary driver of real GDP growth in the baseline scenario is the steady decline of annual oil
production over the next twenty years (¶7). Non-oil growth should increase above its long term average in
the short term owing to the construction of the second oil field, an oil refinery, a new power plant, and the
impact of road construction on internal trade. After that, non-oil growth is expected to return to its pre-oil
era trend growth.
Inflation moderates rapidly in the short term to stabilize at a level consistent with the CEMAC
convergence criterion of maximum 3 percent per year (Table 1b).
The current account remains in significant deficit until the new pipeline and refinery are complete and
operational in 2012, at which time construction-related and refined petroleum product imports drop
significantly. Similarly, strong FDI, associated with the refinery and other investment projects, slows upon
their completion in 2012 (¶7, Table 1a).
The fiscal outlook is dominated by dwindling oil revenues and limited financing options. The authorities
adjust primarily by restraining expenditure, but also with tax policy and administration reforms that
increase non-oil revenue (¶8).
External financing consists of project loans from official multilateral and bilateral creditors to finance
public investment, but at less concessional terms over time, and stable official grants and other net transfers
(¶10 and Table 1a).

exploitation of the second oil field and refinery under construction would not significantly
alter the downward path of revenue, as this oil field is only about one third of the size of the
Doba oil field, and the profitability of the projects hinges on yet to be resolved logistical and
other issues. It is assumed that the authorities will adjust to this permanent decline of oil
revenue because their financing options are limited: savings at the central bank are
practically exhausted; the central bank’s statutory advance ceilings are declining gradually;
the central bank window will close in 2014; and sustained external finance has been
identified only for project loans. The fiscal adjustment is assumed to be accomplished
primarily by restraining expenditure, but also by increasing non-oil revenue, through tax
policy and revenue administration reforms.
9.
In the short term, debt ratios will increase significantly owing to two large nonconcessional external loans. These loans will increase external public debt from 24 percent
of GDP in 2009 to 28 percent in 2011 (Table 1a). An official creditor has agreed to lend the
Government of Chad $300 million (3.6 percent of 2009 GDP) for budget support with a grant
element of about 15 percent, with 2 ½ years grace and 6 years maturity. A commercial
creditor associated with the construction of the N’djamena refinery has agreed to lend the
Chadian partner, the state-owned Société des Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT), €232 million
(4.1 percent of 2009 GDP) at LIBOR plus 3 percent, with 5 years grace and 10 years
maturity. Disbursement of the entire budget support loan is assumed in 2010, the refinery
loan in equal tranches this year and next, leading to rapid debt accumulation in 2010-11 and
sizeable debt service pressure in the medium term. The interest rate, grace period and
maturity on these loans reduce the average grant element of external borrowing in the short
term (Figure 1a). Given Chad’s present very tight fiscal situation (¶2) and the prospect of
steadily declining oil revenues (¶¶ 7-8), it is unlikely that creditors will offer additional
financing for budget support.

6
10.
The evolution of public debt will be driven by the volume of project loans. New
borrowing is expected to comprise funding from IDA, AfDB, other multilateral lenders, Paris
Club and non Paris Club lenders.5 Absent a substantial improvement in macroeconomic and
public financial management performance, traditional donors (multilaterals and Paris Club)
are projected to continue to provide concessional project loans at roughly the same nominal
level as in the last few years. The share of new borrowing on concessional terms is projected
to decline steadily over the 20-year horizon, gradually decreasing the grant element of new
borrowing (Figure 1a). In the absence of an IMF arrangement, there is no target date for the
HIPC completion point, and the baseline does not take into account HIPC and MDRI debt
relief for which Chad is eligible (¶5). In recognition of the authorities’ plans to clear
accumulated arrears, and their obligation to fully repay central bank statutory advances
within five years, domestic public debt declines to a negligible level by the end of 2014.
III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. External Debt
11.
A continuation of current policies would quickly bring the external public and
publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt burden above the thresholds. If the authorities were to
continue to run a current account deficit far higher than the foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows in the oil sector, as they did in 2009 by running down their official foreign exchange
reserves, external PPG debt would breach most of the sustainability thresholds (Historical
scenario in Figure 1b, c, d and e; and Alternative Scenario A1 in Table 2a).
12.
Owing to the lack of financing options (¶8), maintaining the current policy
stance is unlikely; the authorities will have to tighten fiscal policy in synch with the
trend decline in oil revenue. Under this baseline scenario, Chad’s external debt remains
below the thresholds through the projection period (Figure 1 and Table 1a).
13.
Chad’s external debt burden indicators are highly sensitive to an oil price shock.
Across all indicative debt burden thresholds, the most extreme shock is a drop in export
growth in 2011-12 proportional to a one-standard-deviation lower oil price (Most extreme
shock in Figure 1 and B2 Bound Test in Table 2a). Such a shock would send the debt on a
path that would breach three indicative debt burden thresholds (Figures 1b, c, and e). While
severe, such a shock is plausible, given the volatility of oil prices. A shock to net non-debt
creating flows (B4 Bound Test in Table 2a) results in breaches of three out of five thresholds,
including one liquidity indicator, as the PV of debt service-to-export ratio is placed on an
upward trajectory during the last decade of the projection horizon.

5

The terms of IDA, AfDB and other multilateral loans are concessional, with grant elements ranging from 35 to
52 percent.

7
B. Public Debt
14.
The sustainability of Chad’s total public debt also hinges on fiscal adjustment.
The inclusion of domestic debt does not alter the assessment of Chad’s debt sustainability.
Given the limited size of Chad’s domestic debt (¶3) and the fiscal adjustment underlying the
baseline scenario, the public debt sustainability analysis broadly parallels the external debt
sustainability analysis (Figure 2 and Table 1b).
15.
The analysis of total public debt sustainability confirms that the current fiscal
stance is not sustainable. In 2009, the authorities could accommodate a sharp reduction of
oil revenue by running a large primary deficit (about 10 percent of GDP, Table 1b) which
was financed by depleting the sizeable oil savings accumulated on the government’s accounts
at the central bank (withdrawing the equivalent of 7 percent of GDP) and using central bank
statutory advances (borrowing the equivalent of 4 percent of GDP). In 2010, thanks to
increased oil revenues, the authorities are expected to run a smaller primary deficit
(4.9 percent of GDP), financed by drawing down a nonconcessional budget support loan (¶9).
Going forward, financing options are limited (¶8). However, if the authorities were able to
secure financing to maintain the current level of spending, the resulting debt path would
increase steeply, leading to an unmanageable debt and debt-service burden (Fixed Primary
Balance Scenario in Figure 2, and Alternative Scenario A2 in Table 2b). A temporary shock
to real GDP growth in 2011-2012 would also impair public debt sustainability (Most Extreme
Shock in Figure 2 and Bound Test B1 in Table 2b).
C. The Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities expressed more optimism than staffs about the medium-term
fiscal outlook and their ability to raise additional debt. They expect that the improvement
in the security situation will boost non-oil economic activity and non-oil revenue and allow a
decline of security spending. They noted that higher-than-projected oil prices would improve
the outlook. In addition, they hope that the discovery of new oil fields and other natural
resources would improve public revenue in the medium term. Finally, they believe that the
debt burden thresholds applicable to Chad under the DSF are too low, considering their
pressing investment needs.

8
D. Main Differences from the 2008 Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis
17.
The 2010 DSA projections begin from a higher initial debt burden than
anticipated in the 2008 DSA, but the baseline trajectories are broadly similar. Total
public sector debt as of the end of 2009 was higher than expected in the 2008 DSA, 6 due to
higher-than-expected primary spending, financed by domestic borrowing. The extension of
this spending level into 2010, financed by nonconcessional external budget support, was not
foreseen in the 2008 DSA. Both scenarios hinge on the trend decline in oil production and
revenue and fiscal adjustment. Whereas the rate of debt accumulation was relatively stable
and positive in the 2008 DSA, a different mix and terms of external financing in the 2010
DSA (¶10) imply both stronger amortization pressures in the medium term and a declining
average grant element throughout the projection period.
IV. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
18.
Compared to last year’s DSA, Chad’s debt vulnerabilities have increased
because the authorities have used central bank financing and contracted two large nonconcessional external loans. These two loans will lead to a sharp increase of the debt during
the next two years before amortization begins. They will also make Chad’s debt dynamics
more vulnerable to shocks, as they will bring Chad’s debt and debt service burdens closer to
the thresholds in the short term.
19.
Chad’s risk of debt distress remains moderate provided that the authorities
adjust the fiscal stance to the decline in oil production. Such a baseline scenario does not
lead to a breach of debt-burden thresholds. However, if current policies were continued, the
resulting debt path would increase steeply, leading to an unmanageable debt and debt-service
burden. While the risk of debt distress remains moderate, the more rapid increase of the debt
ratios than projected in the previous DSA is cause for concern.
20.
Progress toward the HIPC completion point would substantially reduce Chad’s
debt vulnerabilities, as HIPC and MDRI debt relief would cut external debt in half.

1/ All of Chad's external debt is public.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ For 2009, includes a reduction in foreign reserves equivalent to 11 percent of GDP. Also includes any exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief) and valuation adjustments.
4/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
5/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
6/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

CHAD
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation-Supplementary Information
Prepared by the African Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Seán Nolan and Dhaneshwar Ghura
June 16, 2010

Information just received by staff points to a change in the Chadian government’s
policy to address food shortages. As indicated in paragraph 18 of the Article IV Consultation
Staff Report, information available to the staff at the time of the mission was that the
government had ordered 33,000 tons of food to address food shortages. Staff has learned in
recent days that tenders covering some 20,000 tons of food have been allowed to lapse.
Based on information obtained from specialized agencies, staff believes that this cutback in
orders could pose an important threat to food relief efforts.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Chad
On June 16, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chad.1
Background
Chad is among the poorest countries in the world. It has experienced conflict for
most of the past thirty years. The country’s key medium-term challenge is to seize
the opportunity provided by oil production since 2003 to increase growth of the nonoil sector and reduce poverty. The second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) highlights the importance of fiscal sustainability, sound public financial
management, and high quality spending to promote diversification of the economy
and reduce poverty.
Output contracted by 2 percent in 2009 because of a large reduction in agricultural
production due to poor rainfall and the trend decrease of oil production. Inflation
increased to 10 percent in 2009, but has started to wane in the aftermath of the fuel
and food crisis.
The bad harvest could imply food shortages for up to 2 million people (18 percent of
the population). The need for additional food is estimated at between 80,000 and

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
100,000 metric tons, which the government has started to meet in cooperation with
donors.
The global financial crisis affected Chad mainly through the decline in oil prices. The
fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2009 as the government increased spending
levels while oil revenue collapsed. The overall fiscal balance moved from a sizeable
surplus (some 7 percent of non-oil gross domestic product -- GDP) in 2008 to a large
deficit (about 21 percent of non-oil GDP) in 2009, which was financed by the
depletion of oil savings, borrowing from the regional central bank, and foreign
financing (mainly grants).
The fall in oil prices in 2009 induced a sharp deterioration of both the current account
and the overall balance of the balance of payments, and a reduction of imputed
gross official reserves (to 3 months of imports of goods and services, excluding oil
sector imports financed by the oil consortium).
As a member of the CFA franc zone, Chad has no independent monetary policy.
Broad money contracted slightly in 2009 in line with the drop in economic activity.
The banking sector is subject to vulnerabilities, stemming from its lack of depth, high
credit concentration, the fragile situation of some banks, insufficient on-site
supervision, the poor functioning of the judiciary system, and, more broadly, the
underdevelopment of financial markets in the Central African Economic and
Monetary Community.
The macroeconomic outlook is shaped by the expected rebound of agriculture, the
construction of a second oil extraction project, the gradual recovery of oil prices, and
the need for fiscal adjustment in response to financing constraints.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the global financial crisis has affected Chad mainly
through the decline in oil prices, which caused a large deterioration in the balance of
payments and the fiscal position. At the same time, GDP contracted as a result of a
large drop in agricultural production. While agricultural output is expected to recover,
there is an impending food shortage that needs to be addressed urgently. Over the
medium term, the trend decline in oil resources will require significant fiscal policy
adjustment.
Directors expressed concern over the looming food shortage. They urged prompt
further action to fill the food shortfall in time to avoid famine. Further efforts to
improve agricultural productivity will be critical to prevent the recurrence of food
shortages.
Directors noted the large deterioration of the fiscal position in 2009, the depletion of
oil savings, and the sizable increase in public debt arising from two large
nonconcessional loans and borrowings from the regional central bank. To ensure

3
debt sustainability, Directors advised the authorities to tighten fiscal policy within a
medium-term framework that factors in the trend decline of oil production over the
next 20 years. This would entail steadily reducing the non-oil primary deficit while
focusing spending on priority areas. Directors recommended adopting a
supplementary budget for 2010 along these lines. They encouraged the authorities
to refrain from nonconcessional borrowing.
Directors emphasized that improving public financial management is key to
transforming oil wealth into sustained growth and making progress toward the
Millennium Development Goals. The main priorities are preserving the exemplary
transparency of oil revenue, implementing the Extractive Industry Transparency
Initiative, expanding recent improvements in tax administration, aligning spending
with the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and improving public investment planning and
procurement. Improved fiscal policy and public financial management would also
pave the way for a timely agreement on a new staff monitored program.
Directors noted the assessment that the current level of the real effective exchange
rate does not pose immediate problems for external sustainability, although
significant fiscal adjustment will be needed over time. To improve competitiveness, a
more supportive business climate is needed to promote private-sector non-oil
growth. Directors called for early action to improve the judicial system, deepen the
financial sector and ensure compliance of banks with prudential guidelines, and
reform the state-owned cotton and utility companies.
Directors encouraged the authorities to allocate sufficient resources to statistical
collection and analysis to address the shortcomings in Chad’s macroeconomic
statistics.
Directors commended the authorities for preparing a frank and comprehensive
second National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS II) that draws on the lessons
learned during the implementation of the first NPRS. They welcomed the focus on
restoring security, improving governance, achieving a greater diversification of the
economy, strengthening institutional capacity, and promoting human development.
They stressed that success hinges on a strengthened commitment to poverty
reduction and good governance, and encouraged the authorities to focus on a
manageable number of critical objectives and to closely monitor implementation
progress.

Statement by Mr. Rutayisire on Chad
(Preliminary)
Executive Board Meeting
June 16, 2010
I would like to express my Chadian authorities’ appreciation of the continued engagement of
Fund staff with Chad and their policy advice, including through the recent Staff-monitored
program (SMP). I also thank Management for maintaining a frank and constructive dialogue
with my authorities throughout difficult domestic circumstances.
In spite of the oil stream that begun in the early 2000s, Chad continues to face considerable
challenges, notably unfavorable social indicators (education, health, quality of water) and
significant infrastructure gaps (electricity, roads, agriculture capacities, etc.). This economy
also continues to be adversely affected by difficult weather conditions, particularly drought,
and by long-standing security problems—although my authorities have made efforts on this
front through a recent rapprochement with a neighboring country to address the security
crisis caused by the lingering Darfur conflict. The security situation has heavily weighted on
the mixed performance under the 2009 SMP. My authorities strongly believe that the
country’s medium-term growth prospects partly rest with addressing the security problems,
which requires considerable resources. They intend to build on recent progress to tackle the
security challenge more forcefully and meet the country’s infrastructure needs. In their new
Poverty Reduction Strategy adopted in April 2008, my Chadian authorities highlight the
importance of restoring security, ensuring fiscal sustainability and sound public financial
management, and improving the quality of spending to promote economic diversification and
reduce poverty.
In the short term, my authorities are induced to respond to an immediate humanitarian
challenge stemming from food shortages, and to other priority outlays, while at the same time
reflecting on medium-term fiscal and structural challenges to boost the country’s economic
prospects. They hope that they can count on the Fund to support their efforts, and they
remain open to discuss ways forward to restore financial relations with the Fund and resume
progress towards the HIPC Completion point, with the view to free up scarce resources
needed to advance towards the MDGs and tackle poverty in a significant manner.
I - RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
The economy of Chad has suffered in 2009 from a steep reduction in agricultural production
due to poor rainfall and decrease of oil production, which translated into a 2-percent
economic contraction. Inflation has increased to double digits last year due to adverse
weather conditions, public spending, and international price and exchange rate movements,
before receding somewhat in the aftermath of the food and fuel crisis.
As a result of the economic downturn, the fiscal position deteriorated as the government used
counter-cyclical spending measures while oil revenues fell, prompting it to use savings held
at the regional central bank BEAC, to tap on the counterpart of Chad’s new SDR allocations,
and to have recourse to foreign financing—mostly in the form of grants—to finance projects

implemented by donors. At the same time, my authorities have enhanced non-oil tax
revenues which reflected in an improvement—albeit small—in the non-oil primary balance
for 2009. Chad’s balance of payments also weakened and gross official reserves declined as a
result of decreasing oil prices.
As macroeconomic developments largely responded to the unfavorable domestic and external
shocks, little progress could be achieved in addressing the financial needs of the state-owned
cotton company which has suffered losses stemming from low world cotton prices and
declining production. Likewise, the budget problems facing the utilities (water and
electricity) company and which continue to cause frequent power outages should be dealt
with.
II - POLICIES FOR 2010
For the remainder of 2010, the authorities will put emphasis on tackling immediate
humanitarian and economic challenges. As indicated above, they will build on recent
progress to further improve the security situation. They also strive to address the problem of
food shortages and respond to the spending pressures caused by other short-term priority
outlays. They intend to achieve these objectives through a supplementary budget, which
financing they have secured.
Reducing security-related uncertainties
My authorities are of the view that further progress in reducing security problems is
instrumental to alleviate the fiscal burden. They are ready to put the necessary resources—
which are significant—to this end. They expect that the improvement in the security situation
would boost non-oil economic activity and non-oil revenue, and allow a decline of security
spending.
Addressing the food shortages
My authorities share the view on the need to address the food supply problem through both
short-term measures to tackle the immediate shortage and long-term reforms to enhance
agricultural productivity and output. In the short-term, as about 2 million people in Chad
could face hunger, the Chadian government has decided to use the country’s stock of 10,000
tons of food and ordered an additional 33,000 tons at a cost that amounts to nearly 1 percent
of non-oil GDP. They also count on the donor community to finance additional food supply,
which delivery is coordinated by the World Food Program.
Other immediate priority outlays
Chad also faces significant spending pressures owing to upcoming legislative (end-2010) and
presidential (April 2011) elections, ongoing investments to close infrastructure gaps, and
payments of arrears and other liabilities. The authorities are prepared to meet all these
immediate outlays through the supplementary budget, which must carry appropriate
resources.

III - MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
Coping with the trend decline in oil revenues
My Chadian authorities are fully aware of the fiscal, debt and development challenges
expected from the trend decline in oil resources. They agree that the fiscal situation—which
has already become tight—will further pose challenges going forward. That said, they
believe that, at the current stage, tighter fiscal policy could be counterproductive in
sustaining recovery from the recent global shock and unresponsive to the important
investment needs facing the country. My Chadian authorities continue to reflect on the
medium-term macroeconomic outlook, which must take into account the expected improved
security situation, developments in oil prices, the discovery of new oil fields and other
natural resources. They hope that Fund staff will continue to propose quality policy advice
that factor in all these elements.
Addressing the country’s limited absorptive capacity is also critical to Chad’s meeting its
infrastructure gaps. The Chadian government welcomes any technical assistance from donors
that is aimed at helping them design a multi-year investment framework and improve public
financial management. Furthermore, my authorities share staff’s views on the need to
maintain mechanisms (Petroleum Revenue Management framework; ongoing actions under
EITI; etc.) that ensure transparency in the oil sector. They also look forward to further
enhancing non-oil tax revenues through tax administration reforms and simplification of tax
and customs codes; better aligning spending with priorities set forth in the country’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy; and improving budget execution. In this regard, donors’ technical
assistance will be of essence.
Financial sector
My authorities are cognizant of the financial sector vulnerabilities, notably the lack of
financial depth, the fragile situation of some banks, and the underdeveloped regional
financial markets. They will continue to strengthen their cooperation with the regional
banking supervisory body, COBAC, to tackle bank solvency problems.
Structural reforms
The authorities recognize that there is considerable room for improving the country’s
business climate. Apart from efforts to enhance security and improve the soundness and
functioning of the financial sector, they view the strengthening of the judiciary system and
the resolution of the problems facing the energy and cotton sectors as essential for enhancing
the business environment and alleviating the fiscal burden of those sectors.
