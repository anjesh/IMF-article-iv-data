Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Indonesia
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Carlo Cottarelli
June 26, 2007
• This report is based on discussions held in Jakarta during May 3–15, 2007. The staff
team comprised Messrs. Zavadjil (head), Reichold, Crowe (all APD), Mati (FAD), Seelig
(MCM), and Mesdames Thacker (APD) and Jain-Chandra (PDR). Messrs. Schwartz, Senior
Resident Representative, and Morales, Deputy Resident Representative, participated in the
mission. Messrs. Warjiyo and Agung from the Executive Director’s Office also attended
meetings.
• Counterparts: Discussions were held with Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs
Boediono, Coordinating Minister for Social Affairs Aburizal Bakrie, Minister of Finance
Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Bank Indonesia Governor Burhanuddin Abdullah, Minister of Trade
Mari Pangestu, the newly appointed Minister of State-owned Enterprises Sofyan Djalil,
Minister of Planning Paskah Suzetta, and other senior officials, as well as representatives of
Parliament, the private sector, academia, and labor unions.
• Context of past surveillance: Close relations between the authorities and the Fund have
been maintained following the expiration of the extended Fund arrangement on
December 31, 2003. The staff has been supportive of the authorities’ policy priorities and
policy implementation has been broadly consistent with recent Fund policy
recommendations (Table 1).
• Indonesia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float. Indonesia has accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

• Statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although they could be improved
in some areas (Annex II). Indonesia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
The statistics ROSC was completed in early 2005. The fiscal ROSC was completed in
September 2006 and the government is implementing the recommendations of this report.

Executive Summary
Background
•

Macroeconomic policies have been geared successfully towards promoting stability while
supporting growth.

•

The economy has been growing at about 6 percent over the past year, fuelled by a
recovery in domestic demand and strong export performance. Bank and corporate balance
sheets have strengthened while the public debt-to-GDP ratio continues to trend down.
The current account remains in surplus and international reserves have risen.

•

Growth is expected to continue at the same pace for the rest of the year and pick up
modestly over the medium term, driven mainly by domestic demand. This assumes a
significant increase in investment, especially in infrastructure.

•

Inflation reached a six-month low in May allowing Bank Indonesia (BI) to continue its
easing stance. The policy rate has been reduced by 425 basis points since the easing cycle
began in May last year.

•

Indonesia’s strengthening fundamentals and yield differentials have recently attracted
significant, though volatile, portfolio inflows, resulting in appreciation pressures on the
rupiah.

Policy Discussions
•

On policies to address the portfolio inflows, staff and authorities agreed that allowing the
rupiah to appreciate while intervening to avoid disruptive changes in the exchange rate
would be the best way to deal with the capital influx. Moreover, appreciation would help
to dampen inflation further and allow BI to cut interest rates, in turn helping to moderate
capital inflows and ease concerns about a sudden reversal.

•

Monetary policy discussions focused on the need to exercise caution in reducing interest
rates to ensure that the inflation target for 2008 is met.

•

Fiscal policy, targeting 1.7–1.8 percent of GDP deficits for 2007 and 2008, is
appropriately geared to further reducing the public debt burden, while providing space for
some additional spending on infrastructure, a major bottleneck to sustainable growth.

•

Staff and authorities agreed on the need to strengthen the nonbank financial sector and
long-term financing. Several prudential regulations have been eased in order to encourage
banks to lend. BI believes strong risk management practices at banks will help to limit
risks, but they plan to review the changes next year. Staff believe such measures send the
wrong signals to banks and supervisors.

•

Successful implementation of the new structural reform agenda, including reducing
infrastructure bottlenecks, passage of the tax law currently in parliament and modification
of labor regulations, would help attract investment, create jobs and raise productivity, thus
accelerating growth, reducing poverty, and supporting stability.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Indonesia’s economic performance has been strong since the last Article IV
consultation. Supported by sound policies and a favorable external environment, output has
grown by about 6 percent, inflation has stabilized, and international reserves have risen to an
all time high. The government, banking, and corporate sectors continued to reduce balance
sheet vulnerabilities. Indonesia’s financial markets have rallied in line with global trends and
perceptions that risks have been reduced. Rising reserves enabled Indonesia to complete the
early repayment of its remaining obligations to the Fund in October last year, thus ending
post-program monitoring.
2.
Despite these successes, the benefits of growth have yet to be felt across society.
While the official unemployment rate dipped below 10 percent in 2007, formal sector
employment opportunities remain limited. Meanwhile, higher prices for some household
staples pushed the poverty rate back up to 18 percent in 2006, reversing the improvements of
the previous three years (Table 2).
3.
The authorities’ focus is therefore on accelerating economic growth to improve
social conditions. Key elements of their medium-term strategy include policies to strengthen
financial intermediation, improve the business climate, and increase infrastructure
investment. While substantial progress has been achieved, some measures are encountering
bureaucratic and political resistance, driven in part by vested interests and ambivalence
toward foreign investment. As the 2009 elections approach, the authorities will also need to
resist pressures to achieve quick results through interventionist policies.
4.
Volatile portfolio inflows pose additional challenges for the authorities. These
include minimizing the erosion of competitiveness in labor-intensive manufacturing resulting
from real exchange rate appreciation, and avoiding new external vulnerabilities (e.g., to a
sudden reversal of inflows). Meanwhile, a slowdown in domestic credit growth in 2006 has
triggered pressure on the central bank and state-owned banks to ensure accelerated lending.
The recent loosening of prudential regulations in response to such pressures could risk the
reversal of some of the hard-won gains in financial sector stability.
II. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL BACKDROP
5.
Economic activity and fundamentals have strengthened and near-term prospects
are favorable:
•

Growth reached 5½ percent in 2006 as the dip in activity following the late 2005 fuel
price and interest rate hikes proved shallow. Strong exports compensated for weak
domestic demand. Although some leading consumption and investment indicators remain
sluggish, they have improved over the past year. Staff projects growth at 6 percent in
2007—the pace maintained since Q3 2006—with some shift from external to domestic
demand (Figure 1, Table 3).

•

The external current account surplus is projected to decline from 2¾ percent of GDP in
2006 to 2 percent in 2007 (Table 4). This assumes a significant slowdown in non-oil and
gas export value growth to 15 percent in 2007 (compared with 22 percent growth y/y in
the first quarter) in line with the projected moderation in global growth and commodity
prices. To the extent that the slowdown does not materialize, there are upside possibilities
for GDP growth in 2007.

•

Bank credit expansion supported the pick-up in GDP growth, as it recovered from its
weakness during the first half of 2006. Credit growth reached 17½ percent y/y in April.
Credit to businesses is now outpacing consumer credit, reversing the trend that prevailed
in recent years (Table 5).

•

Inflation has stabilized at around 6 percent. Bank Indonesia (BI) has lowered its policy
rate 425 bps since May 2006 as the inflation rate moved toward its end-2007 target range
of 5–7 percent, following the jump in late 2005.

•

Fiscal policy has been geared toward reducing the debt burden, while attempting to
accelerate development spending. The central government deficit increased modestly to
1.0 percent of GDP in 2006, as budget execution improved toward the end of the year
(Table 6). However, the central government fiscal impulse was fully offset by the
accumulation of regional government deposits, reflecting limited implementation
capacity at the regional level.

6.

Financial markets have rallied, supported by portfolio capital inflows:

•

Equity and bond markets have been buoyant since late 2005, interrupted only by global
market sell-offs in May–June 2006 and, more modestly, in February–March 2007. In
addition to increased global risk appetite, the rise in asset prices also reflected Indonesiaspecific factors, such as lower domestic interest rates and perceptions of reduced
vulnerability (Indonesian global bonds outperformed the EMBI index) (Figure 2).

•

Portfolio capital flows mirrored these developments as foreign investors have been
increasing their positions in Indonesian securities. Flows surged in April–May 2007 as
investors expected the rupiah to appreciate against the U.S. dollar to catch up with other
regional currencies.

•

After considerable prior volatility, the exchange rate remained broadly stable during
July 2006–April 2007, but appreciated by 3 percent in May vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, in
response to portfolio inflows, though some of this appreciation was reversed in early
June.

Vulnerability indicators improved further (Box 1):

•

Banking sector indicators strengthened recently in line with the performance of the
economy. The profitability of banks started to improve with BI’s rate cuts and widening
net interest margins—lending rates are less elastic than deposit rates with respect to the
policy rate. The system is well capitalized and private banks’ nonperforming loans
(NPLs) remain low (Table 7). State banks still have a high share of NPLs, although
recent restructurings cut this significantly. Both contingent claim indicators and stress test
analysis confirm the improving health of the banking sector under the macroeconomic
baseline scenario discussed below (Box 2, Figure 3).

•

Foreign exchange reserves have continued to accumulate, supported by the current
account surplus and capital inflows. Despite the early repayment of all obligations to the
Fund in 2006, standard indicators show adequate reserve levels (reserves covered
154 percent of short-term debt and 5 months of imports at end-2006).

•

Debt ratios continue to decline, with external debt projected at 31 percent of GDP at end
2007, reflecting net repayments of loans by banks and corporations, despite a recent
flurry of new external debt issuance.
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS

Outlook and Risks
8.
Indonesia’s medium-term prospects remain favorable as recent economic
progress is expected to continue (Table 8).
•

Growth is projected to pick up further, driven by domestic demand. Productivity gains
and increased investment could raise potential output growth to about 6½–7 percent.
However, this requires growth in investment of about 12 percent per annum, assuming
that the current pace of overall productivity growth is broadly maintained. While this
should be achievable, it assumes continued progress in improving the investment climate
and infrastructure, as well as in attracting FDI and greater integration into the regional
economy (selected issues paper). The authorities are somewhat more optimistic, with an
official medium-term target of 7½ percent.

•

Financial intermediation will need to deepen to support higher rates of investment.
Private sector credit is expected to expand faster than nominal GDP, reflecting a
continuation of the gradual trend of financial deepening and remonetization, supported by
declining inflation and interest rates, and growing demand for financial services. In
addition, capital markets should continue to gain in importance, continuing recent trends
based on the authorities’ efforts to promote nonbank financial development (see below).

9
BOX 1. 1997 VS. 2007: HOW FAR HAS CRISIS VULNERABILITY BEEN REDUCED?
The tenth anniversary of the Asian financial crisis provides an occasion for assessing Indonesia’s
progress in reducing the crisis vulnerabilities that proved so devastating in 1997. These various
sources of vulnerability, as well as some new potential concerns, are discussed in the accompanying
selected issues paper. The paper’s findings are summarized here:
• Macroeconomic policies are sound. While fiscal policy remains conservative (as in 1997), lower
credit growth and a more flexible exchange rate have reduced vulnerability. The real exchange rate
has appreciated, but remains below its 1997 level,

concern.
• Financial and corporate sector weaknesses have lessened. The recapitalization of the banking
sector and related regulatory and supervisory changes have substantially reduced the balance sheet
and corporate governance problems that proved so damaging in 1997 (in particular excessive foreign
borrowing and lending by banks to related corporate parties). Foreign borrowing (as a proportion of
foreign exchange reserves and in U.S. dollar terms) has declined significantly since 1997, as has the
share of domestic lending in foreign exchange. The level of nonperforming loans has declined, and is
in line with other countries. The

and a sudden increase in their
foreign borrowing could be a concern.
• However, a remaining source of vulnerability in the financial sector is the high share of state
banks (with generally inferior credit quality and more liable to pressure to lend for political reasons).
• Contagion remains a concern, given the increased capital market integration. While Indonesia’s
exposure to intra-regional contagion via trade flows or competitive devaluation remains relatively
limited, indicators of stock market comovement have increased.
• Major institutional reforms, particularly in the areas of governance and financial supervision, help
to minimize worries over the kinds of corporate-political links that helped to destabilize the financial
system in 1997. However, Indonesia continues to lag in terms of perceptions according to many
surveys (e.g., of corruption, despite some improvement).
Some of the new sources of vulnerability in Asia that have been touted appear, for Indonesia, to be
of less concern so far. Indonesia is less dependent on external growth than many other Asian countries
and its reserves build-up has been more limited. The surge in stock prices can be justified with reference
to fundamentals and a reduction in the previously very large risk premium compared with regional
markets.

10
BOX 2. UPDATE OF CONTINGENT CLAIMS (CCA) ANALYSIS FOR INDONESIA1
Markets continue to price in a historically low probability of default for banks and the
sovereign.2
•

Estimated average default probabilities of banks declined in 2007. The global equity
market sell-off in May 2006 raised default probabilities for all banks, but this effect
disappeared toward the end of 2006, in particular for private banks. State banks’
estimated default probability remained elevated through the remainder of 2006. This was
the result of a surge in volatility of the shares of one state-owned bank, related to market
perceptions of possible management and nonperforming loan problems. Other state
banks showed a decline in default probabilities similar to that of private banks.

The CCA analysis for the sovereign
confirms the improving outlook for

with CDS spreads, but remained at a
historically low level.

The distribution of risks in the banking system also improved in 2007. Risks are
more evenly distributed across banks, as estimated default probabilities for riskier banks
have declined more than for the banking system on average. However, the low
perception of bank credit risk by the market may be driven not only by expected
improvements in bank performance, but

Inflation is projected to decline to 3 percent in the medium term in line with BI’s target.
This requires that BI remains committed to achieving its targets, notwithstanding
pressures to ease interest rates to support the government’s near-term growth targets.

•

Public debt could fall to about 26 percent of GDP in 2012, if overall deficits remain
modest (gradually declining to 0.6 percent by 2012), consistent with current policies.

Risks to this positive medium-term baseline include external shocks as well as
possible domestic policy slippages.1
•

External shocks, such as a capital account shock or a global growth slowdown, would
lead to a temporary slowdown in activity. However, as vulnerabilities have declined, the
economy should be able to withstand moderate shocks (see Appendix I).
o Factors limiting the potential impact of external factors are the diversity of exports
(both regionally and with respect to products), limited external debt exposure, and
adequate reserve levels.
o Resilience of the banking system. Stress tests show that the banking system is
sufficiently strong to weather a moderate adverse external shock, thus limiting
possible adverse macro-financial sector feedbacks (Box 3). A financial sector safety
net is now largely in place (selected issues paper).
o A measured policy response would be important to contain the impact of external
shocks. This includes allowing the exchange rate to depreciate while using reserves to
cushion capital outflows and avoid extreme exchange rate movements, as well as
raising interest rates as needed to limit the impact on inflation.

•

Domestic policy slippages could lead to a more persistent slowdown in growth. As in the
past, slippages in monetary policy or doubts about debt sustainability could lead to capital
outflows. Lack of progress in structural reforms or investment in infrastructure could
soon lead to bottlenecks which would limit investment and potential growth. The risk of
growing nationalist sentiment—especially vis-à-vis foreign investment in natural
resources—could impede investment growth. In addition, pressures to boost bank lending
could lead to a deterioration of supervisory standards and increased financial sector
vulnerabilities. If this led to difficulties in the banking system, medium-term growth
would be adversely affected.

•

On the upside, growth could be higher than under the baseline projections if the pace of
structural reforms can be accelerated. In particular, a breakthrough to a more flexible
labor regime could unlock a higher growth potential in labor-intensive sectors such as
textiles and footwear.

1

Annex I describes in more detail the medium-term impact of three possible adverse shock scenarios: (1) a loss
in global risk appetite triggering emerging market capital outflows; (2) domestic policy slippages; and (3) a
slowdown in global growth.

14
BOX 3: STRESS TEST ANALYSIS—THE IMPACT OF ADVERSE MACRO SHOCKS ON BANKS1
Sufficient capital and the relatively low level of outstanding credit should enable Indonesian
banks to withstand moderate macroeconomic shocks:
• At end-2006 the Indonesian banking system was well capitalized as measured by the capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) and by the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets (leverage ratio). The Tier 1
ratio is a better metric to compare bank soundness in Indonesia, as reported CARs are high due to
large holdings of zero risk weighted assets, notably government bonds.
• Stress tests were performed on the 15 largest banks (accounting for 68 percent of banking
sector assets) using BI’s internal risk model. The impact was assessed based on the Tier 1 ratio: a
bank with a ratio of 4 percent is considered seriously under capitalized, while a ratio of 6 percent
is low but acceptable.
• The macro shock in this scenario is a loss of confidence triggering capital outflows. It also
involves exchange rate depreciation, lower growth, and higher inflation and interest rates (see
Scenario A, Annex I).
• The largest Indonesian banks should be able to resist this adverse shock without major
problems. However, some of the smaller banks of the group (accounting for 6 percent of assets)
would exhibit a material decline in their CAR and Tier 1 ratios. Liquidity should not be a problem,
as most banks have ample liquid assets: only four banks in the group (18 percent of banking
system assets) have less than 25 percent liquid assets.
• Negative feedbacks from the banking sector to the macroeconomy should thus be limited.
The largest banks with sufficient capital would be able to continue to provide credit to the
economy, although credit growth should slow down as the deteriorating macro environment raises
risks of new lending. Some smaller banks with materially declining capital ratios, on the other
hand, would see much sharper declines in new lending.
• Additional stress tests show the banking system’s vulnerability to different risks factors.
Exposure to credit risk is limited by the low share of loans to total assets. However, exposure and
risk could increase substantially if efforts to boost lending significantly were successful. Generally
low maturity mismatches and the high share of government bonds at floating rates limits interest
rate risk. Finally, small net open positions limit the exposure to exchange rate risk.

IV. DISCUSSIONS OF KEY POLICY CHALLENGES
10.
Against the background of strong macroeconomic performance and favorable
medium-term prospects, the discussions focused on the two main issues currently
confronting the authorities:
•

How to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability in an environment of capital
account volatility, especially in light of the surge in inflows in April/May 2007. The
authorities were concerned about the immediate effects of such inflows, as well as the
potential adverse effects of abrupt changes in investor sentiment and capital account
reversals.

•

How to deploy macroeconomic, financial, and structural policies to achieve even more
rapid and sustainable growth without undermining hard-won gains toward
macroeconomic and financial stability. This would enable faster progress toward
reducing unemployment and poverty, and alleviate political pressures to relax policies to
attain tangible economic results.
A. Dealing with Capital Inflows

Background and Staff Analysis
11.

Appreciation pressures on the rupiah intensified during May (Figure 4).

•

Portfolio capital inflows increased significantly around mid-April, reflecting both the still
significant interest rate differential, market expectations of rupiah appreciation, and
positive investor views on Indonesia’s vulnerabilities and fundamentals.

•

However, foreign exchange reserve accumulation moderated the extent of appreciation,
as BI continued to take advantage of the strong external position. Both net external debt
disbursements and some oil revenues are automatically purchased by BI and account for
most of the reserve accumulation in 2006-07. In addition, BI has intervened directly in
the market—mostly at times of increased capital flows. While net purchases have
dominated in 2006-07 (in contrast to 2005), there were also extended periods without
direct intervention and BI sold reserves in mid-2006 in response to portfolio outflows.

12.
In assessing the appropriate policy response to appreciation pressures, staff
discussed several issues with the authorities:
•

Valuation of the rupiah: Some estimates of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate
point to a modest undervaluation, as the recent boom in commodity prices has
appreciated the equilibrium rate. However, the evidence (using three different
methodologies), as well as other indicators, is far from conclusive (Box 4).

BOX 4. ASSESSMENT OF INDONESIA’S EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS
Estimates of the real effective exchange rate point to declining, though adequate,
competitiveness. As of April 2007, the REER has appreciated by around 24 percent from the low
level reached in September 2005. At the same time, the external current account improved by about
2½ percentage points of GDP between 2005 and 2006, in tandem with the run up in commodity
prices. According to the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) methodology (which estimates the
relation between fundamentals and real exchange rates using a cross-country panel regression), at end
May 2006, the value of the rupiah

performance has lagged its

well, overall market share has

by manufacturing exports. This is
likely related to a larger degree of
undervaluation in a number of

competitiveness identify several
structural impediments to strong external competitiveness. The International Institute for
Management Development and the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report rank
Indonesia lower than many other Asian countries, with the inadequate supply of infrastructure, and
inefficiencies in business and government as top impediments. The onus for boosting competitiveness
therefore rests on removing these structural impediments.

•

A primarily market-determined exchange rate is supportive of the inflation-targeting
framework. Attempts to target a specific exchange rate could create one-way bets and
trigger additional speculative inflows. Allowing the rupiah to appreciate, on the other
hand, improves inflation prospects and creates room for lower interest rates, weakening
incentives for further inflows.

•

Reserve levels are broadly sufficient according to standard indicators of reserve
adequacy. Modest further accumulation would be warranted, though, to protect against
volatile capital flows and further lower perceptions of vulnerabilities. However, the
sterilization cost of maintaining higher reserves (currently estimated at about 0.1 percent
of GDP for each US$10 billion in reserves) need to be taken into account.

13.

Staff thus recommended addressing any appreciation pressures as follows:

•

The monetary and exchange rate policy response should include: (i) allowing further
appreciation, (ii) possible intervention to limit excessively large exchange rate
movements, and (iii) further interest rate cuts provided that appreciation improves the
inflation outlook. This is broadly consistent with how inflows have been handled in
2006–07.

•

Export performance should best be supported through structural measures to enhance the
business climate (see below).

•

Deeper financial markets could help limit the impact of volatile portfolio flows on
domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. In addition, a broader range of available
financial instruments (including hedging) would enable domestic companies to better
deal with market volatility.

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
14.
BI officials broadly agreed with staff and considered that the current exchange
rate policy remains appropriate.
•

Flexible exchange rate: The authorities emphasized their commitment to the inflationtargeting regime and to a market-determined exchange rate.

•

The current real exchange rate level is viewed by BI as consistent with improved
fundamentals and is appropriate, but some appreciation or depreciation would not pose a
significant problem.

19
15.
Nevertheless, the authorities expressed concern over “hot money” flows
(portfolio holding of foreign investors) which raise the size of potential capital outflows.
•

Investments in short-term instruments, particularly central bank paper, were seen as
speculative investments that are costly and have the potential to disrupt the foreign
exchange market if positions unwind.

•

Need for reserves: BI officials pointed out that significant reserve levels are needed to
reduce vulnerability to “hot money” outflows. In that context, they would welcome some
additional accumulation in the future. However, they remain concerned about potential
sterilization costs.
B. How Much Room is There to Loosen Monetary Policy?

Background and Staff Analysis
16.
Inflation remains on-track to meet the end-2007 inflation target of 6±1 percent
(Figure 5):
•

Rising rice prices pushed up headline inflation modestly in early 2007. However, prices
have begun to decline in line with normal seasonal patterns, and administered prices have
remained stable. As a result, annual inflation declined to 6 percent in May.

•

The near-term inflation outlook is positive, as there are no signs of immediate price
pressures. The recent exchange rate appreciation contributes to the positive short-term
outlook. As a result, BI is signaling further rate cuts for 2007. However, too much focus
on the favorable near-term outlook carries the risk of rapid rate cuts, possibly worsening
the inflation outlook for 2008.

17.
Staff therefore recommended that the focus of monetary policy shift toward
meeting the 2008 target.
•

Staff’s conditional inflation forecasts indicate that the 2007 target of 6±1 percent will be
met and that the 2008 target of 5±1 percent remains within reach, assuming limited
additional rate cuts. Real interest rates are now slightly less than 3 percent (measured
against core inflation) below the historical (2000–07) average of 3½ percent, suggesting
that the current stance might already be slightly expansionary.

•

Additional rate cuts should be determined by forecast inflation for 2008 relative to the
target. With current and projected 2008 inflation above the midpoint of the 2008 target
range, BI should be cautious in cutting rates and take into account the significant lags in
the monetary transmission mechanism. However, further appreciation of the rupiah could
create room for lower rates.

•

Reducing macroeconomic volatility remains a key objective and monetary policy has an
important role to play. This includes continuing to reduce inflation to international levels
and avoiding sharp policy reversals, such as in 2005 when concerns about excessively
loose policies led to a loss of confidence and exchange rate depreciation. Further
strengthening the credibility of the inflation targeting regime could contribute to lower
macroeconomic volatility and staff made several recommendations in that regard,
including on the planned change in the maturity of the policy rate (Box 5).

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
18.
BI officials broadly agreed with staff but remained slightly more optimistic
regarding room for further rate cuts. However, they emphasized their continued
commitment to the inflation-targeting framework and to meeting the 2007 and 2008 targets.
BI considers high food prices as the key risk to the inflation outlook but remains confident
that it can meet the 2007 target range. While BI recognized that meeting the 2008 target will
be more difficult, BI officials believe the target remains achievable, even with additional rate
cuts, in light of recent rupiah appreciation.
C. Deepening Financial Intermediation While Safeguarding Stability
Background and Staff Analysis
19.
Financial intermediation remains low and access to long-term financing is
limited (Figure 6).
•

Bank credit continues to be the main form of financial intermediation. However, bank
credit sharply declined in the wake of the Asian crisis and has not yet recovered despite
significant credit growth in 2002–05. In late 2005 and 2006 credit growth slowed, due to
interest rate hikes and slowing economic activity, although it has since recovered.

•

Loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Banks still hold a significant share of their assets in
government bonds and central bank certificates (SBIs). In part, this reflects the
recapitalization bonds on banks’ balance sheets.

•

Availability of long-term financing is very limited, in part due to the relatively small size
of corporate bond and equity markets. In addition, the exceptionally short maturity of
bank deposits limits banks’ ability to provide long-term loans, in particular at fixed rates.

22
BOX 5: FURTHER IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INFLATION-TARGETING
FRAMEWORK
Transparency and Communication. Further improvements in this area would help signal
BI’s commitment to low and stable inflation and facilitate achieving the inflation target.
•

Clarity of the inflation target. Currently, most private sector analysts project 2008 inflation
slightly above the official target range, suggesting that either the target is not well
communicated, or only enjoys limited credibility. A stronger emphasis on inflation targets
beyond the current year could be useful to better anchor expectations.

•

Monetary policy and inflation reports. Explicit discussion of risks to the inflation outlook
and past inflation performance could improve credibility and predictability of BI’s reaction
to possible future shocks. In addition, consideration could be given to publishing explicit
inflation forecasts, after more experience has been gained with the forecasting framework.

•

BI’s public communication should be aligned as much as possible with the official
position, be less specific with regard to future interest rates or credit growth targets (which
could conflict with the inflation objective), and place less emphasis on growth.

•

The authorities’ view. BI officials emphasized recent improvements in the Monetary Policy
Report, including more forward-looking discussion and a more detailed treatment of risks.
They are considering publishing quantitative inflation forecasts.

Framework for Monetary Operations. BI intends to change the monetary policy rate to the
overnight interbank rate but has yet to announce a firm date.
•

Current framework. BI uses the 1-month SBI rate as the policy rate, while participation in
the overnight market is limited and rates are volatile. The new framework would facilitate
the development of the short end of the yield curve.

•

Key conditions for changing the policy rate:

•

o

A stable overnight rate is needed so that it can serve as an effective signal of the
monetary policy stance. Moreover, it is important that BI exerts sufficient control over
the new policy rate. This will require significant further progress, including in liquidity
forecasting and management. Introducing required reserve averaging could also
contribute achieving a more stable rate.

o

Development of the interbank market, including repos, is important to ensure that the
interbank market adequately reflects liquidity conditions, while at the same time
contributing to stabilizing the interbank rate. This would also facilitate convergence of
the level of overnight rate toward the current policy rate.

The authorities’ view. BI officials concurred on the need to strengthen the overnight
interbank market and highlighted ongoing work in that area, including efforts to develop
the repo market. In addition, progress toward implementing the treasury single account
(TSA) would facilitate liquidity forecasting and management.

Measures to stimulate credit growth have been taken recently.

•

Changes in prudential regulations. BI reduced capital requirements on banks by lowering
the risk weights on small and medium enterprise (SME) and mortgage loans in late 2006.
Subsequently, in April 2007 a relaxation of provisioning and loan classification rules, and
limitations on loans to borrowers with credit history problems, were announced. While
the measures are limited and intended to be temporary, some imply departures from
international standards and risk having an adverse signaling effect on supervisors and
banks.

•

Pressures on state banks: State banks have been under pressure from parts of the
government to limit investment in SBIs and to provide financing for infrastructure
projects.

21.
Empirical research and discussions with analysts suggest that low credit in
Indonesia reflects both supply and demand factors. Lack of demand from creditworthy
customers is the main reason for low credit, according to staff analysis (see selected issues
paper). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that there is unmet demand for long-term
credit to finance infrastructure, housing, and other projects. The problem is exacerbated by a
legal system that often prevents enforcement of creditor rights.2
22.
Discussions with the authorities focused on the following steps to promote
financial intermediation:
•

Improvements in the legal system resulting in greater protection of creditor rights would
encourage banks to lend, although such efforts would only yield results over the long
term.

•

The credit bureau should be expanded to also provide information on nonbank firms,
such as public utilities. This would encourage lending to creditworthy customers who
have never borrowed before.

•

State banks: Staff reiterated the need for a strategy on the role of state banks in
Indonesia’s banking system (as discussed comprehensively in the 2006 Article IV report).

•

Mortgage markets: Efforts are underway to develop markets for mortgage-backed
securities, including by removing legal, tax, and other impediments. This could be
expanded to cover other assets. In addition, the government could also explore expanding
the role of Ascrindo, a state-owned loan guarantee company, to include mortgages for
lower-middle income borrowers.

2

In addition to bank lending, weak legal protection is also an issue for bond financing, as highlighted by the
recent ruling of an Indonesian court declaring international bonds issued by Asia Pulp and Paper to be an
invalid debt that would not have to be honored.

25
•

Second-tier bank: A state-owned bank could be converted into a second-tier development
bank. This institution would be funded by issuing bonds and then, working through
banks, finance infrastructure projects or other long-term projects.

•

A deeper nonbank financial sector could be a significant source of long-term financing.
This includes developing equity and corporate bond markets, as well as developing an
institutional investor base such as pension funds and insurance companies, as proposed in
a recent World Bank study.3

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
23.
The authorities agreed on the need to strengthen financial intermediation and
long-term financing. The recently presented policy package includes a variety of measures,
including steps to strengthen the credit bureau, export financing, sharia banking, equity and
bond markets, the insurance industry, and the venture capital industry.4
24.
BI officials noted that recent prudential measures would not undermine the
soundness of the banking system. They emphasized that the measures are temporary and
subject to review. Moreover, some of the relaxations only apply to banks with strong risk
management practices, thus limiting risk.
25.
The authorities have agreed in principle to participate in an FSAP but have not
committed to specific timing. They emphasized that good preparation on their side will help
maximize the benefits of this exercise.
D. Fiscal Policy to Support Sustainable Growth
Background and Staff Analysis
26.
In supporting long-term growth, a key role of fiscal policy is to ensure adequate
pro-growth spending. Most importantly, this includes investment in infrastructure which
fell from a pre-crisis high of 6 percent of GDP annually to about 2–3 percent of GDP
following the crisis. Infrastructure indicators have deteriorated; the road network, port
facilities, and the electricity supply require substantial new investments. The government is
attempting to address this issue by forging partnerships with the private sector (PPPs). A
sound risk management framework has been established to safeguard public finances, but
poor project preparation often limits the start of PPPs.

27.
A modestly less restrictive fiscal stance is expected in 2007–08, to account for
weaker oil and gas revenues and the need to increase spending on infrastructure.
•

2007: Subject to parliamentary approval, the overall deficit is expected to reach
1.8 percent of GDP, compared to the original target of 1.1 percent of GDP (reflecting
lower oil and gas revenues, higher payments linked to natural disasters, clearance of
arrears to the state-owned electricity company, and higher fertilizer subsidy costs). A
modest increase in non-oil and gas tax revenues is expected from improvements in tax
administration.

•

2008: The authorities are targeting a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP. This takes into
account planned reductions in the corporate and personal income tax rates, and some
increase in personnel expenditures and infrastructure investment (about 0.5 percent of
GDP).

28.
A modestly higher deficit can be accommodated without jeopardizing financial
stability and the downward trend in debt ratios.
•

Falling debt burden. The currently projected deficits are consistent with a fall in the debtto-GDP ratio to 36 percent of GDP by end-2007 (from 39 percent of GDP in 2006) and
with the government’s target of reducing this ratio to about 30 percent of GDP by 2009.

•

Additional financing of the deficit can be secured mainly through higher concessional
loans and domestic bond issuance. Given its modest size, the latter would likely have a
limited impact on interest rates as there is sufficient demand for domestic government
bonds. However, if deficits were to increase beyond the levels currently envisaged, the
need for increased bank holdings of domestic bonds or higher portfolio capital inflows
could conflict with other policy objectives.

•

The risks to the fiscal outlook are mostly linked to higher energy prices (assuming no
price adjustments), lack of progress on tax administration, and additional tax incentives
as part of the new investment package.

29.
Additional measures could be sought to create fiscal space (selected issues paper),
given the expected decline in oil and gas revenues and the tax rate cuts planned for 2008–10.
These include:
•

Increasing further non-oil and gas tax revenues. As gains from tax administration are
likely to take effect only gradually, the introduction of new tax policy measures could be
considered, including raising the property tax rate, removing some exemptions (such as
restaurant and hotel services) or introducing a fringe benefits tax. The granting of tax
holidays and rate reductions should be avoided.

27
•

Efforts to limit non-productive expenditures, such as reducing administrative expenses
and phasing out untargeted energy subsidies by gradually raising retail fuel prices and
introducing an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism.

•

Improving local governments’ ability to increase infrastructure investment, including
through co-financing schemes and encouraging a better spending allocation before
approving regional budgets.

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
30.
The government is committed to fiscal discipline. The authorities are not
considering a deficit beyond 1.8 percent of GDP in 2007–08.
31.
Within that context, the government is determined to alleviate infrastructure
bottlenecks, including through use of public resources. The strategy is to boost
infrastructure spending in 2008 while keeping the central government deficit to 1.8 percent of
GDP. However, new tax policy measures are unlikely to be adopted prior to approval of the
tax package currently in Parliament. Moreover, increases in retail fuel prices before the 2009
elections would be politically difficult. However, the authorities pointed out that early
progress should be possible in the following two areas:
•

Enhancing revenue: The authorities consider that tax administration improvements,
combined with future tax rate cuts, will help broaden the tax base and give a significant
boost to revenues. They agreed that the staff’s above proposals, as well as some
additions, could be envisaged in the medium term.

•

Higher priority spending by local governments: The authorities are encouraging local
governments to use the large deposits accumulated in commercial banks to increase
priority spending, notably in education, health, and infrastructure. The threat of sanctions
facilitated early adoption of regional budgets in 2007 and regional spending is expected
to increase further in 2008 and beyond as local governments’ implementation capacity
improves. However, sub-national data reporting remains weak.
E. Structural Reforms to Improve the Investment Climate

Background
32.
The investment climate still compares poorly in cross-country surveys. In
particular, strict labor legislation and a difficult legal and regulatory environment are
considered impediments for higher investment and compare poorly within the region.
33.
Progress has been made in several areas of the government’s structural reform
agenda (Table 9).

28

•

The Investment Law was passed in March. The law provides equal treatment to domestic
and foreign investors, allows for longer work permits for expatriates, extends the number
of years for which land can be leased, and states explicitly that investors are entitled to
repatriate and transfer funds in foreign exchange and that disputes between the
government and investors can be settled through international arbitrage. In addition, the
law allows the Minister of Finance to issue regulations to provide various tax incentives.

•

However, efforts to make the labor market more competitive are proceeding slowly.
Indonesia’s labor market is among the least competitive in the region with high severance
payments making layoffs very costly and restricting the ability of firms to adapt to shifts
in market demand.5

The Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
34.
The authorities emphasized their determination to press ahead with structural
reforms but cautioned that reforms in politically sensitive areas will take time. Specific
plans include:
•

Fiscal reforms: (i) the issuance of government regulations necessary for the
establishment of a treasury single account; (ii) more regular monitoring of regional
governments and public enterprise operations; and (iii) introducing a statement of fiscal
risks and a medium-term fiscal framework.

•

Investment climate: The next step is to complete the implementing regulations relating to
the Investment Law expeditiously. A package of specific measures to improve the

5

Labor market issues are discussed in detail in Chapter VII of IMF Country Report No. 05/327.

29
investment climate and support small and medium enterprises (in addition to measures on
infrastructure and the financial sector, discussed above) was presented in June.
•

Labor reform would continue, albeit without comprehensive legislative reforms. Efforts
to link the reforms on severance payments to using well-managed pension funds to
provide limited benefits to workers in case of unemployment hold promise. This could
help to attract investment and support job-creation in the labor-intensive sectors.

•

State-owned enterprises (SOEs): following the cabinet reshuffle, the authorities indicated
their intention to develop a new strategy for SOEs, including a revival of the privatization
agenda. This includes the planned sale of a 30 percent stake in the state bank BNI.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

35.
Achievements. Since the last Article IV consultation, Indonesia has seen strong
growth, as well as declining inflation and balance sheet vulnerabilities. To some extent, this
reflects favorable global and regional factors, but appropriate macroeconomic policies and
political stability have also played a crucial role. Progress has also been made in building
macroeconomic institutions, especially in the fiscal area. However, continued high poverty
and unemployment have tended to devalue the gains toward stability in the eyes of much of
the population.
36.
Key challenges. Indonesia is well positioned to take advantage of continued
favorable global conditions. With stronger financial intermediation, especially better
availability of long-term financing, additional investment in infrastructure, and an improved
investment climate, growth could be sustained at least in the 6–7 percent range necessary to
alleviate poverty and unemployment. This would probably involve more integration in the
global economy, including regional production chains. Such integration, however, can
increase risks, enhancing the need for continued sound macroeconomic policies.
37.
Declining vulnerabilities. Improved fundamentals, including lower debt and higher
reserves, have increased resilience to adverse shocks. The banking system is well capitalized,
profitability has improved, and stress tests suggest it is capable of withstanding reasonable
adverse shocks. Experience from two recent episodes of financial market turbulence and
scenario analysis suggests that Indonesia should be able to withstand moderate external
shocks relatively well. That said, the recent flurry in corporate external debt issuance
suggests that private sector borrowing needs to be monitored closely to detect any future
vulnerabilities at an early stage.
38.
Capital inflows and external stability. With a relatively small current account
surplus, which is projected to move into deficit over time, and relatively modest net capital
inflows (at least so far), macroeconomic pressures are manageable. Nevertheless, even with a
generally benign global financial environment, portfolio inflows have been volatile and have
led to significant price swings in Indonesia’s shallow asset markets. The authorities remain
committed to exchange rate flexibility but are concerned about the impact of exchange rate

30
appreciation on the labor-intensive manufacturing sector as well as the possibility of a
reversal of portfolio inflows. Staff feels that these risks can be minimized, in case of further
surges in inflows, through a combination of policies including allowing further rupiah
appreciation, intervention to limit excessive exchange rate movements, and additional
interest rate cuts, provided that appreciation improves the inflation outlook.
39.
Exchange rate level. Evidence on external competitiveness is mixed. REER
measures suggest a modest undervaluation, as reflected in the current account surplus.
However, the performance of manufacturing exports has been modest relative to trading
partners, as high commodity prices have strengthened the real exchange rate. On balance,
some appreciation could take place without jeopardizing the external position. In any event,
there is little to suggest that the authorities should diverge from the current macroeconomic
policy mix, but should focus on structural measures to enhance competitiveness.
40.
Reducing inflation. BI can make an important contribution to limiting capital
account volatility by ensuring the convergence of inflation and interest rates with major
trading partners. With the 2007 inflation target well within reach, monetary policy should
now focus on achieving the 2008 target. While the recent rupiah appreciation and moderating
core inflation may have opened room for limited interest rate cuts, BI needs to exercise
caution and allow time for past rate cuts to affect the real economy.
41.
Monetary policy effectiveness. The inflation-targeting framework has helped BI to
regain credibility, but further improvements in transparency and communication could
bolster confidence in its policies. BI also needs to be mindful that its policy communications
to the public do not give mixed signals about policy priorities.
42.
Financial policies. Staff believes the recent relaxation of prudential regulations to
encourage lending is not likely to have much impact as demand constraints are mostly at
play. However, the steps represent a departure from international standards and risk having
an adverse signaling effect on supervisors and banks alike. BI should therefore reconsider the
appropriateness of the measures as soon as possible. Moral suasion to encourage banks to
lend to specific sectors could result in credit misallocation and should also be avoided.
Instead, steps to promote the development of capital markets and instruments of longer-term
financing would be more effective in the long run and help to preserve the soundness of the
financial sector. Also, a strategy on the future role of state banks is needed. Staff encourages
the authorities to confirm a date for the FSAP, as this could help to identify areas for further
improvement in the financial system.
43.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal stance is appropriate. The modest increase in the deficit
target for 2007 and 2008 from earlier projections should create some room for additional
development spending. However, the authorities should not go beyond the 1.7–1.8 percent
deficits currently envisaged in light of potential negative consequences of higher debt
financing. The authorities’ objective of lowering public debt to about 30 percent of GDP by
2009 remains appropriate. Further improvements in tax administration, some new tax

31
measures, and the streamlining of expenditures, including through greater flexibility of
energy prices, could create additional space for priority spending.
44.
Fiscal reform. Good progress is being made on fiscal structural reforms. With the
restructuring of the tax agency completed, the recent adoption of a key tax reform bill should
improve revenue collection and contribute to improving the investment climate. Staff
supports the planned introduction of a fiscal risk statement and the medium-term fiscal
framework in the 2008 budget.
45.
Structural reform. Accelerating structural reforms further would help to entrench
the recovery in growth. The passage of the much awaited investment and tax administration
laws are important steps. The authorities should now focus on, modifications in labor
regulations to alleviate the burden of severance payments on employment generation and
facilitating public private partnerships in infrastructure (in addition to more budgetary
spending) while ensuring that they are adequately prepared and assessed.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

32

Table 1. Indonesia: The Authorities’ Response to Recent Fund Policy Advice
Advice from the 2006 Article IV Discussions

Actions Taken

Monetary and exchange rate policy
The downward trend in inflation has created room for
reducing the policy rate, but a cautious approach to
further reduction will help maintain BI’s credibility.

BI reduced interest rates by a further 350 basis points between July 2006 and
May 2007 and signaled additional rate cuts in 2007. Inflation has trended
downwards and remains within the 2007 target range.

BI should intervene symmetrically to smooth
fluctuations in the exchange market and limit volatility
in the rupiah.

BI’s interventions in the foreign exchange market have been limited over the
past year, with the exception of April-May 2007, when there was sustained
upwards pressure on the rupiah from capital inflows. Direct intervention has
focused on limiting short-run volatility, although with pressure generally in
one direction the intervention has also been somewhat asymmetric.
Fiscal policy

Fiscal deficit targets of 1.2 percent and 0.9 percent of
GDP in 2006 and 2007, respectively, are appropriate.

The fiscal deficit in 2006 was 1.0 percent of GDP. The projected deficit in
2007, 1.8 percent of GDP, is higher than originally targeted but remains
appropriate and will still allow for a continued reduction in the debt to GDP
ratio.

Fuel price adjustments should be depoliticized by the
introduction of a mechanism for automatic adjustments
of energy prices.

Energy prices are still fixed, with fuel prices at about 90 percent of
international spot prices.

Create a Single Treasury Account to ensure better fiscal
management.

The cash management regulations, which are crucial for the establishment of a
Single Treasury Account, are expected to be signed soon.

Improvements are needed in a number of areas to better
assess fiscal risks, including monitoring of SOEs,
reporting of quasi-fiscal and extra-budgetary activities
and monitoring contingent liabilities.

A fiscal policy office, risk management unit, debt unit, and directorates for
monitoring regional governments and public enterprises have been set up and
are operational. A statement of fiscal risks and a medium-term fiscal
framework will be introduced in the 2008 budget.
Financial sector

State Banks to take haircuts and resolve NPL problems
at State Banks.
Medium-term privatization strategies should be adopted
for public banks that do not have a clear public policy
objective.
The authorities should participate in an FSAP.

A presidential decree has been issued allowing State Banks to take haircuts.
NPLs at State Banks declined by around 5 percentage points, to 10.7 percent,
at the end of 2006.
The government plans to sell shares in a major state bank (equivalent to 30
percent of capital), while the new Minister of State-Owned enterprises is
revisiting divestment plans for SOEs more generally.
The authorities have agreed in principal to participate in an FSAP, but have yet
to commit to a date.
Structural reforms

Early approval of at least one or two of the customs,
investment and tax laws should be pursued.

The customs law and investment law have been approved, as has a key tax law.

Improve flexibility in the labor market.

Legislative reform has been set aside because of opposition by unions, but
authorities are trying to modify regulations to limit severance payments.

APPENDIX I. INDONESIA: MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK UNDER ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS
AND PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
This annex compares the medium-term outlook under the baseline with three alternative
scenarios based on: (i) a tightening of global liquidity conditions; (ii ) stalled structural
reforms; and (iii) a global economic slowdown. It also analyzes the impact of several
exogenous shocks on the sustainability of public sector debt and external debt.
I.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

A: Tightening of global liquidity conditions, reflected in a widening of bond spreads and a
net outflow of portfolio capital of around US$10 billion during 2008.
Policy response: BI is assumed to increase the policy rate by around 300bps relative to the
baseline to stem the capital outflow, stabilize the exchange rate, and limit the impact on
inflation.
Projections: Reserves decline to around 150 percent of short-term debt in 2008 (below the
baseline, but comfortably above conventional reserves adequacy measures; see Chart), while
the exchange rate depreciates by about 15 percent. With demand hit by higher interest rates
and depressed sentiment, GDP growth declines to 4.8 percent. The nominal depreciation
boosts inflation to 7 percent, although higher interest rates contain the increase. The current
account surplus is higher than under the baseline (Figure 1).
B. Lack of progress on the structural agenda
Policy response: The authorities are assumed to relax fiscal and monetary policies to support
growth.
Projections: In the absence of continued reforms, output growth gradually falls back to
5.0 percent over the medium term, as low investment slows productivity gains.
Macroeconomic policy implementation also weakens, as the authorities relax monetary and
fiscal policy to stimulate growth. On the fiscal side, the overall central government deficit
increases to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2008. However, this expansion still allows the ratio of
public debt to GDP to decline. Interest rates are also lower than under the baseline. With a
more expansionary monetary and fiscal stance, inflation increases to a little under 7 percent,
outside BI’s target range for 2008.
C. Global growth slowdown. Driven by a sharp slowdown in the US economy, global
economic growth declines by just over 2 percentage points relative to the baseline in 2008,
while oil and other commodities decline in price, as do both the value and volume of
Indonesian exports. Spreads increase modestly due to heightened risk perceptions.

42

Policy response: Interest rates are unchanged relative to the baseline, as output and inflation
concerns broadly offset each other. The fiscal deficit narrows slightly as the net effect of the
oil price decline is positive (via lower subsidies and transfers to subnational governments as
domestic energy prices are assumed unchanged).
Projections: Lower exports plus multiplier effects on domestic demand affect GDP growth.
With the exchange rate depreciating, inflation picks up to around 6.3 percent, outside BI’s
target range for 2008. The current account surplus narrows due to lower export receipts.
Combined with a modest decline in portfolio inflows, the lower current account surplus leads
to a slowdown in reserves accumulation.
II.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO

A. Public Debt
1.
The public sector debt ratio has declined steadily from 65 percent of GDP at
end-2002 to an estimated 39 percent at end-2006 (Figure 2). This reflects the
government’s fiscal consolidation policy, declining interest rates, and growth in real GDP.
The share of debt held by foreign creditors (mostly multilateral institutions) has declined to
less than 50 percent. This trend is likely to continue as the authorities increasingly tap the
domestic bond market.
2.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt is expected to decline to around
26 percent of GDP by 2012. In terms of government revenues, public sector debt will
decline from 203 percent to 157 percent over the 2006-12 period. These results are based on
the key assumptions underlying the baseline projections for 2007-12, specifically that:
(1) real GDP growth rebounds to 6-7 percent; (2) the primary surplus averages around
0.2 percent of GDP; and (3) average nominal interest rates on public debt gradually decline
to around 3 percent by the end of the
Public Sector Debt

period.

by around 10 percentage points of GDP,
with the impact falling to 7–8 percentage points by 2012. Other macroeconomic shocks have
a more limited impact.

43
B. External Debt
4.
Indonesia’s external debt has also declined steadily since the crisis, from over 150
percent of GDP in 1998 to around 37 percent in 2006 (Figure 3). External debt as a
percentage of exports has also declined, from 288 percent to 116 percent, over the same
period.
5.
External debt dynamics are sustainable under the baseline scenario, with the
debt to GDP ratio declining to less than 20 percent by 2012. The main factors driving
these favorable dynamics are: (1) real GDP growth projected to increase to 6-7 percent over
the medium term; (2) a projected positive growth- interest rate differential; and (3) an
expected increase in non-debt-creating capital inflows.
6.
External debt sustainability
is most vulnerable to shocks to the
exchange rate. A one-time 30 percent
real exchange rate depreciation would
raise the debt ratio by around
20 percentage points in 2007, with the
impact declining to around
15 percentage points over the baseline
by 2012.

Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
The World Bank’s CAS for Indonesia was extended by one year to FY08 (from July 2007
to June 2008) to coincide with Indonesia’s scheduled graduation from IDA funding. The
Bank Group’s strategy remains strongly aligned to that of the government and the CAS
program remains relevant. The CAS continues to address the two fundamental problems
impeding rapid poverty reduction: (i) a weak investment climate and (ii) the lack of quality
service delivery to the poor. Both of these challenges, in turn, arise from the same
fundamental cause—weak governance, which is the overarching focus of the CAS. In
addition, the significant expansion of the Bank program and quick redeployment of resources
to post-disaster efforts (notably in Aceh and Yogyakarta/Central Java) in the context of
perennial natural disasters call for a greater emphasis on natural disaster management within
the CAS. Lastly, given the good track record of reform, continued financing need, strong
macroeconomic indicators, and improved creditworthiness, the CAS supports the request by
government to recalibrate assistance toward more program lending vis-à-vis the on-going
Development Policy Lending (DPL) program and the Infrastructure DPL currently under
preparation. Moving forward, as the Bank commences preparation of the next CAS, close
coordination with the IMF is expected across key areas of the policy dialogue.
World Bank Engagement: Selected Highlights
Improving the climate for high quality investment: The DPL program, coupled with
targeted projects, a large Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) program, and International
Finance Corporation (IFC) interventions are supporting policy and institutional reforms for
higher growth. Reforms supported by DPLs have helped consolidate macroeconomic
stability, a key concern among investors; enhanced competitiveness of the financial sector;
streamlined procedures for business start-up, trade, and customs; improved tax
administration; and promoted small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). A robust
dialogue on infrastructure provision is addressing a key constraint to growth. Key issues
being addressed through technical assistance (TA) include regulatory reforms, new
legislation, risk management, and public private partnerships (PPP). A strategy to mobilize
long-term private financing through nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) has been
developed and a project establishing infrastructure and guarantee funds is currently under
preparation. The IFC has complemented Bank work in several of these areas, including local
financing of infrastructure, business licensing, and SME development. Bank Group activities
have focused on the rural investment climate, with a set of projects to help modernize
services to farmers and fishing communities and to address related issues on water
management, agricultural services, agribusiness, land titling, irrigation, and coral reef
protection.

4

Making Service Delivery Responsive to the Poor: Bank efforts have strongly supported
improvements in quality and relevance of, and equitable access to education, water and
sanitation (WSS), and health services. Activities have focused on strengthening capacity and
systems, and changing the way services are managed and delivered top-to-bottom to improve
results. Financial support in education targets the full range of issues from early childhood
development (ECD) to tertiary education. The Bank has supported an education sector
review and the development of a comprehensive national medium-term strategy (RENSTRA)
covering all levels of education, formal and non-formal. A series of Provincial Health
Projects (PHPs) were designed to help clarify the roles of different levels of government.
Interventions have also aimed at district health administrations’ capacities and making
service planning and delivery more participatory and accountable. The focus is on areas
where indicators lag behind neighboring countries: maternal and child health, and nutrition.
CDD approaches in WSS and the GEG program seek to inculcate a more sanitary and
healthier environment. The Bank is currently involved in the government’s National Program
of Community Empowerment (PNPM) and a Conditional Cash Transfer Program. Several of
these service delivery efforts are supported by a new policy pillar within the DPL program,
including teacher certification, program assessments, and multi-year careover of community
spending.
Addressing the Core Issue of Governance: The World Bank recognizes governance as the
most critical cross-sectoral issue and, hence, has positioned it at the core of the Bank’s work
program. The DPL program and particularly the Government Financial Management and
Revenue Administration Program (GFMRAP) are designed to improve public administration,
particularly in the area of public financial management. Along with well targeted
interventions, such as Public Expenditure Reviews, trust funded programs supporting
corruption prevention and civil service reform, the relatively large CDD portfolio are
resulting in progress toward strengthening accountability, functional streamlining and
modernization of processes both at the national, subnational, and community levels. Via the
multi-donor Decentralization Support Facility (DSF), the Bank works with other donors to
improved decentralization and donor effectiveness.
Program for the Recovery of Aceh and Nias: The Bank is deeply engaged in the recovery
of Aceh and Nias, with a focus on post-tsunami reconstruction, institution building,
analytical support and monitoring of progress. Using all its available instruments over the
past two and half years, the Bank mobilized an Aceh reconstruction program substantial in
scope and objectives. The Bank has played a vital role in putting in place key elements for
the management of the reconstruction effort and coordinating the response of the
international community. Immediately after the tsunami in partnership with the Netherlands,
the Bank established a multi-donor office in Banda Aceh, and made the facilities available to
all donors working in Aceh. With a relatively modest Bank contribution of US$25 million in
grant resources from IBRD net income, the Bank’s country team has leveraged and
mobilized significant donor support. The Bank has mobilized over US$660 million
(commitment) for reconstruction, including the Multi-Donor Fund (MDF) with 15 donors (in

5
the amount of some US$547 million in grants), restructured ongoing community driven
(CDD) operations and added Aceh focused activities in new IDA projects, donor cofinancing of IDA projects and JSDF grants. The community based housing approach
deployed by the Bank in Aceh under the MDF housing project, has been indicated by the
Government of Indonesia as the model for the massive housing reconstruction program in
Yogyakarta and Central Java, following the May 2006 earthquake. At government’s request,
the Bank has established the Multi-donor Java reconstruction Fund (JRF), primarily
supporting housing reconstruction with total value of pledge US$79 million. Given
Indonesia’s geographic location and vulnerability to natural disasters, Disaster Management
has become an important component of the Bank’s country strategy.
New Lending Operations: As of March 2007, the Bank’s active portfolio comprised
31 projects with a total net commitment of US$2.6 billion. In FY07, in total, 6 projects are
likely to be delivered with total lending volume at US$1.2 billion. A third Development
Policy Loan (DPL3) was approved for a loan amount of US$600 million in December 2006.
DPL3 also enjoyed financial support from Japan and AsDB. Others include Strategic Roads
Infrastructure (US$208 million), FEATA (US$92 million), KDP additional financing
(US$123 million), UPP additional financing (US$136 million) and Better Employment and
Redeployment (BERMUTU)(US$86 million). In addition, 5 Aceh and Nias MDF projects
(US$197 million) and 3 projects under JRF (US$67 million) were approved.
Analytic and Advisory Activities
There is sustained Bank engagement in policy dialogue with GOI, on the direction and
substance of its economic, structural, and institutional reform agenda. The AAA program has
been organized around five “breakthrough” themes: (1) investment climate, (2) reducing
poverty, (3) improving decentralized service delivery, (4) improving governance and the
more recently introduced, and (5) progress and constraints in the recovery of Aceh and Nias.
The “flagship reports” in related areas, the stand-alone policy notes and think pieces, and day
to day informal dialogue between Bank staff and government counterparts, are providing
support to GOI in making informed policy choices and in defining the shape of supporting
Bank programs. In FY07, as of end-April, 7 reports were delivered and a few more reports
are expected by end of June. These include, for example, Poverty Assessment, Public
Expenditure Reviews and NBFI Study.

ANNEX III. INDONESIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of June 20, 2007)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) cumulative loans to Indonesia exceeded $21.5 billion at endDecember 2006. In 2006, the ADB approved a total of $784.8 million or 10.2 percent of the total
loans approved by the institution for the year. The assistance provided financing mainly for two
programs to strengthen macroeconomic management, governance and investment climate and to
accelerate infrastructure development in Indonesia. It also covered project loans for aquaculture
development for food security, private and public madrasah education at the primary, junior and
secondary levels, the setting up an infrastructure project development facility, and a $75 million loan
through ADB’s private sector window for the South Sumatra to West Java (SSWJ) Phase II Gas
Pipeline project as part of a larger $652.5 million project. ADB also arranged a $125 million B loan
from commercial lenders for the SSWJ Project. ADB also approved a $10 million grant to Indonesia
following the devastating earthquake in Central Java and Yogyakarta. During 2006, the ADB
continued its support for the post-tsunami reconstruction in Aceh and Nias through its grant-financed
Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project.
In 2006 the ADB Board endorsed the Indonesia Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2006–09. The
CSP aims to help the government achieve higher levels of pro-poor sustainable growth and to
enhance social development, with a key thematic focus on governance and capacity development in
all operations. Five areas of engagement were derived to address the main constraints to development:
improved infrastructure and infrastructure services, deepened financial sector, improved
decentralization, accelerated MDG achievement, and strengthened environment and natural resources
management. A public sector lending and non-lending program has been agreed round these areas of
engagement.
Between 1967 and 2006, ADB also provided 484 Technical Assistance grants to Indonesia amounting
to $247.5 million, or 8.2 percent of the total number of TA grants approved during this period. The
TA grants were financed from ADB’s Technical Assistance Special Fund, the Japan Special Fund,
and other sources. In 2006, seven TA grants amounting to $7.1 million was approved, and represented
2.9 percent of total TA grants approved by ADB during the year.

ANNEX IV. INDONESIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES2
1.
Indonesia has been a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
since September 1996, observing most of the SDDS requirements. Exceptions include the
currency composition in the reserve template in the first quarter of 2007, 2005 general
government operation data, and timeliness in the production index data due to short delays.
Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics and statistical base are broadly adequate to conduct
effective surveillance.
Real Sector
2.
Annual national accounts data are based on a 2000 base year. Quarterly GDP data are
published in a timely manner for both expenditure and production sides. The estimates are
based on a limited set of indirect indicators of uncertain quality. Although some sectors are
influenced strongly by seasonality, seasonally adjusted data are prepared but not published,
and no survey of nonfinancial services is conducted. An economic census of businesses is
undertaken every 10 years, but not updated in the intervening periods. The household budget
survey does not cover higher income households. There are inconsistencies with Bank
Indonesia (BI) in imports and exports; and, possibly with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) with
regard to local government figures. The five-yearly input-output tables remove the statistical
discrepancy, but there are large discrepancies in the intervening years. The staff have
recommended: (i) development of a system to continuously update the census of businesses;
(ii) introduction of comprehensive annual establishment surveys for nonfinancial services
industries; (iii) publication of annual GDP estimates, including a time series of at least 20
years; (iv) development of a set of annual supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from 2000;
(v) expedited conversion to the 1993 System of National Accounts; and (vi) enhancing the
convergence exercise on trade data with BI.
3.
Labor market data, including wages and employment, are available, albeit reported
with some delay, through the annual labor market survey (Sakernas) published by the Bureau
of Statistics. Data are also available on minimum and maximum wages for the formal sector.
Quarterly data are available on industrial wages, again with some delay.
Public Finance
4.
Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of
classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on budgetary central government were
available until recently with a one-month lag, but subnational (provincial and local)
government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of this data is
variable. Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by the recent
decentralization initiatives, which have shifted substantial resources to the subnational

Assessment Framework, prepared by STA in March 2005.

9

governments. At the same time, substantial efforts are in train, and significant progress has
been made, on a wide front, to overcome these problems, ranging from the planned adoption
of advanced accounting and statistical standards, to the introduction of best practice budget
management processes, and development of computerized financial management information
systems.
5.
Against this background, the MoF and the Ministry of Home Affairs are committed to
keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, so as to
make better statistical monitoring one of the deliverables of the current efforts. Reflecting the
close link between this major reform process and its impact on data reporting, it should be
noted that the one-month lag on central government reporting lengthened significantly, but
temporarily, in the course of 2007 as a new treasury system was put in place; this should
reverse itself as the reform is fully implemented. The coverage and timeliness of public debt
statistics is generally adequate; however, only limited information on contingent liabilities is
available. The new expenditure classification introduced in the 2005 budget, is generally
consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on functional
codes and classification , although the data are compiled on a cash basis.
6.
The authorities have committed to full adoption of the GFSM 2001 standards. To this
end, the Fund staff has recommended in the short term: (i) establishment of a register of all
extrabudgetary units to improve the coverage of central government activity; and (ii)
inclusion of the economic codes consistent with the GFSM 2001 in the chart of account to
ensure that general government units report in a statistically meaningful way all transactions
and balances over which they exert control. Over the medium-term, priority should be given
to (i) seizing the opportunity offered by the two new subnational fiscal reform efforts3 to
simultaneously establish the underlying reporting arrangements to obtain timely preliminary
data for local government statistics; and (ii) to develop GFSM 2001 operating statements,
statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial balance sheets, all of which should be
published on the MoF websites. The latter should facilitate to the adoption of a full accrual
accounting basis for all budget transactions.
Monetary Accounts
7.
Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by the BI on a timely basis. With STA
assistance, BI has developed an integrated database from which alternative presentations of
monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund. Further work,
however, is needed to expand the coverage of depository corporations to include mutual
funds (REKSA DANA), which report data to BAPEPAM—an agency that supervises some
of the nonbank financial institutions. To this end, BI is currently developing institutional
data-sharing arrangements that would enable it to access the register of—and data on—
mutual funds.

Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration (GRMRAP) and Local Government Finance
and Governance Reform (LGFGR) projects.

10

8.
To strengthen monetary statistics, STA missions have recommended: (i) collection of
source data on mutual funds in a format that meets statistical requirements; (ii) expansion of
the coverage of the monetary statistics to include mutual funds; and (iii) harmonization of the
reported interbank positions between the BI and commercial banks
Balance of Payments
9.
Trade data are affected by shortcomings. While customs sources utilized by BI are
considered generally reliable, coverage of merchandise trade flows is insufficient. Also,
when the online reporting system for exports and imports was introduced in 2004, the
historical series were reconstructed only as far back as 2003. Therefore, prior to 2003,
balance of payments statistics are not entirely consistent with the national accounts estimates.
Data on services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodologies. BI adjusts the
customs data to cover exports and imports of Batam and other bonded zones. Data on
services suffer from outdated surveys and weak methodology. Adjustments are also made to
data on compensation of employees and workers remittances to cover professional workers,
legal workers not reported to the Ministry of Manpower, and illegal workers.
10.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of
FDI data needs substantial improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan
disbursements to companies that have foreign equity and the application of a fixed ratio to
the loan disbursements data to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect
FDI data have a low response rate and the directory of enterprises requires enhancement in
terms of its coverage. Other areas that need improvement include the recording of trade
credits and the assets data for portfolio investment and other investment transactions. The
magnitude of the errors and omissions item has been significant and appears to be related to
the methodology used, for instance, for unrecorded assets in the financial account. Financial
transactions data have not been reconciled with changes in the International Investment
Position (IIP).
11.
BI has proposed a range of measures to address these weaknesses. On trade-related
data, a working group has been established to reconcile differences between BI and customs
data. BI is planning to collect and publish data on goods imported for processing, goods
procured in ports by carriers, and transactions with the oil and gas sector. On the financial
account, BI is planning to collect and publish data on direct investment abroad, portfolio
investment assets, other investment assets, and trade credits, to help address some of the
identified shortcomings in the recording of private financial flows.
International Investment Position
12.
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably
for FDI. External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an
External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002. The system records external debt of
government and over 800 other entities that report to the BI on a monthly basis. The data that
this system generates for public sector external debt and debt service, as well as those for

11

private banks, are considered reliable. However, improvements are still needed with respect
to components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between
scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector
payments arrears, and in estimating rescheduling and debt reductions received by the private
sector from external creditors.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 18, 2007

1.
This statement provides an update on recent economic developments based on
information received after the staff report was issued. The new information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation has fallen further in June and high frequency indicators suggest that
the recent robust pace of economic growth is being maintained. CPI inflation declined to
5.8 percent y/y in June (compared with 6.0 percent in May). Meanwhile, core inflation eased
to 5.4 percent. Bank Indonesia cut its policy interest rate by another 25 bps to 8.25 percent at
its July 5 Board meeting. Latest short-term indicators suggest that the economy continues to
expand at an annual rate of about 6 percent, in line with staff’s projections. Exports continue
to perform well, in line with staff projections. The trade surplus narrowed slightly as a result
of rising imports in recent months, in particular non-oil and gas exports. The trade balance
remained broadly unchanged as a reflecting rising imports in recent months.
3.
Rupiah appreciation pressures have eased as the strong portfolio inflows during
April/May subsided in June. Foreign investors reduced their positions in fixed income
securities, although moderate inflows into the stock market continued. As a result, the rupiah
weakened in June to about 9,000 Rp/US$, reversing some of the appreciation observed in
May, but the stock market continues to reach new highs.
4.
The latest estimate of the poverty rate has been released, indicating a decline to
16.6 percent as of March 2007 (compared to 17.8 percent in March 2006), despite
significantly higher food prices. While the rate still remains higher than in 2005
(16.0 percent), when food prices were much lower, the new data suggest that strong growth is
beginning to have an effect on poverty, as well as on unemployment, as noted in the staff
report.
5.
Important progress has been achieved toward implementing the structural
reform agenda in the fiscal area. Parliament passed on June 19 amendments to the Law on
General Tax Rules and Procedure. This amended law, which will take effect as of 1 January
2008, improves legal certainty and achieves a better balance between taxpayers’ rights and
tax agency’s powers. In particular, it makes the appeal process less onerous to the taxpayer.
Two more tax law amendments (VAT and income tax) are scheduled for deliberation by
Parliament during the remainder of the year and are expected to also take effect by 2008.

2
6.
The government is in the process of finalizing a set of implementing regulations
for the investment law. A negative list relating to foreign investment has already been
issued. It retains a broadly open investment regime and clarifies existing ownership limits,
which were previously opaque. The vast majority of business sectors will remain as open, or
even more so, than previously, with only a handful of sectors subject to lower foreign
ownership limits. While the negative list has raised some concerns in the foreign business
community, in recent days the authorities have been meeting with concerned investors to
explain the rationale for the list, and to address concerns about how it will be applied.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Indonesia
On July 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2007 Article IV consultation with Indonesia.1
Background
Indonesia’s economic performance has been strong since the last Article IV consultation.
Supported by sound policies and a favorable external environment, output has grown strongly,
inflation has stabilized, and international reserves have risen to an all time high. The
government, banking, and corporate sectors continued to reduce balance sheet vulnerabilities.
Indonesia’s financial markets have rallied in line with global trends and perceptions that risks
have been reduced. A strong external position enabled Indonesia to complete the early
repayment of its remaining obligations to the Fund in October last year.
This robust economic performance is starting to be reflected in unemployment and poverty
indicators, where progress to date had been sluggish. The official unemployment rate dipped
below 10 percent in 2007, although formal sector employment opportunities remain limited.
Meanwhile, the poverty rate fell back to 16.6 percent in March 2007, having increased sharply
to 17.8 percent a year earlier on the back of increased prices for some household staples.
However, despite this recent progress, the authorities’ focus remains on further accelerating
economic growth to improve social conditions and ensure that the benefits of growth are felt
across society.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Economic growth reached 5½ percent in 2006 as the dip in activity following the late 2005 fuel
price and interest rate hikes proved shallow. Strong exports compensated for weak domestic
demand. Staff projects growth at 6 percent in 2007—the pace maintained since the third quarter
in 2006—with some shift from external to domestic demand. Inflation has stabilized at around 6
percent, allowing Bank Indonesia (BI) to lower its policy rate more than 400 basis points since
May 2006 as the inflation rate remains on track to end 2007 inside its target range of 5–7
percent. The external current account surplus is projected to decline from 2¾ percent of GDP to
2 percent in 2007 as lower global growth and commodity prices reduce export values. The
central government deficit increased modestly to 1.0 percent of GDP in 2006. For 2007, staff
projects a somewhat higher deficit at about 1.8 percent of GDP, a level consistent with further
reductions in the debt burden.
Equity and bond markets remain buoyant. In addition to increased global risk appetite, the rise
in asset prices also reflected Indonesia-specific factors, such as lower domestic interest rates
and perceptions of reduced vulnerability. Portfolio capital flows mirrored these developments as
foreign investors have been increasing their positions in Indonesian securities. After
considerable prior volatility, the exchange rate remained broadly stable during July 2006–April
2007, but appreciated by 3 percent in May vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, in response to portfolio
inflows, although most of this appreciation was reversed in June. Banking sector indicators have
also strengthened recently. Banks’ profitability has improved, while the system is well
capitalized and nonperforming loans remain low for private banks, after falling sharply at the
end of 2006 for state banks.
However, volatile portfolio flows are posing additional challenges for the authorities. These
include avoiding new external vulnerabilities (e.g., to a sudden reversal of inflows) and
minimizing the erosion of competitiveness in labor-intensive manufacturing resulting from real
exchange rate appreciation. Meanwhile, a slowdown in domestic credit growth in 2006 has
triggered pressure on the central bank and state-owned banks to ensure accelerated lending.
The government continues to implement its comprehensive reform agenda to boost growth over
the medium term. Key elements of the strategy include policies to strengthen financial
intermediation, improve the business climate, and increase infrastructure investment. While
substantial progress has been achieved, including passing of a new investment law and several
fiscal reforms, other measures, particularly with respect to the labor market, have encountered
resistance.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities on Indonesia’s strong growth, as well as
success in reducing inflation and balance sheet vulnerabilities. Further progress has also been
made in institution-building, especially in the fiscal area. Improved fundamentals, including
lower debt and higher reserves, have increased the resilience of Indonesia’s economy. The
banking system is well capitalized, profitability has improved, and stress tests suggest it is
capable of withstanding reasonable adverse shocks. The recent decline in poverty and
unemployment is encouraging, but continued economic growth will be needed to improve social
conditions.

3
Looking forward, Directors noted that Indonesia is well positioned to take advantage of
continued favorable global conditions. With stronger financial intermediation, especially better
availability of long-term financing, additional investment in infrastructure, and an improved
investment climate, growth could be sustained in at least the 6–7 percent range needed to
alleviate poverty and unemployment.
Directors noted that capital inflows have moderated recently, but acknowledged the authorities’
concern about volatile portfolio capital flows and the challenges they pose to macroeconomic
management. They emphasized that possible future surges in inflows should be addressed
through allowing further rupiah appreciation, intervention to limit excessive exchange rate
movements, and additional interest rate cuts, provided that exchange rate appreciation
improves the inflation outlook. Directors welcomed a modest further increase in reserves.
Directors recognized that, while some estimates of equilibrium exchange rates suggest a
modest undervaluation and although the performance of manufacturing exports has been
moderate relative to many competitors, the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. On balance, Directors endorsed the flexible exchange rate policy and current
macroeconomic policy mix. Directors emphasized that continued focus on structural reforms
would help to enhance external competitiveness.
Directors commended Bank Indonesia (BI) for its cautious monetary stance and emphasized
that convergence of inflation and interest rates with major trading partners would help to reduce
capital account volatility. With the 2007 inflation target well within reach, monetary policy should
now focus on achieving the 2008 target. While the rupiah appreciation and moderating core
inflation have opened room for limited interest rate cuts, the BI needs to exercise caution,
keeping in mind the lags in monetary policy transmission.
Directors felt that the recent relaxation in prudential regulations to encourage lending is not
likely to have much of an impact, as demand constraints are mostly at play, but were concerned
that the departure from international standards could risk sending an adverse signal to
supervisors and banks alike. They, therefore, encouraged BI to reconsider the measures as
soon as possible. Directors also noted that moral suasion to encourage banks to lend to specific
sectors could result in credit misallocation. Instead, steps to promote the development of capital
markets and longer-term financing instruments would be more effective in expanding lending
while helping to preserve the soundness of the financial sector. In addition, a strategy on the
future role of state banks is needed. Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake a
Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors supported the authorities’ fiscal stance and felt that the modest relaxation in deficit
targets for 2007 and 2008 would give the authorities some room for additional development
spending. However, they viewed that the authorities should not go beyond the deficit levels
currently envisaged for 2007–08, given the potential negative consequences of higher debt
financing. Further improvements in tax administration, some new tax measures, and the
streamlining of expenditures, including through greater flexibility of energy prices, could create
additional space for priority spending. Enhancing the implementation capacity of local
government would also contribute to this effort.

4
Directors commended the authorities on the good progress made in fiscal reform. They
welcomed the completion of the restructuring of the tax agency and the recent adoption of a key
tax reform bill. Directors welcomed the planned introduction of a fiscal risk statement and the
medium-term fiscal framework in the 2008 budget and urged early passage of tax bills still in
Parliament.
Directors commended the authorities on the passage of the investment law. They encouraged
the authorities to focus on increased infrastructure spending, both through direct budget
spending to the extent possible and by facilitating public-private partnerships in infrastructure.
The authorities should also alleviate the burden of severance payments on employment
generation.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Perry Warjiyo, Executive Director for Indonesia,
and Juda Agung, Advisor to Executive Director
July 18, 2007
1. On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we would like to express our sincere appreciation
to the staff for the candid and constructive policy dialogue during the 2007 Article IV
Consultation and for their balanced report as well as an excellent and relevant Selected Issues
paper. The consultation has provided valuable venues to discuss the many progress of homegrown policies and institutional reforms that Indonesia is undertaking, updates the recent
achievements on overall economic performance, and exchange views on the best ways to
move forward for the sustained growth and stronger macroeconomic and financial stability of
the Indonesian economy in the aftermath of a post-monitoring IMF program.
Progress and Challenges
2. The Indonesian economy has secured a path of high and sustained growth, as
evidenced in continued stronger growth and sound macroeconomic stability. Supported
by our authorities' continued sound macroeconomic policies and broad-based reforms in the
areas of investment climate, financial sector and public administration, the Indonesian
economy has been enjoying the highest growth performance since the Asian crisis.
Macroeconomic stability strengthened and Indonesia's vulnerabilities have also substantially
subsided. With these strong fundamentals, the economy has been witnessing a dramatic
recovery from financial market turbulence, largely due to external shocks, in 2005 and early
last year. Our authorities believe that this recovery also reflects a growing market confidence
over the sound policy and reforms that are taking place, as well as the expectation for a
stronger outlook of economic performance this year and next.
3. With growth momentum and macroeconomic stability underway, the next challenge
for our authorities is how to sustain high growth needed for poverty reduction and
employment creation. Our authorities are fully aware that addressing these challenges
requires an agenda with clear priorities. While sound macroeconomic policies continue to be
of high importance to strengthen the economy against external shocks, further reforms are
underway to increase economic productivity and competitiveness as they are necessary for
expanding growth potential. And most important for sustaining growth is to capitalize on the
current momentum of increasing confidence to boost private investment. In this context,
reforms for improving the investment climate are the government's top priorities. The notable
progress made in this area is the recent parliamentary approval on the investment law and the
taxation law. In order to further improve the business climate, a new policy package on
investment climate, acceleration of infrastructure development, empowerment of small
medium enterprises, and financial sector development was also recently issued. Institutional
reforms are underway. The bureaucracy reform, including improving public services at the
Ministry of Finance, is a notable step toward strong and efficient public institutions. In the

2
financial sector, deep-rooted institutional reforms have resulted in a financial system with
better governance and risk management, allowing them the strong capability of weathering
potential shocks. The ongoing initiatives on institutional development in various sectors are
now progressing and will be continued. In this regard, we believe that the Fund's role and
contribution in this process, through continuous policy dialogue and advices as well as
training and technical assistance are important.
Recent Updates and Outlook
4. Indonesia's recent economic performance has regained strong growth momentum.
Real GDP growth continued to pickup, the unemployment rate declined, and inflation
decelerated. After a slowdown in the last quarter of 2005 and the first half of 2006 following
the removal of fuel subsidies and a sharp increase in interest rates, growth has been
recovering. For the last three quarters, economic growth has been around 6 percent, allowing
the unemployment rate and poverty rate to fall. At the same time, the overall macroeconomic
stability has strengthened. Inflation fell from its peak of 17.4 percent in 2005 to 6.6 percent at
the end of 2006-well below the inflation target range of 7-9 percent-and it declined further to
5.8 percent in June 2007. In the external side, a robust growth in exports, together with large
surge of capital inflows have significantly improved the surplus of the balance of payments,
strengthened the Rupiah, and bolstered international reserves. These sound external positions
have reinforced confidence and determination of the authorities to expedite the servicing of
all remaining debt to the IMF that totaled US$7.6 billion in June and October 2006, resulting
in Indonesia's early completion of its Post-Program Monitoring. At the end of June 2007,
international reserves continued to rise and reached US$50.9 billion.
5. Looking ahead, the authorities are strongly confident that economic growth is to
gather added momentum during 2007-2008, outperforming previous projections. Key to
the strengthened optimism for growth is improved performance in consumption and exports,
leading to increased investment demand. The lower interest rates are seen as creating greater
opportunity for business to take advantage of lower cost financing for investment. At the
same time, a higher budget execution and authorities' continuing efforts to improve the
investment climate and enhancing infrastructures further boost the economy for the rest of
this year, with the annual GDP growth projected to achieve 6.3 percent in 2007. The upward
growth trend is also expected to continue in 2008, with growth at around 6.7 percent. A
better investment condition following implementation of the new laws on investment and on
taxation and the recent policy package to boost private investment, infrastructure, and small
medium enterprises (SMEs) are expected to further strengthen private investment and growth
in the next year. With the projected growth, unemployment is expected to further decline to
8-9 percent, while poverty at the range of 15-16.8 percent in 2008. Meanwhile, inflation in
2007 and 2008 is forecasted within the target range of 6±1 percent and 5±1 percent,
respectively. On the external front, the balance of payments is likely to outperform earlier
forecasts with an expanding surplus and increasing international reserves alongside a stable

3
Rupiah exchange rate. These developments are expected to underpin stronger and more
balanced economic growth in 2007 and 2008.
Fiscal Policies and Reforms
6. The fiscal policy is designed to support a higher economic growth path, while
ensuring fiscal sustainability. To this end, the authorities are focusing expenditure to areas
that will enhance infrastructure and alleviate poverty, including the health sector and
education, infrastructure and energy projects, and natural disaster mitigation. In this regard,
the government submitted a revised budget to the parliament comprising an increase in the
central government deficit from the initial target of 1.1 percent to 1.6 percent of GDP for
2007. The budget deficit is financed by domestic sources, mainly through a bond issuance,
while foreign sources are expected from program loans. With the current structure of the
government budget, the public debt to GDP ratio is expected to decline further to around 36
percent by the end of 2007. Looking ahead, the 2008 budget will remain prudent with a
deficit expected around 1.7 percent of GDP, which is consistent with the declining path of
public debt and growth target of 6.7 percent.
7. Continuous efforts are also underway to strengthen the management of public
finance. On the revenue side, the authorities are committed to strengthening tax
administration, including the improvement of tax services and the modernization of the
supporting function. Efforts have also been made to simplify the procedures and facilities for
exports and imports, and harmonizing import duty tariffs. More importantly, in order to carry
out a more comprehensive tax reform, deliberations over the tax reform package are expected
to be concluded by the parliament by the end of this year. The General Administrative Rules
for Taxation was recently passed by the parliament, while the other two bills (Income Tax
and Value Added Tax for Goods and Services, and Sales Tax on Luxury Items) are currently
being reviewed by the parliament. The approved bill is designed to create a balanced position
between taxpayer rights and the power of the tax authority. The revised tax law would serve
to give taxpayers greater legal standing by creating a regulatory framework to make it easier
for taxpayers to appeal official rulings, and to reduce incidences of arbitrary detention of
taxpayers. It also contains provisions under which taxpayers will not be obliged to pay
disputed taxes until a court ruling has been made. On the expenditure side, the authorities
have made further progress to address the obstacles of budget execution by streamlining
procedures and improving the capacity of local government.
8. The government is also in the process of reforming the budget and public financial
management system and governance. The publication of ROSCs - Fiscal Transparency
Module for Indonesia in September 2006 earmarked Indonesia's effort in this area. The
Module provides a comprehensive and reliable assessment of fiscal transparency practices in
Indonesia relative to the requirements under the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal
Transparency developed by the IMF. In relation with this, the government pursues a cash

4
management reform (by implementing a Treasury Single Account) and budget reform
(through the implementation of a unified budget since 2005), improvement of fiscal analysis
and forecasting, establishing the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), improving
revenue projections, forward estimates of government expenditures and transfers to local
government. Meanwhile, in the aspect of good governance, the government had issued
Government Regulation Number 8/2006 concerning Government Agencies' Performance and
Financial Reporting, as well as Law Number 7/2006 concerning the ratification of UN
Convention Against Corruption, 2003. The government is also embarking on the bureaucracy
reform, focusing mainly on improving the public service at the Ministry of Finance
(including Tax Office, Custom Office, and Treasury Office) and designing the remuneration
system consistent with the level and the risk and competency. The establishment of Risk
Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance is also a key move to strengthen public
financial management.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
9. On the monetary policy, Bank Indonesia (BI) remains committed to focusing on
achievement of the medium-term inflation target of low inflation. To this end, under the
inflation targeting framework, the central bank consistently sets its interest rate policy in line
with underlying macroeconomic conditions so as to ensure maintaining price stability which
is necessary for sustainable economic growth. BI is confident that the inflation target of 6±1
percent for 2007 and 5±1 percent for 2008 will be achieved. From an operational perspective,
the central bank continues its efforts to improve monetary policy efficacy by strengthening
the monetary policy operational framework, including infrastructure developments to
enhance the effectiveness of open market operations. Efforts have been made to enrich
monetary instruments and improve liquidity forecasting and management. Progress toward
implementing Treasury Single Account (TSA) would facilitate liquidity management of the
central bank.
10. To further strengthen monetary policy credibility, the central bank continues to
improve monetary policy communication and transparency. To this end, policy
communication and dissemination through press releases and the issuance of monthly,
quarterly and annual economic reports complimented by a number of outreach programs
through seminars, discussion groups and other venues will be continued. In this regard,
further improvements have been adopted in the Monetary Policy Report, including a more
forward-looking discussion and a more detailed treatment of risks, and publication of
quantitative inflation forecasts is under consideration. At the same time, monetary policy
effectiveness has been strengthened through closer coordination with the government and
other economic agents, particularly coordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy to
support overall macroeconomic objectives. The establishment of a joint team for monitoring
and controlling inflation is a good example of this closer coordination.

11. Indonesia's economic performance with continued stronger growth and sound
macroeconomic stability has strengthened its external stability. Over the past years, the
external position has been sound and its external vulnerabilities have declined. For 2007,
current account surplus is projected to record a surplus of US$8.9 billion and, with financial
account surpluses of US$4.9 billion, lead to overall balance of position to record a surplus of
US$13.4 billion and an increase in international reserves to US$56.2 billion. External
vulnerabilities have also subsided, as a result of continued sound macroeconomic policies, a
stronger financial and corporate sector condition, and major institutional reforms particularly
in the areas of governance and financial supervision. Nonetheless, the authorities are
cognizant of possible risks that may emanate from external shocks, such as a capital account
shock or a global growth slowdown. In particular, with fully free capital mobility, reversals
of short-term portfolio flows may arise in response to shifting in relative yields and a global
risk appetite. To mitigate these risks, the authorities share the staff's recommendation for a
combination of policies including intervention to limit excessive exchange rate movements,
allowing further Rupiah appreciation and appropriate adjustments in interest rate.
12. With regard to exchange rate policy, our authorities remain committed to a flexible
exchange rate regime. In this regard, exchange rate movements are mainly determined
through market mechanisms. As such, the current level of exchange rate is considered
appropriate and relatively consistent with the fundamentals. Interventions in the foreign
exchange market are confined to smoothing abrupt movements in the exchange rate without
targeting any specific exchange rate level. At the same time, adequate accumulation of
international reserves is also necessary to safeguard the external stability, including reducing
vulnerability to "hot money" outflows.
Structural Reforms
13. Reforms for improving the investment climate are the government's top priorities.
In this respect, a notable step is the parliamentary approval on the Investment Law in
March 2007. The new investment law is expected to have a significant impact on the
investment climate and reduce the costs of doing business. Key features of this new
investment law includes: providing equal legal status for local and international investors,
strengthening investor's protection and property rights, simplifying immigration procedures,
dispute resolution using international laws, and tax incentives.
14. In order to further improve the investment climate, our authorities recently issued a
policy package on investment climate, acceleration of infrastructure development,
empowerment of small medium enterprises, and financial sector development. In the
area of investment climate, some significant progress has been made in the past year,
including simplification of procedures for granting investment approval and establishing a

6
new company and revocation of unfriendly regional regulations. The new reform package of
investment climate is aimed at strengthening investment service institutions, further
synchronizing of regional and central government's regulations, improving custom and tax
services, and protecting the rights of taxpayers. In order to boost domestic capital market, the
government intends to formulate tax policies by introducing incentives for listed companies.
15. Meanwhile, infrastructure acceleration programs set out in the new reform package
continued to focus on the regulatory reform of infrastructure development; institutional
developments, including establishment of a non-bank financial institution for
infrastructure; and improvement in management of infrastructure development,
including acceleration of land acquisition process for public infrastructure. In the area
of empowerment of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the main objective is to enhance
the productivity of SMEs by enhancing their access to financial resources, developing
entrepreneurship and human resources, and promoting markets for SMEs. On the labor
reform, our authorities are well aware that steps are needed to reduce the costs of severance
provided by employers. A new scheme by transferring the obligation to pay severance
payments to pension funds is now being considered to find a compromise between interests
of employers and workers.
Financial Sector Development and Reforms
16. In the financial sector, banks continued to be well capitalized and profitable, but
loan growth slowed. The capital adequacy ratio rose to over 20 percent, while net interest
margin remained at about 0.5 percent. Non-performing loans have been relatively stable at
around 6.6 percent of credit outstanding. However, lending growth slowed with loans
outstanding increasing by only 14.1 percent in 2006 and then accelerated to 15.8 percent
(y.o.y) for the first five months of 2007, compared to growths of 24.7 percent and 22.7
percent in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In this regard, we appreciate the staff's Selected
Issues Paper on the sources of credit slowdown. The authorities are of the view that the credit
slowdown is a complex issue involving both supply and demand factors. From the demand
side, the authorities concur with the staff's assessment that the lack of demand associated
with the overall investment condition and financing needs from creditworthy borrowers is
one of the reasons for low credit expansion. Moreover, the lower-than-expected credit growth
may also be due to substitution effect, in which businesses seek a non-bank financing for
capital accumulation. This is indicated by an increase in new IPOs in capital market and new
corporate bond issuance recently. While acknowledging the importance of these demand
factors, which are being addressed by appropriate macroeconomic policies and continued
structural reforms, authorities are of the view that the supply factors should also be addressed
simultaneously, including encouraging lending from banks with strong risk management
practices, while retaining bank prudential practices.

7
17. Further measures were taken to reinforce the banking industry consolidation
program to create a strong and sound banking industry as envisaged in the Indonesian
Banking Architecture. These measures included the incentive for merger and consolidation
process, new regulation on corporate governance of banks, and bank risk-management
certification. Meanwhile, in order to implement Basel II, the risk-based supervision was
implemented last year. The authorities have also made progress to improve the banking
infrastructure by operationalization of the Credit Information Bureau, covering all borrowers
of commercial banks, credit unions, and non-bank financial institutions. As suggested by
staff, the Bureau envisages inclusion of utility companies in its database, although a prior
step to create a reliable unified consumers database is a challenging task. In order to facilitate
long-term financing, the authorities concur with the staff's recommendation to consider
transforming a state-owned bank into a new development bank, as part of the overall reform
strategy for state-owned banks.
18. Our authorities are also committed to further strengthening the stability of the
financial system. A notable progress made in this area includes the establishment of the
Financial Sector Stability Forum, which provides a mechanism for discussing the role of the
government and the central bank in dealing with a crisis. Other important measures include
the drafting of a bill on a financial safety-net program for the financial sector and a blueprint
for development of the financial system, to be known as the Indonesian Financial System
Architecture (IFSA). Progress has been made by the authorities to strengthen financial sector
stability as envisaged in the previous financial reforms, including the settlement of nonperforming loans of state owned banks and the treatment of ailing insurance companies.
Furthermore, efforts have also been made to strengthen capacity of the Deposit Insurance
Corporation. In order to diversify the sources of financing for the real sector economy
through capital market and non-bank financial institutions, the authorities have facilitated
development of the bond repo market and prepared the regulatory framework of the Islamic
capital markets, including Shukuk.
Conclusion
19. The Indonesian economy has regained its strong momentum with high growth and sound
macroeconomic stability. While this remarkable performance has been attributed to sound
macroeconomic policies and continued reforms over the past years, the authorities are
determined that further broad based reforms are needed to secure the high and sustainable
growth path over the medium term. The goal is to enhance the country's international
competitiveness through improvements in efficiency and economic productivity, which are
essential for private sector-led growth, ultimately leading to a reduction in unemployment
and poverty. Finally, the Indonesian authorities remain committed to transparency and
consent to the publication of all staff reports, with necessary deletions of market sensitive
information.
