UNITED KINGDOM
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with United Kingdom
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adrienne Cheasty
February 13, 2007
Executive Summary
Background and outlook: The pickup in GDP growth in 2006 continues a decade-long
record of strong and steady macroeconomic performance. Recent and planned economic
policies, in a supportive international environment, are well-suited to sustaining these
strengths. GDP growth in 2007-08 is expected to remain steady and in line with potential,
while CPI inflation is projected to return to target over the coming year. Although sterling
could be slightly overvalued, the external current account is sustainable. Notwithstanding the
strong and steady outlook, risks are not insignificant, especially from the housing market and
the global economy.
Challenge: The United Kingdom has absorbed domestic and global shocks well, thanks to
the economy’s flexibility and the strong positioning of macroeconomic and financial
policies. Ensuring that policies can continue to contribute to resilience remains a challenge.
In particular, fiscal stabilizers must have ample space to operate, monetary policy must
anchor inflation expectations, and financial policies must bolster the financial sector’s
strength.
Authorities’ views: The authorities see their policy frameworks as providing a strong
platform for the economic stability they believe is essential to prosperity. Spending restraint
is planned to underpin fiscal consolidation. Interest rates are seen as well-positioned to
respond to shocks. Efforts are underway to strengthen the resilience of the financial system
by improving stress-testing and enhancing cross-country cooperation.
Staff views: Convergence between the authorities’ and the staff’s views is high. Planned
fiscal consolidation should halt the increase in public debt, and staff emphasizes the
desirability of holding the fiscal deficit down after this adjustment so as to increase scope for
fiscal stabilizers. For monetary policy, taming the energy-price-related increase in inflation
remains a challenge. Efforts to promote financial system resilience are welcome.

the past two-and-a-half decades have
increased the economy’s openness and flexibility, paving the way for reaping important
benefits from globalization. Macroeconomic policies have contributed to growth and
stability, encouraging households and businesses to plan for the long term and positioning
the economy well to respond to shocks.
Box 1. Surveillance and Policies1
Fiscal policy: Fiscal adjustment in 2005 was in line with the Fund’s views on the need to
narrow the fiscal deficit and stabilize net public debt. The authorities and the Fund share the
view that the rules-based fiscal framework has constrained discretion and allowed automatic
stabilizers to operate. Consistent with Fund recommendations, the authorities have broadened
the scope of independent audit of the budget assumptions.
Monetary policy: The Fund has praised the inflation targeting framework for its overall
design and consistently strong implementation.
Financial stability: In line with the recommendations of the 2002 FSAP, the authorities have
enhanced their surveillance of the financial system, improved the supervision of insurance
companies, and strengthened payment and settlements systems.
Pension system: The government has proposed pension reform, supported by the Fund, that
will help ensure both adequate saving for retirement and fiscal sustainability.

While the economic outlook is favorable, a crystallization of risks could threaten
macroeconomic stability, so managing shocks will remain a challenge. Given the
economy’s openness, global shocks influence the United Kingdom quickly and strongly.
Some shocks have had and continue to have positive effects, including the rapid growth of
productivity in emerging Asia, immigration, and the increased demand for financial services.
Other shocks, such as the global downturn of 2000–03 and the increase in oil prices during
2004–06, were managed with good policy responses. For example, the shallowness of the
UK growth slowdown during last global downturn reflected in part the most aggressive
fiscal expansion of any G7 country, alongside a reduction in interest rates and a sharp
increase in house prices.

In light of the high convergence between the authorities’ and staff views on the
outlook and policies, this report focuses on the capacity of macroeconomic policies to
respond to shocks.1 Although openness and flexibility are important shock absorbers, the
positioning of policies is also key. In this vein, the fiscal framework has constrained
discretion, but there is a question whether over time margins for fiscal stabilizers under
prudent rules should be increased. Regarding monetary policy, a question is whether
globalization shocks could weaken the link between economic slack and inflation or distort

A staff team comprising Ms. Schadler (head), Mr. Morsink, Mr. Hunt, Ms. Honjo, Ms. Iakova (all EUR), and
Ms. Ong (MCM), joined by Mr. Scholar and Ms. Robinson (OED), visited London during December 7–18,
2006. The mission met with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of England, the
Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, and other senior government officials, as well as representatives
from research institutes, labor and business organizations, and financial organizations. Basic data about the UK
economy are in Annex I. The United Kingdom has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers on current international
transactions (Annex II). Data provision is adequate for surveillance (Annex III). This report does not cover trade
policy, ODA, or AML/CFT as they are not currently considered macro-relevant in the United Kingdom. The
United Kingdom is scheduled to be assessed for AML/CFT compliance by the FATF in June 2007.

perceptions of potential. The financial sector, despite its strong performance, could be
affected by shocks in international financial markets, especially given London’s role as a
global financial center. This report first covers recent developments and the outlook, then
provides staff’s analysis of the positioning of macroeconomic and financial policies, before
turning to the authorities’ views and the staff appraisal.
II. 2006—BALANCED RECOVERY PUSHING CLOSE TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS
5.
Domestic demand alongside strong exports drove a pick up in GDP growth
during 2006 (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2). The mild downturn in 2005 reflected the United
Kingdom’s advanced cyclical position, the abrupt deceleration of house prices, and the sharp
increase in oil prices. The pick-up in 2006 was anticipated, though it came slightly more
quickly than expected. Business investment was supported by high net rates of return, in part
due to the low cost of capital. Residential investment was boosted by a surprisingly strong
acceleration of house prices. The upturn in private consumption was based on robust
employment growth, steady wage growth, and rising household wealth, including housing
wealth. The recovery in the euro area boosted export growth.
6.
Most economic indicators suggest little economic slack as of end-2006. Staff’s
Output Gap
production-function-based estimate suggests that the
2
output gap at end-2006 was close to zero. In addition,
measures of capacity utilization have risen over the past 1
year and are now above their historical averages. The
unemployment rate, however, increased through

mid-2006. The dampening effect on labor demand from
higher energy prices and the surge in new entrants to the

Wage growth has been steady, but profit margins in the non-energy sector have
fallen. Over the past year, the increases in both actual private sector earnings and pay
settlements have been stable. The deceleration in unit wage costs has been mainly due to the
procyclicality of productivity growth. However, in the non-energy sector, with subdued
output price inflation, the share of profits in output declined from mid-2004 to mid-2006,
reflecting sharp increases in contributions to company pension plans and input costs. As
these factors wane, the profit share should rise.

In light of the pick up in GDP growth and concerns about second-round effects
of cost pressures, the Bank of England (BOE) began raising the policy interest rate in
mid-2006. Following a decade of low core inflation due in part to globalization and
efficiency gains (Box 2), inflation rose above target in May 2006, reflecting primarily higher
energy prices (pass-through to utilities prices continued through late 2006). But core inflation
(ex-energy and food) increased too, as the decline in core goods prices subsided and services
price inflation picked up. Owing to concerns about rising costs, The real policy rate has
increased back to its 2004 level. Given projected nominal GDP growth of about 5½ percent
over the medium term, a policy interest rate of 5¼ percent is broadly neutral.

8

Box 2. Globalization, Efficiency Gains, and Inflation
Subdued core inflation in industrial countries over the past decade is often attributed to rapid
growth in emerging Asia (which has dampened the prices of imported manufactured goods)
or efficiency gains (notably in the distribution sector). In the United Kingdom, efficiency
gains in the distribution sector reflect mergers and acquisitions, as well as the growth of “big
box” style retailing (“Tescoization”).

Staff analysis, using the Fund’s Global Economy Model, suggests that rapid growth in Asia
has had a larger dampening effect on the relative price of goods in the United Kingdom than
in the United States or the euro area, but that the impact on UK core inflation is much
smaller than that of efficiency gains in the UK distribution sector.1 The Asia effect is bigger
in the United Kingdom for two reasons. First, since imports from Asia constitute a larger
share of UK absorption, the direct effect on goods prices is larger. Second, from Asia’s
perspective, the required increase in the volume of imports from the UK needed to equilibrate
the current account is smaller than that from the US or the euro area, so the depreciation of
sterling against emerging Asia currencies is smaller than that of the US dollar or the euro.

House price growth increased during 2006, and house prices are likely
overvalued. Following the stabilization of house prices in 2005, house price appreciation
picked up again in 2006, reflecting in part the combination of a decline in 2-year bond yields
and the growth of fixed-rate mortgages, which are priced off 2-year bond yields. As a result,
the ratios of house prices to average earnings and rents, which were already at historical
highs, increased further. However, estimates of house price overvaluation are subject to great
uncertainty, not least because of the difficulty of incorporating supply constraints. Such
constraints appear to have loosened somewhat in recent years, as the share of residential
investment in GDP has grown substantially.

Although the current account deficit and the international investment position
deteriorated in 2006, neither is a significant vulnerability. The current account deficit
widened in 2006 to 3 percent of GDP, roughly the same as it was in 2000. Between 2000–06,

a considerable increase in the trade deficit was matched by an increase in net investment
income (Table 3). Over the past decade, the current account balance worsened, reflecting a

III. STRONG AND STEADY OUTLOOK
12.
In 2007–08, growth is projected to be broadly in line with potential, with
inflation falling to target and the current account deficit stabilizing (Table 4). The
increase in net immigration—especially from new EU member states—will boost growth
potential (Box 3). At the same time, the growth

With the appreciation of the exchange rate and
the decline in energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to return to target by late-2007. In
2009 and beyond, there are no obvious reasons for the macroeconomic outlook to change.

The interest sensitivity of aggregate demand in the United Kingdom is similar to that in the United States and
the euro area, though consumption is more sensitive in the UK and the US. See Keiko Honjo, “The Interest
Sensitivity of UK Demand,” IMF Country Report No. 04/55, March 2004.

Box 3. The Macroeconomic Impact of Immigration
How is the surge in immigration to the United Kingdom from Central Europe following the
accession of new EU members in May 2004 affecting potential output, the current account
balance, and other key macroeconomic variables?1 Although the precise number of
immigrants is uncertain, the labor force survey estimates that the number of accession
country nationals increased by about 185,000 (about ½ percent of the labor force) in the
two years since accession. The vast majority of these immigrants are less than 30 years old
and virtually all are employed.
Staff analysis, using a dynamic overlapping generations model, indicates that the mediumand long-term (through 2050) macroeconomic effects of a long-lived immigration shock
should be favorable.2 After about 10 years, the impact on real GDP per capita is positive, as
the immigrants accumulate experience and become more productive. The current account
balance deteriorates for about 20 years, reflecting both a lower saving rate (as young
immigrants consume and remit more than the average worker) and a higher investment rate
(to equip the new workers with capital).

Prospects for the longer term are also good, particularly as population aging
will not be as severe as elsewhere and the recent pension reform proposal lessens
concerns about the adequacy of private saving for retirement. With a less generous state
pension system than in other G7 countries, government projections show that—to keep net
public debt below 40 percent of GDP—the required improvement in the primary balance as a
share of GDP is only about ½ percentage point per decade starting in the 2030s. Staff
analysis points to the large uncertainties surrounding these long-term projections, especially
for health care spending.4 Uncertainties about the adequacy of saving for retirement will,
however, be reduced by three key elements of the pension reform proposal: shifting the
indexation of the flat-rate state pension from prices to average earnings (to reduce the spread
of means-testing); introducing a national, defined-contribution scheme with automatic
enrolment and low operating costs; and raising the state retirement age in line with rising life
expectancy.5 The reform would address the existing disincentives to private saving for
retirement and preserve fiscal sustainability, as the savings from the rise in the state
retirement age would largely offset the cost of indexing pension payments to earnings.

Notwithstanding the strong and steady outlook, risks are not insignificant:

•

Immigration may expand the economy’s productive capacity more quickly than is
currently envisaged. The large wage differentials between Western and Central
Europe suggest that migratory flows may remain substantial for several years, though
it is difficult to predict the precise allocation of these immigrants across countries in
Western Europe.

•

In the short term, forward-looking indicators of
housing market activity suggest that house price
growth is likely to remain elevated. In light of
estimates that house prices are already
overvalued, this would increase the subsequent
risk of an abrupt downward adjustment. The
current strength of household balance sheets
reflects in part high house prices.

center could transmit shocks to the domestic
economy. Higher global interest rates could trigger a reassessment of asset
valuations, including UK house prices. Slower global growth would dampen external
demand for UK goods and services. A disorderly adjustment of the US dollar could
put upward pressure on sterling, leading to a widening of the UK current account
deficit and a worsening of the IIP, ultimately producing considerable exchange rate
volatility.

15.
Such risks present a challenge for macroeconomic and financial sector policies.
Policymakers face not only low-probability, high-impact risks, but also more immediate
questions of how policies should respond to changes in the environment from immigration
and globalization. The Bank of England faces the challenge of assessing how these
influences affect inflation and how monetary policy should respond to them. Fiscal policy
needs to ensure that both the fiscal rules and the underlying debt position permit appropriate
countercyclical behavior. Financial sector policies need to keep supervision and crisis
management tuned to changing risks.
IV. CHALLENGES IN ANCHORING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
16.
With CPI inflation having been above
target since May 2006, inflation expectations could
become less well anchored. The longer headline
inflation persists above target, the greater the risk of a
shift toward higher inflation expectations. The BOE’s

survey measure of the public’s inflation expectations is now at its highest level in several
years.
17.
This heightens concerns that higher-than-target inflation could be embedded in
upcoming pay deals. The inflation forecast assumes that private sector wage growth remains
stable, reflecting in part continued slack in the labor market. However, with energy and other
input prices now expected to be permanently higher than they were a couple years ago, a
temporary slowing in real wage growth to rebuild margins of non-energy producing firms is
inevitable. For this to happen without a secondary burst of inflation, nominal wage restraint
in upcoming pay deals (many are concluded during the first quarter of the year) is essential.
The recent interest rate increases send a strong signal on this score and further increases
would be needed if wage restraint were not to continue.
18.
Recent rapid broad money growth has raised concerns but is difficult to
interpret. M4 growth increased sharply over the past year, driven largely by deposits held by
nonbank financial companies (known as other financial corporations or OFCs). To the extent
that these money balances are eventually used (for example, by pension funds) to purchase
other assets, this build-up in liquidity could be associated with upward pressures on demand
and subsequently inflation. However, these money balances could also partly reflect financial
innovation. For example, pension funds and insurance companies are holding more deposits
to finance derivative payments. Moreover, evidence suggests that the link between broad
money growth and inflation in the United Kingdom in the short- to medium-term is weak.6
On balance, staff do not view recent broad money growth as a major concern, though careful
monitoring is appropriate.

19.
Turning to global risks, a key challenge for the BOE is judging when the
deflationary impact of rapid productivity growth in emerging Asia will wane. Looking
back, subdued core inflation has been due in part to falling prices of imported manufactured
goods and efficiency gains in the distribution sector. Looking forward, two risks stand out.
First, the pace of productivity growth in Asia or the UK distribution sector may slow.
Second, even if these underlying trends persist, their dampening effects on UK inflation will
eventually diminish, because households learn about them and incorporate them into their
expected wealth. This will tend to boost aggregate demand. Rising prices of non-energy
imported goods suggest that the effect of the Asia productivity shock is already waning and
that the level of the policy interest rate needed to secure the inflation target may be shifting
up.

Another risk from globalization
is that the influence of monetary policy

pressures, while increased cross-border

imbalances between demand and supply.
Deviation of unemployment rate from NAIRU (percent)
Another, however, is that deviations of
inflation from target are likely to become
more persistent. Thus, if wage growth were to increase, then the BOE would need to keep
monetary policy tight for longer to bring inflation back to target (Box 4).
21.
Altogether, with interest rates now within a broadly neutral range, monetary
policy is well-positioned to respond in either direction to unexpected developments. If
inflation expectations do not moderate or signs of wage pressures were to emerge, additional
tightening would be desirable. In this event, interest rates may need to be held higher for
some period. Conversely, if global growth were to slow more sharply than currently
envisaged or the UK housing market were to weaken substantially, interest rate cuts should
be considered. Moreover, any decision would need to be conditioned on new evidence of the
effect of immigration on the potential output. But the scope for interest rate adjustments to
adequately address large shocks appears ample.

17

Box 4. Globalization and Monetary Policymaking
Globalization is widely seen as contributing to a flattening of the Phillips curve (the link
between inflation and measures of economic slack) in the United Kingdom and other
industrial countries over the past decade. Using a small macroeconomic model, staff analysis
finds that a flatter Phillips curve has three main implications:1
•

First, macroeconomic volatility increases. With the weaker link between inflation and
economic slack, higher output variability is needed to achieve a given level of inflation
variability.

•

Second, a central bank that cares about inflation and (even a small amount) about
deviations of output from potential should respond relatively less to deviations of
inflation from target in deciding monetary policy stance. This is because the deviation
of output from potential needed to bring inflation to target quickly is much higher
when the Phillips curve is flatter.

•

Third, even though the central bank’s response to a given deviation of inflation from
target is attenuated, interest rates would need to stay higher for longer after a positive
shock to inflation, since deviations of inflation from target are more persistent.
Conversely, the cumulative interest rate movement would be smaller after a demand
shock.

V. PROTECTING COUNTER-CYCLICALITY IN FISCAL POLICY
22.
A substantial fiscal expansion in 2001–04 led to a sharp deterioration in the
fiscal balance and rising net public debt

(Table 5). During this period, the government

cyclically-adjusted overall balance relative to
GDP improved by ½ percentage point, primarily due to windfall energy-price-related
revenues and higher revenues from the booming financial sector. In FY2006/07, receipts and
expenditures during the first nine months of the year point to some further improvement in
the cyclically-adjusted overall deficit, reflecting buoyant personal and corporation income
tax revenue (in turn due to the continued strength of the financial sector) and the higher tax
rate on North Sea firms.

The authorities plan further adjustment over the medium term so as to return
the current balance to surplus, relying primarily on spending restraint to do so. The
December 2006 Pre-Budget Report presented a

in the second half of the 1980s, reflecting a
combination of buoyancy and measures. After a
small further rise in FY2007/08, the ratio is
projected to remain roughly stable over the medium term, as fiscal drag is offset by a modest
decline in the VAT base.

20
25.
Recent actions have strengthened the credibility of the commitment to spending
restraint, but the Comprehensive Spending Review (due by mid-2007) will be the
critical test. Key actions have been settlements with selected ministries (covering about
10 percent of discretionary spending) for 2008–10—with the Home Office (one of the largest
ministries) for no real growth, with some smaller ministries (including the Department for
Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs, and the Treasury itself) for declines of
5 percent per year in real terms. Looking ahead, the objective is to achieve savings of at least
3 percent per year across central and local government, with administrative budgets across
ministries reduced by at least 5 percent in real terms per year. While wage bargaining with
public sector employees is conducted on a ministry-by-ministry basis, the Treasury has
responsibility for approving government submissions to the pay review bodies. In 2006, the
average pay increase in the public sector was 2½ percent, the lowest in a decade. The plan is
to ensure that wage increases are affordable and consistent with the 2 percent inflation target
over the medium term.
26.
Once the adjustments in the Comprehensive Spending Review are in place,
fiscal policy should ensure that net public debt remains below 40 percent of GDP, a
limit that has served the economy well.8 On staff projections, net public debt will rise to
just below 40 percent of GDP in the medium term. Countercyclical fiscal policy in the event
of an adverse shock would then push net public debt over 40 percent of GDP. For example,
staff analysis suggests that a sharp drop in house prices could lead to a slowdown in
economic growth that would increase net public debt relative to GDP by about 3 percentage
points.9 This would be consistent with holding debt below 40 percent of GDP “over the
cycle.” However, staff would favor keeping the deficit at 1½ percent of GDP, which would
gradually reduce the debt ratio, creating sufficient room for automatic stabilizers to work
while maintaining debt below 40 percent of GDP “at all times.” The “at all times”
formulation would provide a clearer measure of fiscal performance.
27.
More generally, the fiscal framework has broadly contributed to stability. In
particular, the fiscal rules—the debt rule and the golden rule (which requires current balance
or better over the cycle)—have helped to constrain discretion and protect investment.
Nevertheless, the definition of the golden rule as applying “over the cycle” has two widelydiscussed drawbacks: the uncertainty surrounding the dating of the cycle and the risk of
procyclicality in the event of asymmetric cycles. Possibilities for redressing them while

8

The debt rule specifies that net public debt should be held over the cycle at a stable and prudent level, which the
Treasury has defined as 40 percent of GDP. In 2003, the government committed to keeping net debt under this
ceiling at all times until the end of the current cycle (which is widely seen as imminent), when the default option
would be to revert to 40 percent of GDP over the cycle.

No. 05/81, March 2005.

21
preserving constraint on discretion exist, but it is not clear whether the cost of changing the
rule outweighs the benefit.10 Separately, the credibility of the fiscal framework would be
served by increasing the role of the National Audit Office in auditing certain assumptions
underlying the fiscal projections. Since 1997, the government has invited the NAO, which is
independent of the government and reports directly to Parliament, to audit some general
macroeconomic assumptions and some specific assumptions (such as the effective VAT
rate), so as to enhance the transparency of the Budget forecast. Broader NAO audit of key
fiscal assumptions would further enhance fiscal transparency.
VI. FINANCIAL STABILITY: RISK OF GLOBAL SHOCKS
28.
The financial sector is thriving. Net exports of financial services have risen
steadily over the past decade and increased sharply in recent years. Ratings agencies rank the
highly profitable UK banking system as one of the strongest in the world. Robust economic
growth, a benign interest rate environment, and a buoyant housing market have supported
mortgage credit quality, though high-risk mortgage lending and bad debts on unsecured
personal lending are increasing.11 High net rates of return have underpinned strong corporate
credit quality and low levels of insolvencies. The health of the banking system reflects

improved risk management, geographical diversification, and growth of new business
activities. In particular, financial innovation has allowed banks to transfer some of the risk
that they traditionally held on their own balance sheets. In turn, the ongoing shift from
negotiated, bilateral banking finance to arms-length finance through asset markets has
facilitated consumption smoothing (September 2006 WEO). Bank regulation and supervision
have responded well to these developments. At the same time, the life insurance industry has
returned to a more stable outlook, following several years of weakness. The introduction of a
risk-based approach to determining capital adequacy has helped to increase awareness by
insurers of the risks associated with the products they offer.
10

Staff analysis suggests that changing the operational target of the golden rule from current balance or better
“over the cycle” to aiming for current balance or better at a rolling horizon would reduce macroeconomic
volatility but increase the volatility of public debt. See Keiko Honjo, “The Golden Rule and the Economic
Cycle,” in United Kingdom—Selected Issues.

11

Unsecured personal lending represents less than 20 percent of total personal lending. In response to rising bad
debts, banks have tightened their lending criteria.

22
29.
Linkages between the UK financial system and financial systems in other
countries are growing. Specifically, linkages between the main UK and non-UK banks are
strong and getting stronger. For example, in the London interbank market, the main UK
banks’ exposures to the main foreign-owned banks amount to almost two-thirds of Tier 1
capital. Banks’ activities have also become increasingly intertwined with other parts of the
financial sector and the broader economy. These growing linkages are both a strength and a
vulnerability. They allow the impact of bad shocks to be more broadly dispersed (risk
transfer) and thus more easily absorbed by individual institutions and the system as a whole.
However, they also potentially allow the impact to be spread around the global financial
system more widely and rapidly (Box 5).
30.
Given these growing cross-country linkages, global risks are particularly
important to the UK financial system, more for their potential severity than for their
likelihood of being realized. If global interest rates rise, unusually low risk premia reverse,
or major currencies move sharply, credit and market risks in the UK financial system could
be realized. Extended balance sheets in the domestic nonfinancial sector are a vulnerability.
Leverage, especially among commercial property companies and arising from leveraged
buyouts, has grown rapidly. 12 Household debt has also increased rapidly, mostly reflecting
mortgage lending. 13 Financial institutions’ own balance sheets also contain vulnerabilities.
Exposures to risky and potentially illiquid instruments are rising, including structured credit
products, emerging market assets, commodities, and commercial property. At the same time,
reliance on wholesale funding is increasing, as reflected in the gap between customer lending
and customer funding through deposits. This raises liquidity risks, as wholesale funding may
be more difficult and costly to roll over during times of heightened stress.

12

Commercial property prices have been rising quickly and could be overvalued. An FSA survey of banks’
leveraged buyout activity suggests that these exposures are relatively concentrated and increasingly complex,
though banks are also increasingly distributing the debt they underwrite.
13

The average loan-to-value ratio on banks’ stock of mortgages is about 50 percent, though some aggressive
lenders are posting LTVs on new loans of up to 125 percent. In addition, concerns about sub-prime mortgage
lending and unsecured lending are increasing, especially given the sharp rise in personal insolvencies.

23

Box 5. Linkages Between Major International Banks
Staff analysis of extreme changes (“exceedances”) in distance-to-default measures in a group
of major internationally-active banks yields two key results.1 First, the transmission of
shocks appears to be more important among UK banks than between UK and non-UK banks.
Second, over the past few years, the transmission of shocks between UK and non-UK banks
has been rising. These results suggest that, while the national focus of financial supervisory
authorities has been appropriate until now, improving international cooperation in financial

and Implications for London as a Global Financial Center” in United Kingdom—Selected Issues.

31.
Risks to the UK financial system are thoroughly and systematically reviewed in
reports by the BOE and the FSA. The FSA’s Financial Risk Outlook highlights the key
risks present in the operating environment for firms and consumers. The BOE has revamped
its Financial Stability Report to provide a clearer, forward-looking synthesis of the most
important systemic risks. The new report provides an explicit and transparent assessment of
risks, including assessments of likelihood and expected impact. It also includes a chapter on
the work being done to mitigate risks.
32.
The authorities are taking action to further improve the resilience of the
financial system to possible shocks. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has reviewed
the stress-testing practices of UK financial firms as part of a campaign to identify and
encourage best practices. The BOE is working with the private sector to further improve
understanding of the impact of interconnections between firms on risks to the financial
system. The Treasury, BOE, and FSA are planning to further improve procedures and
information sharing for helping deal with financial or business continuity problems. Given
the growing cross-country linkages between financial systems, the authorities are planning to
enhance international crisis prevention and management arrangements both within the EU

24
and with other countries. In all these activities, the authorities are committed to moving
further towards a principles-based approach to regulation.14
VII. CONVERGENCE OF THE AUTHORITIES’ AND STAFF VIEWS IS HIGH
33.
The authorities see existing policy frameworks as providing a strong platform
for the economic stability they believe is essential to prosperity. The global economy is in
the midst of radical transformation with far-reaching and fundamental changes in technology,
production, and trading patterns. Stability puts households and firms in a strong position to
seize opportunities and respond to challenges in the evolving global environment. Policy
frameworks introduced over the past decade for fiscal policy, monetary policy, and financial
stability have delivered stability and will continue to do so in the future.
34.
The authorities project a favorable economic outlook. The Treasury, the BOE,
and Fund staff have similar assessments of prospects for GDP growth and the external
position in 2007–08 and beyond. Indeed, even views of the current degree of economic
slack—which in the past have diverged—are now similar. The only minor difference is that,
while staff tend to view house prices as overvalued, Treasury officials see risks in the
housing market as balanced, noting that constraints on housing supply have boosted house
prices.
35.
Members of the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) see inflation
moderating to target and interest rates as well-positioned to respond to shocks.
Nevertheless, there is debate about near- and medium-term influences on inflation. Most
MPC members remain concerned that higher-than-target current inflation could affect
expectations and thereby forthcoming pay settlements. Others are more sanguine about pay
settlements, pointing for example to the moderating influence of immigration. In light of the
fall in the profit share in the non-energy sector, MPC members observe that firms may be
forced to rebuild profits by raising output prices. Some point to rapid broad money growth as
an upside risk to inflation, but others feel it is difficult to interpret the high contribution from
money holdings by Other Financial Corporations. From a more medium-term perspective,
MPC members are concerned about the implications of a flatter Phillips curve for monetary
policy. The debate centers on the best way to keep inflation close to target and inflation
expectations anchored, without creating excessive output volatility.
36.
The Treasury is committed to spending restraint as the underpinning for fiscal
consolidation. The tightness of already-announced settlements with some ministries provide
evidence of the government’s determination to deliver the projected slowdown in spending.
Plans for the remaining ministries will be announced by mid-2007. The Treasury’s monthly

14

Principles-based regulation allows firms to decide how best to achieve required outcomes.

25
monitoring of ministries’ actual spending will ensure that tight expenditure ceilings are met.
On revenue, with the convergence of views on the current degree of economic slack, the
Treasury’s and staff’s projections are similar, though the Treasury envisages slightly more
revenue gain on announced policies. Regarding the debt rule, the Treasury is committed to
the 40 percent of GDP limit, but has not yet decided whether—after the end of the current
economic cycle—this will apply at all times or just over the cycle.
37.
The authorities consider that financial sector prospects are strong and are
taking action to further improve resilience. The UK banking system is in rude health,
taking in stride the financial market correction in May-June 2006 and the tightening of
monetary conditions in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, the authorities see
prospects as favorable but risks as underpriced. One of their key concerns is rising
correlations across countries and markets, which is partly attributable to similar strategies
(for trading, risk management, and stress testing) across financial institutions. London’s role
as a global financial center raises the risk of cross-border transmission of shocks, but it also
yields benefits in terms of greater liquidity, which improves the financial system’s ability to
absorb shocks. Regarding financial regulation, the FSA is determined to further develop the
principles-based approach and underlines the importance of subjecting proposed regulations
to a thorough cost-benefit analysis.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Macroeconomic performance in the United Kingdom remains impressive. The
growth of investment, productivity, and output has rebounded from a softer 2005. Although
increases in inflation and the current account deficit must be watched as possible signs of
capacity constraints, net immigration is likely to spur capacity growth in line with demand.
The value of sterling may slightly exceed equilibrium but by a small enough margin not to be
a concern. Moreover, policy frameworks are guiding policies in ways that are responsive to
the requirements for sustained strong growth, low inflation, a stable value for sterling, and
continuing growth of London as a global financial center with sound institutions. The nearand medium-term outlook is for continued strong and stable growth with a return of inflation
to target. Given this favorable macroeconomic outlook, financial sector prospects are strong.
39.
Openness and flexibility position the United Kingdom to continue to benefit
from the opportunities of globalization and to absorb shocks. The recent rapid growth of
the world economy has boosted demand for exports, especially of financial services, and
allowed the United Kingdom to source goods from the lowest cost global producers. The
combination of benign global financial conditions and openness to capital flows has
contributed to record levels of foreign direct investment inflows, while allowing the United
Kingdom to earn substantial net investment income. Admission of workers from most new
EU member states has boosted the flow of immigrants and helped fill skills gaps. Openness
may also increase exposure to downside global risks. And, although the flexibility of an open
economy helps smooth the absorption of global shocks, macroeconomic and financial

26
policies also have a role. In this vein, understanding the influences of globalization and
ensuring adequate cushions to respond to adverse shocks are crucial.
40.
Monetary policy is well-positioned to respond to shocks, though taming the
energy-price-related increase in inflation remains a challenge. With diminishing
economic slack and possibly rising inflation expectations, incentives are weakening for a
timely adjustment in real wages to permanently higher energy prices. The tightening of
monetary policy since August 2006 has therefore been appropriate to help ensure that
inflation returns to target. For the immediate future, continuing to communicate the
importance of wage restraint will help minimize the need for additional increases in interest
rates. Depending on evolving prospects for wage growth, some further tightening of
monetary policy may be required. More broadly, the BOE’s efforts to disentangle the
influences of globalization on inflation and monetary policy, and to communicate them to the
public and financial markets, are appropriate.
41.
Turning to fiscal policy, building the cushions needed to respond to adverse
shocks should be a priority. This is especially important as financial-sector and housingrelated revenues may be temporarily high. Over the next few years, reducing the overall
fiscal deficit to 1½ percent of GDP will be essential to halt the increase in the ratio of net
debt to GDP below 40 percent. Beyond that, maintaining the deficit below 1½ percent of
GDP would build the cushion required for automatic stabilizers to operate in a downturn
without allowing debt to exceed 40 percent of GDP, a limit that has served the economy
well. Current plans to focus this consolidation on spending restraint are appropriate, given
that further increases in tax rates would risk adversely affecting incentives to work and
invest. This will require disciplined choices in the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending
Review. Regarding the long term, the proposed pension reform appropriately addresses the
challenges to the pension system without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability.
42.
The fiscal framework is supporting the improvement in public finances.
Continuing commitment to the framework during the prospective period of strong growth
will help ensure that good times are indeed used to reduce the underlying fiscal deficit. As
experience grows, further steps to strengthen the framework may be desirable, though with
due regard to the cost of changes. One area where change would clearly enhance confidence
in the fiscal projections is broadening the reach of NAO audit.
43.
Lastly, on the financial sector, which is in a position of strength, the authorities
are appropriately promoting the system’s resilience. The key financial sector
vulnerabilities are low-probability events with potentially severe consequences. In
addressing these risks, the authorities are right to insist on balancing the costs and benefits of
regulation. Plans to further enhance stress-testing and international crisis prevention and
management arrangements are welcome.

Appendix I. United Kingdom: Sustainability Exercises
Fiscal sustainability

The analysis, conducted using the standard template, shows that the rise in public debt is
unlikely to cause financing difficulties over the next few years, given that net public sector
debt starts from a low level and increases only slowly over time.
In the baseline scenario, which assumes that no policy action is taken, the net public debt-toGDP ratio1 grows from 38.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to about 41 percent of GDP in 2011,
given the staff projection that the primary balance turns to small surplus by 2011 (Figure A1
and Table A1). This rise in the public debt ratio is unlikely to create debt management
problems, given that it is relatively slow and from a level that is one of the lowest among
industrial countries. The stabilization of the public debt ratio would require the primary
balance to remain at 0.1 percent of GDP.
In the alternative scenarios, the evolution of the public debt-to-GDP ratio is generally
similar to that in the baseline. Only Scenario A1 shows a decline in the debt ratio, reflecting
the assumption (consistent with the historical average) that the primary balance is in surplus.
Scenario A2 indicates a somewhat larger increase in the debt ratio, consistent with the
assumption of constant primary balance in 2006–11.
In the bound test scenarios, the debt ratio stays below 50 percent of GDP in most cases. The
worst deterioration—to 51 percent of GDP—occurs under the assumption that contingent
liabilities amounting to 10 percent of GDP materialize in 2007.
External sustainability

External sustainability does not appear to be an issue in the United Kingdom (Table A2). The
UK’s role as an international financial center implies large gross external assets and
liabilities (gross external liabilities in 2005 were about 400 percent of GDP, compared to
about 100 percent of GDP in the United States). The impact of revaluations on the net
external position has been greater than that of financial flows in all but two years since 1990
(valuation changes have been dominated by currency effects). Cross-border mergers and
acquisitions can also have a sizable impact on the net external position. As a result, one
standard deviation for both net portfolio investment and net foreign direct investment
(calculated over the last ten years) is about 10 percentage points of GDP.

1

The definition of the debt ratio in this exercise differs from that shown in official and staff projections. The
latter uses centered-GDP as the denominator.

33
The composition of the international investment position (IIP) has allowed the UK to earn
positive investment income despite having a sizable negative net external position. The UK
has a large positive net position in FDI, which has a high rate of return; and a large negative
position in bonds and bank deposits, on which the return (in this case, the interest rate on net
liabilities) is low. The return on FDI may be overstated due to measurement problems: it is
difficult to value the stock of FDI on a current basis. Using the book value as a proxy could
understate the size of UK’s net FDI position and therefore overstate the return. The ability of
the UK to generate a positive return on negative net external assets has mitigated the effect of
the widening trade deficit on the current account. This may help explain the relative stability
of the REER over the past few years.
London’s growing role as an international financial center increases the risk of transmission
of global shocks to the domestic economy through the financial sector. However, empirical
evidence suggests that the transmission of shocks among the main UK banks is still much
more important than that between the main UK and non-UK banks.2 In addition, the breadth
and depth of the financial sector improves its ability to absorb shocks.

1/ Defined as net debt, which includes liquid assets (official reserve assets and bank deposits) amounting to about 5 percent of GDP. Based on fiscal year (April-March).
Definition of net public debt ratio in this exercise differs from official and staff projections. Official and staff projections use centered-GDP as the denominator.
Public sector includes general government and public companies.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex III. United Kingdom: Statistical Issues
The United Kingdom maintains high standards in the provision of economic data which are
adequate for surveillance purposes. The authorities publish a full range of economic and
financial data including electronically and have subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). The U.K. shifted to ESA95 in September 1997. More recently, the authorities
have implemented a number of important methodological changes to the national accounts
dataset, most of which were related to the adoption of ESA95. In 2003 the authorities introduced
further revisions reflecting a shift to annual chain-linking, corrections for import fraud, and
revisions in some volatile construction data. The authorities have indicated plans to report
monetary and financial statistics to STA (using Standardized Report Forms) for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS) Supplement, beginning early 2007.

Statement by Mr. Tom Scholar, Executive Director for United Kingdom
February 28, 2007

My authorities value their annual consultation with staff and will carefully consider their
comments. There is a broad level of agreement on most aspects of economic policy.
The economic fundamentals in the UK remain sound. Growth was at trend (2.7 percent) in
2006 and is forecast in the 2006 Pre-Budget Report at 2 ¾ - 3 ¼ percent in 2007, and
2 ½ - 3 percent in 2008. CPI inflation rose to 3 per cent at the end of the year, reflecting
higher energy and import prices, but is expected to return to its 2 percent target by the end of
2007. Employment remains at record levels of 74.5 percent. As staff report, there are risks,
both upside and downside: my authorities remain vigilant to these and agree with staff on the
need for cautious macroeconomic polices, to which they are fully committed.
My authorities will continue to set policy on the basis of the policy framework established in
1997, based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and accountability.
•

fiscal policy set according to two fiscal rules:
o The golden rule – over the cycle, the Government will borrow only to invest and not
to fund current spending;
o The sustainable investment rule – over the cycle, public sector net debt will be held at
a stable and prudent level, defined as 40 percent of GDP or less;

•

Monetary policy set by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee to meet a
symmetric inflation target.

My authorities agree with staff that the macroeconomic policy framework has served the UK
well, guiding policies and anchoring expectations to deliver long-term stability.
My authorities concur with staff that monetary policy is well-positioned, but that continued
vigilance is needed to ensure that inflation returns to target. The current monetary policy
framework gives the Monetary Policy Committee flexibility to adapt its analysis in the light
of events and new data, while maintaining a focus on the inflation target and thus anchoring
inflation expectations. The present policy framework should have the capacity to withstand
more turbulent times, should they materialise.
Fiscal policy will, as usual, be set in the budget. My authorities’ plans will reduce the deficit
over the medium term. The latest official projections show a gradual reduction to 1.3 percent
of GDP, with an average annual surplus on the current budget over the cycle, and net debt
stabilising at 38.5 per cent. My authorities are therefore meeting the fiscal rules. As staff
note, my authorities have already taken a number of steps to restrain spending growth and

2
deliver medium-term fiscal consolidation by committing to, for the period 2008-09 to
2010-11:
•
a series of early departmental spending settlements at or below the rate of inflation;
•

cross-government value for money savings of at least 3 percent per annum;

•

a 5 per cent annual real reduction in administration budgets across departments; and

•

ensuring public sector pay settlements are affordable and consistent with the 2 percent
inflation target.

Full departmental spending allocations for this period will be announced later this year
following the conclusion of the Comprehensive Spending Review.
As staff note, the fiscal framework has performed well, constraining discretion and protecting
public investment, and allowing fiscal policy to respond to shocks such as the global
slowdown in 2001- 2002. With a decade of experience the framework is very well
established, and my authorities believe that stability in the framework has strengthened its
credibility. Defining the rules over the cycle has been central to this. As staff note, the
authorities have broadened the scope of independent audit by the National Audit Office of
key budget assumptions. Last year the National Audit Office approved the methodology for
dating the economic cycle; this year they are auditing five assumptions, including tax
compliance, the VAT gap, and tobacco receipts.
On the financial sector, there is, as noted in the staff report, a high degree of convergence
between the views of staff and the authorities. The Bank of England’s relaunched Financial
Stability Report provides a forward-looking analysis of the systemic risks to the UK
economy as well as efforts to mitigate these risks. The authorities are working with the
private sector to improve stress testing, including understanding the links between firms.
International efforts to coordinate crisis prevention and management are vital and the UK is
working towards improving these mechanisms.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
United Kingdom
On February 28, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance in the United Kingdom remains impressive. After softer growth in
2005, the acceleration in GDP in 2006 was broadly based. Business investment was boosted by
high net rates of return; residential investment by a pickup in house price appreciation; private
consumption by robust employment growth, steady wage growth, and rising household wealth;
and exports by the recovery in the euro area. Most indicators suggest little economic slack as of
end-2006. CPI inflation rose above the 2 percent target in May 2006, mostly due to higher
energy prices, and reached 3 percent in December. Although the current account deficit and the
international investment position deteriorated in 2006, neither is a significant vulnerability and
competitiveness is broadly appropriate.
In light of diminishing spare capacity, concerns about second-round effects of cost pressures,
and rapid broad money growth, the Bank of England began raising the policy interest rate in
mid-2006. The policy rate was raised on three occasions to 5¼ percent in January 2007. Given
projected nominal GDP growth of about 5½ percent over the medium term, the current policy
interest rate is broadly neutral.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
A substantial fiscal expansion in 2001-04 led to a sharp deterioration in the fiscal balance and
rising net public debt. A reversal of the deficit started in 2005-06, with the cyclically-adjusted
overall balance relative to GDP estimated to have improved by ¾ percentage points over two
years. This reflected primarily higher financial sector-related revenues, windfall energy-pricerelated revenues, and a higher tax rate on North Sea firms. The growth rate of current spending
in 2006 is estimated to have been in line with nominal GDP growth.
The financial sector continues to thrive and linkages with financial systems in other countries
continue to grow. Net exports of financial services have risen steadily over the past decade and
increased sharply in recent years. Ratings agencies rank the highly profitable banking system
as one of the strongest in the world. Linkages between the main UK and non-UK banks are
getting stronger. Bank regulation and supervision have responded well to these developments.
The life insurance industry has returned to a more stable outlook.

Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors welcomed the economy’s continued impressive performance, which
they attributed in part to policy frameworks that guide policies in ways that are responsive to the
requirements for sustained strong growth, low inflation, a stable value for sterling, and
continuing growth of London as a global financial center with sound institutions.
With the rebound in growth in 2006, Directors considered that increases in inflation and the
current account deficit need to be watched as possible signs of capacity constraints, though
going forward net immigration is likely to support capacity growth in line with demand. The nearand medium-term outlook is for continued strong and stable growth with a return of inflation to
target. A number of Directors considered, however, that vulnerabilities, including those
associated with high housing prices, warrant vigilance.
Directors agreed that openness and flexibility position the United Kingdom to continue to benefit
from the opportunities of globalization and to absorb shocks. The recent rapid growth of the
world economy has boosted demand for exports, especially of financial services. The
combination of benign global financial conditions and openness to capital flows has contributed
to record levels of foreign direct investment inflows. Admission of workers from most new EU
member states has boosted the flow of immigrants and helped fill skills gaps. Openness may
also increase exposure to downside global risks. And, although the flexibility of an open
economy helps smooth the absorption of global shocks, macroeconomic and financial policies
also have a role. In this vein, understanding the influences of globalization and ensuring
adequate cushions for policies to respond to adverse shocks are crucial.
Directors noted that monetary policy is well-positioned to respond to shocks, though taming the
energy-price-related increase in inflation remains a challenge. They agreed that the exchange
rate may be slightly overvalued, though well within the bounds of uncertainty associated with
such estimates, and in any case by a small enough margin not to be a concern. With
diminishing economic slack and possibly rising inflation expectations, incentives are weakening

3
for a timely adjustment in real wages to permanently higher energy prices. The tightening of
monetary policy since August 2006 has therefore been appropriate to help ensure that inflation
returns to target. For the immediate future, continuing to communicate the importance of wage
restraint will help minimize the need for additional increases in interest rates. Depending on
evolving prospects for wage growth, some further tightening of monetary policy may be
required. More broadly, the Bank of England’s efforts to disentangle the influences of
globalization on inflation and monetary policy, and to communicate them to the public and
financial markets, are appropriate.
Directors welcomed the government’s plans for fiscal consolidation. Given the favorable
medium-term outlook and the possibility that financial-sector and housing-related revenues may
be temporarily high, Directors agreed that building the fiscal cushions needed to respond to
adverse shocks should be a priority. Over the next few years, reducing the overall fiscal deficit
will be essential to halt the increase in the ratio of net debt to GDP. Beyond that, maintaining a
low deficit would build the cushion required for automatic stabilizers to operate in a downturn
without allowing debt to exceed 40 percent of GDP, a limit that has served the economy well.
The plan to focus this consolidation on spending restraint is appropriate, given that further
increases in tax rates would risk adversely affecting incentives to work and invest. This will
require disciplined choices in the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. Regarding the
long term, the proposed pension reform appropriately addresses the challenges to the pension
system without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability.
Directors commended the fiscal framework for supporting the improvement in public finances.
Continuing commitment to the framework during the prospective period of strong growth will
help ensure that good times are indeed used to reduce the underlying fiscal deficit. As
experience grows, further steps to strengthen the framework may be desirable, though with due
regard to the cost of changes. One area where change would enhance confidence in the fiscal
projections is broadening the reach of the National Audit Office audit of key fiscal assumptions.
Directors praised the financial authorities’ efforts to further enhance the resilience of the
financial system. With the financial sector in a strong position, the key vulnerabilities are to lowprobability events with potentially severe consequences. In addressing these risks, the
authorities are right to insist on balancing the costs and benefits of regulation. Plans to further
enhance stress-testing and international crisis prevention and management arrangements are
welcome.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
