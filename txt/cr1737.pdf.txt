IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Indonesia
On January 25, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Indonesia.
Indonesia has maintained macroeconomic stability, while adjusting well to recent shifts in the
external environment. A prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and the launch of structural
reforms has helped the economy weather slow global growth, the commodity down-cycle, and
several episodes of financial turbulence affecting emerging market economies. While growth has
slowed slightly, it has remained robust. Inflation has eased and the external position has
improved. A gradual fiscal consolidation has begun. There has been major progress on the
financial stability framework, and gaps related to the crisis management framework are being
addressed. Structural reforms that began in 2015 have improved the business environment.
Positive sentiment has been reflected in supportive capital inflows in 2016, which buoyed
financial markets before undergoing some corrections starting in October.
Private consumption remains the main driver of growth, but higher inclusive growth will require
deeper structural reforms. Consumption growth has been underpinned by an expanding middle
class, lower fuel prices, and falling inflation. Investment has remained subdued, reflecting
spillovers from lower commodity prices, some excess capacity in mining and manufacturing, and
structural impediments, while external demand has been weak. In staff’s views, consumption-led
growth can be sustained over the medium term, but meeting the authorities’ ambitious targets for
inclusive growth will require deepening structural reforms.
The near-term outlook remains favorable. Growth in 2016 is projected at 5 percent on account of
robust private consumption. In 2017, growth is expected to rise modestly to 5.1 percent, led by a
gradual pickup in private investment in response to stronger commodity prices, low interest

rates, and a recovery in external demand on the back of a pickup in global growth and trade.
Inflation is expected to rise from 3.2 percent at end-2016 to around 4.5 percent at end-2017
largely due to lower electricity subsidies and some recovery in commodity prices. The current
account deficit would remain at around 2 percent of GDP next year, with the expected pickup in
fixed investment and imports offset by the impact of higher commodity prices on exports.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their successful management of
macroeconomic policies and progress on structural reforms, which have preserved stability
amidst challenging shifts in the external environment. Directors noted that, while the economy is
subject to downside risks, the outlook is positive and Indonesia is better placed today to weather
an uncertain external environment than in previous years. Against that background, they
encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening the medium-term policy framework through
fiscal and structural reforms to support inclusive growth and preserve macro stability.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ fiscal strategy, which aims to broaden the revenue base and
expand priority expenditures, while enhancing their efficiency within the statutory fiscal deficit
limit. They supported the government’s short-term fiscal stance, including the start of a gradual
fiscal consolidation in August 2016 focused on rebuilding fiscal buffers. Directors saw merit in
tax reform measures to generate the bulk of additional revenues needed to increase spending on
infrastructure, health and education, which is low compared to peer emerging market economies.
They supported the authorities’ plans to pursue growth-friendly tax reforms this year, including
administration reforms that would lower taxpayers’ compliance costs.
Directors considered that the current monetary policy stance is broadly appropriate and
encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to the resurgence of inflationary pressures, and to
stand ready to adjust the policy stance, as needed. They welcomed reforms to improve the
transmission of monetary policy and financial market deepening, which will help manage
external financial volatility. Directors concurred that the external position is broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals, and that continued exchange rate flexibility and
market-determined bond yields would be critical to help absorb external pressures.
Directors considered that the banking sector is broadly healthy and noted the progress made by
Bank Indonesia and the financial sector supervisor, OJK, in assessing financial and corporate
sector risks. They encouraged continued close monitoring of pockets of vulnerability,
particularly from somewhat higher NPLs and from corporate external debt exposure. Directors
welcomed the adoption of the Financial System Crisis Prevention and Mitigation (FSCPM) Law,
which has strengthened the financial stability framework. They encouraged the authorities to
make the law fully operational as early as possible with the issuance of relevant regulations and
to ensure the continued full implementation of corporate hedging regulations.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts and early successes in revamping the business
climate. They encouraged further structural reforms to improve the business environment and
boost private investment to support greater and more inclusive growth. In this context, Directors
highlighted priority areas, such as expanding infrastructure, enhancing the regulatory framework,
opening new sectors of the economy to investment, and closing labor skill gaps through
improved education and a more flexible immigration regime for skilled workers.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 27, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Indonesian economy continues to perform well, supported by robust
growth and greater macroeconomic stability. A prudent mix of macroeconomic policies
and structural reforms has helped the economy weather the commodity down-cycle
and several episodes of emerging market (EM) financial turbulence. Securing and
boosting growth in a more uncertain external environment requires maintaining policy
buffers, while upgrading the medium-term framework through fiscal and structural
reforms.
Near-term outlook: Growth in 2017 is projected to rise modestly to 5.1 percent,
supported by robust private consumption. Inflation is expected to remain within the
official target band, albeit slightly higher in 2017 due to lower electricity subsidies. The
current account deficit would remain contained. The risks to the outlook have risen and
are mainly external. External risks include uncertainties about the policies of the
incoming United States administration, tighter global financial conditions, spillovers
from a significant China slowdown, and lower commodity prices, which could intensify
macro-financial vulnerabilities related to banks and corporates. Domestic risks include
tax revenue shortfalls or higher domestic interest rates due to tighter global financial
conditions, which could curb fiscal space.
Main policy recommendations: Strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework
through tax policy and administration reforms, and continue to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of public spending. Monetary policy should stand ready to
deal with changes in a more volatile external environment, while maintaining exchange
rate and bond yield flexibility. It is important to fully implement the enhanced financial
stability framework by issuing the regulations of the Financial System Crisis Prevention
and Mitigation (FSCPM) Law, strengthen inter-agency coordination to respond to
shocks, and address macro-financial vulnerabilities from the bank and corporate
sectors. Deeper structural reforms are needed to improve the business environment
further and support private investment. Finally, the policy strategy should continue to
include actions to boost the economy’s resilience, to allow it to prosper even if the
external environment becomes choppier.

OVERVIEW
1.
Indonesia has maintained macroeconomic stability, while adjusting well to recent
shifts in the external environment. A prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and the launch of
structural reforms has helped the economy weather the commodity down-cycle, slow global growth,
and several episodes of financial turbulence affecting EMs. While growth has slowed slightly, it has
remained robust. Inflation has eased and the external position has improved. A gradual fiscal
consolidation has begun. There has been major progress on the financial stability framework, and
gaps related to the crisis management framework are being addressed. Structural reforms that
began in 2015 so far have improved the business environment. Positive sentiment has been
reflected in supportive capital inflows in 2016, which buoyed financial markets before undergoing
some corrections starting in October. Since the United States (U.S.) elections and the December
decision by the FED to raise interest rates, markets have accelerated the correction.
2.
Private consumption remains the main driver of growth, but higher inclusive growth
will require deeper structural reforms. Consumption growth has been underpinned by an
expanding middle class, lower fuel prices, and falling inflation. Investment has remained subdued,
reflecting spillovers from lower commodity prices, some excess capacity in mining and
manufacturing, and structural impediments, while external demand has been weak. In staff’s views,
consumption-led growth can be sustained over the medium term, but meeting the authorities’
ambitious targets for inclusive growth will require deepening structural reforms.
3.
Discussions focused on policies to strengthen the medium-term policy framework to
support inclusive growth, while preserving macro stability in an uncertain and volatile
external environment. The challenge is to continue, and in some cases deepen, ongoing structural
reforms that will boost productivity and growth, while maintaining and improving policy buffers to
boost resilience in an increasingly uncertain and volatile external environment. Policy priorities
include: (i) strengthening the medium-term fiscal framework with a growth-friendly revenue strategy
and continuing to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending; (ii) standing ready to
adjust monetary policy to deal with changes in the external environment, while maintaining
exchange rate and bond yield flexibility; (iii) implementing the enhanced financial stability
framework, improving inter-agency coordination to respond to shocks, and sustaining vigilance on
pockets of macro-financial vulnerabilities from the bank and corporate sectors; and (iv) deepening
structural reforms to improve the business environment and support private investment.
4.
Past Fund advice and the authorities’ policies have been broadly aligned. In 2016,
monetary policy easing was appropriately calibrated and there was progress with monetary
operations reform. The authorities continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy. The FSCPM
Law passed in March was a milestone for the financial stability architecture. On the fiscal front,
however, the authorities decided to launch a tax amnesty to expand the revenue base and
strengthen compliance instead of raising excises.

INDONESIA

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
5.
In 2016, growth remained strong, inflation dropped significantly, and the current
account deficit was contained.


Growth remained robust at 5.0 percent in 2016:Q3 due to resilient private consumption,
despite some modest fiscal consolidation and still weak private investment and external
demand. Credit growth slowed to the lowest over the past few years on weak corporate
demand, before slightly picking up recently.



Headline inflation dropped to the bottom of the official target band (3−5 percent)—the lowest
since end-2009—owing to stable food prices, lower administered prices, and a small negative
output gap (½ percent of GDP), with core inflation also moderating.



The current account (CA) deficit remained contained at 2.1 percent of GDP in Q1-Q3:2016,
due mainly to lower imports that more than offset lower exports. Official reserve assets rose to
US$111.5 billion at end-November (around 8 months of prospective imports), amid supportive
portfolio inflows in the first three quarters of 2016.

6.
The near-term outlook remains favorable. Growth in 2016 is projected at 5 percent on
account of robust private consumption. In 2017, growth is expected to rise modestly to 5.1 percent,
led by a gradual pickup in private investment in response to stronger commodity prices, low interest
rates, and a recovery in external demand on the back of a pickup in global growth and trade.
Inflation is expected to rise from 3.2 percent at end-2016 to around 4.5 percent at end-2017 largely
due to lower electricity subsidies and some recovery in commodity prices. The CA deficit would
remain at around 2 percent of GDP next year, with the expected pickup in fixed investment and
imports offset by the impact of higher commodity prices on exports.
7.
Overall macro-financial risks appear more manageable, but pockets of risks remain.
Macro-financial pressures have moderated slightly, aided by some recovery in commodity prices,
portfolio inflows during much of 2016, and private external debt deleveraging. Indonesian financial
markets experienced strong rallies until Q3:2016. The correction that began in October intensified
after the U.S. election in November and the FED’s decision to raise interest rates in December—in
the period of November 8-December 16, equities fell by 4 percent, benchmark 10-year bond yields
rose 70 bps, and the rupiah weakened 2.3 percent, with portfolio outflows. During this episode,
financial market volatility was higher than following Brexit, but less than during the 2013 taper
tantrum. Corporates’ external borrowing has started to decline, after a rapid rise in previous years,
and credit growth remains tepid. Corporate debt-at-risk with an interest coverage ratio less than 1
picked up somewhat this year. Banks’ nonperforming loans (NPLs) have also risen, albeit from a low
level, while liquidity remains tight in some smaller banks, and deposit growth slowed. Fiscal
financing remains reliant on nonresident investment in local currency (LCY) government bonds and

INDONESIA

in global bond issues.1 The government successfully placed international bonds amounting to
US$3.5 billion in December 2016.

8.
Indonesia’s external position in 2016 is assessed to remain broadly consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Box 1, Appendix II). Staff estimates
the current account gap to be between -0.8 and 1.2 percent of GDP, with the REER gap in the range
of -6 percent to 4 percent. The main conclusion from the external and public DSA are broadly
unchanged from the last Article IV (Appendix III). At 35.8 percent of GDP (about half of which is
public) at end-September 2016, external debt remains at a moderate level. External financing has
been sustainable, but remains sensitive to domestic and external volatility. At about 130 percent of
IMF’s reserve adequacy metric (projected for end-2016), reserves are expected to be sufficient to
buffer most shocks.
9.
Over the medium-term, the macroeconomic outlook is expected to improve. Growth is
projected to increase to 5½ percent by 2020, supported by a gradual recovery in fixed investment
and ongoing structural reforms, with the output gap closing by 2018. International reserves are
projected to gradually increase, with the reserve adequacy metric remaining broadly stable.
10.
Under an illustrative enhanced reform scenario prepared by staff that involves a more
growth-friendly fiscal policy, growth would rise to 6 percent by 2021, mainly on account of higher
infrastructure and social spending, as well as to some productivity growth from capital accumulation
and reforms.
11.
Downside risks to the outlook have risen recently and are largely external. (Appendix I:
Risk Assessment Matrix) The government and corporate sector’s reliance on external financing
makes Indonesia susceptible to global shocks and funding reversals. External risks include
uncertainties around the policies of the incoming U.S. administration, tighter and more volatile
global conditions, spillovers from a significant China slowdown, and lower commodity prices. In
response to expectations for higher interest rates following the U.S. election and an increase in the

Financial Crisis.”

U.S. policy rate in December, sovereign and corporates could face higher funding costs, together
with exchange rate depreciation and capital outflows. Domestic risks include a smaller fiscal buffer,
reflecting tax revenue shortfalls or higher domestic interest rates due to tighter global financial
conditions, which could curb fiscal space to support growth. Domestic political tensions associated
with regional elections could also increase. A confluence of external and domestic factors could
intensify pockets of macro-financial vulnerabilities related to the banking and corporate sectors.
Upside risks include stronger global growth and higher commodity prices, aided by an expected
fiscal stimulus in the United States.
12.
In the event of severe external pressures, tighter aggregate demand management and
continued exchange rate flexibility could help contain risks. International reserves should be
used primarily to prevent disorderly market conditions, provided that reserves remain adequate
(Appendix I: Risk Assessment Matrix). If international financial markets were to be closed to EMs for
a protracted period of time, targeted measures to alleviate funding pressures by banks and
corporates would help preserve financial stability. Contingent financing totaling about US$83 billion
is currently available, inclusive of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization and bilateral swap
arrangements.

Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the macroeconomic outlook. The
authorities reaffirmed their commitment to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, while
enhancing the medium-term framework to raise growth potential. Growth is projected to strengthen
in 2017, underpinned by a recovery in private investment, with exports also expected to benefit from
the recent strong rebound in coal and palm oil prices; inflation and related expectations remain at
multiyear lows; and the CA deficit is expected to remain well contained, while reserve buffers have
risen considerably. In their views, these developments, coupled with a flexible policy framework,
contingency plans, and a range of available contingent financing place Indonesia in a strong
position to manage the downside risks emanating primarily from outside the country.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy and Reforms—Growth-Enhancing Revenue and
Expenditure Strategy
14.
The government’s fiscal strategy centers on broadening the revenue base and
expanding priority expenditures, while making them more efficient within the statutory fiscal
deficit limit of 3 percent of GDP. The government aims to mobilize tax revenue by strengthening
tax collection efforts, simplifying layers of exemptions, and broadening the tax base. The authorities
also intend to continue reallocating unproductive spending and improving the efficiency of
spending, including on infrastructure, social programs, and transfers to local governments. Following
the landmark 2015 fuel subsidy reforms, the government has continued to reform energy subsidies,
including electricity and diesel, and improve the targeting of rice subsidies. The retail prices of diesel

and other fuels are being adjusted on a quarterly basis. Aided by these efforts and the planned tax
reform, the government aims to gradually lower the fiscal deficit to 2¼ percent of GDP over the
medium term, to rebuild buffers and strengthen the fiscal sector’s resilience to outside shocks.
15.
In August 2016, the authorities began a gradual fiscal consolidation while protecting
the government’s priorities. Weak revenues had pushed the fiscal deficit to 1.8 percent of annual
GDP in 2016:H1, requiring lower spending in H2 to stay within the deficit rule of 3 percent of GDP. In
addition to weak commodity-related revenues, nonoil revenues—particularly Value Added Tax (VAT)
and excise taxes—continue to underperform, exacerbating Indonesia’s structurally low tax revenues.
Against this backdrop, the Cabinet approved
a revised financial plan in August 2016, with
more realistic revenue projections and lower
spending, that staff project will lead to a
fiscal deficit of about 2.7 percent of GDP.

amnesty collections are projected to reach
0.9 percent of GDP. Building on the success
of the amnesty, the government intends to
expand the tax base and strengthen relations and trust between the private sector and the tax
administration.
16.
The 2017 budget targets higher revenue, more efficient spending in priority areas, and
a lower fiscal deficit. The 2017 budget increases nominal tax collections by around 13 percent, on
stronger collection efforts and expanded tax base. The authorities plan to upgrade the main tax laws
in 2017, including VAT and income tax laws, while using the information gathered from the tax
amnesty combined with external databases to guide audits. The budget continues to relocate
operational spending to priority areas, including infrastructure, education, and health, reduces and
better targets electricity subsidies for the poor, and increases transfers to local governments for
infrastructure. The fiscal deficit target of 2.4 percent of GDP will help rebuild fiscal buffers.

Staff Position
17.
The government’s fiscal strategy is well-placed. Staff welcomes the government’s overall
fiscal strategy. The revised financial plan approved in August 2016 was appropriate in light of weak
revenues and higher external volatility. The authorities should continue to improve targeting of
subsidies and reduce operational spending, while protecting priority spending. Ongoing expenditure

The tax amnesty program, which runs from July 2016 to March 2017, aims at boosting tax revenues, repatriating
capital held by Indonesians abroad, and improving relations of taxpayers with the tax office.

reviews in agriculture, health, and education are expected to improve efficiency, which will
strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework and contribute to growth.
18.
While Indonesia has some fiscal space to expand spending, the decision to rebuild
fiscal buffers in 2017 by targeting a lower fiscal deficit is appropriate. A range of indicators
point to the availability of fiscal space, even within the existing fiscal rule, including relatively small
financing needs and deficit levels, low inflation and credit growth, and a sustainable external
position. However, in the current context, the authorities’ plan to rebuild fiscal buffers by lowering
the fiscal deficit target in 2017 and rationalizing spending to achieve a sustained lower primary
deficit is appropriate. These policies will support the economy’s resilience to shocks, which is needed
if Indonesia is to prosper in a more volatile external environment. Meeting the authorities’ revenue
targets for 2017 will be challenging. If revenue shortfalls persist, additional revenue actions will be
needed to maintain the planned level of spending and meet the deficit target.
19.
There is room to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework to promote
productivity gains and growth. Public investment in infrastructure and expansion of social
spending, especially health and education, can catalyze other key drivers for medium-term growth,
supplemented by improving the efficiency of public expenditure. To achieve these, fiscal buffers
need to be strengthened, within the fiscal rule, buttressed by additional revenue measures from tax
policy and administration reforms. Higher domestic revenue mobilization will gradually reduce
reliance on external financing. Finally, moving to more frequent adjustments of retail fuel prices
through a transparent fuel pricing mechanism would also protect the budget from upward changes
in international oil prices.
20.
In an illustrative reform scenario prepared by staff, where both revenue and expenditure
would increase by around 3 percentage points of GDP by 2021, potential growth would increase to
6 percent by 2021. This result is similar to the experience of other EMs which implemented growthfriendly fiscal reforms. (text table).3

Growth-Friendly Revenue Strategy
21.
There is scope to mobilize non-oil revenues through growth-friendly tax policy and
administration reforms. Since 2012, total general government revenue has fallen by 2.5 percentage
points of GDP, mainly due to lower production and prices of petroleum products, and, more
recently, import contraction also affecting VAT receipts. At the same time, non-oil revenue
in percent of GDP remains weak at around its 2004 level. There is substantial scope to mobilize tax
revenue (see table)—the most growth-friendly tax is the property tax, followed by indirect taxes
(including excise taxes and VAT), Personal Income Tax (PIT), and Corporate Income Tax (CIT).4 The
following illustrative revenue mobilization strategy could be pursued in the near to medium term:



Excise tax rates on vehicle and tobacco could be increased in the near term, while
simplifying the complicated structure of tobacco excises over the medium term. A new
environmental tax on fuel products could be imposed, as both the retail price and the net tax of
gasoline and diesel are relatively low in Indonesia.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

INDONESIA



The VAT rate could be gradually raised, with VAT administration simplified. Revenue
potential from VAT is the greatest, given that the current rate is 10 percent, well below those in
OECD and large EM countries. The VAT rate could be raised gradually to 15 percent, taking into
account the cyclical position of the economy, coupled with a removal of VAT exemptions
(including on intermediate services), while administration is gradually simplified.



PIT base could be broadened by a lower threshold for the top rate, while capitalizing on
asset declarations under the amnesty.



The removal of untargeted tax incentives and unifying low-rate regimes into one single
CIT rate should be pursued. Lowering the CIT rate significantly is not advisable. At 25 percent,
the statutory CIT rate appears appropriate compared to other countries, and as large countries
such as Indonesia have little to gain from a lower CIT rate.



Higher rates on real property tax could be explored in the near term, while taking into
account that this tax has been decentralized to local governments. In the medium term, the
assessment of property values could be strengthened, and the local stamp duty (transaction tax)
could be gradually replaced by a recurrent real property tax.



International aspects of taxation should be reviewed. There is room to strengthen anti-tax
avoidance regulations such as those on permanent establishment, transfer pricing, thin
capitalization, and controlled foreign corporations. Implementation of the OECD-G20 BEPS
project needs to be adapted to Indonesia’s circumstances.5

22.
Tax administration reforms are an important element of a growth-friendly fiscal
policy. In particular, actions should aim to lower compliance costs and render tax administration
more business-friendly, including by removing ambiguities and inconsistencies in the interpretation
of tax laws and simplifying VAT filing and refund requirements. The current focus on strengthening
the tax administration through incremental reforms, rather than undergoing a potentially disruptive
reform of establishing a Semi-Autonomous Revenue Authority (SARA), is well-placed. Tax collection
efficiency can be improved by enhanced risk management, extended audit coverage through more
specific-issue audits, and moving the Extensification program (comprising efforts to increase the
number of registered taxpayers) towards a more targeted campaign.

Growth-Enhancing Expenditure Strategy
23.
Higher expenditure in selected areas will support inclusive growth. Constrained by weak
revenues, Indonesia lags compared to the rest of ASEAN in spending on growth-critical areas such
as infrastructure, health and education.


Infrastructure development should
continue, supported by stronger
coordination and close monitoring.
Improving the infrastructure investment
framework is critical to improving the
efficiency and integrity of scaling-up of
investment. With increasing fiscal
transfers to local governments, the
capacity of regional governments should
be enhanced in tandem. As state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) are increasing capital
spending and there are plans to create
six large SOE holding companies, it is important to closely monitor their balance sheets and
assess their strategic role to ensure that SOEs do not crowd out private investment. The
authorities should also closely monitor contingent liabilities from public-private partnerships
(PPPs), where some large projects were recently launched or announced.



Health and education spending could further expand. Indonesia’s spending in health and
education was 1.3 percent and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2015, respectively, well below the EM Asia
average of 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent of GDP. As additional fiscal space is generated over the
medium term and in response to Indonesia’s demographic and social needs, spending in these
sectors should increase to levels closer to peers. In the near term, the ongoing review of the
efficiency of public spending in education, health, and agriculture will help improve its impact
and lay the basis for a gradual expansion of social spending. Recommendations from the
reviews should be implemented expeditiously.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA



The efficacy of social protection programs has room to improve through consolidation
and expansion of those found to be effective. This would entail the reduction and
consolidation of various social assistance and subsidy programs, and the expansion of
conditional cash transfers, taking advantage of the updated integrated database.6

24.
Further actions on public financial management (PFM) reforms would enhance the
efficiency and integrity of public spending. The authorities are working to improve coordination
with local governments and establish incentives to boost infrastructure investment by local
government, which are welcome and should continue. Carrying out a comprehensive review of the
public investment process at all levels of government may identify measures to improve the
efficiency and efficacy of the public investment process.
25.
The government’s ambitious infrastructure program should be supported by further
financial development. The program aims to mobilize a broad base of investors, including
domestic institutional investors and banks, and introduce new financial instruments. In this context,
it will be important to ensure that the program does not relax prudential standards that in turn
could lead to excessive risk.

Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and described their actions to
support growth. A sound financial plan for 2016 approved in August 2016 enabled more realistic
revenue projections and a streamlined expenditure envelope, aimed at strengthening fiscal buffers.
By streamlining less-productive spending, they improved expenditure composition with a focus on
growth-enhancing areas, including critical infrastructure projects and better targeted energy
subsidies. These efforts, combined with potential for further revenue-raising reforms in the near to
medium term, can support fiscal consolidation while protecting spending that is catalytic for growth.
27.
The authorities concurred that revenue mobilization will be challenging but they are
confident that the 2017 targets will be met. The authorities agreed on the need to build buffers,
and noted that they had prepared spending contingency plans, should tax revenues be lower. They
noted that tobacco excises were again increased in the 2017 budget. The authorities indicated that a
tax reform group will be formed to develop a comprehensive plan to upgrade the main tax laws
in 2017. The authorities also concurred with the view that effective enforcement would be critical
following the amnesty to reap the full benefits from the effort.

B. Monetary Policy and Foreign Exchange Management—Maintaining
Stability
28.
In 2016, Bank Indonesia (BI) eased monetary policy, which remains accommodative,
and broadly maintained exchange rate flexibility. BI has cut policy rates by a cumulative 150 bps
6

For further information, see the accompanying selected issues on “Reforming the Social Safety Net.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

INDONESIA

in 2016, in response to falling inflation and, until very recently, reduced external pressures on the
rupiah. The cuts were accompanied by reduced reserve requirements to create space for credit.
Exchange rate flexibility has been broadly maintained, with some intervention during episodes of
inflow surges and outflows to prevent disorderly market conditions, including the latest bout of EM
volatility in November.
29.
Important progress has been made in monetary operation reforms (Box 2). Effective
August 19, 2016, BI shifted the policy rate to a transactional one (the 7-day reverse repo rate), to
strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and facilitate financial deepening. BI
also narrowed the interest rate corridor between the overnight Lending Facility and Deposit Facility.
The transition was smooth, and early indicators on the transmission have been favorable, with
interbank rates moving closer to the new policy rate.

Staff Position
30.
The current monetary stance is broadly adequate. The latest decisions by the BI to hold
policy rates in November and December were appropriately calibrated with inflation remaining
within the target band and greater market volatility. While inflation in 2017 is projected to remain
within the official target band, albeit higher than in 2016 due to the elimination of subsidies and
some recovery of commodity prices, the authorities should remain vigilant to the resurgence of
inflationary pressures and stand ready to adjust the policy stance, as needed. In the event of
spillovers from severe external volatility affecting the currency and related inflation expectations, BI
is encouraged to review its policy stance and adjust it to contain second-round inflationary
pressures.
31.
BI’s ongoing monetary operations reforms will support financial market deepening.
The decision to move to reserve requirement averaging in the second half of 2017 will help improve
banks’ liquidity management.
32.
Continued exchange rate flexibility and market-determined bond yields are critical to
help absorb external pressures that may arise. Keeping this flexibility will be important to allow
the economy to adjust smoothly to volatile external conditions. FX intervention should continue to
be used primarily to prevent disorderly market conditions, provided that reserves remain adequate.
The authorities’ handling of capital outflows in the recent period has been broadly consistent with
the Fund’s Institutional View on capital flows.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities are cognizant of heightened financial volatility facing EMs and were
prepared to react to the changing external environment. The authorities saw some additional
room to reduce policy rates further when conditions are appropriate, given moderate inflation, a
negative output gap, and downside risks to growth in 2016. They viewed that credit growth, which
has continued to slow for several years, has reached levels that were less than fully consistent with
growth fundamentals, but also noted that the shift to the capital markets in financing over the past

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

year had provided a partial offset. The authorities affirmed that exchange rate and bond yield
flexibility would continue to be maintained as part of a prudent policy mix to absorb external
pressures that may arise, supported by improved FX market hedging regulations. Furthermore, they
noted that the domestic FX market for the last two years has been more liquid and the price
discovery processes of the currency driven by market forces.

C. Financial and Corporate Sector Issues—Strengthening the Financial
Stability Framework7
34.
Financial soundness indicators suggest that the banking sector is broadly healthy,
albeit with areas of vulnerabilities. The high level of banks’ capital and profitability has helped
weather slowing economic growth. On average, the banking system is well capitalized and
profitable, with a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 23.3 percent and returns on assets (ROA) of
2.4 percent (as of August 2016). However, soundness varies across different types of banks. Some
smaller banks are more vulnerable to a liquidity shock, due to their higher reliance on short-term
time deposits and limited access to the money market. The financial system as a whole remains
liquid. Some sources of vulnerabilities include the rise in NPLs, special mention loans (SMLs), and
restructured loans, although there are early signs that these are stabilizing.8 Higher NPLs are related
mainly to manufacturing and trade, while NPLs in mining further increased.
35.
Risks from the corporate sector have somewhat moderated, but they remain elevated
(Box 3). Corporate vulnerabilities stem from a relatively high level of foreign currency denominated
(FX) debt exposures, elevated distressed debt, and lower cash buffers. FX risk of corporate debt has
mitigated somewhat due to the slight decline in external borrowing and deleveraging, following
weak investment appetite and business consolidation, as well as by the full implementation of BI
hedging regulations.9 Profitability has improved slightly, supported by cost-cutting and
postponement of investment projects. Nonetheless, corporate performance has varied across
sectors, with commodity related sectors slightly recovering and manufacturing remaining weak.

7

The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Report will be discussed separately at the Board later in 2017.

8

NPLs rose to 3.1 percent of total loans in September 2016 (end-2015: 2.4 percent), SMLs at 5.4 percent (end-2015:
4.9 percent); and the share of restructured loans in total loans more than doubled to 5.1 percent between April 2015
and September 2016.
9

The hedging regulations consist of (i) the minimum hedging ratio, which requires 25 percent of the net foreign
currency liabilities with a maturity period up to three months, and those that mature between three and six months;
(ii) the minimum liquidity ratio, requiring 70 percent of short-term foreign currency assets and short-term foreign
currency liabilities; and (iii) a credit rating of no less than BB or equivalent issued by an authorized rating agency.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

INDONESIA

36.
The economy is at a late stage of the credit cycle. Credit growth declined to 6.3 percent
in October 2016 from 10 percent at end-2015, but appears to have bottomed out recently. FX loans
have declined. Credit growth to corporates varies by sector, with weakness in mining and
manufacturing, and robust growth in construction. Sluggish credit growth has been mainly driven by
weak corporate credit demand, reflecting low investment. At the same time, some institutions,
particularly medium-sized banks, have tightened their lending standards given higher NPLs, but
conversely, credit expansion in large state-owned banks remains relatively robust. Some firms have
also been shifting financing sources from banks to capital markets, which can partially explain lower
lending from banks. Consumer loan growth has similarly slowed down in recent years.
37.
The authorities have further unwound part of an earlier tightening of macroprudential
policies undertaken in 2012−13.10 The unwinding includes easing loan-to-value (LTV) limits on
mortgage loans and down payments on auto loans, and raising the floor of banks’ loan-to-funding
ratios that would incur reserve requirements.11 BI has introduced a counter-cyclical capital buffer
(CCB) in January 2016, currently set at zero.
38.
The adoption of FSCPM Law in April 2016 has strengthened the financial stability
framework. The law defines domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), and provides a legal
basis for crisis response and bank resolution. The authorities are now focusing on issuing the
implementing regulations before April 2017 to make the law fully operational. These include
regulations on recovery planning (OJK); and bank restructuring and resolution of systemic and
nonsystemic banks (the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) and OJK); and short-term lending
facility (BI). The authorities have continued enhancing the integrated supervision of banks and
nonbanks and upgrading risk-based supervision. Reflecting Basel III requirements, liquidity coverage

10

The tightening in 2012–13 aimed to address systemic financial stability risks from rapid credit growth, which
peaked at almost 30 percent in 2012.
11

This is the second round of unwinding since 2015, and in order to maintain prudence and macro-financial stability,
the relaxation is only applied to banks with NPL ratios under 5 percent.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

ratio (LCR) requirements are being adopted to help banks manage liquidity risk, besides a number
of other liquidity ratios monitored by the authorities.
39.
Financial deepening remains a priority of the government. Financial deepening in recent
years has been slower than in peer EMs, constrained by a segmented banking system, shallowness
of the financial markets, and low financial inclusion. Nonetheless, over the past decade the local
currency government bond market has seen growth in depth and range of investor participation,
including from foreign investors. The authorities have created a high-level coordinating committee
comprising the key public agencies to intensify coordination on financial deepening.
Indonesia: Financial Deepening Index Comparison to Peers

Sources: IMF Staff Discussion Note 15/08; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Financial development indices are in the range between 0 and 1, with a higher value representing more
advanced financial development.
2/ Peers include Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey.

Staff Position
40.
Progress achieved in assessing financial and corporate sector vulnerabilities should
continue. Macro-financial linkages should continue to be carefully monitored with regards to banks’
soundness and liquidity, and corporates’ NPLs and developments in FX debt, including
conglomerates. The authorities should continue to ensure the full implementation of the corporate
FX hedging regulations and proper loan classification and provisioning against problem loans.
Removing various bank deposit and lending rate caps would improve the financial sector’s resilience
to shocks and contribute to better transmission of monetary policy.12
41.
The authorities are rightly focusing on making the FSCPM Law fully operational. The
FSCPM Law establishes a coordination mechanism to maintain financial stability. The approval of this
law should be followed by the closely coordinated revisions of the laws of BI, OJK, and LPS to ensure

12

Current supervisory guidance includes on deposit rate caps for large banks, informal guidance for single-digit
lending rates, and maximum interest rates allowed for guaranteed deposits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

INDONESIA

the overall consistency of the legal framework, providing clarity on mandates and policy
responsibilities.
42.
Financial deepening should continue to be balanced with financial stability. This
requires continuing to develop a strong supervisory and regulatory framework, as well as
modernizing instruments and institutions. Progress on developing a national plan for financial
deepening should continue to allow for enhanced coordination at the national level.

Authorities’ Views
43.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessments and recommendations, and
emphasized progress on the financial stability framework. They emphasized that the banking
system is among the most capitalized and profitable in EMs, which provides strong buffers to
support financial stability. While banks’ asset quality has weakened somewhat from very low levels,
banks are adjusting well including by increasing provisions and loan write-offs. The authorities are
closely monitoring the process of NPL restructuring to ensure financial stability. The authorities also
noted ongoing efforts to further improve monitoring of the corporate sector, where they see that
risks have abated to some extent and remain manageable, aided by BI’s FX hedging regulations.
Finally, the authorities noted that the financial stability architecture had been strengthened and that
the new FSCPM Law is expected to be fully operational in the coming months.

D. Structural Reforms—Boosting Private Investment
44.
The authorities place high importance on revamping the business climate and have
achieved some early successes. Following the landmark 2015 fuel subsidy reform, the authorities
have been implementing reforms aimed at improving the business environment and strengthening
the economy’s productivity and competitiveness. The government announced 14 economic policy
packages since September 2015, including some that streamline regulations and support private
sector investment. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regime was also partially liberalized, and
clarity has increased on the setting of the minimum wage.13 These actions contributed to Indonesia’s
notable improvement in World Bank’s Doing Business ranking in 2016 (15 positions to the
91st position).
45.
Notwithstanding reforms to date, challenges remain to support private investment
(Box 4). While the global economy has seen a slowdown in private investment in recent years,
Indonesia has undergone a sharper decline than most of its regional peers, adversely affected by a
slump in commodity prices.14 Investment growth in the commodity sector has stalled, while that in
manufacturing has contracted, and the economy’s linkages with global value chains have weakened.

13

In 2015, a minimum wage formula for provinces was established, which is defined as Minimum Wage t+1 =
Minimum Wage t × (1+National Inflation Rate t + National GDP Growth Rate t)
14

For further information, see the accompanying selected issues on “Drivers for Private investment in Indonesia.”

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Infrastructure is below those of other EM peers. Labor skills gap may have constrained investment,
while rigid labor markets have resulted in a proliferation of short-term contracts.

Staff Position
46.
The government should continue with its efforts to strengthen the economy’s
productivity and competitiveness through targeted reforms. Building on these efforts, deeper
reforms would bolster private investment and growth.


Expanding infrastructure. Accelerated infrastructure development would reduce logistics costs
and improve competitiveness and productivity, including in manufacturing and tourism. The
authorities are rightly planning to expand PPP projects, and the recent start of construction of a
large electricity generation plant under this scheme, expected to be completed by early 2020, is
promising. Continuing financial deepening with stronger institutional investors base will help
channel funds to infrastructure development.



Policy packages reflect the authorities’ commitment to improving the investment climate,
and efforts should continue. Stronger inter-agency coordination is needed to accelerate the
land acquisition process, streamline still-complex regulations, and reduce uncertainty on
regulatory consistency. Increased coordination with local governments would improve the
investment climate. A comprehensive review of the role of SOEs in the economy, with a view of
establishing a level playing field and opening sectors to private investment, would also
contribute to higher private investment and growth.



Pursuing trade integration and further modernizing the FDI regime would promote
investment and economic diversification. The recent revision in the FDI regime is an
important step, but further liberalization will help attract FDI inflows as Indonesia’s regulations
remain comparatively restrictive. Opening up new sectors of the economy to private investment,
including the energy and service sectors (e.g., tourism), could become important drivers of
growth and diversification. Participation in new regional trade arrangements would help
reinforce Indonesia’s attractiveness and integration into global value chains, which should be
pursued along with policies to mitigate the social impact of greater integration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

INDONESIA



Stronger efforts are needed to improve the labor market and narrow the skills gaps. While
the implementation of the minimum wage formula will increase business certainty, wage growth
should be aligned with productivity growth at the enterprise or industry levels. Rigid labor
practices, especially on worker dismissal procedures, should be rationalized and the social safety
net strengthened to facilitate the transition. The skills gap would narrow with expanded
vocational training linked to the economy’s needs and improved quality of education, supported
by more qualified teachers. Adopting a more open immigration policy toward skilled workers
can temporarily abate the unmet demand for skilled workers.

Authorities’ Views
47.
The authorities reiterated a strong commitment to continuing structural reforms. They
highlighted significant advance in setting the tone for the importance of structural reforms in
Indonesia, and progress has been made through the economic policy packages launched since
September 2015. They noted that structural reforms are key to strengthen the productivity and
competitiveness of the economy and the need to differentiate Indonesia from peers. While
continuing infrastructure development, they will further streamline regulations including the
Negative Investment List (DNI) and at the local level, thereby bringing in FDI and diversifying growth
engines, especially in manufacturing and tourism. They plan to review the role of SOEs, with a view
to making more space for the private sector and its investment. The authorities also plan to reform
vocational training and the quality of education in order to enhance manpower.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
The Indonesian economy continues to perform well, supported by robust growth and
macroeconomic stability. Over the past few years, the economy has weathered well a major
commodity down-cycle and several episodes of financial turbulence affecting EMs, aided by a
prudent mix of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. The near-term macroeconomic
outlook remains positive, with economic growth rising modestly, inflation within the official target
band, and the current account deficit manageable.
49.
Downside risks to the outlook have risen recently and are largely external. Indonesia’s
reliance on external financing leaves it susceptible to global shocks and funding reversals. External
risks include uncertainties around the policies of the incoming U.S. administration, tighter and more
volatile global conditions, spillovers from a significant China slowdown, and lower commodity prices.
Domestic risk arises primarily from tax revenue shortfalls and higher interest rates, which could curb
fiscal space to support growth.
50.
The authorities have strengthened the short-term fiscal framework. The revised financial
plan approved by Cabinet for 2016 includes prudent revenue projections and spending
commitments. While Indonesia has some fiscal space to expand spending, the decision to rebuild
buffers by targeting a lower fiscal deficit in the budget for 2017 is appropriate. Progress continues to
be made in reforming and better targeting subsidies and improving the efficiency of spending.

51.
There is room to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework, including through
fiscal reforms that generate productivity gains and improved infrastructure. Low tax collections
continue to limit fiscal space. The authorities’ plan to upgrade the main tax laws in 2017 is well
placed. There is also room to deepen tax administration reforms to strengthen compliance and
reduce compliance costs. Ongoing actions to enhance the quality and efficiency of public spending
should continue. The authorities should continue to move towards automaticity of energy prices via
a transparent fuel pricing mechanism. The domestic investor base of the government bond market
needs to be strengthened, which combined with higher domestic revenue mobilization, will
gradually reduce reliance on external financing over the medium term.
52.
Tax reform can generate the bulk of additional needed tax revenue. Excise tax rates on
vehicle and tobacco could be increased in the near term, together with a new environmental (fuel)
tax, while simplifying the structure of tobacco excises over the medium term. VAT provides the
greatest revenue potential and the authorities could gradually raise the VAT rate, coupled with
removing VAT exemptions, while simplifying administration. PIT base could be broadened by a
lower threshold for the top rate, while capitalizing on asset declarations under the amnesty.
53.
Business-friendly tax administration reforms would lower taxpayers’ compliance costs.
The business environment can be strengthened by removing ambiguities and inconsistencies in the
tax laws, and simplifying VAT filing and refund requirements. Tax collection efficiency can be
improved by enhanced risk management, extended audit coverage through more specific-issue
audits, use of external taxpayer information, and moving the Extensification program towards a
more targeted campaign.
54.
The current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Policy rates were lowered in 2016,
in an environment of falling inflation and reduced external pressures on the rupiah. With inflation
remaining within the target band and the external environment more uncertain, the policy rate since
has been placed on hold. Exchange rate flexibility has allowed the economy to adjust to intermittent
shocks, including higher volatility in capital flows. Continuing with this approach will be critical to
allow the economy to adjust to shocks, including by standing ready to adjust the monetary policy
stance in the event of severe external pressures and allowing the exchange rate and bond yields to
move flexibly. Indonesia’s external position in 2016 is assessed to continue to be broadly consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
55.
The reform of monetary operations should continue. The introduction of the 7-day
reverse repo rate as the policy rate has been smooth, with early indications that it has improved the
transmission of monetary policy. The authorities also announced the introduction of reserve
requirement averaging, which is expected to improve banks’ liquidity management. Removing
various bank deposit and lending rate caps would improve financial sector resilience to shocks and
improve the transmission of monetary policy.
56.
Risks from the corporate sector have moderated slightly but remain elevated. The
corporate sector remains vulnerable due to FX debt exposure, an elevated share of distressed debt,
and reduced cash buffers. FX risk of corporate debt has mitigated somewhat as a result of lower

external borrowing and deleveraging, supported by the BI regulation on FX hedging. In addition, a
large portion of the external debt of nonfinancial corporates is with parent or related loans.
Corporate performance varies across sectors, with manufacturing particularly weak. Profitability has
also improved somewhat, supported by cost-cutting and postponement of investment projects. In
response to expectations for higher interest rates following the U.S. elections and the increase in the
U.S. policy rate in December, corporates could face higher funding costs together with exchange
rate depreciation and less supportive capital flows. In this context, the continued full implementation
of the hedging regulation is important to contain risks, while the preparation and implementation of
a balanced financial deepening plan can gradually reduce corporates’ reliance on external financing.
57.
The banking system overall remains sound, with some pockets of vulnerabilities. Some
smaller banks are more vulnerable to liquidity shock due to their higher reliance on short-term time
deposits. Other sources of vulnerabilities are increased NPLs, special mention loans (SMLs), and
restructured loans, although there are early signs that they are stabilizing. The authorities should
continue to closely monitor banks’ soundness and liquidity conditions, including loan classification
and provisioning, while enhancing inter-agency coordination. Macro-financial linkages should
continue to be carefully monitored with regards to corporate sector performance, particularly NPLs
and developments in FX debt.
58.
Making the FSCPM Law fully operational is a priority. Issuing the relevant implementing
regulations should be followed by the coordinated revisions of the laws of BI, LPS, and OJK, to
ensure the overall consistency of the legal framework to the new institutional landscape. These
revisions should provide clarity on the mandates and policy responsibilities of each institution.
59.
Deepening structural reforms would bolster growth and diversify the economy. While
consumption-driven growth can be sustained in the medium-term, boosting growth and making it
more inclusive will require further structural reforms to improve the business environment and boost
private investment. Priorities include expanding infrastructure, enhancing the regulatory framework,
especially of local governments, opening new sectors of the economy to investment, and closing
labor skill gaps through improved education and a more flexible immigration regime for skilled
workers.

Box 1. Indonesia: External Sector Assessment1
Overall Assessment. In 2016, Indonesia’s external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Lower commodity prices and weak trading partner demand for commodity
exports have been broadly compensated by import compression. Easing trade and investment restrictions, growthfriendly revenue mobilization, deepening financial markets, and improving labor markets would help strengthen overall
competitiveness over the medium term. External financing appears sustainable, but could be affected by domestic or
external shocks. The authorities’ handling of capital outflows in the recent period has been broadly consistent with the
Fund’s Institutional View on capital flows.
Foreign asset and liability position and trajectory. At end-June 2016, Indonesia’s net international investment position
(NIIP) stood at -46 percent of GDP, compared to -43¼ percent of GDP at end-2015. A majority of the widening in the
first half of 2016 was due to strong net portfolio inflows (mainly government debt). At end-June 2016, gross external
liabilities stood at 71 percent of GDP. At end-September 2016, Indonesia’s gross external debt was moderate at
35¾ percent of GDP, with about 6½ percent of GDP denominated in rupiah. The level and composition of the NIIP and
gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is sustainable, but nonresident holdings of rupiah
denominated government bonds, with a share of 37 percent at end-November 2016, could be affected by global
volatility. Private external debt growth is expected to slow on the implementation of BI’s FX hedging regulations, and
expected tightening of global financial conditions.
Current account. Drawing on the IMF’s model-based External
Balance Assessment (EBA) regression exercise, staff assess the
cyclically-adjusted current gap to be -0.8 percent to
1.2 percent of GDP relative to the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies for 2016.
Much of this gap could be accounted for by low public health
spending in Indonesia and fiscal policy gaps in other countries.
Real exchange rate. Compared to the 2015 average, the REER
appreciated by 3.1 percent in the first ten months of 2016. EBA
index and level REER results suggest the REER gap to be about
-3.4 percent to 3.2 percent, respectively, in line with staff’s
REER gap assessment in the range of -6 percent to 4 percent
based on the CA assessment.

Capital and financial accounts. Indonesia’s gross external
financing requirement is expected to be about 9.2 percent of GDP in 2016, with amortization at about 6 percent of GDP.
Net FDI and new borrowing are projected at 1.5 percent and 7.6 percent of GDP, respectively. Net and gross financial
flows have been steady since the global financial crisis despite some short episodes of volatility. The narrower current
account deficit and strengthened policy framework including exchange rate flexibility since mid-2013 have also helped
reduce capital flow volatility. For 2016, financial flows have been supported by attractive bond yields and assets
repatriation related to the tax amnesty but could become weaker or reverse in the event of large domestic or external
shocks as seen in November. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position, keeping inflation in
check, and easing supply bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term.
FX intervention and reserves levels. Indonesia’s floating regime has facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market
conditions. Reserves are assessed to be adequate as assessed against the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric,
sufficient to absorb most shocks, with predetermined drains also manageable. Intervention should aim primarily at
preventing disorderly market conditions, while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks.

Box 2. Indonesia: Monetary Operation Reforms
Backdrop for reforms. Since 2010, the transmission of the policy rate had weakened, as the overnight (O/N) interbank
interest rate hovered near the floor of the interest rate corridor represented by Bank Indonesia’s deposit facility rate (as
a Standing Facility), reflecting ample liquidity arising from large capital inflows. This opened up a divergence of as much
as 200 basis points between O/N interbank rates and the stated policy rate. Without a transacted anchor at the
short-end of the yield curve, the interbank money market has also failed to develop a viable interest rate structure,
notably for tenors of 3 months to 12 months.
Bank Indonesia has launched a series of reforms to
improve the transmission of monetary policy
operations, including:



Shifting the policy rate to the BI 7-day reverse repo
rate, a risk free rate actually transacted by the BI with
the money market. The shift did not change the
monetary policy stance.



Narrowing the interest rate corridor between the
overnight Lending Facility and Deposit Facility,
reverting to a mid-corridor system at ±75 bps around
the new policy rate.



Managing the transition well, ably communicating
to the markets. During the period, BI absorbed more
liquidity at the longer tenors of the term structure,
helping keep excess liquidity in the overnight deposit
facility contained, and implemented measures to
strengthen the interbank rate mechanism (JIBOR). To
further sensitize market participants to the impending
shift, BI published the term structure of its monetary
operations (up to one year) in its monetary policy
statements since May 2016, to provide a reliable rate
structure for market reference.



Announcing reserve requirement averaging. In
November 2016, BI indicated that it was preparing for
implementation of a reserve requirement averaging
scheme in the second half of 2017, which would
further incentivize banks’ liquidity management and strengthen policy transmission.

Further reforms are recommended to strengthen transmission and deepen the money markets:



Shifting from fixed-rate to variable-rate auctions, for the 3 to 12 month tenors, to encourage market
participants to transact for price discovery and shape the yield curve.



Removing transmission constraints to deposit rates, notably ceilings for large banks and maximum guaranteed
deposit rates.



Completing the short-term risk-free yield curve by gradually expanding issuance of short-tenor treasury bills as
instruments to underpin interbank money market transactions, including repos.

Box 3. Indonesia: Update on Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA)1
The pattern of intersectoral funding and
exposures is broadly unchanged between
end-2014 and end-2015. Nonfinancial
corporations (NFCs) borrowing from the rest of the
world (ROW), in the form of both FDI and otherwise,
remains the largest exposure in the BSA. The rupiah
depreciated approximately 10 percent in U.S. dollar
terms as of mid-2016, which inflates all BSA
positions denominated in foreign currency
proportionately. After correcting for this
development, NFC borrowing from the ROW has
significantly decreased by 20 percent. The largest
change in exposure stems from a 30 percent
increase of government borrowing from the ROW.
Stress-testing demonstrates the impact of a
combined depreciation (25 percent) and capital
outflow shock (10 percent).2 In this scenario, NFCs
lose 10 percent of their funding from the ROW,
while existing liabilities increase by 25 percent in
national currency terms. In a second round, NFCs
replace the missing funding with bank funding (or
deposit withdrawal), thereby passing on the shock
to the banking system. After the shock, liabilities of
NFCs with both ROW and banks increase by about
4 percent. The shock also affects government debt
which increases by 4 percent of GDP.

Box 4. Private Investment in Indonesia
Indonesia has seen a marked slowdown in private investment. While investment globally and in the region has
decelerated, Indonesia’s investment has slowed more markedly than that of peers. Over the past several years,
investment has become more important in Indonesia as a source of growth, accounting for a third of economic
output. The investment slowdown mainly reflects weak private investment, in contrast with a pickup in public
investment.
Cyclical factors related to both the commodity down-cycle and subsequent economic downturn have
hampered private investment. After a commodity-related investment boom prior to 2013, commodity prices have
slumped, pushing down investment growth. The subsequent economic slowdown affected sectors beyond
commodities, notably manufacturing. Capacity utilization in mining and manufacturing also fell and remains
subdued, accompanied by a sharp fall in selling prices. With cash flows decreasing, corporates responded by cutting
costs, postponing investment and laying off workers. Since a number of corporates still rely on internal cash flows
for funding, a prolonged weakness in commodity prices and soft economic growth has reduced financing capacity
for investment.
Structural constraints have also affected private investment, resulting in weakened linkages with global
value chains. Investment has been constrained by weak infrastructure, rigid labor markets and labor skills gaps, as
well as regulatory risk and uncertainty. Also financial constraints have been a factor, as some banks have tightened
their lending standards amid higher NPLs. While the business climate has started to improve on the back of the
authorities’ reforms, important challenges remain.
In contrast, public investment is rising, led by local governments and SOEs, with progress made in PPPs.


The central government is increasingly
channeling investment through local
governments and encouraging SOEs to ramp
up capital spending. Capital expenditure of
SOEs doubled in 2016, and are expected to
rise by around 35 percent in 2017, aimed at
meeting infrastructure development needs
(text chart). To strengthen investment
capacity, the government capitalized
selected SOEs in the energy, food, and
infrastructure sectors in 2016 (amounting to
about 0.4 percent of GDP). In 2017, the
government is planning to establish six
holding companies in different sectors to
increase their financial leverage and reduce
duplication.



The authorities have also made some recent progress with PPPs. Several projects have started, including the
landmark project of 2 GW Central Java Power Plant, with the investment amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP,
partly funded by overseas investors. Considerations are also being given to diversifying funding sources, such
as securitizing existing infrastructure and promoting SOE joint ventures with the private sector. The government
also has increased the number of priority projects to 30 from 22 projects aimed to start by end-2018
(equivalent to 8 percent of GDP), where SOEs and PPPs are expected to play an important role.

Expected Impacts

Recommended Policy Responses

High
Combined with uncertainties regarding the policies
of the incoming U.S. administration, portfolio and
other capital inflows could be curtailed by weaker
investor appetite for emerging market (EM) assets.
Tighter funding conditions put additional pressure
on the balance of payments (BOP), government
financing, and the financial and corporate sectors.
Bank funding could become constrained, raising
domestic borrowing costs. Rollover risks rise for
corporate external debt. A severe crunch in credit
growth or spike in lending rates could hit
corporate and household balance sheets (including
property) and reinforce negative growth dynamics
through asset price corrections and confidence
losses.

Maintain exchange rate flexibility and marketdetermined bond yields. Preserve a sound fiscal
position, while allowing automatic stabilizers to
work in case of an extreme economic slowdown
and using contingent financing if market access
is restricted. Monetary policy tightening would
need to be combined with targeted measures to
alleviate funding pressures faced by some
segments of the banking system and preserve
financial stability to avoid reinforcing financial
stresses brought on by market volatility and
capital outflows. These should be combined
with heightened monitoring of corporate sector
vulnerabilities and firm implementation of
measures to encourage hedging of corporate
external debt. Maintain vigilance on exchange
rate pass-through to inflation.

High
Lower export volume and prices (particularly those
of commodities) could widen the current account
deficit, putting FX reserves and the exchange rate
under pressure. The fiscal balance would
deteriorate on weaker resource revenues and
knock-on effects to domestic demand, with the
financial sector exposed to losses from loans to the
commodity sector and a broader economic
slowdown. Corporate profits would decline from
weak commodity related activities.

Maintain exchange rate flexibility to help reduce
the current account deficit and limit FX reserve
losses. More stringent fiscal measures to contain
the budget deficit might be necessary if the
slowdown in EMs were accompanied by
protracted financial market volatility that
restricts funding. Accelerate infrastructure
spending and structural reforms to boost
productivity and employment in non-resource
sectors, and export diversification.

Medium
Fiscal position would weaken further on lower oil
related revenues, with adverse spillovers to growth
if space for public investment is curbed.

Implement upfront revenue reforms to raise
non-oil revenues, and accelerate structural
reforms to boost private investment and
productivity.

Low-Medium
Trade protectionism and reversal of globalization
affects external demand, while suppressing FDI
flows.

Resist protectionism while deepening regional
trade integration and seek new opportunities to
enhance position in global value chains.
Strengthen domestic drivers of growth, notably
private investment.

Medium
The fiscal impulse supporting growth over the past
year would reverse abruptly, precipitating a growth
slowdown which could damage investor
confidence, curb capital inflows, raise bank NPLs,
increase the country risk premium, and raise costs
for corporate external borrowing. The consequent
layoffs could further weaken domestic demand.

Implement growth-friendly revenue measures to
raise tax collection. Prioritize expenditures to
growth-critical areas and minimize disruptions
to project execution. Accelerate structural
reforms to the trade and investment regime to
boost productivity, private investment, and
exports. Assuming inflation is well anchored and
the external sector remains stable, ease
monetary policy. Supervisory actions to preserve
banking system soundness and close
monitoring of at-risk corporate borrowers.

Medium
Stronger business and investor confidence
translates into higher private investment activity.
Economic growth outperforms expectations and
reinforces the favorable dynamics.

Reinforce the positive reform momentum by
implementing a coherent inclusive growthenhancing fiscal framework within a mediumterm strategy, deepen investment climate
reforms, and accelerate trade integration and
labor market reforms.

domestic political risks could
intensify in the run-up to the
Jakarta election, making
reforms more difficult.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 percent and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
“Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Technical
Background
Notes

Background. At end-June 2016, Indonesia’s net international investment position (NIIP) stood at -46 percent of GDP,
compared to -43¼ percent of GDP at end-2015. A majority of the widening in the first half of 2016 was due to strong net
portfolio inflows (mainly government debt). At end-June 2016, gross external liabilities stood at 71 percent of GDP.
Indonesia’s gross external debt was moderate at 35¾ percent of GDP, with about 6½ percent of GDP denominated in rupiah
at end-September 2016.
Assessment. The level and composition of the NIIP and gross external debt indicate that Indonesia’s external position is
sustainable, but nonresident holdings of rupiah denominated government bonds, with a share of 37 percent at
end-November, could be affected by global volatility. Private external debt growth is expected to slow on the implementation
of BI’s FX hedging regulations and expected tightening of global financial conditions.
Background. Indonesia’s current account deficit is projected at 2.0 percent of GDP in 2016, as the continued decline in
commodity exports could be largely compensated by less imports due to low oil prices and cyclical weakness in investment.
The contraction of exports and imports is moderating, as commodity prices have bottomed out. Over the medium term, a
moderate increase in the current account deficit is expected from a rise in capital goods and raw material imports tied to
infrastructure investment and a pickup in domestic demand. A gradual increase in manufacturing exports, stronger demand
from trading partners, and relatively low projected world oil prices should help limit the increase in the CA deficit. External
adjustment would be supported over time by continued exchange rate flexibility and a prudent monetary and fiscal stance, in
keeping with a moderate increase in domestic saving.
Assessment. The EBA CA model suggests a gap of 0.2 percent of GDP for 2016 (based on an estimated cyclically-adjusted CA
balance of -1.4 percent of GDP and a norm of -1.6 percent of GDP), same as the gap of 0.2 percent for 2015. Taking into
account the uncertainties of the EBA-regression estimates and Indonesia’s investment needs, staff assesses that a norm of 0.6 percent to -2.6 percent of GDP is appropriate.1/ This suggests a CA gap range of about -0.8 percent to 1.2 percent of GDP
for 2016, which reflects domestic gaps including in social spending and policy gaps in partner countries (particularly fiscal
deficits).
Background. Compared to the 2015 average, the REER appreciated by 3.1 percent in the first ten months of 2016.
Assessment. EBA index and level REER results suggest the REER gap to be about -3.4 percent to 3.2 percent, respectively, in
line with staff’s REER gap assessment in the range of -6 percent to 4 percent in 2016 based on the CA assessment.
Background. Indonesia’s gross external financing requirement is expected to be about 9.2 percent of GDP in 2016, with
amortization at about 6 percent of GDP. Net FDI and new borrowing are projected at 1.5 percent and 7.6 percent of GDP,
respectively.
Assessment. Net and gross financial flows have been steady since the global financial crisis despite some short periods of
volatility. The narrower current account deficit and strengthened policy framework including exchange rate flexibility since
mid-2013 have also helped reduce capital flow volatility. For 2016, financial flows have been supported by attractive bond
yields and assets repatriation related to the tax amnesty but could become weaker or reverse in the event of large domestic
or external shocks as seen in November 2016. Continued strong policies focused on strengthening the fiscal position,
keeping inflation in check, and easing supply bottlenecks would help sustain capital inflows in the medium term.
Background. Since mid-2013, Indonesia has had a more flexible exchange rate policy framework. Its floating regime has
better facilitated adjustments in exchange rates to market conditions. At end-November 2016, reserves were US$111.5 billion
(equal to 122 percent of IMF’s reserve adequacy metric—and about 8 months of prospective imports of goods and services).
In addition, the authorities have in place contingencies and swap lines amounting to about US$83 billion.
Assessment. Volatile capital flows could cause reserves to decline significantly. While the composite metric may not
adequately account for commodity price volatility, the current level of reserves should be sufficient to absorb most shocks,
with predetermined drains also manageable. Intervention should aim primarily at preventing disorderly market conditions,
while allowing the exchange rate to adjust to external shocks.
1/ A range of +/- 1 percent is added to reflect the fact that the EBA-regression estimates are subject to high uncertainty given
the large residual.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment
In 2016, Indonesia’s external
position is assessed to be broadly
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. Lower commodity
prices and weak trading partner
demand for commodity exports
have been compensated by
import compression. External
financing appears sustainable,
but large share of new
borrowing makes it vulnerable to
domestic and external shocks.
Potential Policy Responses
Monetary policy should continue
to focus on containing inflation
within Bank Indonesia’s target
band. Fiscal policy can help
support external adjustment and
contain vulnerability to funding
pressures by aiming for a small
primary deficit over the medium
term. This could be led by
reforms aimed at mobilizing
revenues in a growth-friendly
way to provide space for health
and infrastructure spending to
help ease supply bottlenecks and
bolster exports over the medium
term. Continued flexibility of the
exchange rate and use of
market-determined interest rates
would also help facilitate
adjustment and absorb shocks.
Easing trade and investment
restrictions, deepening financial
markets, and improving labor
markets would help strengthen
overall competitiveness over the
medium term.

Appendix III. Indonesia—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Indonesia’s external debt remains at a moderate level and is projected to be sustainable over the
medium-term. Growth in private external debt is expected to remain slow, partly contained by the BI’s
FX hedging regulations and less favorable global financial conditions. Public debt remains low, but
contingent liabilities arising from borrowing by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and public-private
partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure development may pose some fiscal risk, which should continue to
be carefully monitored. Reliance on foreign investors remains sizable, which could leave Indonesia
susceptible to external shocks and funding stops.
External Debt Sustainability
Indonesia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has stabilized after a steady increase in recent years,
and total external debt remains at a moderate level. As a share of GDP, external debt was
36 percent at end-2015, up from 25 percent at end-2011, reflecting a rise in general government
borrowing, through internationally issued bonds and holdings of nonresidents of domestic bonds,
and private external borrowing, mainly through loans and debt securities, including by SOEs. As
growth in external borrowing has slowed and pressures on the exchange rate have reduced, external
debt is expected to decline to 34 percent of GDP at end-2016 (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Looking ahead, the external debt is projected to gradually decline in the medium term. Under
the baseline, debt would decline to 25¾percent by end-2021 in line with favorable real GDP growth
and a slower buildup in nonbank private sector debt due to BI’s FX hedging requirements and less
favorable global financial conditions. Public external debt is expected to remain at low levels, as
external borrowing of the public sector is tightly regulated by an inter-ministerial committee. Real
GDP growth is projected to average about 5½ percent over the medium term.
As in the last Article IV, external sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is
more sensitive to current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 2). A further deterioration in
the current account balance from the current level would cause the external debt ratio to rise
moderately (a one-standard deviation shock would raise the external debt to GDP ratio to
30¾ percent by 2021). Exchange rate depreciation would have the largest impact—a 30 percent
depreciation in 2017 would raise the external debt-to-GDP ratio to about 46¼ percent in 2017
followed by a gradual decline to 37 percent of GDP by 2021.
Public Debt Sustainability
Public sector debt remains low in Indonesia. General government debt as a percent of GDP
declined steadily from 87 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2015, owing to a prudent fiscal stance,
which has been anchored by the fiscal rule since 2003. The rule caps the annual general government
deficit at 3 percent of GDP. The debt dynamics have been also favorable, with strong GDP growth
and moderate real interest rates. In 2016, the debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to increase to
28 percent of GDP (from 26.8 percent of GDP in 2015), reflecting slightly larger primary deficit than in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the past and higher real interest rate. At the same time, foreign-currency denominated debt has
fallen to less than half of total public sector debt, as issuance in the domestic rupiah bond market
has grown and attracted strong foreign interests. Notwithstanding, dependence on foreign investors
remains sizable, with nonresidents holding about 60 percent of general government debt. Moreover,
the share of foreign ownership of rupiah-denominated government bonds rose from
about 20 percent in 2009 to about 37 percent as of end-November 2016.
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt is expected to increase gradually over the
medium term (Figure 3). The baseline envisages the general government deficit to remain constant
at 2.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, resulting in the primary deficit at ¾ percent of GDP
through 2021. Favorable debt dynamics, with a negative interest rate-growth differential (about
5 percent over the medium term), would limit the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is
expected to reach 29.4 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs are also expected to remain at
around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Public debt dynamics are robust to both standard shocks and stress tests (Figures 4 and 5). Even
under the most severe scenario with a combined macro-fiscal shock, total government debt would
stabilize at 35 percent of GDP or 250 percent of revenue, with gross financing needs below 7 percent
of GDP. Nevertheless, fiscal risks, in particular those arising from expanding balance sheets of key
SOEs and PPPs, will need to be managed carefully. These modalities of investment are tasked with
the bulk of infrastructure development, and strengthening public investment management will limit
contingent liabilities arising from such entities and activities.

Currently, the World Bank’s support is being provided through the Government Financial
Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) program, trust funds, and
development policy loans (DPLs), with elements in support of (a) efficient treasury operations,
including accounting reforms, improved in˗year budget disbursement, and regulatory reform;
(b) improved linkages between planning and budget preparation through the implementation of
a medium-term expenditure framework, performance budgeting, and the enhancement of
budget flexibility at the service delivery level; and (c) improved capacity for budget oversight
through systems and organizational reform. Indonesia’s Ministry of Finance launched SPAN in
April 2015. SPAN, a financial management information system supported by GFMRAP, is
designed to improve transparency, efficiency, and accountability of the government’s financial
transactions. An updated Public Expenditure review and further analysis in 2017 are informing
the efficiency and effectiveness of government budgets. An ongoing Development Policy Loan
(DPL) on fiscal reforms also supports reforms to enhance the allocative efficiency and
effectiveness of public spending. The IMF has complemented this work through recent technical
assistance (TA) on subsidy reform and social safety nets aimed at ensuring longer-run fiscal
sustainability.

Taxation Issues


Revenue (tax and nontax revenue) issues are a priority for the IMF and the World Bank, with
broadening the revenue base and increasing revenues an important issue for both macro-fiscal
stability and the investment climate. The Fund conducted a mission on tax policy and
administration in September 2014 to identify key reform options in each of these areas. The
Bank provides tax policy (including international tax) and administration support through trust
funded TA to the Fiscal Policy Agency and DG Tax and an ongoing DPL on fiscal reforms. The
Bank has also been providing analytical support on nontax revenue administration.

Asset-Liability Management


The World Bank and IMF have been leading an effort to improve asset-liability management,
including at the Treasury and Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance and at Bank
Indonesia, with continued collaboration envisaged, as needed.

Crisis Preparedness


In recent years, the World Bank has focused on supporting the authorities in Indonesia to create
a robust crisis prevention and management framework. Most recently, this support has included
analysis of the financial sector stability framework through the 2010 FSAP and a series of crisis
simulation exercises. Preparation is underway for the next FSAP. Between 2012 and 2015, the
Bank’s Program for Economic Resilience, Investment and Social Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI)
DPL, now disbursed and closed, has also supported the authorities in this area. The IMF has
supported work in this area through past TA on reviewing the legal framework underpinning
Indonesia’s financial stability architecture and in its current surveillance dialogue with the
authorities and exchange of views with the Bank.

Financial Sector


The World Bank has focused on broad monitoring of the financial sector. Through its Financial
Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization DPL, the Bank supported the
implementation of reforms aimed at maintaining stability, increasing diversification, and
enhancing financial sector inclusion in Indonesia. The IMF has concentrated on the banking
system, with emphasis on regulation and supervision, with a resident advisor placed at the
Financial Services Agency (OJK) in January 2015. It has also embarked on TA in financial
deepening, focused initially on money and foreign exchange market development and more
recently on monetary operations and the transmission mechanism. In addition, the Fund has
provided recent TA on the macro prudential policy framework and bank stress testing. A joint
World Bank-IMF FSAP was completed in 2010 and some recommendations have been followed
through by the authorities. The Bank is to provide TA to implement select FSAP
recommendations concerning the nonbank financial sector.

Statistics


The World Bank has a major program of capacity building with the statistics agency that was
launched in 2011. The Statistical Capacity Building-Change and Reform for the Development of
Statistics (STATCAP-CERDAS) program is designed to focus on improvements in key statistical
series that should improve the ability to understand the Indonesian economy, executed through
an institution-wide approach, which includes significant business, IT and HR/organizational
reforms. The IMF has focused recent training and TA on government finance statistics, monetary
and financial statistics, and sectoral balance sheets.

Macroeconomics


The IMF continues to take the lead in macroeconomic areas, with the Article IV mission and staff
visits, focusing on fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies; macro-financial linkages, financial
sector reforms, and crisis management, as well as the external position and spillover effects. The
Fund also updates the Debt Sustainability Analysis at the time of the Article IV consultation, with
inputs from the World Bank and other development partners. The Bank has also taken on a
larger role, including on macroeconomic monitoring, public policy dialogue, and capacity

building, with ongoing coordination with the Fund. The Bank continues to assist the Ministry of
Finance‘s Fiscal Policy Office to improve capacity for macroeconomic monitoring, forecasting,
and evidence-based macroeconomic and fiscal policy analysis.
These threads of work are expected to be continued by both institutions, with periodic meetings
aimed at keeping each other informed about ongoing work and joint areas of interest. Issues being
addressed by the IMF include domestic and external vulnerabilities, exchange rate management,
medium-term external and fiscal sustainability, and macrofinancial linkages and financial stability
risks; and by the Bank the link between macrofiscal policy and real economic outcomes, including
growth and poverty, resource-sector fiscal revenues, and longstanding problems in the
implementation and effectiveness of government spending.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 2016)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans to Indonesia have totaled US$31.5 billion since 1969.1 The
ADB approved a total of US$1.4 billion in loans to Indonesia in 2015. The sectors with the largest
shares in cumulative lending are public sector management (18.9 percent), energy (14.4 percent),
agriculture and natural resources (14.1 percent), and finance (13.4 percent).2
Between 1969 and 2015, the ADB provided TA grants to Indonesia amounting to US$437 million.
The TA grants were financed from the ADB’s TA Special Fund, the Japan Special Fund and other
sources.
The ADB has completed a new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2016−2019 for Indonesia, aligned
with the government’s medium-term development plan for 2015−2019. The CPS is closely attuned
to the needs of Indonesia as a large middle-income country and guided by the government’s
commitment on development. The CPS will also maintain consistency with the priorities set out in
ADB’s Mid-Term Review of Strategy 2020.
ADB’s new partnership with Indonesia will be working toward inclusive and environmentally
sustainable growth through improved infrastructure services, better economic governance, and
enhanced human resource development.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance.
National accounts: Statistics Indonesia (BPS) disseminates annual and quarterly GDP (QGDP) by economic activity and expenditure
components at current prices and in volume terms at 2010 prices regularly. In general, GDP estimates are based on the latest
international methodologies following the System of National Accounts 2008. The QGDP estimates are based on a limited set of
indirect indicators. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, with seasonally adjusted data prepared but not published.
BPS has been leading the work on developing sectoral accounts and balance sheets jointly with Bank Indonesia (BI) with TA from
STA. BPS and BI expect to finalize the annual nonfinancial accounts, financial flows, and stocks for the year 2010, and quarterly
financial flows and stocks starting from Q1:2015 in 2017. A TA mission on Sectoral Accounts and Balance Sheets will be fielded in
January 2017.
Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. In October 2013, BPS released the new Producer Price Index
(PPI) covering agriculture, mining and quarrying, and manufacturing with 2010 as the base period, and has published the PPI index
quarterly. BPS has also expanded the mining sample to include oil and natural gas extraction, coal, and gold, and starting or
completing work to further expand PPI coverage to include 15 service industries. There is a need to increase dissemination
frequency and update the weights. Bank Indonesia and BPS have jointly begun work to expand the coverage of the residential
property price index (RPPI) to include resales (the current RPPI includes only the sales of newly constructed units). It is planned that
the new index will be released later in 2016.
Government finance statistics (GFS): The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal statistics
at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, with better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the current efforts. The authorities
are continuing their efforts to adopt the GFSM 2001/2014 standards, with assistance from STA as part of a regional GFS project.
Significant progress has been made in these areas and, in 2013, Indonesia reported for the first time to STA general government
data (including balance sheet data) covering the period 2008 onwards. Aggregated data on the budget of the central government
are available with a one-month lag. Annual general government GFS are currently available 12 months after the end of the
reference period and these data are published on the GFS website: http://www.gfs.djpbn.kemenkeu.go.id/en. The timeliness of the
annual data will improve once all systems are in place.
The authorities have started to compile quarterly general government data in 2015. Quarterly general government GFS (operations
statement) are available 6 months after the end of the reference quarter. The quarterly general government data are yet to be
published on the GFS website because the authorities are planning to improve these data in terms of coverage of local
governments and timeliness with the development of new regional financial information system.
In late 2015, the authorities have started to develop methodology to compile quarterly general government data based on
estimates of local government data.
The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics are generally adequate.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs): Good quality monetary statistics are
compiled by BI on a timely basis. BI compiles and reports monetary data using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), from
which an integrated database and alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be drawn to meet the needs of BI and the
IMF. Additional challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification. With the
support of a Fund TA mission in October 2014, BI expanded the coverage of the OFCs survey, which since January 2015 includes
finance companies, insurance companies, pension funds, the state owned pawn shop (PT Pegadaian), and the Indonesian export
financing institution (Eximbank); achieving almost full coverage of the subsector. OFC data are reported on a monthly basis. The
mission also assisted BI in advancing the production of flow-based monetary statistics and quarterly financial accounts. BI
compiles and reports to the Fund all (12) core and 12 encouraged financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for deposit takers, all
(two) encouraged FSIs for OFCs, two encouraged FSIs for nonfinancial corporations, one encouraged FSI for households, two
encouraged FSIs for market liquidity, and three encouraged FSIs for the real estate sector, which are published quarterly on the
Fund’s FSI website.
Balance of payments (BOP): Trade data have been improved in recent years. Import and export transactions of free trade
zones and bonded warehouses are captured in goods data of BOP statistics.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial improvement.
Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign equity using a fixed ratio to
estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have improved the coverage of the directory of enterprises
in recent years. Other areas that need improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio
investment and other investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item in the BOP has been large at
times and appears to be related to the under coverage of assets in the financial account. Financial transactions data are
reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP), except data on direct investment.
Annual and quarterly IIP data are compiled and published, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI.
External debt statistics have improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002
and the recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. Also, as a result of the ongoing reconciliation of data conducted by BI,
the IIP and external debt data are fully consistent. However, improvements are still needed with respect to components of
private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt service, in estimating the
accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating reschedulings/debt reductions received by the
private sector from external creditors.

Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) since September 1996, observing most of the
SDDS requirements. Indonesia uses the SDDS flexibility
options for the timeliness of the labor market categories
(employment, unemployment, and wages/earnings) and
general government operations.

Statement by IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
January 25, 2017
The following information, which does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal, has become
available following the issuance of the staff report.
1.

The latest data released include:



Headline inflation fell to 3.0 percent (y/y) in December 2016 on lower food prices inflation,
while core inflation remained stable at 3.1 percent (y/y).



Based on preliminary data, the central government deficit for 2016 as a whole was
2.5 percent of GDP, with somewhat lower government revenue (12.4 percent of GDP) and
expenditure (14.9 percent of GDP) than those projected in the staff report. Collections from
the tax amnesty for 2016 as a whole were Rp 107 trillion (0.9 percent of GDP).



International reserves rose to US$116.4 billion at end-December 2016, following a
US$3.5 billion international sovereign bond issuance in December.

2.
Financial markets have stabilized. Since mid-December, the rupiah has appreciated by
around 0.1 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the 10-year government bond yields has fallen by
about 25 bps, and equities rose by 1.8 percent, with stable capital flows. Market movements
appear broadly in line with those of regional EM peers.

3.
On December 21, Fitch upgraded Indonesia’s sovereign rating’s outlook from
“stable” to “positive” and affirmed the rating at BBB- (Investment Grade). The cited factors for
the upgrade were: (i) the track record of macroeconomic stability; (ii) effective monetary and
exchange rate policy in response to market turmoil; and (iii) a strong structural reform drive
since 2015.

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for Indonesia
and Arief Machmud, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 25, 2017
On behalf of the Indonesian authorities, we would like to express our appreciation to the IMF
mission team for the candid discussions and policy dialogue during the 2016 Article IV
consultation.
The authorities are in broad agreement with the focus of this year’s consultation which is to
strengthen the medium-term policy framework to support more inclusive growth, while
preserving macroeconomic stability in a prolonged uncertain and volatile external environment.
The authorities are encouraged by staff’s acknowledgement of Indonesia’s robust
macroeconomic performance, proper policy management and ongoing structural reforms.
Nevertheless, the authorities view that the policy recommendations and risk analyses need to
consistently take into account the progress made thus far by the authorities as well as Indonesia’s
solid and sound macroeconomic and financial conditions. Notable examples are in staff’s
assessment of the external sector development and financial and corporate sector issues. As
an illustration, adding the word ‘continue’ to the last sentence of the key issues section in the
staff report (“….the policy strategy should continue to include actions to boost the economy’s
resilience, …..”) would provide a more accurate picture of the Indonesian economy as well as
acknowledge the efforts of the authorities.
We view that against the risks mentioned, a qualifying opinion from staff to where Indonesia
currently stands and its ability to weather the risks is very important. The absence of this
qualifying opinion would result in a rather pessimistic assessment and draw unnecessary
attention which is inconsistent with Indonesia’s economic resilience and positive prospects. As
Article IV is an important reference for the global community at large, we view it is imperative
for the analysis to put more weight on coherence rather than completeness. This is important for
Indonesia as well as for other emerging market economies as an overemphasis of risk aspects
could affect the confidence of investors and financial market participants which is unfair to the
country. In this respect, we wish to highlight the following areas.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Indonesian economic policies are guided by a sound macropolicy direction which enables
the economy to withstand volatile external conditions. Notwithstanding the complexity of the
policy challenges emanating from the external headwinds and the on-going structural reforms in
the domestic economy, the authorities have employed a so called “Bauran Kebijakan” or “the
policy mix strategy”. This policy mix strategy allows the authorities to determine a harmonious
combination among monetary, fiscal and structural reform policies to ensure a more sustainable
and inclusive economic growth. For instance, during the episode of taper tantrum, the

2
macroeconomic strategy placed emphasis on maintaining stability over growth, whereby
monetary policy was aimed at preserving stability while fiscal policy was directed at nurturing
growth. Following a clearer direction in the US monetary policy normalization, the authorities
shifted the strategy by using monetary policy primarily to support growth while pursuing fiscal
consolidation to retain credibility. In the current complex situation, the macroeconomic strategy
places greater weight on stability, while using structural reforms to strengthen growth.
Throughout these periods, the policy combination is not only accompanied by deeper and
stronger structural reforms but also a more flexible exchange rate regime, ample reserve level,
calibrated macro-prudential policy and better communication strategy.
The above strategies have resulted in the Indonesian economy performing well among
peers (recorded the third highest growth among G20 countries). The economy grew by
5.02 percent in the third quarter of 2016, bringing the estimated economic growth to 5 percent
for the whole year. Inflation, at 3.02 percent in 2016, was at the lower range of the inflation
target of 4 ± 1 percent. Fiscal deficit stood at 2.46 percent of GDP, while public debt remained
low and manageable at 27.7 percent of GDP at the end of 2016, with well diversified currency
composition (almost 60 percent in Rupiah-denominated debt) and debt maturity (weighted
average of 9 years). The balance of payments recorded a larger surplus in the third quarter
of 2016, supported by a narrower current account deficit and a larger capital and financial
account surplus. The 2016 current account deficit is expected to be below 2 percent of GDP.
International reserves remained sufficient at USD116.4 billion as of December 2016, equivalent
to 8.4 months of imports and official debt repayment.
Consistency in maintaining macroeconomic stability while optimizing economic growth has
safeguarded the economy’s resilience and is recognized by international community. In
December 2016, Fitch revised Indonesia’s outlook to Positive and affirmed the Investment
Grade. Correspondingly, the implementation of structural reforms has contributed to the
significant improvement in Indonesia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business Index.
Indonesia’s economic outlook is expected to further improve. The economy is projected to grow
between 5.0–5.4 percent in 2017, supported by solid domestic demand and a recovery in exports,
along with improvement in prices of Indonesia’s export commodities. The government is
expected to record a prudent fiscal deficit in 2017 coupled with a more realistic tax revenue
target and better subsidy scheme. The 2017 budget will be primarily allocated to productive
spending to support the growth momentum and improve infrastructure and basic services,
including education, health and social welfare. Meanwhile, the current account deficit is
expected to remain below 3 percent of GDP. The authorities will carefully monitor the impact of
the plan to lower subsidy on some tariffs, such as electricity, on inflation, and will ensure that
inflation expectations are firmly anchored. In addition, financial stability and corporate sector
conditions are also expected to further improve in line with a better economic outlook.

3
External Sector Development
The authorities are fully cognizant of the importance of the external sector and remain
vigilant in maintaining and strengthening external resiliency. The authorities wish to
highlight staff’s assessment that Indonesia’s external position is broadly consistent with mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Further, staff also assessed that reserves are
sufficient and that in the event of severe external pressure, exchange rate flexibility would help
contain risks. While staff has rightly stressed that global uncertainty can have downside risk to
the economy, the authorities wonder what is staff’s final assessment of the resiliency of the
Indonesian economy. Further, we would like to point out that the external risks mentioned are a
global phenomenon not unique to Indonesia. Against this backdrop, the authorities would like to
underline their confidence in weathering future external shocks, namely due to 3 factors:
(i) sound macroeconomic discipline; (ii) intensive monitoring of debt characteristics and
compositions; and (iii) sound prudential policy to mitigate risks.
On sound macroeconomic discipline, the authorities focused on three major areas, namely
a sustainable current account deficit (CAD), more flexible exchange rate and sufficient
level of reserves. Indonesia’s CAD has been on a declining trend and is consistent with mediumterm economic fundamentals. Over the years, the CAD has declined from 3.19 percent of GDP
in 2013 to 2.06 percent of GDP in 2015. By the end of 2016, the CAD is projected to be below
2 percent of GDP. The authorities are committed to further safeguard the CAD within its
medium-term sustainable level and to improve competitiveness and promote exports which
would in turn further improve the CAD. On the exchange rate, Indonesia has implemented a
more flexible exchange rate regime in line with its fundamental value. Exchange rate flexibility
has helped increase the resilience of the external sector as reflected in improvements in the CAD.
Meanwhile, international reserves are sufficient at USD116.4 billion as of December 2016,
equivalent to 8.4 months of imports and official debt repayment. The reserves are further
supported by the availability of a second line of defense from bilateral, regional and global
financial arrangements which provide further buffers against external shocks.
The authorities will continue to monitor debt characteristics and compositions. Currently,
Indonesia has a healthy International Investment Position structure, where net external liabilities
are mostly long-term (FDI and long term loans) that will provide positive trickle-down effects on
long-term economic activities and growth. Indonesia’s long-term foreign borrowing amounts to
87.5 percent of total foreign borrowings with a balanced share between public and private debt.
Short-term debt of private non-bank corporations amounts to only 5 percent of total foreign debt.
Further, non-resident holders of Indonesian government bond are also dominated by long-term
investors, including central banks.
In addition to implementing a strong policy framework, the authorities will continue to adopt
necessary prudential regulations to maintain and strengthen external resiliency. To ensure
prudent external debt management, the authorities have since end-2014 implemented prudential

4
regulations to manage external debt of non-bank corporations, where non-bank corporations
must meet minimum hedging and liquidity ratios as well as minimum credit rating requirement.
This is in addition to the 3 percent fiscal deficit ceiling introduced by the State Law, a special
committee to administer and approve the SOEs’ related loans, and existing banking prudential
regulations on loan and foreign exchange exposures.
Financial and Corporate Sector Issues
The authorities wish to highlight that the Indonesian financial and corporate sectors
remain resilient and well placed to weather the current uncertain global conditions. As
noted by staff, the banking system is well capitalized and profitable, with ample liquidity. The
capital adequacy ratio stood at 23 percent at end-November 2016, well above the international
standard. Meanwhile, ample liquidity is reflected in the low level of volatility of interbank
market rate and the ratio of liquid assets to third party fund, which stood at 20.5 percent at endNovember 2016. Latest data have also signaled that NPLs’ growth is reaching its peak in
addition to improved corporate performance, especially in the commodity-related sector. Taking
into account the positive outlook of the Indonesian economy and the rising commodity prices,
risks emanating from the banking and corporate sectors are expected to moderate in the future. In
sum, the authorities would like to underline a very important conclusion of the risk assessment
on the banking and corporate sectors, namely that none of the identified risks triggers systemic
concerns in the financial system, despite the said “pockets of vulnerability” in those areas.
To ensure that no vulnerability in the banking and corporate sectors persist, the authorities
regularly monitor and conduct stress tests in compliance with international best practices.
The results again confirmed that there is no systemic risk. As an example, the result of the
authorities’ stress test on liquidity shock showed that only 1 (one) small-sized banks (out of
118 banks) encountered a liquidity problem due to its reliance on short-term deposits.
Nevertheless, the authorities assessed that the problem to be temporary and not a structural issue.
Sufficient access to liquidity both from money market and the central bank is also available to
the bank.
The same strong conclusion on the absence of systemic risk also hold true for the corporate
sector. The authorities believe that corporate vulnerability will also decline in line with
improvements in corporate performance as reflected in increasing profitability (data up to
September 2016). This is further bolstered by improved efficiency including a tendency among
corporations to reduce debts. In addition, the authorities would also like to refer to the analysis
from related working paper1 draft by staff which states that risks in the Indonesian corporate
sector are manageable and that the authorities have been proactive in monitoring corporate

Default Analysis.” IMF Working Paper (draft) WP/16/XX, pp.4.

vulnerabilities. The above reference simply reinstated that there are no systemic risks stemming
from the corporate sector.
In this regard, the authorities would like to convey the need to have a coherent assessment
on the banking and corporate sectors to understand the depth of the problem and the ability of
the authorities to handle the issues. Emphasizing the analysis on the risks would overshadow the
progress made by the authorities in strengthening the resilience of the financial and corporate
sectors and to address pockets of vulnerabilities.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
On the fiscal front, the authorities appreciate staff recognition that the fiscal strategy is
appropriate. The government has embarked on a gradual fiscal consolidation while protecting
infrastructure priority spending. The tax amnesty program launched by the government has been
successful in collecting significant tax payments and repatriated funds as well as expanding the
revenue base.
Going forward, the authorities are committed to implement a growth-friendly fiscal strategy and
concurred with staff’s assessment that revenue mobilization will be challenging. Nevertheless,
the authorities’ commitment to achieving revenue targets remain unwavering. This effort
will be supported by several factors, namely: (i) a new larger tax base as a result of information
obtained through tax amnesty; (ii) potential for further revenue-raising reforms with the creation
of a tax reform team in January 2017. The team will also help improve the organization and
clarity of the tax reforms roadmap, which will improve credibility of the tax revenue target;
(iii) plan to improve the information system to capitalize on the readily available information
from tax amnesty; (iv) efforts to address complications in tax regulations as well as to implement
tax policy and administration reforms by way of amendments to the VAT law and income tax
law are also underway; (v) electronic invoicing. With the above progress and strategies, it is also
worth noting that tax revenues will also move in line with the tax buoyancy rate. The authorities
have also continued to work closely with the IMF through Technical Assistance to further
improve the fiscal position.
Structural Reforms
The authorities have embarked on a series of structural reforms to improve the economy’s
competitiveness and the business climate. Focus areas of the reform are on improving the ease
of doing business, providing good infrastructure, diversifying sources of growth (including
developing the tourism sector and more value added export products), improving purchasing
power and deepening the financial market. As staff noted, there are signs of early successes, as
shown in the improvement of Indonesia’s ranking in the Doing Business Index, which in 2016
moved up 15 positions to 91. The deep and intensive reforms are aimed at supporting the
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2014-2019 which is led directly by the President.

The NDSP comprises of three arrows, namely human development, priority sector development
and equitable development.
One important landmark in improving the investment climate is the establishment of OneStop Service (OSS) for investment under the Investment Coordinating Board Agency (BKPM),
in January 2015. The objective of the OSS center is to accelerate and simplify licensing
procedures for investment projects by placing the licensing processes for all businesses (except
those in the banking and energy sectors) that were handled by 22 ministries and government
agencies under one roof. The business climate has been further improved by the introduction of
the 3-hour investment licensing service in January 2016 and the 10th Policy Package on
Negative Investment List in February 2016. As many as 130 companies with investment value of
IDR291 trillion have benefited from the OSS service up to October 2016. Meanwhile, up to
June 2016, 527 companies have applied to invest with total planned investment of
USD12.9 billion as a result of the revised Negative Investment List.
Debottlenecking effort was also done to accelerate the implementation of priority
infrastructure projects. Recognizing the need to improve infrastructure, the authorities have
established a body under the Economic Coordinating Minister as a Project Management Office
(KPPIP) to administer 30 priority infrastructure projects, ranging from electricity, energy,
seaport, airport and toll roads. One notable progress of this body is the revision of the Law on
Land Acquisition for Public Interest which sets a maximum time to complete the land
acquisition process, the biggest hurdle in undertaking infrastructure projects. To date, many
projects, such as the Trans Sumatra Toll Road Project and Java North Line Double Track Rail
Project, have benefited from the revision of this regulation.
Conclusion
The Indonesian economy is progressing well with well-preserved macroeconomic and
financial stability. The authorities have proven their resolute commitment and are well prepared
to tackle prolonged global uncertainty with appropriate policies. The authorities believe that
combining policy mix with appropriate structural reforms provides optimal result for an
emerging market economy such as Indonesia. To that extent, the authorities will continue its
unwavering commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability and broad-based structural
reforms. We believe that this commitment is a major factor in shaping the economy’s agility in
weathering shifts in the external environment and has been well tested in several episodes of
global financial turbulence as well as during the period of commodity down-cycle.
