EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
The Jordanian economy has performed remarkably well in recent years. Despite negative
shocks (including increasing oil prices), growth has been robust (averaging 6 percent during
2001–06), the public debt ratio has continued to fall, inflation has remained low, and reserves have
reached an all-time high. This reflects sound monetary and fiscal policies, far-reaching structural
reforms—including trade liberalization and improvements in the business environment—and a
successful privatization program.
Focus of discussions
This year’s discussions focused on policies needed to sustain Jordan’s strong economic
performance.
•

Medium-term external outlook: Despite the large current account deficit in 2006 (16 percent
of GDP), the baseline outlook is positive. With appropriate policies in place, the current deficit
is expected to narrow substantially over the medium term, reducing reliance on capital inflows.

•

Macroeconomic policy mix: With a fixed exchange rate and an open capital account, the
burden of adjustment will fall on fiscal policy to maintain macroeconomic stability, reduce the
current account deficit, and lower further the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Monetary policy will
continue to aim at maintaining the exchange rate peg, which has served Jordan well.

•

Structural reforms: Implementing a wide array of fiscal structural measures, including on
pensions, sales and income taxes, revenue administration, and public expenditure management
is key. Continued improvement in the business environment and proceeding with privatization
are also important to maintain high growth and reduce unemployment.

Key staff recommendations
•

Maintain the policy reform agenda. This offers the best prospect for sustained strong economic
performance. Jordan’s current account deficit and reliance on capital inflows remain high, as
does its public debt burden. Making further progress on these issues requires both sustained
policy reforms and a supportive external and regional environment.

•

Legislate a new public debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP in 2011 as the new fiscal anchor to
better insulate the budget from political pressures. This year’s budget could have been more
ambitious.

•

Remove excess liquidity by issuing additional certificates of deposit (CDs). This should help
slow domestic credit growth, rein in consumption and imports, and strengthen further the
interbank market.

Authorities’ views
•

Sound economic policies will be continued to sustain Jordan’s good economic performance.

•

Growth should remain at 6 percent next year—despite risks from the recent equity market
downturn, declining profits, and higher interest rates—given continued large investment
projects.

•

The overall deficit, including grants, will be about 3½ percent of GDP in 2007, mainly to
accommodate high-priority spending.

2.
This success is due mainly to far-reaching macroeconomic and structural
reforms. Under successive Fund-supported programs, the Jordanian authorities pursued
sound fiscal policy; negotiated successfully several debt reschedulings; reduced budget
deficits (following the passage of the 2001 Public Debt Law); eased trade barriers
substantially, acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2000, and completed several
bilateral trade deals (notably the free trade agreement with the U.S.); deregulated extensively
food and fuel prices; undertook a successful privatization program; and took measures to
improve the business environment.

3.
Jordan’s performance also reflects a stable and supportive political
environment. The cabinet, reshuffled in November 2006, is pursuing its mandate to
implement the 10-year National Agenda, which aims at advancing political and economic
reforms, and strengthening internal security. And, following a forum held in July, the
government has established the “We are All Jordan” Commission to help implement reforms
in the economic and political spheres. General elections are scheduled to be held in 2007.
4.
Against this background, discussions covered policies needed to sustain Jordan’s
strong economic performance. The authorities’ response to past Fund advice is summarized
in the table below. The specific questions discussed with the authorities arise in the following
areas:
•

The medium-term external outlook and competitiveness: Will the recent narrowing of
the current account deficit continue? Is the level of the peg appropriate? Are there any
competitiveness issues?

•

The macroeconomic policy mix: What kind of fiscal adjustment is required to maintain
macroeconomic stability, reduce the current account deficit, and further lower the public
debt-to-GDP ratio? How can monetary policy contribute to maintaining the exchange rate
peg and reducing the current account deficit?

•

Structural reforms to support medium-term growth and reduce unemployment:
What macroeconomic and structural reforms are needed to maintain robust growth and
reduce unemployment and poverty? What steps are needed to further improve the
business environment?

Jordan: The Authorities' Response to Fund Policy Advice from 2005 Article IV Discussions
Recommendations

Actions Taken
Fiscal Policy

Limit the 2005 fiscal deficit to 5.3 percent of GDP, instead of a
projected 6.4 percent, and continue fiscal consolidation over
the medium term.

Fiscal deficit was limited to 5.0 percent in 2005, and lowered
further to 4.3 percent in 2006. The 2007 budget targets a deficit
of 3.4 percent of GDP. Further consolidation is planned by the
authorities under a new medium-term public debt target.

Raise the lower GST rate from 4 percent to 8 percent and extend
GST to electricity and transportation.

No actions taken.

Introduce automatic petroleum pricing formula.

Monthly price adjustments in place for a few oil products
already at market levels, but not yet fully automatic.

Allocate more funds to targeted social safety net programs
focused on most vulnerable segments.

Targeted social safety net program related to fuel price
increases executed successfully.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Consider introducing greater flexibility of the exchange rate,
once requisite institutional preparations are in place.

Staff now considers exchange rate regime and level
appropriate, consistent with authorities' views.

Structural and Other Policies
Intensify efforts to improve public expenditure management,
macrofiscal forecasting and analysis, and fiscal management
through the introduction of a GFMIS.

Progress is being made on public financial management
reforms, including on establishing a treasury single account,
modernizing the budget classification, implementing GFMIS,
and strengthening budget processes. Reforms in these areas
are continuing.

Continue intensified banking supervision, enact AML/CFT
legislation, and facilitate domestic capital market development.

Improvement in banking supervision has continued; AML/CFT
law is in parliament; efforts ongoing in capital market development.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
With sound policies in place, economic performance remained strong in 2006
(Tables 2 and 3). Growth of 6¼ percent was recorded during the first three quarters, and is
estimated at 6 percent for the year. This reflected buoyant domestic demand (private
consumption and investment), in part financed by large private capital inflows. Although
average inflation increased to 6.3 percent, this stemmed mainly from fuel and imported food
price increases, with core inflation (excluding food and energy) well contained.
Unemployment declined to 14 percent, from 15 percent a year earlier. The Amman Stock
Exchange index declined sharply in the first half of the year, but has since stabilized.
Following interest rate developments in the U.S., Jordan’s yield curve flattened over the
course of the year.

6.
The current account deficit narrowed—albeit to a still-high 16 percent of GDP—
and was financed by long-term capital inflows (Table 4). A broad-based slowdown in
import growth and continued strong performance of exports and remittances have been key.
At the same time, private capital inflows rose to record levels on the back of foreign
investments in banking, mining, telecommunications, and real estate. As a result, gross
usable reserves reached US$6.1 billion at end-2006—more than US$1¼ billion higher than at
end-2005—equivalent to about five and a half months of prospective imports (Figure 1).
Following four years of modest depreciation, the real effective exchange rate (REER)
appreciated by 6 percent during 2006, a return to levels prevailing in the early part of the
decade.
7.
The fiscal situation also improved (Tables 5 and 6, Figure 2). Stronger revenue
performance (income tax and general sales tax receipts), larger-than-expected grants
(especially from Saudi Arabia), and the authorities’ decision to raise domestic fuel prices
(lowering substantially oil subsidies) more than offset higher primary spending on transfers,
security, and wage bonuses. Preliminary estimates suggest that the fiscal deficit (including
grants) was about 4¼ percent of GDP in 2006 and 7½ percent excluding grants, both lower
than in 2005. The deficit was financed comfortably without adding to macroeconomic
pressures. A narrowing of the fiscal deficit, together with partial privatization of Jordan

Telecom and strong growth, reduced the public debt-to-GDP ratio further, to 73 percent by
end-2006, from 83 percent in 2005.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
9.
The macroeconomic outlook is positive, with steadily declining inflation and a
sustained growth rate of 6 percent (Figure 3).
•

Under the currency peg, and as the oil and food price shocks work their way through the
system, inflation is expected to fall to 5.7 percent next year and then to decline to levels
closer to those of the U.S.

•

The high growth rates experienced over the last five years—well in excess of what would
be expected from factor accumulation—are indicative of a structural shift in trend
growth, likely reflecting the impact of Jordan’s ongoing reforms, a major step up in
foreign direct investment (FDI) and private investment levels, and improving
productivity.

•

For next year, the authorities expect growth to remain strong given the coming on stream
of large investment projects. Staff believes that growth could be slightly lower because of
slowing housing and equity markets (wealth effects), declining corporate profits
(investment effects), and the delayed effects of higher interest rates.

10.
The external outlook is more uncertain, but staff’s analysis suggests the risks are
limited given recent trends.
•

While the current account deficit has been large in the past few years, it has partly
reflected a sizable increase in private investment. Foreign investors have ratcheted up
operations in Jordan since 2003, boosting private investment (and associated imports) by
an estimated 8 percentage points of GDP. But this has also increased substantially
Jordan’s foreign exchange earning capacity for the coming years.1

•

The current account is expected to narrow further. The strong export momentum of
recent years is likely to continue, reflecting the free trade agreement with the U.S., strong
regional demand, and large investments in traditional export sectors. Import growth is
projected to stabilize on account of falling import unit prices (a substantial reversal of
recent trends) and import volume growth more in line with overall economic activity.
Assuming tourism and remittance growth in line with recent norms, the current account
deficit would decline steadily to 7½ percent of GDP by 2012.

•

The narrowing of the current account deficit will come mainly from higher savings.
Investment is expected to decline only modestly and from a high starting level,

1

Higher private investment played an important role in Jordan’s current account deterioration, but high oil
prices and an influx of about ½ million Iraqi migrants had boosted domestic consumption by up to a combined
12 percentage points of nominal GDP.

11

supporting Jordan’s medium-term growth prospects. Savings should increase, however,
from 11 percent of GDP in 2006 to about 18 percent in 2012. Public saving increases
reflect medium-term fiscal adjustment. Private savings are also expected to increase—as
tighter credit conditions, weaker asset prices, and declining fuel and food subsidies put
private consumption back on trend.
•

External debt dynamics and liquidity ratios do not signal vulnerability. With a
falling current account deficit, and continued strong FDI inflows, reserve ratios to
imports and short-term debt should remain comfortable, and external debt (mostly
concessional) could be halved in five years (to 23 percent of GDP). As discussed in the
external debt sustainability analysis (DSA), these baseline projections are robust to
several assumed shocks, but are more sensitive to private capital inflows, including
regional FDI (Appendix I).
B. Fiscal Policy

11.
The authorities intend to base their policies on achieving a public debt-to-GDP
ceiling of 60 percent by 2011.2 They are considering updating the Public Debt Law’s
existing 80 percent limit, which was
instrumental in securing past

However, a still-high public debt,

adjustment is warranted. The fiscal
DSA highlights the dependence of debt sustainability on sustained fiscal adjustment
(Appendix II).
12.
Both sides agreed that medium-term fiscal adjustment should rely primarily on
spending measures. With the Jordanian economy well taxed, the authorities indicated that
any higher tax revenue (on top of higher expected fuel-related revenues, see below) should
come from further strengthening tax administration and broadening the tax base.
2

With the recent oil price decline, the 60 percent target becomes easier to reach, leaving room to adjust, as
needed, to exogenous shocks. The medium-term fiscal adjustment entails declines in debt ratios of about
3½ percentage points per year, which appears feasible given falling deficits and assumed strong growth; debt
reduction in recent years has on average been far larger.

12

Accordingly, the authorities will concentrate their efforts on keeping nonpriority current
spending constant in real terms, while protecting priority spending. This requires savings on
transfers and other current spending, a better targeted social safety net, and improved public
financial management (see table below).

1/ 2007 preliminary budget includes JD 55.2 million (about 0.5 percent of GDP) amortization to IMF.

13.
The draft 2007 budget is consistent with the new medium-term debt target. The
overall deficit, including grants, is set to improve by about 1 percentage point of GDP, to
3.4 percent. While planned fiscal adjustment could have been more ambitious, the authorities
indicated that this was the best they could do given high priority spending needs. (These
include large one-off defense and security spending of about 2 percentage points of GDP that
is expected to be unwound the following year.) At the same time, the authorities had
reiterated their plan to eliminate fuel subsidies in 2007, to be followed by an automatic
formula-based fuel price adjustment mechanism to help insulate pricing decisions from

13
political considerations.3 In addition, they are considering introducing specific inflationindexed excises and full general sales tax (GST) on selected petroleum products that could
generate at least 1 percent of GDP a year, although this will not likely take place this year.
14.
Despite continued fiscal adjustment, securing appropriate domestic financing
will resume its importance over the medium term. Although requirements are expected to
remain low next year, net domestic financing will likely average 2¾ percent of GDP on an
annual basis over 2008–12. This is due to a marked decline in net foreign financing—linked
to an end of Paris Club reschedulings—and completion of the privatization program. The
authorities are considering extending the yield curve beyond five years and issuing long-term
JD-denominated bonds on regional markets mainly to test the confidence of regional
investors in the JD and to avoid squeezing private sector credit. They are also considering
issuing Islamic financial instruments (sukuks) for budget financing needs and for mopping up
excess liquidity of Islamic banks.
15.
The authorities intend to continue with structural fiscal adjustment as a key part
of their reform agenda:
•

Tax and expenditure policy measures include broadening the GST base; strengthening
the income tax regime; phasing out food subsidies; and proceeding with civil service
reform.

•

Revenue administration measures are continuing apace, in line with Fund technical
assistance recommendations. These include strengthening further the large taxpayer
office and setting up medium taxpayer offices. Staff called for accelerating reforms in the
area of public financial management, including on strengthening macrofiscal
management, completing work on the treasury single account, modernizing the budget
classification, implementing Government Financial Management Information
System (GFMIS), and strengthening budget processes.

•

Reforming the pension system is essential for its long-term viability. Although the Social
Security Corporation has been achieving surpluses of about 1½ percent of GDP, it needs
to put its finances on a sustainable footing to ensure that early retirement is actuarially
fair, benefits are linked to lifetime contributions, and pensions are indexed to inflation to
prevent an erosion of their real value over time. The World Bank is providing assistance
in this area.

3

At the time of the discussions, it was projected that the elimination of the subsidy required an average
10 percent fuel price increase in March 2007. Given recent fuel price declines, these price increases no longer
appear necessary.

The CBJ intends to continue to remove excess liquidity through the issuance of CDs.
This will help slow domestic credit growth, and contain consumption and imports. It will
also help strengthen further the interbank market by reducing reliance on the CBJ’s
overnight deposit window. The CBJ is also considering increasing the frequency of its
CD auctions to help better manage aggregate liquidity conditions in the market.

May-06

With the recent inflation increase reflecting mainly a one-time jump in the price
level due to supply shocks, staff and authorities do not see a need for an immediate
monetary response. The CBJ stands ready, however, to tighten monetary policy further
should inflation show signs of becoming entrenched.

Mar-06

•

Feb-06

The CBJ and staff consider the existing interest rate spread over U.S. interest rates
appropriate, with no pressures evident in the foreign exchange market. International
reserves are adequate, covering more than five months of prospective imports.

•

17.
Staff agrees with the authorities that the exchange rate peg provides a stable
nominal anchor. This requires supportive macroeconomic and structural policies, including
bringing inflation in line with that in the U.S. The value of the dinar is appropriate from
several perspectives (Box 1):

4

These could then be used in the future by the CBJ as needed to conduct open market operations.

Box 1. Jordan: External Outlook and Competitiveness
Although Jordan’s current account deficit is large, external sustainability is not a concern.
Even with high oil prices and the continued presence of Iraqi migrants (key factors behind the
import surge of recent years), import growth moderated in 2006, aided in part by adjustments in
domestic fuel prices. At the same time, one-third of the current account deterioration reflects a
jump in private investment (the counterpart to rising capital goods imports), a foundation for
future growth. The external DSA also suggests no real grounds for concern.
The outlook for the current account and external competitiveness appears positive:
•

REER and terms of trade: The REER level appreciated by 6 percent this year. However,
this follows four years of steady
Effective Exchange Rates (2000=100)
110
110
depreciation, and returns the REER to
levels prevailing in the early part of the
105

decade, a period of strong export

growth. And, as explained in the main
100
100
text, export growth, gains in market
share, productivity improvements, and
95
95
the capital inflow surge do not suggest
90
90
misalignment of the dinar.

•

Exports volumes: Annual export
85
85
Jan-02 Sep-02 May-03 Jan-04 Sep-04 May-05 Jan-06 Sep-06
volumes have grown by 14 percent on
average since 2000, aided by a free
Source: IMF Information System; and Central Bank of
trade agreement with the U.S. and
strong mineral exports to the Middle East and Asia. These developments, in addition to
recent sector-specific agreements covering agriculture and pharmaceuticals, should help to
sustain Jordan’s strong export performance in the years ahead.

REER

The outlook for the capital and financial account looks similarly positive. Despite the large
current account deficit, there are no signs of foreign exchange shortages, given record
remittances and FDI (both near 20 percent of GDP). Looking ahead, new FDI inflows, although
likely to fall following exceptional bank- and telecom-related flows in 2006, look set to remain
well above US$1 billion a year over the medium term reflecting (i) record registrations of new
investor commitments; (ii) privatization plans; (iii) inflows into special economic zones of about
US$½ billion a year; and (iv) announced real estate, retail, and tourism projects that could
collectively bring inflows of US$3–5 billion over the next five years.

16

•

The current account deficit has not been associated with weak export performance, a
typical symptom of a misaligned exchange rate—exports have been growing at doubledigit rates for five years. Market shares in the U.S. have risen substantially, despite tough
competition in the apparel industry, and productivity in the manufacturing and textile
sectors has increased sharply in recent years (Figure 1).

•

There are no signs of foreign exchange pressures, with the CBJ a net buyer of foreign
exchange in the past few years, and net foreign assets of the banking system increasing
substantially.

•

While the REER appreciated modestly in 2006, the equilibrium REER might have
appreciated with the recent surge in private capital flows.

•

Finally, the dramatic increase in FDI suggests confidence in the economy’s ability to
generate sufficiently high rates of return in the future, and indicates investors’ favorable
views on prevailing competitiveness conditions.

(AML/CFT) assessment of Jordan
revealed a need to improve the overall legislative and institutional framework. As part of the
authorities’ response to these findings, parliament is expected to pass soon the AML/CFT
legislation, prepared with World Bank advice. The Credit Bureau Law is at discussion stage.
The CBJ welcomed the prospect of an FSAP update, possibly during the second half of 2007,
once readiness for Basel II is complete and payments system reforms are fully implemented.
20.
However, rapid private sector credit expansion calls for continued vigilance and
strict bank supervision. New forms of lending, such as margin and noncollateralized loans,
as well as credit card usage, have grown rapidly over the past two years, and banks may not
have the capacity to assess associated risks. And the consequences of banks’ increased
indirect exposure to a declining stock market could become more visible in 2007. Against
this backdrop, the CBJ has improved its staffing to support on- and off-site supervision
activities, and has started to enforce a finer classification of credit facilities and associated
stricter provisioning rules since June 2006.
E. Investment Climate
21.
The authorities are determined to build on Jordan’s strong record of attracting
regional investors.
•

This will require further improvement in the business environment (the World
Bank’s latest Doing Business Survey has shown slippages in most areas except trade).
Possible reforms here include simplifying procedures for starting and closing a business,
and for registering property; improving credit information through a Credit Bureau Law;
increasing labor market flexibility by containing public sector wage increases and easing
hiring and firing legislation; and strengthening further basic infrastructure.

18

•

Continued privatization will also help. In this context, the authorities plan to sell stakes
in Royal Jordanian Airlines and three electricity generation and distribution companies,
as well as to sell in early 2007 the remaining shares in Jordan Telecom.

•

The authorities see a greater role for the use of public private partnerships (PPPs)
in attracting investment. Potential schemes include projects related to water supply,
airports, and railways, among others. They acknowledged that any plans to introduce
PPPs should be accompanied by an appropriate legal and institutional framework, and
proper accounting and transparent disclosure of fiscal risks.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

22.
Jordan’s economic performance in recent years has been stronger than expected
by staff. Despite negative external shocks, growth has increased sharply and inflation has
remained low, anchored by the exchange rate peg. Public debt has continued to fall, foreign
reserves are at an all-time high, and banks have gathered strength. Although the current
account deficit is high, it is narrowing and has been comfortably financed mainly by longterm capital inflows.
23.
This success reflects successive rounds of supportive economic policies. Over the
past decade, the Jordanian authorities have pursued sound fiscal policy, limited CBJ public
credits, maintained the exchange rate peg through prudent monetary policy, lowered trade
barriers, deregulated domestic prices, implemented a successful privatization program, and
improved the business environment.
24.
Sustaining this good economic performance is now the key challenge Jordan
faces. Despite its major achievements, Jordan’s current account deficit and reliance on
capital inflows remain high, as does its public debt burden. And still-high unemployment and
poverty also have to be tackled. Making further progress on these issues requires both
sustained policy reforms and a supportive external and regional environment.
25.
The authorities’ policy package appropriately relies primarily on continued
fiscal adjustment. This is expected to lower the debt burden further and support the currency
peg and low inflation. It should also contribute to a sharp narrowing of external imbalances
over the medium term, with the current account deficit falling sharply, and external debt
halving, to 23 percent of GDP, by 2012. Further structural reforms are also needed to
improve the investment climate, create jobs, and support growth.
26.
Staff believes that the introduction of a new binding public debt ceiling—
60 percent of GDP by 2011—will play a critical role. The previous fiscal anchor worked
well, guiding successive governments to adopt a series of budgets that helped further ease
Jordan’s debt burden. To help ensure that the new anchor is similarly successful, the new
target should be legislated and accompanied by a medium-term path for the primary balance

19

(excluding grants, given their volatility) in line with the new target. The margin created by
the recent oil price declines should be used to adjust to negative external shocks, rather than
to make room for additional spending or tax cuts. Also, measures to further develop the
domestic debt market would be important to secure adequate financing on reasonable terms
over the medium term.
27.
Achieving the new debt goals will require spending restraint and ambitious fiscal
structural reforms. Initial steps should include the introduction of an automatic fuel price
adjustment mechanism—current international fuel prices afford the opportunity to do this
without an accompanying price increase—and specific inflation-adjusted excises on selected
petroleum product. This fuel price adjustment mechanism should play a key role in
preventing the re-emergence of fuel subsidies in case world fuel prices increase in the future.
With Jordan already well taxed, and beyond resisting pressures to cut taxes (e.g., recent
parliamentary income tax law proposals), the new debt targets will mainly require keeping
current primary expenditure constant in real terms. Given competing demands on
expenditure, eliminating fuel subsidies in early 2007, containing nonpriority current
spending, better targeting the social safety net, and improving public financial management
should be priorities. Additional capital spending should also be well prioritized with due
consideration to absorptive capacity constraints.
28.
The 2007 budget is consistent with the new medium-term fiscal targets, but more
ambitious adjustment would have been desirable. Not only would this make reaching the
debt target less susceptible to shocks in the outer years, it would likely help with the current
account deficit and inflation. It would also set the stage for lower domestic financing needs in
the medium term, thereby limiting any potential crowding out of private sector activity.
Further adjustment might have been achieved through containing nonpriority current and
capital spending growth.
29.
The dinar is fairly valued and the exchange rate peg should continue to serve
Jordan well as a nominal anchor. The interest rate spread of CBJ CDs (1½–2 percentage
point range) relative to the U.S. 3-month T-bill has contributed to maintaining confidence in
the peg . But the CBJ needs also to remove remaining excess liquidity through the issuance
of additional CDs. This should help slow domestic credit growth over time and further
strengthen the interbank market. Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to keep credit and
inflation developments under close review—and to react as needed should developments
diverge from expectations. Staff also welcomes the joint plan of the CBJ and the MOF to
strengthen CBJ’s balance sheet.
30.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to a strict financial sector
supervision. A sound banking system will provide a base for sustainable growth in Jordan.
Banks are now well capitalized, nonperforming loans have declined and profits remain
comfortable. The implementation of FSAP recommendations, including introducing a prompt
corrective framework and improved off-site surveillance, is welcome. Staff looks forward to

20

the early passage by parliament of AML/CFT legislation and to an FSAP follow up later this
year.
31.
The authorities’ commitment to continue with PPM is welcome. This reflects the
continued close and fruitful cooperation between the authorities and staff.
32.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
cycle.

APPENDIX I: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Jordan’s external debt is expected to be halved in five years under the staff’s baseline
scenario (Tables 9 and A.1). Besides favorable macroeconomic policies, this assumes a
continuation of the cautious external borrowing policies adopted by the government in recent
years, which has reduced annual external borrowing to an average of 1.8 percent of GDP in
2005–06, half the borrowing rate in the early part of the decade. The projections also reflect
expectations that Jordan will rely predominantly on concessional sources of external
financing over the next five years (mainly the World Bank).
The debt reduction path is robust to the usual bound tests, but shows more sensitivity to
an assumed sharp decline in non-debt creating capital inflows:
•

Standard bound tests (Figure A.1) reveal that external debt sustainability is most
vulnerable to developments in the current account position. If the actual current
account were one-half standard deviation worse than currently assumed, there would
be only a marginal decline in the debt ratio by 2012. At the same time, bound tests
show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is robust to shocks in the external interest rate or
GDP growth. A sharp depreciation would lead to an immediate deterioration in the
debt ratio, but would not have an adverse impact over time, provided other
assumptions remain achievable.

•

A potentially important source of risk in Jordan’s case is a shock involving a largerthan-expected decline in (non-debt creating) capital inflows. To assess the impact
of such a decline, a shock scenario is considered in which capital inflows remain the
same as in the baseline scenario for 2007, but fall to the historical average for the
remainder of the projection period. This scenario shows that the debt ratio would no
longer decline (it remains broadly unchanged from its current level by 2012), leaving
the economy more exposed to other shocks.

•

If key assumptions are held at their historical averages, Jordan’s debt would fall
even faster than expected, due to the high current account surpluses that have
characterized most of the period prior to 2004.

Overall, the debt sustainability analysis shows that policies that help reduce the current
account deficit and maintain the recent growth and FDI momentum would provide the
strongest assurances of a sustainable debt position.

APPENDIX II: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Public and publicly guaranteed debt is expected to decline steadily to just above
50 percent of GDP by end-2011 under the baseline scenario (Tables 10 and A.2). Fiscal
adjustment is expected to proceed as discussed in the main text, anchored by the new
medium-term debt goal. Also, the government is assumed to continue to abstain from shortterm and commercial borrowing, and external borrowing is expected to decline as the
domestic financial market continues to strengthen. The following discusses briefly the impact
of most relevant external shocks to both public and external debt sustainability.
Although baseline projections show a large decline in the debt burden, this outcome is
vulnerable to large shocks. Standard bound tests (Figure A.2) reveal that:
•

Under a 30 percent real effective depreciation—as defined in the Fund-standard template,
equivalent to a much larger depreciation in local currency terms—the public debt ratio
would first jump sharply before returning to current levels by end-2011.

•

If real GDP growth during 2007–12 were to be a half standard deviation below the
baseline, the public debt burden would still decline sharply, but would be 6 percentage
points of GDP higher than under the baseline by end-2011. Half standard deviation
permanent shocks to real interest rates or to the primary balance has a somewhat smaller
medium-term impact. By contrast, the impact of a contingent liabilities shock—which is
assumed to increase the debt ratio by 10 percent of GDP in 2007—would be a little
higher.

•

With combined, small but permanent shocks (¼ historical standard deviations) on real
interest rates, real growth and the fiscal primary balance in 2007–12, the debt-to-GDP
ratio would decline sharply but exceed the baseline by about 5 percentage points by
end-2011.

Jordan’s debt profile is heavily dependent on adjustment policies. Under a no-policychange scenario (keeping the primary deficit of 2006 constant during 2007–12), the public
debt ratio would increase to 84 percent of GDP by end-2011, instead of declining to
52 percent of GDP, as in the baseline.

APPENDIX I: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The quality and timeliness of Jordan’s data are adequate to conduct Article IV and
post-program monitoring discussions.
2.
A mission from the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) visited Amman during
December 17–21, 2003 to update the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) prepared by the February 2002 mission. The main objectives
of this mission were to (i) review and document the actions undertaken by the authorities to
address the issues raised by the 2002 data ROSC mission for national accounts, price,
government finance, monetary, and balance of payments (BOP) statistics; and (ii) discuss the
authorities’ plans for further improving the quality of the statistics. A Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) mission visited Amman during October 29–
November 8, 2006 to assess current data dissemination practices against the requirements of
the SDDS and assist preparations for subscription to the SDDS. Jordan is a participant in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its metadata were initially posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in September 2000. Financial sector
metadata (except for the stock market category) were last updated in December 2003.
3.
Real sector. During the past two years, progress has been made toward enhancing the
quality of national accounts statistics. However, the implementation of the authorities’ plans
for improvement will require a strong commitment and the allocation of some additional
resources. The main actions taken by the department of statistics (DOS) in the area of
national accounts statistics, since the 2002 ROSC mission, include:
(a)

compilation of price indices for imports and exports for the calculation of GDP at
constant prices;

(b)

estimation of household final consumption expenditure based on the 2002 Household
Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS);

(c)

updating of supply and use of tables for the assessment and valuation of the statistical
output;

(d)

preparation of a study on the revision to the GDP series for 1976–2002;

(e)

workshops conducted to enhance quality awareness of data providers and users and to
monitor user needs;

(f)

adoption of a comprehensive training program for national accounts statistics
compilers; and

3

(g)

dissemination of national accounts data at the two-digit level of the international
standard industrial classification of economic activities.

4.
With respect to price statistics, even though the CPI and PPI were already considered
of good quality by the 2002 data ROSC mission, the DOS has short-term plans for
improvements leading to full observance of international best practices. These plans include:
(a)

incorporation of owner-occupied dwelling services in the CPI;

(b)

updating of CPI weights based on the 2002 HEIS; and

(c)

dissemination of regional CPIs.

5.
With respect to the serviceability and accessibility of national accounts and price
statistics, the DOS has short-term plans to:
(a)

inform the public about the planning minister’s access to data prior to public release
(the ministry of planning has oversight responsibilities over the DOS);

(b)

continue the program to increase quality awareness and monitor user needs;

(c)

disseminate a statement on revision policy and practices in the DOS publications and
website;

(d)

disseminate an advance calendar for the release of national accounts and price
statistics; and

(e)

update the GDDS metadata on a more timely basis.

6.
Government finance. An STA technical assistance mission visited Amman in
April 2004 and found significant improvements in government finance statistics since the
2002 data ROSC mission. These improvements have been facilitated by the establishment of
a statistical division in the ministry of finance (MOF) and the adoption of the Financial
Management Reform Project (FMRP). The FMRP is guided by an interministerial committee
headed by the secretary general of the MOF. Important actions that have already been taken
include:
(a)

the regular publication of data on the operations of the consolidated general
government; and

(b)

initiation of migration to the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)—the authorities provide data in GFSM 2001 format for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The scope of these data

4

is, however, limited to the operations of the central government budget and should be
expanded.
7.
Some of the actions contemplated in the comprehensive plan to improve the
quality of government finance statistics include:
(a)

dissemination of data on central and general government operations based on the
classification and sectorization systems recommended by the GFSM 2001;

(b)

seeking feedback from users of government finance statistics to monitor their needs;

(c)

establishment of regular procedures for the verification of internal and intersectoral
consistency of government finance statistics;

(d)

dissemination of a statement on the revision policy, an advance release calendar, and
more detailed metadata in the MOF publications and website; and

(e)

updating of GDDS metadata on a more timely basis.

8.
Monetary statistics. Monetary data for the Central Band of Jordan (CBJ) and the
commercial banks are reported and published on a monthly basis. At present, consistency
checks between government finance statistics and monetary statistics are not conducted.
However, the CBJ authorities informed the 2003 ROSC update mission that the CBJ
Research Department, which is responsible for the collection and compilation of the
monetary statistics, proposed to the CBJ management the establishment of an interagency
group to monitor the intersectoral consistency of macroeconomic statistics. Further, actions
are being taken to improve the quality of the source data and the methodological soundness
of the statistical output. In particular, the CBJ is:
(a)

reviewing a new set of report forms for banking institutions, which the Banking
Supervision Department prepared to facilitate better classification and sectorization of
the analytical accounts; and

(b)

promoting the adoption of international accounting standards (IAS) by the
commercial banks. Also, the Administrative and Financial Department and the
Banking Supervision Department of the CBJ are in the process of adopting the IAS,
in particular with respect to valuation procedures and the recording of financial
derivatives within the balance sheet.

Nevertheless, the reporting of monetary data for publication in International Financial
Statistics remains irregular and no tangible progress has been achieved so far by the CBJ in
implementing the Standardized Report Forms for reporting monetary data to the Fund.

5

(c)

Balance of payments (BOP) statistics. The establishment of a BOP division within
the Research Department of the CBJ and the allocation of additional resources have
facilitated the development of a comprehensive program for the improvement of BOP
statistics, including a detailed action plan to address weaknesses in all data quality
dimensions. These efforts were supported by long-term STA technical assistance
involving two peripatetic missions. The CBJ has adopted the methodology of the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) for the compilation of the BOP
statistics and the IIP, and has disseminated data in the BPM5 format. Further, the CBJ
started compiling and disseminating the reserves template on the CBJ’s website.
However, the breakdown of some components of the reserves template is not
consistent with the Fund’s guidelines on the data template on international reserves
and foreign currency liquidity. The implementation of surveys in the area of services
is important for the further improvement of the quality of the BOP statistics. Middle
East Technical Assistance Center (METAC) provided technical assistance to the DOS
in March 2005 on the construction of a foreign direct investment (FDI) survey. In
October 2006 METAC also conducted an SDDS assessment mission. Preliminary
results of the FDI survey are targeted for early 2007. Efforts are continuing to
complete the coverage of the international investment position , including portfolio
investment liabilities and private external debt.

VII. Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBJ
was subject to a full assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which was
approved on July 3, 2002 and expired on July 2, 2004. The assessment was completed on
June 27, 2003; and concluded that the CBJ has made progress in strengthening its safeguards,
as recommended in the previous assessment of May 2001. The assessment proposed a set of
measures, the majority of which have been implemented. Implementation of the remaining
recommendations is being monitored by staff.

8

VIII. Exchange System: The Jordanian dinar is fully convertible and is officially pegged to
the SDR. In practice, the authorities have tightly linked its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar
since October 1995, at JD1 = $1.41044.
IX. Article IV Consultation: The 2005 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on November 21, 2005. Two Financial Sector Assessment Program
missions visited Jordan in August and September 2003, and the Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) was published in January 2004. The Ex Post Assessment (EPA) of
Jordan’s of Longer-Term Program Engagement was published in November 2005.

APPENDIX III: WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
9.
As of November 30, 2006, Jordan had received 66 World Bank (Bank) loans,
1 guarantee, and 15 IDA credits totaling $2,225 million net of cancellations and terminations.
Of the $2,225 million, $2,110 million have been disbursed todate. All the credits and 60 of
the loans have been fully disbursed. There are six active projects in the Bank’s portfolio for a
total of $268 million. Overall performance of the portfolio is good, both from the perspective
of implementation and development impact. This reflects the generally good project
implementation capacity of Jordanian institutions, Jordan’s strong ownership of the program,
and the quality of the dialogue between the Bank and the government of Jordan. The
International Finance Corporation (IFC) has made cumulative loan and equity investment
approvals of $302 million and about $78 million in syndications.
10.
The existing International Bank for Reconstruction and Development portfolio
includes six projects, three of which were approved over the last Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) period (2003–05). Education accounts for the biggest share of the portfolio
(57 percent) and aims to build a qualified human resources base for Jordan. The Pubic Sector
Capacity loan provides critical resource to the Jordanian government to improve its
effectiveness. The Amman Water and Sanitation, Amman Development Corridor, and the
Horticultural projects will contribute to improve the physical and institutional basis for
development and private sector investment.
11.
The new Joint World Bank-IFC CAS for 2006–10, endorsed by the Bank Executive
Board in May 2006, is aligned with the government priorities, as expressed in particular in
the 10-year National Agenda, of poverty alleviation and the creation of higher productivity
jobs, while assisting the country in its transition through the medium-term economic
shocks. This CAS sets out a four year program organized in four cross-sectoral clusters:
•
•
•
•

strengthening the investment environment and building human resources for
value-added, skill-intensive and knowledge-based economy;
supporting local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities;
reforming social assistance and expanding inclusion; and
restructuring public expenditures and supporting public sector reform.

12.
The first two clusters tackle issues related to private investment and job creation,
respectively at the macro level and at the local level. The third cluster deals with programs to
support those who cannot by themselves achieve sufficient welfare. The last cluster is
focused, on strengthening the public administration’s ability to design and implement
development polices, including improvements in the government budget, as the main tools of
public policy. Important cross-cutting issues, such as gender and the environment, will be
mainstreamed into the clusters. Various sectoral concerns, such as water and energy, will be

11

integrated in these programmatic clusters through thematic approach. The CAS mix among
possible policy lending, investment lending, and analytical services reflects the emerging
needs with respect to short-term financial challenges and longer-term institutional
developments, with a lending ceiling of up to US$540 million over four years.
13.
World Bank Group support to private sector development will continue to focus on
improving the investment environment, privatization, partial risk guarantees for major
projects (envisaged to attract private sector participation and to provide a better financial
package for critical projects in water and energy), and, in the case of IFC, direct investment.
The IFC has been active in Jordan for many years and has a current portfolio of $39 million
in nine companies as of August 31, 2006. The IFC will place a high priority on business
development to seek investment opportunities in the following areas: (i) infrastructure
development to encourage foreign private investment; (ii) financial sector development
(e.g., housing finance, securitization, microfinance and trade finance); (iii) health and
education; and (iv) export-oriented and foreign exchange generating investments. The IFC’s
technical assistance activities in Jordan are being strategically positioned to fill gaps and
address areas where the client wants urgent help.

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation and Fourth Post-Program
Monitoring Discussions with Jordan

On March 5, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2006 Article IV consultation and fourth Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) discussions with
Jordan.1
Background
Jordan graduated from a series of Fund-supported programs in 2004 and has since been
engaged in PPM, which expires at end-2007. The Jordanian economy has performed
remarkably well in recent years, due mainly to far-reaching macroeconomic and structural
reforms. Despite negative shocks (including high oil prices and regional uncertainties),
growth has been robust, inflation has remained low, public debt has continued to fall, and
reserves have reached an all-time high.
Economic performance remained strong in 2006. Growth is estimated at 6 percent for the
year, reflecting buoyant domestic demand (private consumption and investment), in part
financed by large private capital inflows. Average inflation was 6.3 percent, stemming mainly
from fuel and imported food price increases, with core inflation (excluding food and energy)
well contained. Unemployment declined to 14 percent, from 15 percent a year earlier.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the March 5, 2007 Executive Board discussion based on the staff
report.

2

The current account deficit narrowed in 2006—albeit to a still-high 16 percent of GDP—as a
result of a broad-based slowdown in import growth and continued strong performance of
exports and remittances. This deficit was financed by record levels of long-term private
capital inflows reflecting foreign investments in banking, mining, telecommunications, and
real estate. As a result, gross reserves reached US$6.1 billion at end-2006—more than
US$1¼ billion higher than at end-2005—equivalent to about five and a half months of
prospective imports.
The fiscal situation also improved in 2006. Stronger revenue performance (income tax and
general sales tax receipts), larger-than-expected grants (especially from Saudi Arabia), and
the authorities’ decision to raise domestic fuel prices (lowering substantially oil subsidies)
more than offset higher primary spending on transfers, security outlays, and wage bonuses.
Preliminary estimates suggest that the fiscal deficit in 2006 was about 4¼ percent of GDP
including grants, and 7½ percent excluding grants, both lower than in 2005. The deficit was
financed comfortably without adding to macroeconomic pressures. The narrowing of the
fiscal deficit, together with partial privatization of Jordan Telecom and strong growth, reduced
the public debt-to-GDP ratio further, to 73 percent by end-2006, from 83 percent in 2005.
Meanwhile, monetary policy supported well the peg of the Jordanian dinar (JD) to the
U.S. dollar. The spread on 3-month JD-denominated CDs issued by the Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ) over the U.S. dollar 3-month Treasury bill rate has been kept to a 1½–
2 percentage point range during the past year. The dollarization ratio has been stable, at
about 27 percent of deposits, reflecting continued confidence in the dinar. Broad money
increased in line with nominal economic activity, with strong private sector credit growth
(24 percent year-on-year) broadly offset by reductions in credit to government (privatization
receipts) and a large increase in banks’ capital.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Jordan’s strong economic performance, noting the critical
role played by supportive macroeconomic and structural policies over the past decade.
Looking ahead, Directors stressed that staying on course with the economic reform agenda
will help sustain good economic performance, and address the large current account deficit
and the still-high public debt. To this end, they supported the authorities’ policy package, with
continued fiscal adjustment at its core.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to introduce a new public debt ceiling—60 percent of
GDP by 2011—and underscored the successful role that the previous debt target played in
helping to ease Jordan’s debt burden. To ensure a similar success, the new target should be
legislated and accompanied by a medium-term path for the primary fiscal balance. They also
supported the authorities’ plans to deepen the domestic debt market and tap regional liquidity
by issuing dinar-denominated bonds.
Directors observed that, with Jordan already well taxed, achieving the new debt targets will
depend mainly on containing nonpriority current primary expenditure over the medium term.

3

Eliminating fuel subsidies in 2007, adopting an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism,
better targeting the social safety net, and improving public financial management should be
priorities. On the revenue side, measures should include specific inflation-adjusted excises
on selected petroleum products and further improvements in revenue administration.
Directors considered the 2007 budget to be consistent with the new medium-term fiscal
targets. They recommended that the authorities consider more ambitious targets, which
would limit the susceptibility of the debt target to shocks, while helping to moderate inflation
and the current account imbalance.
Directors agreed that the dinar is fairly valued and most observed that the exchange rate peg
continues to serve Jordan well as a nominal anchor, supported by solid macroeconomic
policies and a more resilient economy. They noted that the interest rate spread relative to
U.S. rates has contributed to maintaining confidence in the peg. They also encouraged the
CBJ to remove remaining excess liquidity through the issuance of additional certificates of
deposit to help slow domestic credit growth and further strengthen the interbank market.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep credit and inflation developments under
close review. They also were encouraged by the ministry of finance plan to retire gradually its
old debt to the central bank and thus strengthen its balance sheet.
Directors noted banks’ strong performance and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
strict financial sector supervision. They commended the authorities for implementing core
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, including introducing a
prompt corrective framework and improved off-site surveillance. They looked forward to the
early passage by parliament of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism
legislation and to an FSAP follow-up later this year.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue with post-program monitoring as
a sign of continued close cooperation between the authorities and staff.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
