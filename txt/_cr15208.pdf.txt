IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Somalia

On July 27, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Somalia. 1
Since 1991, Somalis have suffered greatly from civil war. The economy deteriorated as the
physical infrastructure was destroyed. In addition to the loss of lives, the war worsened the
population’s living conditions, now among the lowest in the world. Even though the political
and security situations remain challenging, Somalia has made tremendous progress since
resuming relations with the IMF on April 12, 2013. The IMF has been actively involved in
providing technical assistance and policy advice in its key areas of expertise, which laid the
groundwork for this Consultation. While Somalia has been welcomed back as an active
member of the Fund, it remains ineligible for financial assistance pending the clearance of its
longstanding arrears. Arrears clearance will be an important part of normalizing relations
with the international community and establishing a roadmap to debt sustainability.
As a result of the civil war, all Somali state institutions are severely impaired. Improving
governance in key state institutions is critical for progress on economic reconstruction and
development. The federal government, working with the international community, has taken
steps to improve governance based on the rule of law and the application of international
good practices for fiscal and financial operations. IMF technical assistance is largely devoted
to enhancing governance in the ministry of finance and the central bank. Rebuilding critical
infrastructure and delivering basic social and economic services will be crucial for the new

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

government to gain the trust of the Somali people, advance the process of national
reconciliation, and to extend federal government authority over all parts of the country.
Economic activity is estimated to have expanded by 3.7 percent in 2014, driven by growth in
agriculture, construction, and telecommunications. Consumer price inflation was 1.3 percent.
For 2015, real growth is projected at 2.7 and inflation should remain subdued at about 4
percent. With modest progress on the security front and an absence of drought, medium-term
annual growth should be about 5 percent. Nevertheless, growth will remain inadequate to
redress poverty and gender disparities.
Budget preparation and implementation is fraught with difficulty due to deficiencies in
revenue mobilization and expenditure pressures that exceed available resources. The budget
consists largely of salary and security expenditures contained by strict cash rationing.
Deficits have been financed mostly through arrears accumulation. Similarly, the 2015 budget
was prepared on a zero cash balance basis with optimistic revenue forecasts and weak
commitment control, leading the federal government to ration cash and incur arrears to the
defense forces, civil servants, and suppliers. On July 19, an extraordinary session of the
Cabinet, chaired by the President, approved and sent to Parliament a revised budget for 2015.
The formal financial sector consists of the central bank, six banks with provisional licenses,
and nine licensed money transfer firms. The sector is small and nascent while there is
reportedly a large informal sector. The central bank of Somalia (CBS) faces challenges in
building financial sector supervision due to technical and human resource constraints. The
economy is predominantly dollarized and cash is scarce, particularly in lower denominations.
Somali banknotes are not readily available, creating problems for the poorest.
The 2014 current account deficit is estimated at US$644 million (11.3 percent of GDP).
Trade consists mostly of exports of livestock to Gulf Cooperation Council countries and
imports of foodstuffs from neighboring countries and the Indian subcontinent. The trade and
income deficits were US$2,663 million and US$450 million, respectively, partially covered
by remittances of US$1,333 million and other transfers of US$1,137 million. The deficit was
financed by foreign direct investment of US$434 million, especially in telecommunications,
electricity, and hotels, and donor capital transfers of US$150 million.
External debt was estimated at US$5.3 billion (93 percent of GDP) at end-2014,
preponderantly arrears. Debt data covers most creditors, excludes commercial debt, and
shows obligations to: (i) multilaterals (US$1.5 billion); (ii) Paris Club creditors
(US$2.3 billion); and, (iii) Non-Paris Club creditors (US$1.5 billion). Based on a preliminary
assessment, Somalia lacks the ability to service its debt in the medium term.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Somalia’s reengagement with the Fund, setting the stage for
its first Article IV consultation since 1989. Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff
appraisal. They noted that, following the protracted civil war, the country is facing daunting
challenges. The first priority is to continue building institutions and administrative capacity,
while undertaking key structural reforms to spur inclusive growth and reduce poverty.
Directors underscored the importance of continued assistance from the international
community to support the authorities’ efforts. They welcomed the launch of the Trust Fund
for Capacity Development, and highlighted the important role of Fund policy advice and
technical assistance.
Directors stressed the need for decisive steps to build fiscal discipline, underpinned by
realistic budgeting and effective implementation systems. They welcomed cabinet approval
of a revised budget for 2015 that will avoid new arrears by raising revenues and rationalizing
wages and services and other recurrent spending. Going forward, Directors stressed the
importance of budgeting within a medium-term fiscal framework, based on sound fiscal
principles and transparent reporting, and a public expenditure review to promote the
allocation of resources towards investment in human capital and infrastructure.
Directors encouraged the adoption of sound mechanisms to ensure effective and transparent
management of prospective natural resource wealth. They recommended building institutions
consistent with international best practices to ensure that natural resource exploitation
maximizes benefits for Somalis. They also stressed the need for clarity regarding the
delineation of authority between the federal government and sub-national entities.
Directors supported ongoing efforts to strengthen the Central Bank of Somalia’s capacity and
governance structure, with support from the Fund and development partners. They cautioned
that currency reform should not be implemented until all prerequisites are in place, in order
to safeguard policy credibility.
Directors stressed that elaboration of a financial sector roadmap will be a critical first step to
build credibility in licensing and supervising money transfer firms, in order to help channel
remittances through the international banking system. They also recommended bringing the
AML/CFT framework in line with international standards. Other priorities include preparing
and approving additional prudential regulations, and strengthening compliance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors encouraged the authorities to improve statistical capacity, in order to enhance the
scope, quality and timeliness of economic data compilation, with technical assistance from
the Fund and development partners.
Directors noted Somalia’s longstanding arrears to the Fund and other creditors, and
encouraged the authorities to continue to work towards a pathway for arrears clearance and
eventual debt relief. They noted that, in due course, the establishment of a track record of
cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments in the context of a well-designed
staff-monitored program (SMP) would be a key step in the process of arrears clearance and
normalization of relations with the international community as a whole. Directors stressed
the need for sustained international support and cooperation, and welcomed the formation of
the Technical Working Group on Somalia’s Debt.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 8, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Somalia is a fragile state emerging from a protracted civil war. In 1991, the
government was toppled by armed opposition groups, leading to implosion of the
central government and devolution of power to administrative regions. The Fund
recognized the Federal Government of Somalia on April 12, 2013, paving the way for
staff to provide policy advice and technical assistance. While Somalia has been
welcomed back as an active member of the Fund, it remains ineligible for financial
assistance pending the clearance of its longstanding arrears. The political and security
situation remains challenging. Complex clan politics and high turnover in the members
of the economic team have undermined policymaking. A new government took office on
February 18, 2015, and presidential elections are planned for September 2016.
Key policy issues: The Article IV discussions focused on immediate and medium-term
actions for building institutions and policy frameworks for fiscal and financial
management. Specifically,


Capacity building and governance. Concerted action is needed to build
institutions and improve governance in order to support sustainable, inclusive
growth, and poverty reduction. In particular, urgent efforts are required to set in
place sound mechanisms and institutions to ensure that prospective natural resource
wealth, notably hydrocarbons, is well managed. Considerable donor assistance is
required for helping Somalia to meet these daunting challenges.



Fiscal. Decisive steps are necessary to build fiscal discipline, underpinned by realistic
budgeting and effective implementation systems, including commitment controls.
The 2015 budget needs to be revised in light of revenue shortfalls. An emergency
revenue mobilization plan and an expenditure review are warranted.



Financial sector. Efforts are needed to develop the currently rudimentary financial
system. Swift action is required so that remittances can be channeled through the
international banking system. Currency reform should not be implemented until
prerequisites are in place. Given the extent of dollarization and the absence of
monetary policy instruments, the central bank is unable to conduct monetary policy.

Past IMF advice: The latest Article IV consultation was on November 13, 1989, and
focused on the low priority attached by the government in place then on the need for
better controlling unproductive spending, and on the need for better economic and
social services.

CONTEXT AND RISKS
1.
Somalia is a fragile state emerging from a protracted civil war. In 1991, the government
was toppled by armed opposition groups, leading to implosion of the central government and
devolution of power to administrative regions. In the 24 years since, the situation has been very
difficult and volatile. A provisional constitution was adopted in August 2012 and a 275-member
federal parliament was elected by 135 traditional elders from across Somalia. In September 2012,
the parliament elected Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as president, leading to formation of a
government in October. Consistent with broad international support of the Federal Government of
Somalia (FGS), the IMF recognized the FGS on April 12, 2013. Institutions are very weak and lack of
capacity impedes development. 1 While work to establish a federal constitutional framework is
underway, the regions are fairly independent. Nevertheless, donor initiatives to channel earmarked
resources through FGS treasury systems are helping reduce regional autonomy. The government has
a poverty reduction strategy, but in the absence of adequate domestic resources, poverty reduction
efforts are being undertaken mainly through off-budget donor support.
2.
The Somali authorities have resumed active engagement with the Fund. Recognition of
the FGS paved the way for staff to provide technical assistance (TA) and policy advice in key areas,
including: (i) financial governance and accounting; (ii) currency reform; (iii) bank licensing and
supervision; (iv) fiscal policy and budget preparation; and, (v) development of statistical systems.
Reengagement has laid the groundwork for these discussions; milestones include: (i) national
budget preparation; (ii) development of consumer price index, gross domestic product, and external
sector data; and, (iii) preparation of the central bank balance sheet. While resources are available for
TA and training, absorptive capacity and security issues are overarching constraints. Despite
shortcomings in source data and coverage, core data were available for these discussions. Data
deficiencies limited some standard elements of bilateral surveillance, such as medium-term
projections, debt sustainability analysis, and an external stability assessment (Box 1).2

1

The 2012 interim constitution underpins efforts to introduce a modernized legal system. However, implementation
of laws on a nationwide scale continues to meet formidable challenges. Staff from the African Development Bank,
IMF, and World Bank have been providing assistance.
2

A debt sustainability assessment and external stability analysis were not possible because of data weaknesses,
including the need to validate some figures on non-Paris Club debt and collect information on individual loans.

Box 1. Technical Assistance by IMF Staff
Staff TA aims to support building economic institutions and sound macroeconomic policies (see Table below and the
Informational Annex for a list of individual TA missions). Somalia would benefit from TA in various areas. On February 6, 2015, the
Fund launched the “Trust Fund for Capacity Development in Macroeconomic Policies and Statistics for Somalia,” to finance TA in:
(i) developing macroeconomic frameworks and policies; (ii) establishing a functional central bank; (iii) modernizing tax and customs
administration; (iv) strengthening public financial management; and, (v) improving statistics. The program coordinates activities with
the authorities and other TA providers. Continued donor
support will be critical for capacity building.

program covering 2014-17. Initial contributions were
received from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (US$3 million), Canada (US$2.5 million),
and the UK (US$1 million). The trust fund can be
renewed. As of end-May 2015, US$124,297 had been
disbursed.
TA has been delivered in key areas of IMF expertise,
namely: (i) fiscal issues; (ii) the monetary and banking
sector; (iii) statistical systems; and, (iv) legal issues. In
the fiscal area, TA has addressed: (i) budget accounting
and reporting; (ii) budget preparation and execution;
and, (iii) tax policy and customs administration. In the
money and banking sector, TA has focused on: (i) the
organization and governance structure of the central
bank and its accounting systems; and, (ii) and licensing
procedures and supervision of financial institutions.
Regarding statistical systems, TA has addressed
development, compilation and publication of national
accounts, external sector statistics, and prices statistics. In
the legal area, TA has focused on: (i) reviewing the

central bank law; (ii) establishing a legal department in the central bank; (iii) development of central bank by-laws and a code of
ethics and conduct for the board; and, (iv) advice on banking legislation and regulations.
In the period ahead, extensive TA is planned. In the fiscal area, TA will assist with: (i) preparation of the 2016 budget; (ii) tax
policy; and, (iii) public financial management. In the monetary and banking sector, TA will support: (i) central bank governance;
(ii) currency reform; and, (iii) bank licensing and supervision. TA for statistical systems will assist with: (i) balance of payments
compilation; (ii) the consumer price index; and, (iii) monetary aggregates. Legal assistance will help with the preparation of central
bank by-laws.
TA has been delivered through different modalities. Staff has developed capacity building plans and is providing TA through
deployment of advisors, staff-led missions, expert visits, and training.
TA has built capacity and allowed staff to begin carrying out surveillance. TA has helped build capacity in key government
institutions and allowed the authorities to provide basic data for surveillance.

3.
While Somalia has been welcomed back as an active member of the Fund, it remains
ineligible for financial assistance pending the clearance of its longstanding arrears. Arrears
clearance will be an important part of normalizing relations with the international community and
establishing a roadmap to debt sustainability. The process will involve: (i) establishing a track record
of cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments, including in the context of a Staff
Monitored Program; (ii) reconciling external debt; (iii) preparing a poverty reduction strategy; and,
(iv) mobilizing donor resources to finance debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative. As of end-May 2015, arrears to the IMF were US$328 million, while arrears to the
World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) were US$283 million and US$94 million,
respectively.
4.
The political and security situation remains very challenging. Complex clan politics and
high turnover in the members of the economic team have undermined policymaking and limited TA
and surveillance effectiveness: since September 2013, there have been three central bank governors
and three ministers of finance. A new government took office on February 18, 2015 and presidential
elections are planned for September 2016.
5.
As a result of the civil war, all Somali state institutions are severely impaired. Improving
governance in key state institutions is critical for progress on economic reconstruction and
development. The FGS, working with the international community, has taken steps to improve
governance based on the rule of law and the application of international good practices for fiscal
and financial operations. IMF TA is largely devoted to enhancing governance in the ministry of
finance and the Central Bank of Somalia (CBS). Rebuilding critical infrastructure and delivering basic
social and economic services will be crucial for the new government to gain the trust of the Somali
people, advance the process of national reconciliation, and to extend FGS authority over all parts of
the country.
6.
Global and regional risks arise from slower global growth and spillovers from Middle
East unrest. These risks could lower demand for exports, reduce donor support, decrease
remittance inflows, and prompt an influx of refugees (see RAM). The policy response should be
perseverance with the reform agenda in light of the highly constrained room for maneuver.
7.
Somalia-specific risks arise from tightening international regulatory and supervisory
frameworks, insecurity, weak institutions, and the availability of data for economic
management, as well as low revenue, lack of control over the national currency, and poorly
developed financial system supervision. The protracted civil war has left institutions in disarray
with few qualified staff. Capacity for data collection, compilation, analysis, and dissemination is
limited. Poor revenue performance—against the backdrop of large expenditure commitments—is
leading to further arrears accumulation. Credibility would be damaged if a currency reform were
launched without adequate preparation. Delays in developing supervisory capacity could exacerbate
problems linked to global de-risking, impeding remittances that support livelihoods.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Real Growth and Inflation
8.
Humanitarian and social conditions in Somali are among the most daunting in the
world. Close to 4 million people—around a third of the population—are in need of food assistance;
infant mortality is more than one in ten; and, life expectancy is about 51 years.
9.
Based on rudimentary data, the economy is growing while consumer price inflation
remains moderate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that economic conditions improved rapidly
in 2012-13, following years of disruption from war and internal strife. The recovery was led by
growth in livestock and fisheries, and a very active private sector resurgence of the services industry,
notably communications, construction, and money transfer services, mainly associated with the
return of diaspora Somalis.
10.
Economic activity is estimated to have expanded with real GDP rising by 3.7 percent
during 2014. In nominal terms, GDP increased in 2014 by 6.6 percent to US$5.7 billion with the CPI
rising by 1.3 percent (Figure 1 and Table 1). The most significant industries are: (i) agriculture,
livestock, and fisheries; (ii) information and communications; (iii) wholesale and retail trade; and,
(iv) financial services. For 2015, growth is projected at 2.7 percent with CPI inflation of 4.0 percent.

B. Fiscal and Financial Governance
11.
While governance of key state institutions has improved, considerable strengthening
is required. Inland revenue collection is stymied by insecurity and the war-induced destruction of a
compliance culture. Accounting and reporting operations will be strengthened by completing
implementation of the Somalia Financial Management Information System (SFMIS). Much of the
work aimed at strengthening the operations of the ministry of finance are fundamentally focused on
improving the governance of public financial management (PFM) operations. Progress has also been
made in establishing the offices of an accountant general and an auditor general to underpin
financial governance for Somalia.
12.
At time of restoration of contacts between Somalia and the Fund in 2013, the CBS no
longer carried out traditional central banking operations. It had few staff of which merely a
handful had a professional background in central banking. While recruitment of qualified staff from
the diaspora remains challenging, several highly competent individuals with appropriate training
have been appointed. These new staff are underpinning work on a new central bank organization.
Key new units under construction are departments for: (i) accounting and finance; (ii) economics and
statistics; (iii) internal audit; and; (iv) licensing and supervision. The near-term agenda also includes
setting up units for management of international official reserves and for handling cash currency.
13.
A Financial Governance Committee (FGC) was established on April 23, 2014 in
response to worrisome governance developments. The FGC is a committee of the FGS with the

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

objective of enhancing financial governance by monitoring, advising and assisting government in
matters related to CBS governance, public sector contracting, procurement and commercial
concessions, PFM, asset recovery, and fiscal federalism. The FGC is chaired by the minister of finance
and consists of Somali and external partner representatives. Fund staff has appointed a technical
expert in an advisory capacity.
14.
Issues related to public sector contracting have attracted particular attention. Public
procurement and the granting of commercial concessions were initially carried out in a
nontransparent manner. Through the FGC, reviews are now made of all such contract over
US$5 million. The FGC has recommended that certain contracts be renegotiated, amended, or
cancelled. Furthermore, an interim regime has been adopted that will operate until specialized
legislation, in line with international good practice, is in effect.

C. Fiscal
15.
Fiscal policy is geared toward delivery of basic services in the context of a zero cash
balance budget. Considerable expenditure pressure, deficiencies in revenue mobilization, unfulfilled
donor pledges, and nascent political processes have produced unrealistic budgets. The funding
shortfall has led the FGS to incur liabilities to local money transfer firms (MTFs), reduce assets, ration
cash, and incur arrears to the defense forces, civil servants, and suppliers.
16.
The federal budget for 2013 was the first post-conflict budget. The 2013 budget
consisted primarily of salary and security expenditures. Cash was limited due to revenue shortfalls,
leading to arrears accumulation of US$30.4 million, almost 26 percent of expenditure.
17.
The budget outcome for 2014 underscores deficiencies in revenue mobilization
(Table 2). Revenue (including grants) in 2014 of US$145.3 million underperformed the budgeted
US$188.5 million. International assistance outside the budget is significantly higher than direct
assistance (Table 3).4 Trade taxes and foreign grants remain the largest sources of revenue. Through
strict cash rationing, expenditure was limited to US$151.1 million—30 percent less than the
budgeted US$216.2 million. Financing of US$22.9 million (equivalent to 27.2 percent of domestic
revenue) was through arrears accumulation and liquidation of recovered government assets.
18.
On December 31, 2014, parliament approved a 2015 budget of US$239.9 million with a
highly optimistic revenue forecast, setting the expenditure ceiling 58.8 percent over the 2014
outcome of US$151.1 million. The expenditure envelope was not underpinned by prudent
budgeting. Infrastructure investment and social spending are crowded out by wages (Box 2).
Analysis of five months of budget data points to a revenue shortfall of US$56.3 million for the year,
underscoring the need to adjust expenditure in a revised budget.

Donor support was provided predominantly off budget, directly financing large infrastructure and capital projects,
humanitarian assistance, and the wages of some military and security personnel.

Box 2. Public Expenditure
Expenditure is concentrated on wages and goods and services. The share of wage compensation is about half
of expenditure while goods and services are a third. This concentration crowds out resources for interest
payments, subsidies, social benefits and

Box 2. Table 1. Composition of Public Expenditure

capital.
Infrastructure investment is crowded
out by spending on wages. Investment
in schools, hospitals, and clinics is vital
for the government to meet its
obligation to provide essential goods
and services, while investment in roads,
bridges, ports, and airports supports
economic growth.
The share of wages—about
45 percent—is higher than in
comparable countries. Wages as a share
of expenditure are about 30 percent in
Africa and in low income countries.
Accordingly, the FGS should focus on
containing the wage bill.

D. Financial Sector
Structure and development of the financial sector
19.
At end-June 2015, the formal financial sector consisted of the central bank, six banks
with provisional licenses, and nine licensed money transfer firms (MTFs). The formal financial
sector (outside that under the control of the Bank of Somaliland) is small and nascent while there is
reportedly a large informal sector.5 Each bank maintains one office, four of which are in Mogadishu,
and one each in Somaliland and Puntland. As of end-June 2015, thirteen MTFs had pending
applications for banking licenses. The MTFs provide fund transfer services throughout the country
and internationally via Dubai. Balance sheets and financial statements for banks and MTFs are not
available.
5

With one exception, financial institutions operating in Somaliland are licensed and supervised by the Bank of
Somaliland, none of which are recognized by the CBS.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

20.
The CBS is responsible for: (i) the national currency; (ii) the payments system, including as
the fiscal agent of government; (iii) management of official international reserves; and, (iv) licensing
and supervision of banks.
21.
The Central Bank of Somalia (CBS) faces challenges in building financial sector
supervision due to technical and human resource constraints. In addition, oversight of antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism is not in line with international
standards. Recently, a number of international banks have closed their correspondent accounts with
Somali MTFs, threatening the inflow of remittances.

Monetary policy and national currency
22.
Monetary policy instruments do not exist, the exchange rate of the Somali shilling is
freely floating, and the de facto exchange regime is free of restrictions or multiple currency
practices. The status of the national currency is complex (Box 3). The economy is predominantly
dollarized in an unregulated environment. Cash currency is scarce, particularly in lower
denominations, and Somali banknotes issued by the CBS are not readily available, creating problems
for the poorest. With a general lack of technical, human, and financial resources, the CBS needs
considerable assistance to change the status quo. Political pressure is mounting for an early currency
reform.
Box 3. National Currency
The de jure currency for all of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). According to Somali law, the CBS is in
charge, and the sole supplier, of the national currency. However, since 1991, no banknotes have been issued by
the CBS. Instead, a single denomination—the SOS 1,000 (value about US$0.05)—has been widely distributed in
different forms of counterfeit notes estimated to account for about 95 percent of SOS notes in circulation. Some
versions were printed abroad, others in Somalia, typically funded by local businesses. Virtually all SOS notes in
circulation are de facto accepted as a means of payment although counterfeits are readily identifiable.
The de facto currency in Somalia (excluding Somaliland) is the U.S. dollar estimated to account for about
95 percent of currency in circulation. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency and neighboring country
currencies are used in border areas. Mobile phone payments, with air time transactions denominated in
U.S. dollars, are also widely used. Air time also serves as a transactional sub-denomination of the U.S. dollar, as do
SOS notes, but to a more limited extent. In Somaliland, the de facto monetary authority—the Bank of Somaliland,
an institution not recognized in the rest of Somalia—has issued its own currency, the Somaliland shilling,
since 1994. That currency is neither recognized nor co-circulating in the rest of Somalia.

Central bank modernization
23.
Against the backdrop of many years of challenging conditions, the CBS is not yet in a
position to operate as a modern central bank. The CBS board of directors was established, and
started operations, only in April 2014. As of end-June 2015, the board had had five meetings and
had approved and implemented a first set of by-laws for the CBS. Work on a new organizational
structure and human resource practices are underway at the CBS and the ministry of finance. The
CBS has also started to implement a memorandum of understanding that clarifies the roles and
obligations of the CBS as the fiscal and financial agent of the state.
24.
The CBS has prepared financial statements for 2014 (Table 4). The preliminary balance
sheet shows assets of US$57.3 million, primarily gold, foreign exchange assets, and property and
equipment. The nominal exchange rate of the SOS has remained broadly stable in recent years.6
Since the value of SOS in circulation is unknown, this liability was not included. The residual CBS
equity and reserves was US$49.7 million.

E. External
25.
The 2014 current account deficit is estimated at US$644 million (11.3 percent of GDP)
(Table 5). Trade consists mostly of exports of livestock to GCC countries and imports of foodstuffs
from neighboring countries and the Indian subcontinent. The trade and income deficits were
US$2,663 million and US$450 million, respectively, partially covered by remittances of
US$1,333 million and other transfers of US$1,137 million. The deficit was financed by foreign direct
investment of US$434 million, especially in telecommunications, electricity, and hotels, and donor
capital transfers of US$150 million.
26.
External debt was estimated at US$5.3 billion (93 percent of GDP) at end-2014,
preponderantly arrears (Table 6). Debt data cover most creditors, exclude commercial debt, and
show obligations to: (i) multilaterals (US$1.5 billion); (ii) Paris Club creditors (US$2.3 billion); and,
(iii) Non-Paris Club creditors (US$1.5 billion). Data are compiled and validated by a dedicated
finance ministry unit, with TA from multilaterals, which maintains a dialog with creditors and is
redressing data gaps including loan size validation and bilateral loan terms.7 Based on a preliminary
assessment, Somalia lacks the ability to service its debt in the medium term.

6

The SOS exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years at US$1 equaling SOS 20,000. During May 2015,
the rate depreciated briefly to SOS 23,500 in response to a sudden influx of new, counterfeit notes.
7

In the dialogue with creditors, a second meeting of the technical working group took place on the sidelines of the
2015 IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings.

OUTLOOK
27.
Despite daunting challenges and risks, the outlook remains broadly favorable. Diaspora
Somalis are driving growth, largely in communications, construction, and money transfers. With
progress on the security front, and in the absence of drought, modest growth is expected.
Nevertheless, growth will remain inadequate to redress poverty and gender disparities.8 Should
security worsen or drought return, growth will be at risk. The 2016 presidential elections could set
the stage for normalization of the political process, or they could disrupt reform efforts.

POLICY DICUSSIONS
Discussions focused on immediate and medium-term issues, including possible quick wins. In the
short run, improving fiscal management will be critical, including raising revenue and grants and
prioritizing expenditures, as well as technical issues of budget control. Looking forward, the
discussions explored the key building blocks for stability and growth, mostly related to setting in
place institutions, managing public resources, and facilitating financial sector development.

A. Strengthening Governance and Institutions
Institutions
Background
28.
Continued progress in building sound and accountable institutions is critical for the
restoration of public confidence in government and the CBS, and for poverty reduction,
inclusive growth and addressing gender disparities. Institutions need strengthening through
phased adoption of international standards and codes, and improved systems for transparency and
accountability. Staff will continue to provide TA in key areas of IMF expertise (see Box 1). Discussions
focused on key institutions in economic, financial, and monetary areas, to: (i) improve legal and
regulatory frameworks; (ii) strengthen procurement systems; (iii) bolster expenditure control; and,
(iv) enhance revenue administration.
29.
Statistical system development is a priority. The statistics law enacted in 1970 provides
for establishment of a statistical office and protects data confidentiality. Nevertheless, the lack of
statistical capacity, combined with fragmented administration, impedes development of basic
economic statistics. The statistics law is being updated, and priorities are being set for development
of the statistical system and dissemination of statistics.

Preliminary data indicate significant income inequality. Consumption in nomadic households is 28 percent of that in
urban households.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SOMALIA

30.
Data provision has significant shortcomings that hamper surveillance. Source data are
limited for national accounts, the fiscal and external sectors, and the banking system. TA to redress
these deficiencies is supported by the recently launched trust fund. Identified measures include
updating the statistics law and strengthening institutions and staff.
Staff’s views
31.
Staff emphasized the need for improved accounting systems and better regulatory
practices. The ministry of finance should enhance its capacity to prepare and manage the annual
budget, and improve communication with ministries, departments, agencies, parliament, and
citizens.
32.
Staff recommended that responsibility for statistical activity be clearly defined among
stakeholders in the national statistical system. Responsibility for preparing national accounts,
price indexes, and balance of payments must be allocated across institutions. The role of state and
regional governments in the statistical system should be specified. Procedures must be established
to collect source data for compilation of economic statistics.
Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities supported of these recommendations, indicating a desire for demanddriven TA from the international community. Areas of future demand would be identified as
strategic priorities. They welcomed the continued role of TA from the staff.

Natural resource management
Background
34.
Somalia has large potential for revenue from natural resources, particularly
hydrocarbons, so effective concession management and a suitable fiscal regime are critical.
Preliminary seismic survey results are promising. The FGS has signed several concession contracts to
initiate resource exploitation and raise revenue despite the absence of a clear legal and regulatory
framework. While transparency is paramount, sound institutions are required to manage natural
resources and specialized expertise is needed to negotiate contracts effectively. A draft Public
Procurement, Disposal, and Concessions Act has been before parliament since April 2014.
35.
Resource sharing between the center and the regions, as well as the authority of the
regions to make concession agreements, need to be clarified. Work is underway on agreement
between the FGS and sub-national entities on resource sharing.
Staff’s views
36.
Staff stressed the importance of having institutions, policies and legislation for
effective and transparent management of natural resources. Staff urged the authorities to
develop capabilities in negotiating resource management contracts and to establish an appropriate

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

fiscal regime. Staff discussed the steps necessary to build institutions for managing natural resources
and making contracts for their exploitation in a manner consistent with welfare maximization. Staff
encouraged the authorities to incorporate best practices in their resource management strategy,
which should facilitate private sector participation and ensure transparency.
37.
The mission urged the authorities to seek consensus regarding fiscal federalism,
including responsibilities for service delivery, and revenue collection and sharing. Planning
frameworks for federal and sub-national entities are required. Plans need to be linked to the budget
and a harmonized revenue strategy, and reflect realistic forecasts.
Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities agreed that their natural resource management framework needs
improvement and recognized the importance of delineating responsibilities between the FGS
and sub-national entities. The authorities confirmed that agreement on fiscal federalism is
essential. Delineation of responsibilities within the FGS will also be important. Policies and
procedures are being established for the department of national assets within the ministry of
finance.
39.
The authorities informed staff of plans to strengthen the concession management
framework. Under the donor-supported financial governance program, a strategy for capacity
building in concession management is being developed, including the legal and regulatory
framework. Work on this agenda is supported by the FGC and the World Bank.
40.
The authorities welcomed the review of concession contracts by the FGC, which
resulted in the termination and renegotiation of some contracts. Legal support for contract
review has been financed by the AfDB.

B. Fiscal
Background
41.
Staff and donors have been providing technical assistance in fiscal areas ranging from
budget preparation to tax policy. Urgent efforts are needed to strengthen budget credibility by
limiting expenditure commitments to available resources. While staff has initiated discussion of the
fiscal regime, policy advice requires clarity regarding the nature of the federation, particularly fiscal
relations between the center and the regions. Staff will continue to provide TA in key areas of IMF
expertise (see Box 1).
42.
The budget outcome for 2014 and indications to May 2015 point toward significant
underperformance in domestic revenue and grants. Tax collection was below target due to
delays in implementation of measures to raise revenue. Dependence on grants is large, exposing the
budget to uncertainties in donor disbursements. All capital spending is donor funded.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SOMALIA

43.
Despite the implementation of stricter expenditure rules (including sequestration
rules), arrears will rise if the revenue target is not achieved. The expansion in the number of
ministries and government entities has left Somalia with a payroll-centric budget. Investment and
social spending are crowded out by spending on wages, which are about 45 percent of expenditure
in 2015. Revenue has been revised downward substantially. As of mid-June, the government was
preparing a revision of the 2015 budget in response to revenue shortfalls.
Staff’s views
44.
Staff stressed the importance of revising the 2015 budget, adopting a strategy to
avoid arrears, and eliminating existing arrears. Staff underscored the need to provide for arrears
repayment in future budgets and strengthen controls to prevent arrears accumulation. Staff
welcomed the arrears management plan, while noting that implementation will be challenging.
45.
Staff recommended that the authorities develop and implement an emergency
revenue mobilization plan and conduct an expenditure review. Revenue options include taxing
hotels, telecommunications companies, and large employer payrolls. Staff urged: (i) designing laws
and regulations to support revenue initiatives; (ii) implementing plans for tax administration and
collection improvement; and, (iii) enhancing efforts to identify and secure reliable and timely budget
support from the international community. A review of expenditure is needed to identify options to
rebalance the composition of the budget and contain spending in light of anticipated revenue
expansion in the near term, improve efficiency, and help better focus spending on poverty
reduction.
46.
Regarding budget formulation in the years ahead, staff stressed the need to adopt
policies to address important vulnerabilities. Fiscal rules, such as targets for the share of wages or
capital, can help ensure fiscal sustainability and a desirable composition of spending, and should be
accompanied by a medium-term fiscal framework to guide their realization.9 To improve
accountability, staff recommended that line ministry budgets reflect resources disbursed from the
contingency reserve. Staff encouraged publication of data on off-budget assistance in an addendum
to the budget.
47.
Staff stressed that Somalia should eschew external borrowing (especially on
nonconcessional terms), as this would complicate a debt workout. Staff urged continued
avoidance of selective debt servicing of bilateral creditors, as this would complicate eventual
normalization of financial relations with creditors.
Authorities’ views
48.
The authorities informed staff about their plan to strengthen revenue and prioritize
expenditures in a supplementary budget for 2015. An amended spending plan was discussed
9

In conjunction with an annual budget, a medium-term fiscal framework typically sets out a three-year plan.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

with the Council of Ministers in June. The authorities confirmed the need for plans aimed at
emergency revenue mobilization and expenditure review, noting that political support is required
for expenditure reductions.
49.
The authorities presented an arrears management strategy to eliminate domestic
arrears, which are estimated to have increased by US$14.9 million during 2014 to
US$45.3 million at end-2014. The strategy includes steps to perform a stock-take, verification,
assessment, and clearance for existing arrears. Moreover, it designs policies to avoid further arrears,
strengthen commitment controls, improve cash management, and prioritize repayments.

Public financial management
Background
50.
Although considerable progress has been made in laying the foundation for PFM,
significant reform is required to bring PFM systems closer to international standards.
Improvement in budget credibility—consistent with absorptive capacity—is required to assist fiscal
discipline and improve the efficacy of public spending.
Staff’s views
51.
Staff identified multilateral and bilateral donors providing TA and recommended a
PFM agenda for 2016-20 to guide engagement with the international community. Staff
focused on the reform agenda and implementation modalities to identify and address gaps in
policy, processes, and capacity. Identified weaknesses include: (i) budget credibility and
sustainability; (ii) cash management and commitment controls; (iii) IT systems; (iv) payroll
management; (v) accounting and reporting; and, (vi) executive and legislative oversight. Staff also
emphasized the need to adopt comprehensive and properly sequenced budget preparation and
execution reforms, including arrears management.
52.
Staff welcomed the significant progress toward implementation of an effective SFMIS,
which would allow comprehensive ex ante recording of liabilities, as well as strengthened
control of spending and timely and accurate financial reporting. Staff recommended that SFMIS
development be reinforced with relevant procedures and practices including full implementation of
the treasury single account. Commitment controls need to be incorporated in the SFMIS to identify
arrears. Rules and procedures underpinning controls should be institutionalized.
Authorities’ views
53.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to leading and implementing PFM
reforms. They welcomed the PFM review and suggestions for a new reform plan for 2016-20, and
acknowledged the imperative of placing public finances on a sustainable path and closing the gap
with international standards. A fully functional SFMIS is being rolled out and PFM procedures and
practices will be institutionalized across government. The authorities observed that their 2013-16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SOMALIA

PFM reform action plan is optimistic, and that future reform plans should be more focused,
prioritized, and sequenced.

C. Financial Sector
54.
With the economy largely dollarized and in the absence of policy instruments, the CBS
is unable to conduct monetary policy. The preliminary step toward developing a monetary policy
framework would be to compile a monetary survey, underpinned by development of the CBS’s
institutional capacity.
55.
Staff reviewed financial sector developments focusing on: (i) preparing monthly financial
statements; (ii) strengthening the organizational and governance structure of the CBS;
(iii) implementing accounting and financial reporting systems and practices; and, (iv) establishing a
robust licensing and supervision process. Internal and external auditors have been appointed. The
authorities have requested TA to develop strategies to address dollarization, payment systems
limitations, and monetary policy constraints.
56.
The CBS balance sheet should remain broadly stable. The lack of financial intermediation,
inability of the government to accumulate financial assets, and limited role of the shilling should
preclude major changes to CBS balances.
Financial governance
Staff’s views
57.
Strengthening CBS organization is essential and steps are required to address the lack
of appropriate regulations. Establishment of an executive committee is important to bolster
governance and a legal unit is needed. The CBS board should approve regulations to ensure
consistent implementation of the CBS act. Areas that deserve special attention include:
(i) accounting and financial reporting; (ii) auditing; (iii) collecting and handling information from
supervised institutions; and, (iv) establishing a robust licensing and supervision process.
58.
Action is needed to strengthen the role of the CBS as sole manager of international
reserves. The CBS should: (i) establish a reserves management unit; (ii) approve by-laws for foreign
reserve management; and, (iii) utilize World Bank expertise to bolster knowledge and capacity.
Efforts to recover missing, lost, or stolen financial assets should be intensified under the leadership
of the CBS.
Authorities’ views
59.
The authorities stressed their commitment to enhancing governance at all levels with
the aim of being in line with international best practice. The CBS agreed that establishment of
an executive committee would bolster governance. They informed staff of potential donor resources

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

available to support this endeavor, and the need for review of the allocation of responsibilities. They
underscored the importance of TA and training.
Monetary and exchange rate policy framework

Background
60.
Current monetary conditions do not serve the country well and need to be addressed.
The monetary regime and the situation with respect to currencies in actual circulation are not the
results of specific policy choices, but the outcome of chaotic conditions since the early 1990s
combined with the operational weakness of the CBS. Moreover, the policy framework and regime
have not been determined by the authorities. The absence of exchange restrictions supports trade
and the vibrant expansion of the private sector.
Staff’s views
61.
Staff noted that the choice of an appropriate monetary policy framework and
exchange rate regime contains several options. Options range from dollarization or a currency
board-type arrangement to a freely floating exchange rate. In the short run, staff sees no
alternatives to de facto dollarization.
62.
Introduction of a new currency is complex and costly. Staff reiterated that currency
reform must be prepared properly. Staff discussed prerequisites and modalities for successful
currency reform: (i) building technical capacity; (ii) mobilizing financial resources; (iii) planning and
conducting currency conversion; and, (iv) ensuring policy consensus and broad-based political
support. Staff also discussed Article VIII obligations and exchange restrictions (see the Informational
Annex).
63.
At this time, the CBS lacks the capacity and resources for undertaking a
comprehensive currency reform. International experience shows that the direct costs of an illprepared currency reform are large and reputational losses can be considerable. Accordingly, staff
recommended that priority be given to an agreed framework for the preparation, with extensive
international support, of a roadmap that would provide options for the authorities’ eventual
decision on a currency reform.
Authorities’ views
64.
The authorities welcomed a discussion on options for a monetary policy and exchange
rate framework, including the identifying modalities for successful currency reform. Although
there is no consensus on the currency reform, they initially stressed the importance that successive
governments have attached to the role of the national currency. Since May 2015, parliament has
escalated pressure on the CBS to issue new Somali banknotes.
65.
The CBS governor underscored the importance of a currency reform strategy and
consensus on key reform measures before proceeding. The authorities are discussing options

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SOMALIA

including issuing the lowest denomination banknote, which they believe is important for the poor
and those living in remote areas.
66.
The authorities confirmed that the de facto currency is the U.S. dollar and that they
enforce no restrictions on transfers. Accordingly, the making of payments for all international
transactions is free of restrictions. The de jure regime is under discussion.
67.
The authorities highlighted the importance of external advice and financing for a
successful currency reform. Extensive TA from staff and collaborating central banks will be
requested. In addition, substantial financial support from donors will be required.
Financial sector developments
68.
While the CBS has insufficient capacity to license and supervise financial institutions,
they are taking steps to address the threat to remittance flows. Prudent growth of financial
intermediation requires bolstering capacity in critical areas including bank licensing and supervision,
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. Recently, a number of
international banks have closed their correspondent accounts with Somali MTFs, threatening the
inflow of remittances. In response, the authorities have launched a multi-agency task force on
remittances. Moreover, the authorities, in collaboration with donors, have established an advisory
council to facilitate remittances to Somalia. The CBS and the World Bank have agreed on the
appointment of a “Trusted Agent” to supervise MTFs and help build capacity in licensing and
supervision.
Staff’s views
69.
The CBS has taken welcome steps to establish a formal financial sector. Staff agreed
with the CBS that the number of licensed banks should not be increased until the supervisory
capabilities of the CBS have been enhanced. Nevertheless, the practice of awarding provisional
banking licenses should cease, as it has no legal basis in the CBS act or the financial institutions law.
70.
Decisive action is needed to address capacity weaknesses in licensing and supervision.
Elaboration of a financial sector roadmap will be a critical first step. Preparing and approving
additional prudential regulations and ensuring compliance, as well as strengthening the AML/CFT
framework, are also priorities. Staff is providing advice in these areas, supported by collaborating
central banks.
71.
International remittances to Somalia must not be jeopardized. Staff urged the
authorities to move swiftly to build credibility in licensing and supervision. The initiative to establish
a trusted agent may mitigate the threat to remittance flows.

72.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff regarding capacity building. They
emphasized the need for external technical support for human capacity building and drafting
regulations.
73.
The CBS board has decided to halt issuance of additional bank licenses until applicants
fulfill basic requirements. Consequently, nine licensing requests are on hold pending compliance
with the following requirements: (i) adequate capital; (ii) an established board of directors;
(iii) proper accounting systems; (iv) internal auditing; (v) non-concentrated shareholding;
(vi) ownership of a national (non clan-based) character; and, (vii) an approved business plan.
Furthermore, the CBS informed staff that licensed banks will also have to meet these requirements,
and have until the end of the year to comply.

STAFF APPRAISAL
74.
Somalia is recovering from decades of conflict. Protracted civil war has left weak
institutions and sparse human capital. The government in Mogadishu is broadening its domain while
building institutions that could lead toward prosperity. The FGS has garnered broad international
support and Somalia has been welcomed back as an active member of the Fund.
75.
Despite tremendous progress, challenges remain daunting and risks are ubiquitous.
Complex politics and nascent political institutions continue to undermine policymaking. Slower
global growth could lower demand for exports, reduce donor support, and decrease remittance
inflows. Remittance inflows are also at risk due to heightened global concerns about terrorist
financing coupled with weak Somali bank supervision.
76.
Economic activity is picking up while consumer price inflation remains low. Real growth
in 2014 was 3.7 percent and medium-term growth should be modest, supported by security
improvements. Inflation has been and should remain in low single digits.
77.
Concerted action is needed to build institutions for sustainable, inclusive growth and
to reduce poverty and address gender disparities. Sound and accountable economic and
financial governance and an enabling environment for the private sector are critical for the
restoration of public confidence in government. Data provision has serious shortcomings that
significantly hamper surveillance. Data weaknesses preclude a debt sustainability assessment and
external stability analysis. Remedial measures needed to lay the foundation for improved data
provision and surveillance would entail gradual adoption of international standards and codes,
measures to implement accounting systems and better regulatory practices, and clarity regarding
delineation of authority between the FGS and sub-national entities. Clarity is needed regarding
delineation of authority between the FGS and sub-national entities.
78.
Urgent efforts are required to set in place sound mechanisms and institutions to
ensure that prospective natural resource wealth is well managed. Effective and transparent

concession management will require building institutions to ensure that natural resource
exploitation maximizes benefits for Somalis. International best practices must be integral to the
resource management strategy.
79.
Decisive steps are necessary to build fiscal discipline, underpinned by realistic
budgeting and effective implementation systems. Emergency revenue mobilization and an
arrears strategy will tackle immediate problems, supported by expenditure rationalization. Realistic
budgeting within a medium-term fiscal framework, supported by fiscal rules and reliable,
transparent reporting, is urgently required.
80.
Currency reform should be postponed until prerequisites are in place. Failed efforts
would create significant direct losses as well as reputational costs. Currency reform should adhere to
a well-designed roadmap, including building adequate technical and human capacity.
81.
Swift action is required so that remittances can be channeled through the
international banking system. Elaboration of a financial sector roadmap will be a critical first step
to build credibility in licensing and supervision. Other priorities include preparing and approving
additional prudential regulations and ensuring compliance.
82.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Somalia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Excluding SDRs allocated and placed in escrow account under the Fourth Amendment of the IMF's Articles of agreement
(SDR 4,156,315), such holdings will be available to Somalia upon the settlement of all overdue obligations to the Fund.

Projections based on existing use of resources and present holdings of SDRs. The projection of charges and interest assumes
that overdue principal at the report date (if any) will remain outstanding, but forthcoming obligations will be settled on time.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). However, the de facto currency is the
U.S. dollar. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency with Somali banknotes serving as a subdenomination. Neighboring country currencies are used in border areas. Mobile phone payments,
with transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are widely used. Most transactions are settled in
U.S. dollars. The SOS exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years at USD1 = SOS
20,000. During May 2015, the rate depreciated briefly to SOS 23,500 in response to an influx of
new, counterfeit notes. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Due to the
absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate, and the inoperative
status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is
classified as a free floating arrangement.
As part of its ongoing reengagement with the authorities, staff continues to assess the
jurisdictional implications of the existing exchange regime. Somalia still avails itself of the
transitional arrangements of Article XIV, however it no longer maintains restrictions under Article
XIV. At the time of Somalia’s last Article IV consultation in 1989, Somalia maintained the following
Article VIII restrictions: (i) a multiple currency practice and exchange restricting arising from the
imposition of a ten percent levy on all applications for purchases of foreign exchange under the
commodity import program, (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from different exchange rates
applicable to official transactions and to transactions in external accounts and to import/export
accounts, and (iii) an exchange restriction evidenced by some external payments arrears. As part
of its ongoing reengagement with the authorities, staff continues to assess the existing exchange
regime.
Article IV Consultation
Although Somalia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, civil war led to the

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(As of June 30, 2015)
The IMF and the World Bank Group country teams for Somalia maintain close working
relations and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues. Collaboration is becoming
more regular as both institutions scale up their engagement with the Somalia. The following are
notable areas of collaboration:


Fiscal: The IMF and the World Bank have collaborated closely on fiscal policy matters. There
is an agreement on fiscal priorities and policies between the two institutions. Specifically,
both teams have urged the authorities to: (i) prepare and execute a realistic budget;
(ii) develop an emergency revenue mobilization plan; and, (iii) find agreement between
federal and sub-national governments on fiscal federalism. There has been extensive
collaboration on public finance management issues, particularly, on: (i) the design of the
Treasury Single Account; (ii) improvements to the Chart of Accounts; and, (iii) the
implementation of the Financial Management Information System. More recently, the IMF
and World Bank teams initiated preparatory work on developing a macro-fiscal framework
and conducting a debt sustainability analysis. Additionally, the teams have collaborated
closely in assisting the authorities with the preparation and management of the 2015
budget. The assistance was provided by an IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department public financial
management expert who joined several missions of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia
Department, and subsequently travelled to Mogadishu under a World Bank-funded contract
to operationalize fiscal issues discussed and agreed with the authorities.



External debt statistics: In 2014, the IMF and the World Bank collaborated in the
establishment of the Technical Working Group on Somalia’s Debt. The group has met twice
since the 2014 Spring Meetings.



Macroeconomic statistics: Somalia’s macroeconomic statistics depend upon collaboration
between the IMF and the World Bank. At present, there are two significant examples: (i) a
World Bank funded household survey has been conducted in Somaliland, with enumeration
of Mogadishu scheduled for late 2015. The results of the World Bank household survey will
enable the IMF to provide assistance in delivering: (a) objective estimates for household final
consumption expenditure to derive GDP; and, (b) appropriate expenditure patterns for
estimating the Consumer Price Index; and, (ii) the recently implemented Somali Financial
Management Information System which provides revenue and expenditure data for most of
the activities conducted by the Federal Government of Somalia.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP3
(As of June 30, 2015)
1.
The Somalia Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was endorsed by the World Bank Board in
December 2013. Its objective is to lay the foundations for a solid poverty reduction strategy and
shared prosperity. These goals will be reached by delivering on selected priorities under the Peace
and State-building Goals (PSGs) of the Somali Compact, a high level mutual accountability
framework endorsed at the Brussels Conference in September 2013. The ISN is structured around
two priorities: (i) strengthening core economic institutions; and, (ii) expanding economic
opportunity.
2.
Under Priority I (Strengthening Core Economic Institutions), the World Bank is focusing
on improving economic governance, including macro-fiscal and public finance management, as well
as statistical capacity and supporting the establishment and implementation of a sound regulatory
framework in strategic economic sectors. Key trust-funded activities under this area include: (i) a set
of core systems strengthening projects (the Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing, Public Financial
Management Strengthening, and Capacity Injection); (ii) a financial governance program; (iii) an
information and communications technology (ICT) regulatory support project; and, (iv) a petroleum
sector program. Policy dialogue and economic and sector work focuses inter alia on macro- and
fiscal planning, revenue mobilization, inter-governmental fiscal relations, and statistical
strengthening and socio-economic data collection.
3.
Under Priority 2 (Expanding Economic Opportunity), the World Bank is focusing on
supporting job creation through private sector investment through public-private partnerships
(PPPs), public private dialogue, and targeted financial support; as well as financing basic
rehabilitation of infrastructure for employment generation and productivity. Key activities under this
priority include: (i) a private and financial sector development project; (ii) an urban development
project; and, (iii) an energy sector support project. While the UN leads assistance in both the health
and education sectors, the World Bank is preparing the ground programming with analytical work.
Active Projects and Pipeline
4.
As Somalia is in arrears to the World Bank, the World Bank project portfolio is
primarily supported by three trust funds: (i) the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund (MPF), a multi-donor
trust fund (MDTF) launched in August 2014 with approximately US$175 million in contributions from
six donors and expected to grow to US$250 million over the next two years; 4 (ii) the State- and
Peace-Building Fund (SPF), a World Bank-administered global MDTF has contributed
US$28.9 million to Somalia since 2012;5 and, (iii) Som-PREP II, a US$24.7 million MDTF focused on

Somalia Private Sector Development Re-engagement Program Phase II (Som-PREP II):
Som-PREP II, has been primarily focused on Somaliland. Its activities are mostly complete. Its
objective was to improve access to markets and generate employment in key productive and service
sectors. The component-level objectives of the program focused on: (i) improving the investment
climate and strengthening public-private dialogue; (ii) strengthening banking supervision and legal
frameworks; (iii) promoting value chain development; (iv) supporting PPPs in ports and solid waste;
(v) providing MSME financing to the private sector; and, (iv) identifying economic sector work
constraints to private sector-led growth and job creation with a particular focus on key economic
sectors.
6.
Petroleum Sector Inclusive Development: Funded by the MFP, the objectives of this
project are to: (i) facilitate a process to harmonize issues of ownership, control and revenue sharing
in the petroleum sector; (ii) support the development of a petroleum strategy and a policy, legal and
fiscal framework; and, (iii) build government capacity to negotiate and manage petroleum contracts.
7.
Financial Governance Policy Dialogue: Funded by the MPF, the objective of this program
is to provide technical advice and facilitate policy dialogue to strengthen transparency and
accountability in the areas of strategic public procurement and concessions, asset recovery, and
other selected areas of financial governance. In 2014 the FGS and the international community
established the Financial Governance Committee (FGC), a high-level institution to help the Somali
authorities improve governance. This project will provide assistance to the FGC with: (i) predictable
and reliable funding for its basic operations; and, (ii) technical assistance to help advance its work
program during the FGC’s second year.
8.
Somalia Knowledge for Operations and Political Economy (SKOPE): Funded by the SPF,
the objectives of this program are to: (i) enhance the development impact of domestic policies and
development partner interventions through better knowledge of socio-economic realities as well as
political economy constraints; (ii) promote basic accountability through better information on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

availability and use of public resources; and, (iii) revitalize the strategic planning process. SKOPE
activities fall under three broad components: (i) collecting and analyzing data, as well as developing
TA-related activities; (ii) understanding political economy constraints; and (iii) supporting strategic
planning at federal and regional levels.
9.
Public Financial Management Capacity Strengthening, Phase I: Funded by the SPF, the
objective of this project is to establish systems for more transparent and accountable management
and use of public funds in Somalia. Effective since early 2014, the project was launched as a pilot to
lay the foundations for a larger scale public financial management program supported through the
MPF. The project focuses on public financial management reform oversight, piloting one Financial
Management Information System, and establishing expenditure control, procurement, accounting,
and reporting systems.
10.
ICT Sector Support, Phase I: Funded by the SPF, the objective of this pilot project is to:
(i) lay foundations for a larger scale program under the MP; and, (ii) contribute towards the process
of developing a regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector and building an ICT
infrastructure in Somalia. The project focuses on supporting open access to international bandwidth
and setting up communication rooms and facilities for government.

Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing (RCRF) Program, Phase II: The objective of the
RCRF is to support the government to provide credible and sustainable payroll and to establish the
foundation for efficient budget execution and payment systems for the non-security sectors in the
FGS and eligible sub-national authorities. Phase II, starting in 2015, will consolidate the gains made
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

under the recently closed Phase I project, and will strengthen macro-fiscal management, central
bank reform, and potential target support to expanded social service delivery. Phase II will also
explore options for the expansion of recurrent cost support to regional governments.
12.
The Somali Core Economic Institutions and Opportunities (SCORE) Program: The
objective of the SCORE program, which expands work previously undertaken through Som-PREP II,
is to support select core economic institutions linked to trade, financial sector, and private sector
development in order to catalyze inward investment and job creation. The project components are:
strengthening core institutions in three critical areas of the economy (central banking, the Ministries
of Commerce and Industry, and local port and customs authorities). The second component will
focus on expanding economic opportunities by providing direct support to the private sector—
through technical assistance and grants—to expand economic opportunities in the country.
13.
Capacity Injection Project: The objective of this project is to enable the government fill
critical capacity gaps in the civil service, and strengthen the capacity of key ministries and agencies
to perform core government functions. Project components cover: (i) developing capacity for key
cross-cutting government functions; (ii) strengthening the policies and procedures for civil service
management; and, (iii) aiding policy management, coordination and monitoring capabilities at the
center of government.
14.
Public Financial Management Strengthening Project, Phase II: The objective of the
project is to establish systems for transparent and accountable public funds management, building
on the work launched under Phase I. It focuses on the implementation of medium-term fiscal
frameworks to underpin: (i) planning budget preparation; (ii) managing revenue mobilization and tax
administration; (iii) developing Somalia’s financial management information system; (iv) managing
expenditure control; (v) overseeing procurement, accounting and financial reporting; (vi) conducting
auditing and monitoring; and, (vi) establishing structures to oversee public financial management
reforms in Somalia.
15.
ICT Sector Support in Somalia, Phase II: The objective of the project, continuing from
Phase I, is to support the ICT Sector in Somalia by contributing to establish an enabling environment
and by encouraging efficiency and equity in access to connectivity. The program aims to allow the
ICT sector grow and support connectivity benefits to the government and the citizens. The scope of
the work will combine technical assistance, and provision of goods (e.g. communications rooms in
ministries), and services (e.g. connectivity and bandwidth support for the higher education).
16.
Somali Urban Investment Planning Project (SUIPP) and Somalia Urban Development
Project (SUDP): The objective of SUIPP is to support feasibility studies and preliminary design work
for a MPF-funded operation targeted at urban infrastructure investment and institutional
strengthening in southern Somalia, Puntland and Somaliland, as well as the provision of technical
assistance to government agencies to assist them prepare and implement these activities.
17.
Somalia Power Sector Development Master Plan: The objective of the program is to
support the building blocks for the establishment of a modern energy sector in Somalia. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

SOMALIA

components of the program are: (i) developing a master plan that sets out priorities and investment
sequencing in generation, transmission and generation over a 20-year period, and delivers detailed
electrical infrastructure development plans for a number of urban areas; (ii) preparing a “Lighting
Africa Somalia” investment; and, (iii) developing a renewable energy resource map for Somalia.
18.
Somalia Towage Services in Berbera Port: The objective of the project is to support the
development of the Berbera Port by improving throughput, towage capacity and reliability of
towage services.
19.
Water for Agro-Pastoral Livelihoods Pilot Project: The objective of the project is to build
the government to implement small-scale water interventions to provide safe water for human
consumption and sufficient quantities of water for livestock as inputs to enhancing fodder and
agricultural production in targeted arid lands of Somaliland and Puntland. This will be done by
piloting the development and implementation of under-utilized rural water supply technologies.
Economic and Sector Work
20.
Statistical Strengthening and Socio-Economic Data Collection: The last nationally
representative household surveys providing information on household income, consumption and
poverty were conducted in 1985. The World Bank program has worked to address these data gaps
in Somaliland, Puntland and Mogadishu. The 2012 Somaliland Enterprise and Household Surveys
provided data to produce a poverty assessment; private sector studies; and a CPI base weights and
estimates of GDP. In Mogadishu, the World Bank and the Somali Department of Statistics (under the
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation), have successfully implemented the first set of
an innovative high-frequency computer assisted household survey that will provide vital household
expenditure, socioeconomic and peace and state-building goal data. The instrument is tailored to
collect data quickly, in highly insecure settings, and is designed to work in tandem with new
econometric techniques to produce a reliable poverty profile and CPI base weights. The World Bank
will support the roll-out throughout Somalia of household surveys—combining high frequency
surveys and more standard household surveys—to provide regular poverty, social and process data,
as well as other relevant information that can be gathered through that instruments. This work will
also support poverty assessments and other poverty analytical studies made possible by the data
collection exercises.
21.
Policies and Institutions for Economic Growth: The World Bank is conducting a source of
growth study, with a view to establish a consensus between the government and its partners on
priority policies and public investment to enable strong inclusive growth. The work will also support
analysis and technical assistance in areas related to private investment, trade, and sectors
contributing to growth. This work will also support the building of core capacity of government to
design and implement economic development polices.
22.
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Planning: The World Bank is working with relevant ministries to
support the development of a simple macro-fiscal framework with clear linkages to the annual
planning and budgeting process, as well as a simple public investment management framework

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

covering financing modalities and time horizons, that would inform national planning and enable
the FGS to improve the appraisal and evaluation of capital investments.
23.
Policy Engagement on Revenue Mobilization, Natural Resource Management and
Inter-governmental Fiscal Relations: The World Bank plans to undertake an analysis to generate a
better understanding of the Somali economy and potential sources for maximizing revenue
generation. The work will focus on policy related issues and areas for advisory work, including
supporting licensing and regulatory frameworks for telecommunications, ports management, ICT
and the extractive industries. This will also include technical support on revenue management
options for natural resource revenues. Inter-governmental fiscal relations engagement initially
focuses on sharing relevant international experience with the government.
24.
Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs): The World Bank is supporting the production of
regular PERs at both the federal and regional level, with the goal of closely monitoring the evolution
of macro-fiscal and budgetary trends, and providing the underlying analysis for the Recurrent Cost
and Reform Project. The World Bank has also supported a Security and Justice Public Expenditure
Review as a joint exercise with the UN. This PER aims to unpack the fiscal implications of the current
response to the threats facing Somalia, and the long term implications by offering a data-driven and
evidence-based analysis, not only of revenues and expenditures of the security sector, but of the
violence and insecurity Somalia is facing.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK6
(As of June 30, 2015)
25.
The 2013-15 Somalia Country Brief (CB) was approved by the African Development
Bank’s (AfDB) board of directors in April 2013. The CB laid out a scaled-up program
reengagement with Somalia. The strategic areas of reengagement include: (i) strengthening
governance and institutional capacity; (ii) supporting the re-engagement process of Somalia with the
international financial community, through a comprehensive program of arrears clearance and debt
relief; (iii) including Somalia in the AfDB’s regional “Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihood
Programme” (DRSLP); and, (iv) developing infrastructure planning to support the recovery process.
26.
The AfDB Somalia Infrastructure Trust Fund (SITF) is currently being prepared.
Following the AFDB’s board approval, the trust fund is expected to be operational by the fourth
quarter of 2015. The SITF has a medium to longer-term perspective and will focus on infrastructure
reconstruction and development, which is aligned with the Peace and State Building Goal 4 (or
PSG 4).7 The bulk of activities financed by the SITF will be core infrastructure investment projects in
the energy, transport, water, sanitation and ICT sectors. The SITF will also support capacity building,
as well as financing and governance activities related to the infrastructure reconstruction program.
27.
The AfDB has had 12 operations in Somalia since 2013. Of these, two operations are now
finished, nine are national operations, and one is a regional project. The current net commitment is
UA 21.7 million, equivalent to about US$33 million. The AfDB’s ongoing portfolio in Somalia
comprises many small sized operations, with an average project size of UA 2.17 million. The
portfolios average age is 1 year, with a cumulative disbursement rate of 3.75 percent. A brief
description of the projects is provided below:


The AfDB (in partnership with a host of UN agencies and bilateral donors, and through UNFPA
implementation), contributed about US$ 0.5million (of a total cost of US$6.18million) to fund the
Population Estimation Survey for Somalia (PESS) project. In May 2015, the official findings
from the PESS were released (e.g. 75 percent and 46 percent of Somalis are below the ages of
30 and 15 respectively). The PESS is supposed to assist the FGS and donors in establishing a
platform for compiling data and information on Somalia’s socio-economic and poverty baselines;
pave the way for an official Census in 2016; and, support the monitoring of progress towards
attaining the MDGs.



The AfDB has played a key role in supporting Somalia’s re-engagement with international
financial institutions (IFIs), particularly through the preparation for arrears clearance, access to

The Somali New Deal Compact (2014-2016) including the Somaliland Special Arrangement1, outlines Somalia’s key government
priorities within five Peace and State Building Goals (PSGs). These are: PSG 1 (Inclusive Politics); PSG 2: (security); PSG 3 (justice),
PSG 4 (economic foundations); and PSG 5 (revenue and services).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

HIPC/MDRI debt relief, and building debt management capacity. AfDB’s TA has supported the
reconstruction of Somalia’s external debt data, including the setting up and initial capacity
(including systems and staff) of a debt management unit in the ministry of finance; and, initial
work in developing a strategy for arrears clearance and access to HIPC/MDRI debt relief. The
AfDB is currently in Phase 2 of this program.


The AfDB is supporting the development of statistical capacity in all regions of Somalia. The UA
0.35 million Somaliland Statistical Capacity Building Project, is currently ongoing. A similar
project has also been designed for Puntland. Discussions are being held to develop a
comparable project with the FGS. The AfDB is also represented on the High Level Task Force
(HLTF) for Statistics in Somalia.8 The HLTF focuses on statistical capacity building and data
gathering for the development of an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP),
establishment of an IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), and monitoring of the Peace and State
Building Goals (PSGs) under the Somali Compact. Through its participation in the HLTF, the
AfDB is assessing further options to provide statistical capacity building support in Somalia.



Through the Economic and Financial Governance Institutional Support Project (EFGISP), the
AfDB is helping strengthen macroeconomic and financial management in Somalia. By setting up
an improved macroeconomic and budget framework, the AfDB intends to enhance fiscal
discipline of the FGS, and, ultimately, the strategic and efficient allocation and use of public
resources. Furthermore, the AfDB is playing a lead role through the FGC in implementing the
Financial Governance Program. The AfDB has also provided TA to the ministry of finance in
building capacity for aid coordination.



Since September 1, 2014, the AfDB’s African Legal Support Facility placed a senior legal expert in
the FGS to provide legal advisory services to the government in connection to complex
commercial negotiations relating to, inter alia, infrastructure, loans, and natural resources. This
support will include placing systems, providing capacity building services to government officials,
and working on the negotiations of government contracts.



The Somalia Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Programme (DRSLP) is part of
Phase II of the AfDB’s broader initiative to provide support to the drought and famine stricken
countries in the Horn of Africa, and build their sustained and long-term resilience. The main
components of the DRSLP are: (i) water and natural resource development and management;
(ii) livestock infrastructure for market access; and, (iii) capacity building. Funds for the Somalia
DRSLP are grants from the Transition Support Department Pillar I (UA 5 million) and the Regional
Operations (RO) window (UA 10 million) for a total project of UA 15 million. In view of Somalia’s
external debt arrears situation, the FGS cannot administer resources from the RO window and,
thus, requires a third party to administer the resources on its behalf (as per AfDB’s rules and

8

partners and relevant Somali institutions.

regulations). Thus, the FGS, with the endorsement of Puntland and Somaliland, have selected
IGAD to administer the RO resources.


14

On the knowledge front, the AfDB conducted the Infrastructure Needs Assessments (INA) in
the energy, transport, water and sanitation and ICT sectors. These assessments are key
deliverables in the government’s Economic Recovery Plan 2014-15. The ultimate goal is to
develop a Somalia Infrastructure Action Plan, which will: (i) assist the government in building
an initial project pipeline for the proposed AfDB Multi-Partner Somalia Infrastructure Trust
Fund; (ii) provide input into the preparation of Somalia’s i-PRSP; and, (iii) assist in the broad
planning, prioritization and resource mobilization for infrastructure interventions. The ICT
assessment has been completed and validated. The water and sanitation assessment is expected
to be validated in the second quarter of 2015. A final draft of the energy assessment has been
distributed to the FGS, and will be validated at a workshop in August 2015. The transport
assessment is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015. The AfDb continues to play
a leadership role in the infrastructure sector by chairing the PSG 4 Sub-working Group on
Infrastructure, and engaging with federal and regional governments to rationalise priority
infrastructure projects. This has allowed the AfDB to take a leadership role in guiding the
reconstruction and development of Somalia’s infrastructure.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 30, 2015)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance caused by
institutional weaknesses, lack of source data, and agencies having unclear and overlapping responsibilities.
Somalia is rebuilding its macroeconomic statistics after several decades of civil war. The Statistics Law from
1970 remains in effect and is being updated to reflect current conditions and requirements. An impressive
achievement is a time series of average monthly prices for several markets in Mogadishu covering several
years. State and local authorities also independently produce some statistics for their region while
coordination arrangements are being established. A multisector mission was conducted in May 2015 to
assess the status and development plans for macro economic statistics. It affirmed work begun by the
authorities to develop a strategic plan to guide development of the national statistical system and identified
technical assistance requirements over the coming years. Somalia intends to commence reporting of basic
IFS data to the IMF as they become available.
National Accounts: A modeled time series for annual GDP has been compiled since 2012. Results are largely
dependent upon qualitative assessments of the authorities and broad assumptions applied to limited data.
Estimates for government final consumption expenditure are derived from the FGS accounts and
assumptions regarding the relative size of the general government sector. Estimates for capital formation are
based upon product detail within counterparty data, assumptions about undercoverage, and value added by
Somali resident units. A household expenditure survey has been conducted in Somaliland and used to
estimate average daily household final consumption expenditure of US$1.60 per day. A household survey in
Mogadishu will begin in late 2015 and may result in substantial revisions.
Price Statistics: The FGS began to compile a new experimental Consumer Price Index (CPI) following an IMF
mission in January 2015. An expanded basket of 312 items with weights based on expenditure shares derived
from other African countries was introduced. When results from the household expenditure survey for
Mogadishu are finalized (which should occur in 2016) TA will be provided to introduce new weights and to
improve price collection procedures. Somalia does not have a producer price index (PPI).
Government Finance Statistics: FGS commenced use of an automated financial management information
system during 2015 to replace the previous manual recording. A mapping between the underlying chart of
accounts and GFS items is being developed and is expected to enable production of preliminary GFS
estimates for budgetary central government during 2015. The authorities have commenced negotiations to
obtain appropriate financial data from state/local units to produce comprehensive estimates for Somalia’s
general government sector. Somalia does not currently have any significant public trading enterprises.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The significance of monetary statistics is limited by the ambiguous status
of the Somali shilling. The CBS is currently finalizing the relationship between its accounts and the MFS
aggregates and expected to produce monetary statistics for this subsector by the end of 2015. Statistics for
the remaining subsectors will be produced as regulatory and reporting arrangements for Somalia’s financial
institutions are established over coming months.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SOMALIA

Financial sector surveillance: Negligible data will be available for financial sector surveillance until
regulatory arrangements are implemented. The authorities are beginning to collect basic balance sheet data
from several financial institutions.
External sector statistics: A modeled time series for annual Balance of Payments has been compiled since
2013. Results are largely dependent upon qualitative assessments of the authorities and broad assumptions
applied to existing data. Estimates for imports and exports of goods and services are based upon
counterparty data and assumptions about undercoverage. The Somalia’s Customs Directorate has agreed to
start to collect data on the value of exports and imports that can be used to estimate values of trade in
goods. Model-based estimates for remittances and foreign direct investment will be replaced by source data
as regulatory and reporting arrangements are established. While Somalia does not compile comprehensive
estimates for International Investment Position, data are compiled by the World Bank on the liabilities of
Somalia’s general government to the rest of the world. An estimate of Somalia’s reserves will be available
when balance sheet data from the CBS are audited and published.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). However, the de facto currency is the
U.S. dollar. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency with Somali banknotes serving as a subdenomination. Neighboring country currencies are used in border areas. Mobile phone payments,
with transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are widely used. Most transactions are settled in
U.S. dollars. The SOS exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years at USD1 = SOS
20,000. During May 2015, the rate depreciated briefly to SOS 23,500 in response to an influx of
new, counterfeit notes. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Due to the
absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate, and the inoperative
status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is
classified as a free floating arrangement.
As part of its ongoing reengagement with the authorities, staff continues to assess the
jurisdictional implications of the existing exchange regime. Somalia still avails itself of the
transitional arrangements of Article XIV, however it no longer maintains restrictions under Article
XIV. At the time of Somalia’s last Article IV consultation in 1989, Somalia maintained the following
Article VIII restrictions: (i) a multiple currency practice and exchange restricting arising from the
imposition of a ten percent levy on all applications for purchases of foreign exchange under the
commodity import program, (ii) a multiple currency practice arising from different exchange rates
applicable to official transactions and to transactions in external accounts and to import/export
accounts, and (iii) an exchange restriction evidenced by some external payments arrears. As part
of its ongoing reengagement with the authorities, staff continues to assess the existing exchange
regime.
Article IV Consultation
Although Somalia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, civil war led to the
postponement of discussions for 26 years. The last Article IV consultation discussions were
conducted on July 9-23, 1989 in Mogadishu. The Executive Board concluded the 1989 Article IV
consultation on November 13, 1989.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(As of June 30, 2015)
The IMF and the World Bank Group country teams for Somalia maintain close working
relations and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues. Collaboration is becoming
more regular as both institutions scale up their engagement with the Somalia. The following are
notable areas of collaboration:


Fiscal: The IMF and the World Bank have collaborated closely on fiscal policy matters. There
is an agreement on fiscal priorities and policies between the two institutions. Specifically,
both teams have urged the authorities to: (i) prepare and execute a realistic budget;
(ii) develop an emergency revenue mobilization plan; and, (iii) find agreement between
federal and sub-national governments on fiscal federalism. There has been extensive
collaboration on public finance management issues, particularly, on: (i) the design of the
Treasury Single Account; (ii) improvements to the Chart of Accounts; and, (iii) the
implementation of the Financial Management Information System. More recently, the IMF
and World Bank teams initiated preparatory work on developing a macro-fiscal framework
and conducting a debt sustainability analysis. Additionally, the teams have collaborated
closely in assisting the authorities with the preparation and management of the 2015
budget. The assistance was provided by an IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department public financial
management expert who joined several missions of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia
Department, and subsequently travelled to Mogadishu under a World Bank-funded contract
to operationalize fiscal issues discussed and agreed with the authorities.



External debt statistics: In 2014, the IMF and the World Bank collaborated in the
establishment of the Technical Working Group on Somalia’s Debt. The group has met twice
since the 2014 Spring Meetings.



Macroeconomic statistics: Somalia’s macroeconomic statistics depend upon collaboration
between the IMF and the World Bank. At present, there are two significant examples: (i) a
World Bank funded household survey has been conducted in Somaliland, with enumeration
of Mogadishu scheduled for late 2015. The results of the World Bank household survey will
enable the IMF to provide assistance in delivering: (a) objective estimates for household final
consumption expenditure to derive GDP; and, (b) appropriate expenditure patterns for
estimating the Consumer Price Index; and, (ii) the recently implemented Somali Financial
Management Information System which provides revenue and expenditure data for most of
the activities conducted by the Federal Government of Somalia.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP3
(As of June 30, 2015)
1.
The Somalia Interim Strategy Note (ISN) was endorsed by the World Bank Board in
December 2013. Its objective is to lay the foundations for a solid poverty reduction strategy and
shared prosperity. These goals will be reached by delivering on selected priorities under the Peace
and State-building Goals (PSGs) of the Somali Compact, a high level mutual accountability
framework endorsed at the Brussels Conference in September 2013. The ISN is structured around
two priorities: (i) strengthening core economic institutions; and, (ii) expanding economic
opportunity.
2.
Under Priority I (Strengthening Core Economic Institutions), the World Bank is focusing
on improving economic governance, including macro-fiscal and public finance management, as well
as statistical capacity and supporting the establishment and implementation of a sound regulatory
framework in strategic economic sectors. Key trust-funded activities under this area include: (i) a set
of core systems strengthening projects (the Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing, Public Financial
Management Strengthening, and Capacity Injection); (ii) a financial governance program; (iii) an
information and communications technology (ICT) regulatory support project; and, (iv) a petroleum
sector program. Policy dialogue and economic and sector work focuses inter alia on macro- and
fiscal planning, revenue mobilization, inter-governmental fiscal relations, and statistical
strengthening and socio-economic data collection.
3.
Under Priority 2 (Expanding Economic Opportunity), the World Bank is focusing on
supporting job creation through private sector investment through public-private partnerships
(PPPs), public private dialogue, and targeted financial support; as well as financing basic
rehabilitation of infrastructure for employment generation and productivity. Key activities under this
priority include: (i) a private and financial sector development project; (ii) an urban development
project; and, (iii) an energy sector support project. While the UN leads assistance in both the health
and education sectors, the World Bank is preparing the ground programming with analytical work.
Active Projects and Pipeline
4.
As Somalia is in arrears to the World Bank, the World Bank project portfolio is
primarily supported by three trust funds: (i) the Somalia Multi-Partner Fund (MPF), a multi-donor
trust fund (MDTF) launched in August 2014 with approximately US$175 million in contributions from
six donors and expected to grow to US$250 million over the next two years; 4 (ii) the State- and
Peace-Building Fund (SPF), a World Bank-administered global MDTF has contributed
US$28.9 million to Somalia since 2012;5 and, (iii) Som-PREP II, a US$24.7 million MDTF focused on

Somalia Private Sector Development Re-engagement Program Phase II (Som-PREP II):
Som-PREP II, has been primarily focused on Somaliland. Its activities are mostly complete. Its
objective was to improve access to markets and generate employment in key productive and service
sectors. The component-level objectives of the program focused on: (i) improving the investment
climate and strengthening public-private dialogue; (ii) strengthening banking supervision and legal
frameworks; (iii) promoting value chain development; (iv) supporting PPPs in ports and solid waste;
(v) providing MSME financing to the private sector; and, (iv) identifying economic sector work
constraints to private sector-led growth and job creation with a particular focus on key economic
sectors.
6.
Petroleum Sector Inclusive Development: Funded by the MFP, the objectives of this
project are to: (i) facilitate a process to harmonize issues of ownership, control and revenue sharing
in the petroleum sector; (ii) support the development of a petroleum strategy and a policy, legal and
fiscal framework; and, (iii) build government capacity to negotiate and manage petroleum contracts.
7.
Financial Governance Policy Dialogue: Funded by the MPF, the objective of this program
is to provide technical advice and facilitate policy dialogue to strengthen transparency and
accountability in the areas of strategic public procurement and concessions, asset recovery, and
other selected areas of financial governance. In 2014 the FGS and the international community
established the Financial Governance Committee (FGC), a high-level institution to help the Somali
authorities improve governance. This project will provide assistance to the FGC with: (i) predictable
and reliable funding for its basic operations; and, (ii) technical assistance to help advance its work
program during the FGC’s second year.
8.
Somalia Knowledge for Operations and Political Economy (SKOPE): Funded by the SPF,
the objectives of this program are to: (i) enhance the development impact of domestic policies and
development partner interventions through better knowledge of socio-economic realities as well as
political economy constraints; (ii) promote basic accountability through better information on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

availability and use of public resources; and, (iii) revitalize the strategic planning process. SKOPE
activities fall under three broad components: (i) collecting and analyzing data, as well as developing
TA-related activities; (ii) understanding political economy constraints; and (iii) supporting strategic
planning at federal and regional levels.
9.
Public Financial Management Capacity Strengthening, Phase I: Funded by the SPF, the
objective of this project is to establish systems for more transparent and accountable management
and use of public funds in Somalia. Effective since early 2014, the project was launched as a pilot to
lay the foundations for a larger scale public financial management program supported through the
MPF. The project focuses on public financial management reform oversight, piloting one Financial
Management Information System, and establishing expenditure control, procurement, accounting,
and reporting systems.
10.
ICT Sector Support, Phase I: Funded by the SPF, the objective of this pilot project is to:
(i) lay foundations for a larger scale program under the MP; and, (ii) contribute towards the process
of developing a regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector and building an ICT
infrastructure in Somalia. The project focuses on supporting open access to international bandwidth
and setting up communication rooms and facilities for government.

Recurrent Cost and Reform Financing (RCRF) Program, Phase II: The objective of the
RCRF is to support the government to provide credible and sustainable payroll and to establish the
foundation for efficient budget execution and payment systems for the non-security sectors in the
FGS and eligible sub-national authorities. Phase II, starting in 2015, will consolidate the gains made
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

under the recently closed Phase I project, and will strengthen macro-fiscal management, central
bank reform, and potential target support to expanded social service delivery. Phase II will also
explore options for the expansion of recurrent cost support to regional governments.
12.
The Somali Core Economic Institutions and Opportunities (SCORE) Program: The
objective of the SCORE program, which expands work previously undertaken through Som-PREP II,
is to support select core economic institutions linked to trade, financial sector, and private sector
development in order to catalyze inward investment and job creation. The project components are:
strengthening core institutions in three critical areas of the economy (central banking, the Ministries
of Commerce and Industry, and local port and customs authorities). The second component will
focus on expanding economic opportunities by providing direct support to the private sector—
through technical assistance and grants—to expand economic opportunities in the country.
13.
Capacity Injection Project: The objective of this project is to enable the government fill
critical capacity gaps in the civil service, and strengthen the capacity of key ministries and agencies
to perform core government functions. Project components cover: (i) developing capacity for key
cross-cutting government functions; (ii) strengthening the policies and procedures for civil service
management; and, (iii) aiding policy management, coordination and monitoring capabilities at the
center of government.
14.
Public Financial Management Strengthening Project, Phase II: The objective of the
project is to establish systems for transparent and accountable public funds management, building
on the work launched under Phase I. It focuses on the implementation of medium-term fiscal
frameworks to underpin: (i) planning budget preparation; (ii) managing revenue mobilization and tax
administration; (iii) developing Somalia’s financial management information system; (iv) managing
expenditure control; (v) overseeing procurement, accounting and financial reporting; (vi) conducting
auditing and monitoring; and, (vi) establishing structures to oversee public financial management
reforms in Somalia.
15.
ICT Sector Support in Somalia, Phase II: The objective of the project, continuing from
Phase I, is to support the ICT Sector in Somalia by contributing to establish an enabling environment
and by encouraging efficiency and equity in access to connectivity. The program aims to allow the
ICT sector grow and support connectivity benefits to the government and the citizens. The scope of
the work will combine technical assistance, and provision of goods (e.g. communications rooms in
ministries), and services (e.g. connectivity and bandwidth support for the higher education).
16.
Somali Urban Investment Planning Project (SUIPP) and Somalia Urban Development
Project (SUDP): The objective of SUIPP is to support feasibility studies and preliminary design work
for a MPF-funded operation targeted at urban infrastructure investment and institutional
strengthening in southern Somalia, Puntland and Somaliland, as well as the provision of technical
assistance to government agencies to assist them prepare and implement these activities.
17.
Somalia Power Sector Development Master Plan: The objective of the program is to
support the building blocks for the establishment of a modern energy sector in Somalia. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

SOMALIA

components of the program are: (i) developing a master plan that sets out priorities and investment
sequencing in generation, transmission and generation over a 20-year period, and delivers detailed
electrical infrastructure development plans for a number of urban areas; (ii) preparing a “Lighting
Africa Somalia” investment; and, (iii) developing a renewable energy resource map for Somalia.
18.
Somalia Towage Services in Berbera Port: The objective of the project is to support the
development of the Berbera Port by improving throughput, towage capacity and reliability of
towage services.
19.
Water for Agro-Pastoral Livelihoods Pilot Project: The objective of the project is to build
the government to implement small-scale water interventions to provide safe water for human
consumption and sufficient quantities of water for livestock as inputs to enhancing fodder and
agricultural production in targeted arid lands of Somaliland and Puntland. This will be done by
piloting the development and implementation of under-utilized rural water supply technologies.
Economic and Sector Work
20.
Statistical Strengthening and Socio-Economic Data Collection: The last nationally
representative household surveys providing information on household income, consumption and
poverty were conducted in 1985. The World Bank program has worked to address these data gaps
in Somaliland, Puntland and Mogadishu. The 2012 Somaliland Enterprise and Household Surveys
provided data to produce a poverty assessment; private sector studies; and a CPI base weights and
estimates of GDP. In Mogadishu, the World Bank and the Somali Department of Statistics (under the
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation), have successfully implemented the first set of
an innovative high-frequency computer assisted household survey that will provide vital household
expenditure, socioeconomic and peace and state-building goal data. The instrument is tailored to
collect data quickly, in highly insecure settings, and is designed to work in tandem with new
econometric techniques to produce a reliable poverty profile and CPI base weights. The World Bank
will support the roll-out throughout Somalia of household surveys—combining high frequency
surveys and more standard household surveys—to provide regular poverty, social and process data,
as well as other relevant information that can be gathered through that instruments. This work will
also support poverty assessments and other poverty analytical studies made possible by the data
collection exercises.
21.
Policies and Institutions for Economic Growth: The World Bank is conducting a source of
growth study, with a view to establish a consensus between the government and its partners on
priority policies and public investment to enable strong inclusive growth. The work will also support
analysis and technical assistance in areas related to private investment, trade, and sectors
contributing to growth. This work will also support the building of core capacity of government to
design and implement economic development polices.
22.
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Planning: The World Bank is working with relevant ministries to
support the development of a simple macro-fiscal framework with clear linkages to the annual
planning and budgeting process, as well as a simple public investment management framework

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOMALIA

covering financing modalities and time horizons, that would inform national planning and enable
the FGS to improve the appraisal and evaluation of capital investments.
23.
Policy Engagement on Revenue Mobilization, Natural Resource Management and
Inter-governmental Fiscal Relations: The World Bank plans to undertake an analysis to generate a
better understanding of the Somali economy and potential sources for maximizing revenue
generation. The work will focus on policy related issues and areas for advisory work, including
supporting licensing and regulatory frameworks for telecommunications, ports management, ICT
and the extractive industries. This will also include technical support on revenue management
options for natural resource revenues. Inter-governmental fiscal relations engagement initially
focuses on sharing relevant international experience with the government.
24.
Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs): The World Bank is supporting the production of
regular PERs at both the federal and regional level, with the goal of closely monitoring the evolution
of macro-fiscal and budgetary trends, and providing the underlying analysis for the Recurrent Cost
and Reform Project. The World Bank has also supported a Security and Justice Public Expenditure
Review as a joint exercise with the UN. This PER aims to unpack the fiscal implications of the current
response to the threats facing Somalia, and the long term implications by offering a data-driven and
evidence-based analysis, not only of revenues and expenditures of the security sector, but of the
violence and insecurity Somalia is facing.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK6
(As of June 30, 2015)
25.
The 2013-15 Somalia Country Brief (CB) was approved by the African Development
Bank’s (AfDB) board of directors in April 2013. The CB laid out a scaled-up program
reengagement with Somalia. The strategic areas of reengagement include: (i) strengthening
governance and institutional capacity; (ii) supporting the re-engagement process of Somalia with the
international financial community, through a comprehensive program of arrears clearance and debt
relief; (iii) including Somalia in the AfDB’s regional “Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihood
Programme” (DRSLP); and, (iv) developing infrastructure planning to support the recovery process.
26.
The AfDB Somalia Infrastructure Trust Fund (SITF) is currently being prepared.
Following the AFDB’s board approval, the trust fund is expected to be operational by the fourth
quarter of 2015. The SITF has a medium to longer-term perspective and will focus on infrastructure
reconstruction and development, which is aligned with the Peace and State Building Goal 4 (or
PSG 4).7 The bulk of activities financed by the SITF will be core infrastructure investment projects in
the energy, transport, water, sanitation and ICT sectors. The SITF will also support capacity building,
as well as financing and governance activities related to the infrastructure reconstruction program.
27.
The AfDB has had 12 operations in Somalia since 2013. Of these, two operations are now
finished, nine are national operations, and one is a regional project. The current net commitment is
UA 21.7 million, equivalent to about US$33 million. The AfDB’s ongoing portfolio in Somalia
comprises many small sized operations, with an average project size of UA 2.17 million. The
portfolios average age is 1 year, with a cumulative disbursement rate of 3.75 percent. A brief
description of the projects is provided below:


The AfDB (in partnership with a host of UN agencies and bilateral donors, and through UNFPA
implementation), contributed about US$ 0.5million (of a total cost of US$6.18million) to fund the
Population Estimation Survey for Somalia (PESS) project. In May 2015, the official findings
from the PESS were released (e.g. 75 percent and 46 percent of Somalis are below the ages of
30 and 15 respectively). The PESS is supposed to assist the FGS and donors in establishing a
platform for compiling data and information on Somalia’s socio-economic and poverty baselines;
pave the way for an official Census in 2016; and, support the monitoring of progress towards
attaining the MDGs.



The AfDB has played a key role in supporting Somalia’s re-engagement with international
financial institutions (IFIs), particularly through the preparation for arrears clearance, access to

The Somali New Deal Compact (2014-2016) including the Somaliland Special Arrangement1, outlines Somalia’s key government
priorities within five Peace and State Building Goals (PSGs). These are: PSG 1 (Inclusive Politics); PSG 2: (security); PSG 3 (justice),
PSG 4 (economic foundations); and PSG 5 (revenue and services).

HIPC/MDRI debt relief, and building debt management capacity. AfDB’s TA has supported the
reconstruction of Somalia’s external debt data, including the setting up and initial capacity
(including systems and staff) of a debt management unit in the ministry of finance; and, initial
work in developing a strategy for arrears clearance and access to HIPC/MDRI debt relief. The
AfDB is currently in Phase 2 of this program.


The AfDB is supporting the development of statistical capacity in all regions of Somalia. The UA
0.35 million Somaliland Statistical Capacity Building Project, is currently ongoing. A similar
project has also been designed for Puntland. Discussions are being held to develop a
comparable project with the FGS. The AfDB is also represented on the High Level Task Force
(HLTF) for Statistics in Somalia.8 The HLTF focuses on statistical capacity building and data
gathering for the development of an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP),
establishment of an IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), and monitoring of the Peace and State
Building Goals (PSGs) under the Somali Compact. Through its participation in the HLTF, the
AfDB is assessing further options to provide statistical capacity building support in Somalia.



Through the Economic and Financial Governance Institutional Support Project (EFGISP), the
AfDB is helping strengthen macroeconomic and financial management in Somalia. By setting up
an improved macroeconomic and budget framework, the AfDB intends to enhance fiscal
discipline of the FGS, and, ultimately, the strategic and efficient allocation and use of public
resources. Furthermore, the AfDB is playing a lead role through the FGC in implementing the
Financial Governance Program. The AfDB has also provided TA to the ministry of finance in
building capacity for aid coordination.



Since September 1, 2014, the AfDB’s African Legal Support Facility placed a senior legal expert in
the FGS to provide legal advisory services to the government in connection to complex
commercial negotiations relating to, inter alia, infrastructure, loans, and natural resources. This
support will include placing systems, providing capacity building services to government officials,
and working on the negotiations of government contracts.



The Somalia Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Programme (DRSLP) is part of
Phase II of the AfDB’s broader initiative to provide support to the drought and famine stricken
countries in the Horn of Africa, and build their sustained and long-term resilience. The main
components of the DRSLP are: (i) water and natural resource development and management;
(ii) livestock infrastructure for market access; and, (iii) capacity building. Funds for the Somalia
DRSLP are grants from the Transition Support Department Pillar I (UA 5 million) and the Regional
Operations (RO) window (UA 10 million) for a total project of UA 15 million. In view of Somalia’s
external debt arrears situation, the FGS cannot administer resources from the RO window and,
thus, requires a third party to administer the resources on its behalf (as per AfDB’s rules and

partners and relevant Somali institutions.

regulations). Thus, the FGS, with the endorsement of Puntland and Somaliland, have selected
IGAD to administer the RO resources.


14

On the knowledge front, the AfDB conducted the Infrastructure Needs Assessments (INA) in
the energy, transport, water and sanitation and ICT sectors. These assessments are key
deliverables in the government’s Economic Recovery Plan 2014-15. The ultimate goal is to
develop a Somalia Infrastructure Action Plan, which will: (i) assist the government in building
an initial project pipeline for the proposed AfDB Multi-Partner Somalia Infrastructure Trust
Fund; (ii) provide input into the preparation of Somalia’s i-PRSP; and, (iii) assist in the broad
planning, prioritization and resource mobilization for infrastructure interventions. The ICT
assessment has been completed and validated. The water and sanitation assessment is expected
to be validated in the second quarter of 2015. A final draft of the energy assessment has been
distributed to the FGS, and will be validated at a workshop in August 2015. The transport
assessment is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015. The AfDb continues to play
a leadership role in the infrastructure sector by chairing the PSG 4 Sub-working Group on
Infrastructure, and engaging with federal and regional governments to rationalise priority
infrastructure projects. This has allowed the AfDB to take a leadership role in guiding the
reconstruction and development of Somalia’s infrastructure.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 30, 2015)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance caused by
institutional weaknesses, lack of source data, and agencies having unclear and overlapping responsibilities.
Somalia is rebuilding its macroeconomic statistics after several decades of civil war. The Statistics Law from
1970 remains in effect and is being updated to reflect current conditions and requirements. An impressive
achievement is a time series of average monthly prices for several markets in Mogadishu covering several
years. State and local authorities also independently produce some statistics for their region while
coordination arrangements are being established. A multisector mission was conducted in May 2015 to
assess the status and development plans for macro economic statistics. It affirmed work begun by the
authorities to develop a strategic plan to guide development of the national statistical system and identified
technical assistance requirements over the coming years. Somalia intends to commence reporting of basic
IFS data to the IMF as they become available.
National Accounts: A modeled time series for annual GDP has been compiled since 2012. Results are largely
dependent upon qualitative assessments of the authorities and broad assumptions applied to limited data.
Estimates for government final consumption expenditure are derived from the FGS accounts and
assumptions regarding the relative size of the general government sector. Estimates for capital formation are
based upon product detail within counterparty data, assumptions about undercoverage, and value added by
Somali resident units. A household expenditure survey has been conducted in Somaliland and used to
estimate average daily household final consumption expenditure of US$1.60 per day. A household survey in
Mogadishu will begin in late 2015 and may result in substantial revisions.
Price Statistics: The FGS began to compile a new experimental Consumer Price Index (CPI) following an IMF
mission in January 2015. An expanded basket of 312 items with weights based on expenditure shares derived
from other African countries was introduced. When results from the household expenditure survey for
Mogadishu are finalized (which should occur in 2016) TA will be provided to introduce new weights and to
improve price collection procedures. Somalia does not have a producer price index (PPI).
Government Finance Statistics: FGS commenced use of an automated financial management information
system during 2015 to replace the previous manual recording. A mapping between the underlying chart of
accounts and GFS items is being developed and is expected to enable production of preliminary GFS
estimates for budgetary central government during 2015. The authorities have commenced negotiations to
obtain appropriate financial data from state/local units to produce comprehensive estimates for Somalia’s
general government sector. Somalia does not currently have any significant public trading enterprises.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The significance of monetary statistics is limited by the ambiguous status
of the Somali shilling. The CBS is currently finalizing the relationship between its accounts and the MFS
aggregates and expected to produce monetary statistics for this subsector by the end of 2015. Statistics for
the remaining subsectors will be produced as regulatory and reporting arrangements for Somalia’s financial
institutions are established over coming months.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SOMALIA

Financial sector surveillance: Negligible data will be available for financial sector surveillance until
regulatory arrangements are implemented. The authorities are beginning to collect basic balance sheet data
from several financial institutions.
External sector statistics: A modeled time series for annual Balance of Payments has been compiled since
2013. Results are largely dependent upon qualitative assessments of the authorities and broad assumptions
applied to existing data. Estimates for imports and exports of goods and services are based upon
counterparty data and assumptions about undercoverage. The Somalia’s Customs Directorate has agreed to
start to collect data on the value of exports and imports that can be used to estimate values of trade in
goods. Model-based estimates for remittances and foreign direct investment will be replaced by source data
as regulatory and reporting arrangements are established. While Somalia does not compile comprehensive
estimates for International Investment Position, data are compiled by the World Bank on the liabilities of
Somalia’s general government to the rest of the world. An estimate of Somalia’s reserves will be available
when balance sheet data from the CBS are audited and published.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By:

Prepared by MCD

Adnan Mazarei
(MCD) and Ranil
Salgado (SPR)

1.
Staff wishes to highlight developments since the staff report was circulated to the
Executive Board on July 8, 2015. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
The authorities have produced a revised budget for 2015 that will avoid new
arrears. On July 19, an extraordinary session of the Cabinet, chaired by the President,
approved and sent to Parliament a revised budget for 2015. The budget revision contains
significant measures to reduce spending and raise taxes. Our preliminary analysis is that
these measures should yield $66 million on a full-year basis, equivalent to 33 percent of
revised expenditure for 2015. The key measures are: (i) a sharp reduction in allowances
for the military and police; (ii) cuts in spending on goods and services; (iii) a significant
reduction in civil service salaries and allowances; and, (iv) substantial new taxes on
allowances for parliamentarians. With these strengthening of revenue efforts, staff
believes that the revised budget for 2015 could be implemented without incurring new
arrears.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Somalia,
and Mr. Tlelima, Adivsor to the Executive Director
July 27, 2015

Context
Somalia is a country in a fragile situation as a result of years of civil war, coupled with the
still challenging political and security situation. The government and the people of Somalia
have started a rebuilding process, with invaluable support by the international community.
Against this backdrop, the authorities view the reengagement with the Fund as a pivotal
aspect of their efforts to rebuild their institutions, infrastructure and the human resource
capacity, to give the Somali people hope for a better future.
While Somalia’s relations with the IMF have been restored, the country is still facing
tremendous challenges. Arrears accumulated during years of conflict have impaired
Somalia’s ability to service its external debt, while rendering the country ineligible for the
much needed IMF financial assistance. In addition, the political and security environment has
slowed the rebuilding progress. As a result, the country’s recovery process is not expected to
be easy. However, with support from the international community, our Somali authorities are
determined to forge ahead with the necessary reforms.
Against this background, the Somali authorities highly appreciate the Fund’s efforts in the
form of technical assistance (TA) and policy advice extended to Somalia since 2013. In the
context of the current Article IV Consultation, the first since 1989, the authorities welcome
the constructive dialogue with the Fund staff. They remain hopeful that this marks the
beginning of increased engagement that would culminate in arrears’ clearance and, ultimately
debt relief. They see a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) as a possible avenue, not only to give
hope to the Somali people but also help to change perceptions about the country; and
demonstrate the authorities’ commitment to address the challenges they are facing.
Recent Developments
Analysis of economic activity remains severely constrained by lack of data. However, this
area is receiving due attention through TA by the Fund under the “Trust Fund for Capacity
Development in Macroeconomic Policies and Statistics for Somalia” that was launched in
February 2015. In the meantime, the authorities appreciate staff’s assessment of the
Somali economic developments based on incomplete information, indicating some
expansion in real GDP and low inflation.

2

Policy Issues and Challenges
Given the unique challenges facing Somalia, the authorities share the staff’s assessment that
concerted efforts are needed to build capacity and institutions for sustainable and inclusive
growth. Despite improvements in some of the state institutions, more still needs to be done,
especially, to strengthen capacity in the key macroeconomic areas including fiscal and public
financial management; central banking, and financial sector regulation and supervision; and
statistics. The authorities remain committed to changing Somalia’s fortunes. With the support
they are receiving from the international development partners, including the African
Development Bank, the IMF, and the World Bank, they are confident of achieving their goal.
Fiscal policy: The authorities acknowledge the importance of strengthening the budget
process by ensuring that expenditure commitments are in line with available resources.
However, it is important to note that while the authorities engage in rebuilding their capacity
to mobilize domestic revenues, Somalia continues to rely crucially on donor funding. In this
context, the authorities and the development partners have expressed the need to improve
coordination, to ensure that all financial assistance is channeled through the Ministry of
Finance. In the meantime, Somalia is receiving invaluable TA support from the IMF and the
World Bank in public financial management and various aspects of fiscal policy, including
budget preparation and execution, and tax policy, which are expected to provide a lasting
solution in this area.
Monetary and exchange rate policy framework: The Somali authorities agree that, despite
progress made through previous TA and training, more needs to be done to capacitate the
Central Bank of Somalia to carry out its mandate. One of the key critical areas is currency
issuance. Although the CBS is by law responsible for issuing the national currency, no bank
notes have been issued since 1991, leaving the economy predominantly dollarized and in an
unregulated environment as a legacy of the decades’ long civil conflict. This has created a
shortage of currency, to the detriment of the majority of Somalis. In turn, it is increasing
pressure for the CBS to undertake currency reforms, despite capacity constraints that are
being addressed with IMF TA support. In this context, the Fund has an important role to play
in assisting the CBS to develop a roadmap towards reforms, in addition to the ongoing
training and capacity building.
External Debt: Somalia’s external debt, estimated at more than 90 percent of GDP at end2014, has become a binding constraint to the country’s development agenda. The authorities
agree with the staff’s assessment that Somalia lacks the ability to service its debt in the
medium term. With the help of the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Somalia’s Debt, the
Somali authorities are working towards a pathway to arrears’ clearance and eventual debt
relief. The TWG on Somalia’s Debt was established after the Federal Government of
Somalia agreed with the international partners at the Brussels Conference in 2013 to create a
forum to discuss issues related to Somalia’s debt. It is open to all major official creditors to
Somalia and is co-chaired by the IMF mission Chief, the World Bank’s Country Director,
and Somalia’s Minister of Finance.

3

Conclusions
The Somali authorities remain committed to changing Somalia’s fortunes. They have
earnestly started the process of rebuilding their institutions, infrastructure and the human
resource capacity, in an effort to revive Somalia’s economy and improve the lives of its
nationals. With the highly appreciated assistance from the international community, notably,
the African Development Bank, the IMF and the World Bank, much progress has been
achieved to date. However, more still needs to be done. In this context, continued support by
the international community remains critical.
