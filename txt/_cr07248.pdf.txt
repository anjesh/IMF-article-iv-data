Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Michael T. Hadjimichael
June 27, 2007
•

Discussions. Article IV consultation discussions were held during April 30–May 15 with,
among others: President Morales, Finance Minister Arce and other senior government officials;
CBB President Raúl Garrón; opposition leaders; key embassies; representatives of the private
and financial sectors; and with social movements. The mission team comprised Messrs. Furtado
(head), Cerutti, Mansilla, and Vesperoni (resident representative); and Ms. Jaramillo-Mayor (all
WHD); Mr. Cortavarria-Checkley (MCM); Mr. Dodzin (PDR); and Mr. Simone (FAD).
Mr. Singh joined the mission during May 10–11.

•

Political setting. Bolivia’s political environment remains complex. While President Morales
enjoys strong public support, the Senate and six out of nine Bolivian departments are controlled
by the opposition. In addition, uncertainties related to the ongoing constituent assembly further
complicate the political context. There is a possibility of early general elections in 2008.

•

Economic setting and key policy issues. Macroeconomic developments continue to be
positive. Large export windfalls in hydrocarbons and mining have been reflected in record-high
international reserves, 4½ percent real GDP growth, and sizable fiscal surpluses. However,
inflation has picked up in recent months, suggesting the need for combining the maintenance of
a significant fiscal surplus with greater exchange rate flexibility. Moreover, the investment
climate should be made more conducive to a recovery in private investment, critically needed
for higher medium-term growth and increased living standards.

•

MDRI. Since the last Article IV consultation, Bolivia has benefited from further debt reduction
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. This comprised US$1.2 billion in debt relief from
the Inter-American Development Bank, equivalent to 10 percent of the GDP or about one-third
of the stock of debt outstanding at end-2006. The total reduction of Bolivia’s debt under the
MDRI thus amounted to US$2.9 billion, equivalent to about 25 percent of GDP.

•

Fund relations. Bolivia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on current international payments and transfers, and
there are no significant controls on capital flows. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on July 17, 2006. The latest Stand-By Arrangement expired on March 31, 2006.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Over the last two years, the economy has benefited from large export windfalls in
hydrocarbons and mining. Real GDP growth has been around 4–4½ percent, the
external current account has recorded large surpluses, and NIR have risen to historically
high levels. The fiscal position has shifted into a substantial surplus and public debt has
been substantially reduced. Financial sector stability has improved, though dollarization
is still high. These trends are projected broadly to continue in the period ahead.

•

However, inflation has picked up in recent months, partly due to rapid monetary
expansion. The Central Bank has stepped up open market operations, though policy
interest rates have reacted only mildly, and has appreciated the Boliviano, albeit
modestly. Inflation is projected to remain in the range of 6–7 percent through the end of
the year, with continued NIR accumulation contributing to inflationary pressures.

•

The high priority attached by the authorities to maintaining a fiscal surplus is
welcome. This is key for managing the inflationary pressures associated with large
hydrocarbons-based external receipts. However, maintaining a surplus will demand
considerable control over expenditure, including at the subnational level.

•

On the structural front, reforms are needed to make the budget a more effective
developmental and poverty-reducing tool. The authorities are encouraged to reduce the
large and poorly targeted hydrocarbon product subsidies, as well as to improve the tax
system, intergovernmental relations, and the budget process. The authorities felt that
action on this front would have to await the outcome of the constitutional assembly.

•

Given the strength of the balance of payments, evidence of inflationary pressures,
and indications that the Boliviano is undervalued, it will be important to
incorporate greater exchange rate flexibility into the policy mix. In the short run, this
can be achieved under the existing exchange rate regime through a more rapid pace of
nominal appreciation. The authorities were open to the possibility of transitioning to a
more flexible exchange rate regime over time.

•

Efforts to address remaining financial sector vulnerabilities should be intensified.
Priority areas of reform include the adoption of prudential regulations to mitigate market
risk and credit risks from dollarization; and of legislation governing corporate
bankruptcy/restructuring. Exchange rate appreciation will also help reduce dollarization.

•

Even though social indicators have improved in recent years, Bolivia’s levels of
poverty and inequality are persistently high. In 2005, extreme poverty amounted to
37 percent of the population, while absolute poverty reached 60 percent. Also, income
inequality was among the highest in the region. As less than 2 percent of employment is
in the leading hydrocarbons and mining sectors, growth in recent years has contributed
only marginally to poverty reduction.

•

To underpin sustained growth, it is imperative to develop policies that lead to a
recovery in private investment. Such an increase would require improvements in the
investment climate, which would benefit from greater legal/institutional stability. In
particular, the government’s nationalization policy should be implemented through
mutually acceptable arrangements with private investors. In the key hydrocarbons sector,
the authorities should seek to consolidate the recently negotiated framework and to
secure early agreement on critically needed new investments.

I. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SETTING
1.
The economy has continued to benefit from rising natural gas export volumes,
which has been compounded, over the last two years, by high hydrocarbons and mining
export prices. Real GDP growth has been around 4–4½ percent, mainly driven by an
expansion in hydrocarbons and mining-related activities. The external current account has
recorded large surpluses (12 percent of GDP in 2006), and NIR have risen to historically high
levels (exceeding US$3.8 billion as of end-May 2007).
2.
The fiscal position has
improved sharply and—reflecting
also debt relief under the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)—
Bolivia’s public debt has declined
markedly. Over the five-year period
2002–06, the overall fiscal position
shifted from a deficit of about 9 percent
of GDP to a surplus of about
4½ percent of GDP. While part of the
improvement corresponds to higher
hydrocarbons-based revenue (about
8 percent of GDP) other revenue has
increased1 and expenditure growth has
been contained, including for wages
and salaries. MDRI debt relief has
helped reduce Bolivia’s total public
debt, from about 70 percent of GDP in
2005 to about 35 percent of GDP in
2007.

up in recent months, due in part to
negative supply shocks but also to rapid monetary expansion. Twelve-month inflation
rose from 4½ percent in September 2006 to 7 percent in March 2007, the highest inflation
level observed since 1998, and remains at about 6 ½ percent. While part of the recent price
increases has been associated with floods and one-time adjustments in some administered
prices, both core and headline inflation have displayed an upward trend since the last quarter

The increase appears to reflect both past improvements in tax administration and, more recently, a shift in
taxpayer behavior towards greater compliance.

of 2006, driven by higher prices of nontradable goods and services. Accordingly, the pick-up
in inflation trends may be attributed in part to the strong and only partially sterilized NIR
accumulation, which has driven the high growth in base money over the past two years. The
Central Bank has responded to rising price pressures by increasing its open market operations
and by appreciating the Boliviano against the U.S. dollar under the crawling peg regime.
However, policy interest rates have reacted only mildly to the monetary tightening while the
nominal appreciations have been very modest, leaving Bolivia’s real effective exchange rate
broadly flat after a substantial depreciation during 2003–04 (Box 1).2

Financial sector stability has improved, with comfortable levels of liquidity and
full NFA coverage of deposits, although vulnerabilities remain. Credit risk is still high as
restructured but performing loans (about 90 percent of capital) may deteriorate. Moreover,
some banks might need to build additional provisioning over time to offset potential losses
arising from the unprovisioned portion of nonperforming loans (about 9 percent of capital).
Furthermore, despite some decline, dollarization still remains among the highest in the region,
with the financial system considerably exposed to credit risk from unhedged borrowers.

Box 1. Bolivia: Exchange Rate Regime
•

For many years, the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) has followed a crawling peg
exchange rate regime. Beginning in 1985, when the official and parallel exchange rates were
unified, the BCB adopted a crawling peg exchange rate regime without a preannounced path.
The crawling peg was a main pillar of the macroeconomic policies that, following
hyperinflation in the mid-1980s, succeeded in further reducing inflation, from double digits in
the late 1980s, to an average of 4½ percent in recent years. Despite numerous external shocks,
political crises, and deposit runs, the crawling peg was successful in maintaining a competitive
exchange rate while keeping balance sheet effects manageable in the context of the highly
dollarized environment.

•

The BCB is the dominant player in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange is
provided to the financial system at the official exchange rate through an auction system, the
Bolsín, with sales by the BCB of up to US$15 million per day. Meanwhile, the central bank
stands ready to purchase any amount of foreign exchange offered by the financial system at
the official rate. The BCB implements periodic adjustments to the official exchange rate
taking into account the financial system’s demand for foreign exchange in relation to the size
of the Bolsín. With a view to stimulating the interbank market, the BCB has gradually
increased its buy-sell spread, from 2 to 10 cents, with only modest results thus far.

•

Since mid-2005, in the context of a strong balance of payments, the central bank has
been appreciating the Boliviano modestly under the existing exchange rate arrangement,
which has become a de facto peg. Demand for foreign exchange from the financial system
through the Bolsín disappeared completely since June 2005, while central bank foreign
exchange purchases surged by US$2.5 billion between June 2005 and May 2007. Against this
backdrop, the BCB reversed the direction of the crawl of the exchange rate in July 2005 and
has since then been appreciating the exchange rate. However, the modest pace of appreciation
(only 2.7 percent against the U.S. dollar since July 2005, to Bs7.85 per U.S. dollar) has led the
Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department to reclassify Bolivia’s exchange rate
regime as a de facto peg.

Hydrocarbons regime and investment climate
5.
Significant changes in hydrocarbons policy have been implemented over the last
two years, resulting in a higher government tax take and a greater public sector role in
the sector. Following a national referendum in August 2004, a new hydrocarbons law was
enacted in May 2005 and a related decree issued in May 2006. The main effects of the new
legislation have been: (a) a “migration” of the contracts with the foreign companies operating
in Bolivia, from risk-sharing contracts to an arrangement whereby all production is
surrendered to the state energy company YPFB, which has been made the country’s sole
exporter of natural gas; (b) a permanent increase in natural gas royalties, from 18 percent to
50 percent of turnover;3 and (c) a requirement that YPFB regain control over the five
hydrocarbons companies that were privatized in the 1990s. While the transition to new service
contracts has recently been completed, only one of the five companies targeted for
nationalization (i.e., the company in charge of the country’s two oil refineries, formerly
owned by Brazil’s Petrobras) has thus far returned to YPFB control.
6.
Following a boom in the late 1990s, which included large-scale privatization,
private investment levels in Bolivia have been depressed in the past few years. This has
been associated in part with the protracted political crisis of 2003–05 and with the
uncertainties arising from the changes in the hydrocarbons regime during 2005–06. While
there has been significant FDI in the mining sector and public sector investment has
increased, this has not been enough to overcome the fall in other private investment, notably
in foreign hydrocarbons-related investment. As a result, Bolivia’s overall investment-to-GDP
ratio, as well as the share of private investment in total investment, are among the lowest in
the region (Box 2).
Poverty and inequality
7.
Even though social indicators have improved in recent years, Bolivia’s levels of
poverty and inequality are persistently high. In 2005, extreme poverty amounted to
37 percent of the population, while absolute poverty reached 60 percent. Also, income
inequality was among the highest in the region. As less than 2 percent of employment is in the
leading hydrocarbons and mining sectors, growth in recent years has contributed only
marginally to poverty reduction. Although Bolivia will be able to meet some of the
Millennium Development Goals (e.g., child mortality, maternal health, gender equality, and
water and sanitation), achievement of other goals by 2015, such as those of eliminating
extreme poverty and universal primary education, remains a significant challenge.

3

The distribution of the post-royalty revenue between the service operators and YPFB is governed by an agreed
contractual formula for each gas field, which takes into account, inter alia, investment-related costs and the
production level.

8

Box 2. Bolivia: Trends in Aggregate Investment
•

As a result of depressed private investment, the overall levels of investment in Bolivia
have been very low in recent years, amounting to only 12 percent of GDP in 2006—the
lowest ratio in the Latin American region. This contrasts with the late 1990s, when the
privatization program contributed an investment peak of about 20 percent of GDP, reflecting
both strong FDI and domestic investment. In recent years, there has been an increase in
public investment but this has not been enough to offset the fall in private investment.

•

Investment activity has therefore been dominated by the public sector, whose
investment outlays are high by regional standards, in both relative and absolute terms.
In 2006, Bolivia’s public investment was about 6½ percent of GDP, one of the highest ratios
in the region. The ratio of private to public investment in Bolivia is about 90 percent. Most
countries in the region exhibit higher and increasing ratios.

•

In this environment, a major recovery in private investment would appear to be a precondition for higher and sustainable growth over the medium term. According to recent
entrepreneurs’ surveys, the main factors that would need to be addressed to promote such a
recovery include: (a) political/institutional uncertainty; (b) red tape; (c) inefficiencies in the
judicial system; and (d) inadequate infrastructure.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
With the sharp turnaround in the balance of payments and fiscal position in
recent years, vulnerabilities in Bolivia have shifted, and the discussions covered policies
needed to manage hydrocarbons wealth so as to promote medium-term growth and
intergenerational equity, while containing inflation. In particular, discussions focused on
policies to contain inflationary pressures arising from the strong external position, and to
revive private investment activity to underpin higher and sustainable growth. There was
agreement that, to contain inflation, the fiscal position should remain in surplus, the pace of
appreciation under the crawling peg should be stepped up, and open market operations should
be expanded. There was also broad agreement on the thrust of fiscal structural reforms. There
was less agreement, however, on the policy adjustments to promote higher investment and
growth over the medium term, with the mission emphasizing the need for improvements in
the investment climate and the authorities expressing confidence that private investment

9
would be forthcoming and/or appropriately supplemented by state-led investments, including
in association with friendly governments.
A. Short-Term Outlook
9.
The key economic trends of the past year are projected broadly to continue in the
period ahead, although with a somewhat lower fiscal surplus. In 2007, real GDP growth is
projected to remain driven mainly by the boom in mining and hydrocarbons, but to slow
somewhat to 4 percent as agricultural output has been reduced by floods. The fiscal surplus is
projected to decline to 1 percent of GDP reflecting an increase in capital expenditure (partly
payments for nationalized refineries) and a reduction in hydrocarbons revenue related to the
implementation of the new contracts with hydrocarbons companies, which have recently come
into effect.4 The external current account surplus is projected at close to 9 percent of GDP,
which would translate into a further rise in NIR, to US$4.3 billion. Twelve-month inflation is
projected to remain in the range of 6–7 percent through the end of the year, with projected
increases in government spending in the second half of the year and continued NIR growth
contributing to inflationary pressures (Table 1).
B. Fiscal Policy
10.
The mission argued that an overall fiscal surplus should be maintained to protect
macroeconomic stability and facilitate monetary management in light of the potential
for continued high current account surpluses over the medium term. In particular, the
mission suggested that the authorities consider carefully the desirability of the sharp increases
in public expenditure budgeted for 2007 and envisaged under the National Development Plan
(averaging 14 percent of GDP in 2007–12, compared with 10½ percent of GDP in 2006). The
mission argued that the case for a more prudent fiscal stance was also motivated by the need
to entrench savings out of the windfall to guard against the risk of a weakening of
hydrocarbons-based revenue (11 percent of GDP in 2007) over the medium term, as well as
by long-term intergenerational equity considerations.5 The authorities indicated their intention
to maintain a prudent fiscal position, pointing out that current expenditure was being kept
under control and that investment outlays would in practice be consistent with maintenance of
fiscal surpluses in the range of 1–2 percent of GDP in 2007 and over the medium term
(Table 2). The mission inquired about the fiscal authorities’ ability to avoid expenditure
increases, particularly by subnational governments, which have accumulated a large stock of
deposits at the central bank. The authorities affirmed their resolve to contain the growth of
central government expenditure and explained that subnational spending had to be undertaken
in the context of the national budget. They noted that their ability to monitor compliance with
the budget framework was being strengthened through improvements in information systems.
Structural fiscal issues
11.
The mission discussed reforms to improve the efficiency and equity of the tax
system, and to raise the effectiveness of government spending, which are needed to

Selected Issues Paper.

10
underpin the fiscal position over the medium term and make the budget an effective
anti-poverty tool. The staff’s main proposals were to reduce explicit and implicit
hydrocarbons subsidies (currently estimated at 6–7 percent of GDP) gradually while
compensating the poor through targeted assistance; to reform the tax system (including by
introducing a personal income tax with a high exemption threshold);6 to approve a budget
framework law; and to address the weaknesses in intergovernmental fiscal relations system. In
addition to strengthening the institutional environment for the conduct of fiscal policy, these
reforms would release fiscal resources, which could be used to finance targeted public
spending programs for the poor and/or to strengthen the fiscal surplus. The authorities agreed
with the thrust of the reforms discussed but felt that action on this front would have to await
the outcome of the constitutional assembly. In addition, the authorities felt that the reduction
in fuel subsidies should wait until envisaged increases in natural gas production allowed for
some shift in domestic consumption away from petroleum and into gas products.
12.
The mission urged caution on pension reform, emphasizing the need to analyze
carefully the budgetary implications of possible changes to the pension law. The
authorities explained that discussions in this area were still at an early stage, although a
reduction in the retirement age underlay most proposals. The mission noted that a reduction in
the retirement age would run counter to the direction observed in pension reforms in other
countries in light of demographic trends. The authorities emphasized the more general point
that they attach high priority to keeping the eventual cost of pension reform within a prudent
fiscal envelope.
13.
The mission welcomed the continued improvements in domestic debt
management towards lengthening maturities and improving the currency composition.7
In this context, the authorities had recently taken a decision to reduce gradually direct
issuance of bonds to pension funds, while raising (from 3 percent to 13 percent of their assets)
the effective limit on their investments abroad. Such a decision will avoid an unnecessary
build-up of domestic debt given the low financing needs of the government. At the same time,
higher external investments by the pension funds will help diversify risk in their portfolios, as
well as facilitate sterilization of foreign exchange receipts. The mission encouraged the
authorities to relax those investments limits further over time.
C. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
14.
Greater exchange rate flexibility and a more active use of open market
operations would help contain inflationary pressures. The mission argued that an
appreciation of the real exchange rate is likely to be unavoidable, given the magnitude of
foreign inflows and the fact that estimates suggest the exchange rate is undervalued.8 It

Dollar-denominated Treasury bonds fell from 59 percent of total bonds in 2005 to 44 percent in May 2007,
while the average maturity of auctioned bonds has increased to over four years. However, about 85 percent of
the auctioned local-currency bonds continue to be inflation indexed. For a detailed discussion of recent
developments in debt management, see the accompanying Selected Issues Paper, prepared jointly with the
authorities.

The exchange rate misalignment has arisen mainly from the permanent positive shock associated with the
development of the hydrocarbons sector, combined in recent years with a major improvement in the terms of

underscored that real exchange rate adjustments through inflation would have a regressive
distributional impact, in particular for the real incomes of the poor. Furthermore, given the
underlying appreciating trend, greater exchange rate flexibility would likely contribute to a
reduction in dollarization. Staff therefore suggested the following: (a) for the short run,
greater flexibility under the crawling peg regime—e.g., with some acceleration in the pace of
nominal appreciation; and (b) for the medium term, a move to a regime that permits still
greater exchange rate flexibility (e.g., a managed float). The latter would also allow more
timely responses to external shocks.9 On the monetary policy front, the mission suggested that
open market operations be expanded further to manage excess liquidity in the short run, in
particular as the accumulation of government deposits at the central bank is expected to
subside in the second half of the year.

1/ Expected inflation as m easured by the central bank's
m onthly econom ic expectations survey.

15.
The authorities’ own assessment of the monetary/exchange rate policy
requirements coincided with the thrust of the staff’s positions but not necessarily on the
magnitude of the adjustments needed. Accordingly, the central bank has continued to
appreciate the nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, albeit through still very small
adjustments. Also, the volume of open market operations has continued to rise, although still
with only a modest impact on policy interest rates (Table 3).10 Moreover, the authorities were
open to the possibility of transitioning to a more flexible exchange rate regime over time; in
this connection, they reconfirmed their request for a technical assistance mission from MCM
in late June, which they hoped would provide a roadmap of the institutional adjustments that
might be necessary for a transition to this type of monetary policy framework.

trade, in the context of only small nominal exchange rate appreciations. The extent of the misalignment is
uncertain, however, as alternative estimates place it within the wide range of 6–26 percent. The authorities’ own
estimates of the misalignment are on the lower side of this range. For a detailed discussion of these issues, see
the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.
9

While balance sheet effects from nominal exchange rate adjustments may be significant for many borrowers,
they tend to be positive in this case given the underlying pressures towards appreciation of the local currency.

10

Real interest rates on one-year instruments were about 1 percent as of end-May 2007 (based on surveys of
expected inflation), compared to an average of 3 percent in 2006.

12
D. Financial Sector Issues

16.
While the authorities have been successful in maintaining financial sector
stability, the discussions highlighted issues that still require attention (Box 3). The
authorities remain confident that existing vulnerabilities in banks’ loan portfolios have been
already identified, but they concurred on the need to continue to monitor closely banks’ loan
provisioning and solvency; and to introduce prudential regulations to enhance banks’
assessment of market risks. They did not agree on the need at this time to issue prudential
measures to require banks to recognize risks from dollarization in their lending procedures, or
to raise capital requirements to cover market risks. There was broad agreement that various
pending structural reforms recommended by the 2003 FSAP are still relevant, including to
strengthen the legislation governing corporate bankruptcy.
17.
The authorities emphasized that the recently created second-tier public
development bank would be subject to standard prudential regulations, and would
complement rather than compete with the existing micro-finance sector.11 The
development bank (BDP) has replaced an existing second-tier public bank and will manage an
initial resource pool of US$60 million. To prevent undue competition with microfinance
institutions, beneficiaries may only be those with no outstanding credit with the financial
system over the past 12 months. The authorities indicated that they do not envisage treasury
financing for the BDP, which they expect would be financed instead with concessional funds
from the donor community. The mission suggested that the credit procedures of the BDP
should be subject to technical assessment by the Superintendency of Banks.
E. Supply-Side Policies

18.
While stressing what they viewed as major positive achievements in the
hydrocarbons area, the authorities recognized the challenges ahead for the sector. In
particular, major investments (amounting to approximately US$3.5 billion) would be needed
to enable the export increases committed to Argentina as well as to meet rising domestic
demand. The authorities expected the current operators to submit substantial investment
proposals in coming months, in line with those commitments; and were confident that any
shortfalls could be covered by direct investments from YPFB, probably in association with
friendly governments. They emphasized that YPFB will have to be restructured and
expanded, consistent with its greater role in the new hydrocarbons framework. They will
submit a bill to Congress this year to that effect, which would enable YPFB to adjust its salary
structure (currently linked with that of the government) in line with industry standards.12

11

Micro-finance institutions hold about 6 percent of financial system deposits and 10 percent of credit
outstanding (about US$350 million).
12

In addition to restructuring YPFB as an autonomous public enterprise, this bill would reform the legal and
institutional framework governing the hydrocarbons sector, including through the creation of a new regulatory
agency (the National Hydrocarbons Agency).

Box 3. Bolivia: State of the Banking System and Pending Reform Agenda
•

•

•

The Bolivian banking system has continued its
recovery from the 2001–03 crisis. Deposit
growth has picked up, reaching 16 percent in
2006. Credit growth has also improved, although
it still lags deposit growth (Table 4). Conse–
quently, banks have managed to improve their
liquidity position and broadly hold liquid assets of
about 50 percent of total deposits. The banking
system remains concentrated—the six largest
banks out of 13 institutions account for almost
82 percent of banking system assets.
Bank profitability has improved and
capitalization remains above requirements.
Return on assets and equity increased in 2006—to
1.3 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively (from
0.7 percent and 6.4 percent in 2005)—mainly due
to an increase in fee income, lower loan
provisioning, and a reduction in operating
expenses. The banking system currently shows an
aggregate capital adequacy of about 14 percent of
risk weighted assets, although asset quality and
loan dollarization are still a challenge (Tables 5
and 6). Despite declines, the stock of restructured
and nonperforming loans could still become a
source of losses as they represent—after
provisioning—about 17 percent of net loans or
100 percent of equity. Moreover, foreign
exchange loans account for about 80 percent of
total loans, which might lead to a deterioration in
the portfolio in the event of exchange rate shocks.

strengthened, and it has issued and enforced
regulations on prompt corrective action, bank intervention, and liquidity risk. A large-value real
time gross settlement payment system (SIPAV) has been implemented. However,
recommendations remain outstanding on: (a) amending the legislation governing corporate
bankruptcy/restructuring; (b) ensuring proper consolidated supervision through close coordination
among financial regulators; (c) strengthening the Financial Intelligence Unit and legislation
against money laundering; (d) creating a deposit insurance scheme, inter alia to reduce the
potential for central bank participation in bank resolutions; (e) internalizing the risks posed by
financial dollarization through prudential regulations; and (f) adopting regulations to offset market
risks.

14
The mission emphasized that improvements in the investment climate were
19.
needed to kick start domestic and foreign investment and raise economic growth. It
stressed that the investment climate would greatly benefit from a clear signal that the
government’s nationalization policy applies only to those enterprises privatized in the 1990s,
and that it will be pursued through mutually agreeable arrangements with the concerned
investors. In the same vein, the mission expressed concern over the recent decision to exit
from the World Bank’s investment disputes framework, which might discourage future
investments. More generally, the staff noted that the investment climate would benefit from a
reduction in legal/institutional uncertainties, which have been heightened by the potential for
far reaching reforms in the context of the ongoing constituent assembly. While taking note of
these concerns, the authorities expressed confidence that major investments would be
forthcoming over the medium term—from private sources and friendly governments—in
hydrocarbons, mining, and other sectors.
F. Medium-Term Outlook

20.
The medium-term outlook entails a significant narrowing of the current account
surplus in the context of some improvement in the growth performance (Tables 1 and 3).
The current account surplus would decline from 11½ percent of GDP in 2006 to 5 percent in
2010–12. Consistent with the WEO, the terms of trade would fall during 2008–12, driven by
declines in the prices of minerals and a leveling off in natural gas export prices, contributing
to lower public and private savings. As a result, and also due to higher investment, the public
sector surplus would be reduced while the private sector savings-investment balances would
decline, partly due to real exchange rate appreciation. However, the current account surplus
would remain significant, reflecting major increases in natural gas exports to Argentina,
beginning in 2010; and the large iron/ore steel project of El Mutun, expected to boost miningrelated output starting in 2009. These projects would also contribute to some improvement in
GDP growth, to an average of about 5½ percent during 2008–12.13 The fiscal surplus would
be maintained in the 1–2 percent of GDP range during 2007–12, as the impact on public
sector revenue of a limited softening in natural gas export prices would be compensated for by
an increase in export volumes.14 NIR would continue to increase, although they might be
allocated partly to a hydrocarbons stabilization/savings fund. Still, with greater exchange rate
flexibility, inflation would fall gradually to 4.5 percent.
21.
However, this scenario is subject to a range of downside risks, including major
uncertainties regarding private investment and growth. First, substantial investments on
both sides of the border will be required to undertake the major expansion in natural gas
exports to the Argentine market while raising production for the domestic market in line with
projected increases in consumption, as envisaged by the authorities. Second, the scenario is

13

In the absence of these projects, real GDP growth would remain broadly around 4½ percent (i.e., same as in
2006–07), with non-hydrocarbons GDP growth at a similar level.
14

Without the increase in exports to Argentina from the new pipeline, public sector revenue would weaken
starting in 2010, and the shortfall compared to the baseline could reach 2½ percent of GDP by 2012.

15
sensitive to the assumption that the large mining/steel mill project at El Mutun will indeed go
forward. Third, while the fiscal scenario is not predicated on any additional measures, it does
assume that the authorities succeed in controlling spending, including at the subnational level,
which may be challenging in an electoral environment. Finally, the projected inflation path
depends importantly on the assumption that the authorities will implement a more flexible
exchange rate policy, i.e., more frequent and/or greater exchange rate adjustments than
observed over the last two years. Risks are also compounded by the potential for wide-ranging
institutional changes in the context of the ongoing constitutional assembly, which could
discourage investment and complicate macroeconomic management.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

22.
Over the past year, the economy continued to benefit from high and rising
hydrocarbons and mining exports, which led to increased accumulation of external
reserves and a large fiscal surplus. GDP growth has continued at a satisfactory rate and
inflation has remained moderate, albeit with some pick up in recent months that is partly
attributable to exogenous shocks. The financial system has remained stable and dollarization,
though still exceptionally high, has maintained a declining trend. Reflecting further debt relief
under the MDRI, as well as the sizable fiscal surplus, the public debt has been substantially
reduced.
23.
The authorities are to be commended for the strong emphasis they have
continued to place on safeguarding macroeconomic stability. In particular, the government
has managed expenditure prudently over the past year, especially in the area of current
spending, where wage increases have been kept within prudent limits despite the ample
hydrocarbons-based resources that have become available. The fiscal gains of recent years
constitute an important achievement, and the high priority attached by the authorities to
protecting these gains is welcome. This achievement has been instrumental in dealing with the
monetary impact—and associated inflationary pressures—of large foreign exchange receipts
related to hydrocarbons, and is consistent with a prudent long-term use of the country’s
hydrocarbons resources. While maintaining the fiscal surplus is not predicated on new fiscal
measures, it will still require considerable control over expenditure, including at the
subnational level. In light of the potential fiscal impact, the authorities are urged to exercise
caution in assessing the various proposals regarding possible modifications to the pension
system, and craft these consistent with demographic trends.
24.
While the staff welcomes the overall medium-term fiscal stance, there is room to
improve the structure of the budget to make it a more effective developmental and
poverty-reducing tool. In this context, the authorities are encouraged to consider, as soon as
feasible, cuts in the large and poorly targeted hydrocarbon product subsidies, along with
structural reforms to improve the tax system, intergovernmental relations, and the budget
process. A gradual rise in hydrocarbon product prices towards market levels over the medium
term, in tandem with the implementation of properly designed initiatives to protect the most
vulnerable social groups, would release substantial fiscal resources which could be used to
finance development-oriented and poverty-reducing spending, and/or to strengthen the fiscal

16
position. Additional elements of a structural reform agenda to enhance the effectiveness of the
budget as a development/poverty reduction tool would be the elimination of distortionary
taxes, concurrently with a broadening of the tax base; the removal of imbalances between the
revenue sharing arrangement and expenditure assignments across levels of government; and
the enactment of a budget framework law, which would contribute to strengthening the
budget process and to increasing control over subnational spending. The authorities are
encouraged to introduce a personal income tax with a high exemption threshold to make the
tax system more equitable.
25.
Given the strength of the balance of payments, and indications from analytical
work that the Boliviano is undervalued, it will be important to incorporate greater
exchange rate flexibility and a more active use of open market operations into the policy
mix. Over the last two years, the slight nominal appreciations of the Boliviano under the
crawling peg regime have been insufficient to address the misalignment brought about by the
rapid development of Bolivia’s energy exports. There is scope for greater flexibility under the
current regime, which may be achieved by adjusting the frequency and/or the magnitude of
exchange rate adjustments. The staff welcomes the authorities’ indications that they will
exercise greater exchange rate flexibility in the period ahead. Furthermore, there is scope for a
more active use of open market operations to tighten monetary conditions. Despite an increase
in the volume of open market operations in recent months, policy interest rates have moved
only slightly in relation to end-2006 levels and base money growth remains very high. Thus
far, strong base money growth has been consistent with higher real demand for the Boliviano
as dollarization has declined. However, excess liquidity in the system may increase
significantly if the growth in real demand for Bolivianos subsides in the period ahead. Open
market operations would therefore need to be stepped up in a forward-looking manner to
prevent a sustained rapid growth of the currency stock from translating into higher inflation.
Over the medium term, transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime would allow more
timely responses to external shocks. Furthermore, given the underlying appreciating trend,
greater exchange rate flexibility would likely contribute to a reduction in dollarization. The
staff therefore welcomes the authorities’ request for MCM technical assistance on the
technical and institutional requirements for a potential move to a more flexible exchange rate
arrangement over time.
26.
The authorities have been successful in maintaining financial sector stability and
efforts to address remaining vulnerabilities should continue. Key issues include, inter alia,
monitoring closely banks’ loan provisioning and solvency; introducing prudential regulations
to mitigate credit risks from dollarization––especially in light of the need for greater exchange
rate flexibility––and market risk; amending the legislation governing corporate
bankruptcy/restructuring; and strengthening of the Financial Intelligence Unit and legislation
against money laundering. Creating of a deposit insurance scheme, which would provide
better tools to deal with systemic crises, also merits consideration. Regarding the recent
creation of a development bank, the staff welcomes the indications by the authorities that such
a bank is not meant to compete with Bolivia’s successful micro-finance system, and that it
will be subject to standard prudential requirements.

17
In the hydrocarbons sector, the new operating contracts with the foreign energy
27.
companies constitute an important step towards a more favorable investment climate.
However, while the new contracts have virtually ensured that current production levels will be
maintained, the authorities now face the challenge of securing the major additional
investments that will be needed to enable committed increases in exports to the Argentine
market and forestall domestic bottlenecks in light of rising local demand. The authorities are
therefore encouraged to continue to seek mutually acceptable arrangements with the foreign
investors in the strategic hydrocarbons sector, especially with those investors affected by the
ongoing nationalization of companies privatized in the 1990s. Given the the pivotal role of the
state company YPFB in the new hydrocarbons framework, its planned restructuring as an
autonomous public enterprise following international best practices is a high priority. More
generally, there is a need for an efficient management of any nationalized enterprises.

28.
Regarding the overall economy, it is imperative to develop policies that lead to a
recovery in private investment, which has now been depressed for several years. Indeed,
while the authorities understandably assign public investment a key role in developing the
country’s infrastructure and human capital, a recovery in domestic and foreign private
investment will be critical to underpin sustained growth and reduce the risks to the medium
term growth outlook, which is highly dependent on large projects envisaged in hydrocarbons
and mining. Such an increase would require improvements in the investment climate, which
would benefit from greater legal/institutional stability. Accordingly, the authorities should
carefully assess the potential impact on investment and growth of possible constitutional
changes, including in land tenure and any other aspect of property rights.
29.
As evidenced by the recent ROSC, Bolivia’s economic statistics are of adequate
quality, timeliness, and coverage to allow the conduct of Fund surveillance. The
authorities are encouraged to address expeditiously the areas identified in the ROSC for
improvement in the country’s statistical system.
30.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Bolivia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Memorandum item:
Hydrocarbons related revenues
Royalties and IDH
YPFB participation
Non-hydrocarbons balance
Sources: Bolivian authorities, and Fund staff estimates

1/ Since May 2007 royalties and IDH are no longer included in the definition of tax revenue of the general government as
these funds are now collected and transferred by YPFB.
2/ In 2007 tax revenues include only the IDH and royalties that were paid directly by the oil companies to the general
government preceding the take over of this responsibility by YPFB in May 2007.
3/ In 2007 the spending on Universities initially included in other spending was reclassified. More importantly, the wage bill
now includes 1,056 million bolivianos of salaries of university personnel while other minor amounts were included in goods
and services.

APPENDIX 1. SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
The full annexes to this report may be viewed in CyberDocs on the Fund’s intranet and on
the secure extranet for Executive Directors and member country officials.
Fund relations

As of May 31, 2007, Bolivia’s outstanding purchases and loans amounted to SDR
9.66 million (5.63 percent of quota). The latest SBA expired on March 31, 2006. In 2006,
Bolivia received a SDR 160.93 million in stock of debt relief from the Fund through the
MDRI. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on July 17,
2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/270). Bolivia has received wide-ranging TA in recent
years. An update of the safeguards assessment was completed in September, 2004, which
confirmed that identified vulnerabilities had been addressed, except for those requiring a
change in the central bank law. Mr. Esteban Vesperoni has been the IMF resident
representative since February 2006.
Relations with the World Bank Group

The World Bank’s support to Bolivia is being delivered according to the Interim Strategy
Note (ISN), approved by the World Bank Board in November 2006. Bank support includes
lending, analytical work, and technical assistance in the areas of governance and
transparency; fostering jobs through growth; and providing better services to the poor. ISN
lending includes only IDA resources, which will finance 10 investment projects, with
projected disbursements of approximately US$140 million over the two-year period; and six
Economic and Sector Works (EWS). The Bank’s current portfolio in Bolivia comprises six
projects under implementation, with total commitments of US$221 million.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank

As of December 31, 2006, Bolivia’s outstanding debt to the IDB was US$1.28 billion. In
2006, a total of US$145 million in new concessional lending was approved for Bolivia’s
public sector, the most important of which was a US$120 million loan to support road
rehabilitation and improve the Northern Corridor Highway from La Paz to Rurrenabaque.
The IDB’s portfolio in Bolivia also includes active non-reimbursable technical cooperation
projects amounting to US$21.6 million. On March 16, 2007, in the context of the MDRI, the
Board of Governors of the IDB approved 100% debt relief on loan balances outstanding as of
December 31, 2004 from its Fund for Special Operations (FSO).
Statistical issues

The timeliness and coverage of economic statistics in Bolivia is generally adequate for
surveillance purposes. A data ROSC mission in early 2007 confirmed advances in recent
years, and reiterated the existence of shortcomings that might hamper the formulation of
appropriate policies. Many national agencies, including the National Institute of Statistics
(INE), post statistical information on the Internet. Bolivia has participated in the GDDS since
November 2000 and plans to subscribe to the SDDS are at an advanced stage.

Safeguards Assessment. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central
Bank of Bolivia (CBB) was subject to an assessment with respect to the April 2, 2003
Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). A safeguards assessment was completed June 27, 2003,
and while no systemic risks with the CBB’s safeguards were identified, uncertainties

1

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

3

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004
which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by
bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

were expressed about the de facto lack of operational independence and program
monetary data. An update assessment was completed September 27, 2004 in
conjunction with an augmentation of the SBA. This assessment confirmed that
measures had been implemented to address all previously identified vulnerabilities,
except for those requiring a change in the central bank law.
X.

Exchange Arrangement. The Bolivian currency is the boliviano and the exchange
rate regime is a crawling peg. The central bank holds a daily foreign exchange auction,
accepting all bids that are at least equal to the central bank’s minimum price. If
acceptable bids exceed the amount offered for auction, the lowest acceptable bids are
prorated so as to exhaust the amount offered. The minimum price is adjusted from
time to time in light of the evaluation of Bolivia’s real exchange rate with respect to
Bolivia’s key trading partners. On March 31, 2007, the official selling rate was
US$7.99 per U.S. dollar.

XI.

Article IV Consultation. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on July 17, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/270). Bolivia is on a
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

APPENDIX II. BOLIVIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK 1
1.
The World Bank’s support to Bolivia is being delivered according to the Interim
Strategy Note (ISN), approved by the World Bank Board in November 2006. The ISN
has been designed to cover a two-year period (FY07–FY08) that will allow the Bank to
implement a flexible work program in Bolivia while the Constitutional Assembly outcomes
are defined and the National Development Plan, presented in May 2006, advances in its
implementation. The Bank support include lending, analytical work and technical assistance
in areas where the Bank and the Government have clear agreement: enhancing good
governance and transparency; fostering jobs through growth; and providing better services to
the poor. The ISN lending includes only IDA resources which will finance ten investment
projects for approximately US$140 million over the two-year framework, and six Economic
and Sector Works (EWS). To the extent possible, these projects and programs are being
designed and implemented in a collaborative fashion with donor partners to have a greater
development impact.
2.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Bolivia comprises six projects under
implementation for a total amount of US$221 million. The entire portfolio is made of
concessional IDA funding, of which US$129 million remain undisbursed, in the following
six projects:
•

The Institutional Reform Project I, for US$30 million and closing date May 2007.

•

The Health Sector Reform APL II, for US$35 million and expected to close in
September 2007.

•

The Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, for US$77 million and expected to
close in December 2007.

•

The Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation, for US$20 million and
closing date December 2007.

•

The Urban Infrastructure for the Poor Project, for US$30 million and closing date
November 2010.

•

The Rural Alliances Project, for US$28 million and closing date September 2011.

3.
Additionally, the World Bank program includes some trust funds: a grant for
US$300 thousand to strength the Technical Secretariat of the Constituent Assembly; and a
grant amounting to US$212 thousand intended for the strengthening of the Congress Budget
Commission.
4.
During 2006 the World Bank has concluded the following three studies, which
were published in both Spanish and English and presented to the Civil Society in several
Bolivian cities.

Prepared by World Bank staff.

6
•

Policy Notes on 23 different economic and social issues, after technical discussions
with major political parties – including the MAS party – which started in August
2005. The Bank presented these notes to the Government in March 2006 and to the
Civil Society at the end of 2006.

•

The Country Social Analysis (CSA) provides consideration of the options and
lessons from international experience that the Constitutional Assembly faces on four
critical issues: indigenous rights, land and territory, decentralization and access to
justice. This document was presented to the Government and the Civil Society in
March 2007.

•

The Institutional Governance Review (IGR) analyses the second phase of the
decentralization issue at the departmental level, including a thorough diagnosis of its
context and current strategy, focusing on guiding principles for a successful
progressive implementation. This document was also presented to the Government
and the Civil Society in March 2007.

5.

The Bank is discussing with the Government the following projects for FY07:
•

The Productivity and Job Creation Project for US$15 million will support
Government initiatives to increase productivity and job creation through both
facilitating access to financial services for micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs) using market-friendly mechanisms, and improving the investment climate.

•

The Community-Based Land Administration Project for US$15 million. This
project aims to establish a decentralized beneficiary-driven land distribution
mechanism that allows organized landless or poor farmers to acquire suitable
agricultural lands and implement investment subprojects which puts them on a
sustainable, higher-income, livelihood path.

•

The Participatory Rural Investment Project II, for US$17 million, will improve
the economic opportunities of poor rural producers through co-financed productive
investments generated in coordinated participatory planning processes at the
community, municipal, and regional level.

•

The Secondary Education Project for US$10 million, with the objective of
supporting the Municipality of La Paz education program. It will expand secondary
education coverage; improve education quality; and strength infrastructure and
educational management capacity.

•

The Lake Titicaca Local Sustainable Development Project, for US$15 million. Its
objective is to improve the quality of life of the basin’s residents through local
development opportunities such as tourism, provision of critical infrastructure
services, and protection of the Lake’s long term water quality and ecological vitality.

7
6.

Ongoing technical assistance and economic sector work includes:
•

The Informality study faces an in-depth analysis of the constraints to productivity as
well as the productivity differentials between informal and formal firms in selected
markets. Based on this analysis and international experience, the study will provide
sector specific and general policy recommendations to achieve productivity gains.

•

The Social Safety Net study will provide analytical tools for a more effective
implementation of the Government’s Social Protection strategy. The study will help
define target populations and programs and propose institutional arrangements,

A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) will validate the
quality and performance of Public Financial Management. The study will allow the
Government to assess the condition of public expenditures, procurement and
accountability systems and develop a sequence of reforms based on a common
baseline of information. It will also help to coordinate donor support in promoting

APPENDIX III. BOLIVIA: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 1
1.
As of December 31, 2006, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) had
approved loans to Bolivia amounting to US$3.93 billion, with disbursements totaling
US$3.25 billion. Bolivia’s outstanding debt to the IDB was US$1.28 billion. During the first
half of the decade, net cash flows to the country were mostly positive, owing in large
measure to the debt relief provided by the IDB under the HIPC Initiative and the
extraordinary financing disbursed in 2003. In 2006, a temporary net outflow was registered.
Nonetheless, a total of US$145 million in new concessional lending was approved for
Bolivia’s public sector, of which a US$120 million loan to support road rehabilitation and
improve the Northern Corridor Highway from La Paz to Rurrenabaque was the most
significant. As of March 27, 2007, undisbursed balances amounted to US$493 million. The
IDB’s portfolio in Bolivia also includes active non reimbursable technical cooperation
projects amounting to US$21.6 million, of which US$13.8 million is undisbursed.
2.
The Board of Governors of the IDB approved March 16, 2007, 100% debt relief
for Bolivia, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras and Nicaragua, on loan balances outstanding as
of December 31, 2004 from its Fund for Special Operations (FSO). In the context of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the IDB will forgive the five HIPC beneficiary countries
approximately $3.4 billion in principal payments and $1.0 billion of future interest payments.
This additional relief by the Bank will be retroactive to January 1, 2007 and is intended to
help beneficiary countries invest more on education, health and other quality services, to
improve their living conditions and reduce poverty. Under this agreement endorsed by the
Bank’s shareholders, which also includes new operational guidelines for the FSO, Bolivia
would receive approximately US$ 1 billion in IDB debt relief (including cancelled loan
balances of-US$ 736.4 million (7% of GDP) and foregone future interest - payments-of
US$307.3 million (generating annual fiscal space of more than US$18 million on average).
3.
Sustainable poverty reduction remains the overarching objective of the Bank’s
country strategy with Bolivia. In pursuit of this objective, the Bank is supporting
government-led efforts to overcome the country’s economic and social development
challenges in three main areas: (a) improving the managerial capacity and transparency of the
public sector, (b) supporting productivity and employment growth; (c) providing basic social
services to the poorest regions. The IDB is updating its country strategy on the basis of the
new priorities established by the Morales Administration since assuming office in January,
2006 and the policy framework for the medium term laid out in its National Development
Program. IDB lending to Bolivia in 2007/8 contemplates new loans amounting to
approximately US$ 74 million per year. These would be subject to the newly adopted
operational guidelines for the FSO that feature a performance-based allocation system and a
parallel lending modality, consistent with the application of the Debt Sustainability
Framework. Loans to Bolivia would continue to benefit from a high concessionality element
to ensure the sustainability of the debt relief and support the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. The proposed lending program for 2007/2008 consists of six loans
1

Prepared by IDB staff.

9
totaling approximately US$156 million (in support of small impoverished rural communities
(Comunidades en Acción), water services, transport infrastructure, development banking and
institutional strengthening in the public sector). The Bank is supporting the country in
emergency clean up, impact evaluation, rehabilitation and disaster prevention and protection
of public infrastructure at risk with a menu of instruments, including activation of a previous
approved emergency loan in response to the damage caused by recent intense rains and
flooding in the country.
4.
The backdrop for the strategy’s implementation remains complex, characterized
by a widespread reorientation of the reform process, need for continued fiscal
consolidation, weak policy implementation and institutional capacity and an overarching political agenda dominated by the constituent assembly and the referendum for
regional autonomy. In this context, the update of the country strategy is being conceived as a
process in which the Bank, in concert with the Government and other development partners,
(i) remains engaged in areas of high priority to attenuate economic risks and preserve the
social gains of the last decade (pension and tax administration, microfinance), (ii) continues
cooperating with the administration in improving planning, budgeting and the ongoing fiscal
decentralization process, and (iii) sharpens the focus of its assistance on local/rural
development (concentrating on municipalities with productive potential) and the provision of
productive infrastructure. The Bank expects to conclude preparation of a new transitional
strategy in the second half of 2007.

APPENDIX IV. BOLIVIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The timeliness and coverage of economic statistics is generally adequate for surveillance
purposes. A data ROSC mission in early 2007 confirmed advances in recent years, and
reiterated the existence of shortcomings that may hamper the formulation of appropriate
policies. National agencies responsible for the dissemination of statistics post data on the
Internet. Bolivia has participated in the GDDS since November 2000 and plans to subscribe
to the SDDS are at an advanced stage.
I. REAL SECTOR
•

National accounts. The INE has begun a thorough revision of the national accounts
statistics, including the base year and intensified implementation of the SNA 1993.
This process is expected to be completed over the next three years. Efforts to improve
the quality of the real sector statistics have been hampered by an inadequate statistical
law and insufficient resources to undertake censuses and surveys such as those on
manufacturing, foreign direct investment, and tourism.

•

Labor market. The quality of the household and employment surveys has
deteriorated in the last few years, due mainly to financial constraints. The quarterly
employment survey was discontinued in 2003, leading to a lack of quarterly
information on unemployment, employment and wages.

•

Prices. The consumer price index (CPI) covering the four largest cities has a base
year of 1991. A household budget survey was conducted over a 12-month period that
began in June 2, 2003 to update the CPI base year. Industrial producer price indices
and external trade unit values are compiled by INE, but are in need of revision as
regards their coverage, product breakdown, and base year (1990=100).
II. FISCAL SECTOR

•

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) provides timely information on revenue, current
and investment spending, and financing for the consolidated general government
(central government and decentralized entities), public enterprises and the
central bank, with appropriate disaggregation, on a monthly basis. The MoF also
provides annual data to STA on the operations of the consolidated central
government, and regional and local governments for publication in Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook. However, these data do not cover all operations of
decentralized agencies and operations channeled through special funds. The ongoing
implementation of a comprehensive financial management system, with funding from
the IDB, will help ensure proper monitoring of public sector financial operations
including local debt and social spending.

11
III. EXTERNAL SECTOR
•

The Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) provides data on balance of payments and
international investment position statistics to STA for publication in the Balance
of Payments Statistics Yearbook and the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The classification of accounts is broadly in accordance with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Although quarterly balance of payments data are
available before the end of the year, these data are submitted to STA only once a year.
The BCB also provides monthly trade data to the Fund, but the import data are only
available with a lag. Upon request, Fund staff has access to more detailed and timely
balance of payments and debt data.

•

The authorities are working on a data base on gross flows of short and mediumterm private debt. However, there is some concern about the quality of private
capital flows as the foreign direct investment survey was discontinued in the third
quarter of 2004. As identified by the January 2007 Data ROSC mission, the coverage
of certain services and financial transactions in the balance of payments needs to be
expanded.

•

Although not yet an SDDS subscribing country, Bolivia is disseminating the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.

IV. MONETARY SECTOR
•

Coverage, sectorization, and timeliness of monetary statistics are now broadly in
line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Monetary data are based
on the balance sheets of the central bank, commercial banks, credit unions, savings
and loans associations, and private investment funds. The survey will be expanded to
cover also the investment funds managing societies (SAFIS). A STA mission in
April 2006 found weaknesses in data provided by deposit institutions, particularly
regarding sectorization of the accounts, which were subsequently addressed through
revisions in the report forms and the instructions issued by the Superintendency of
Banks and Financial Entities.

•

The BCB has started the process to compile a monthly survey on the other
financial corporations, with data from pension funds, insurance corporations,
Nacional Financiera Boliviana (NAFIBO), and Fondo de Desarrollo del Sistema
Financiero (FONDESIF). This survey will help improve the quarterly flow of funds
accounts currently compiled by the BCB and will be the first step in the production of
a balance sheet approach matrix.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BOLIVIA
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund1
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Michael T. Hadjimichael
June 27, 2007
The sustainability of Bolivia’s public debt has improved substantially as a result of the
MDRI—which has granted stock debt relief equivalent to about 25 percent of the GDP—and
the shift into an overall fiscal surplus since 2006. Debt ratios are currently at very
manageable levels, with ample margins with respect to risk thresholds, and may be expected
to decline further over the long run under baseline policies. Given that the remaining stocks
of both domestic and foreign debt are of long maturities, debt service is also projected to
remain low. The declining path of the debt ratio displays an inflexion under standard stress
tests and an alternative scenario of lower oil prices, but would still remain within
sustainable bounds in the long run.
1.
Bolivia’s public debt (external and domestic) decreased significantly since the
last Article IV consultation thanks to lower fiscal financing needs and the delivery of
the latest installment of the MDRI by the Inter American Development Bank (IADB)
for US$ 1.2 billion. The outlook for the nominal public debt-to-GDP ratio—currently at the
35 percent level, down from 70 percent in 2005—is very favorable as it is projected to
decline gradually to 16 percent during the DSA’s projection period. Similarly the NPV of
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach levels below 15 percent, compared to 33 percent at
present. Moreover, with the accumulation of deposits of the public sector in the financial
system—amounting to about 17 percent of GDP at present—the solvency of the public sector
measured by the net public debt (i.e., gross debt minus those deposits) has improved even
more significantly and could reach very low levels during the projection period.
2.
The relief granted by the MDRI has reduced significantly Bolivia’s public
external debt. The relief, amounting to US$2.9 billion, is equivalent to almost 25 percent of
the GDP and has cut by more than half the public external debt to about US$2.1 billion at
present (19 percent of the 2006 GDP) since end-2005. The importance of multilateral debt in
1

Since Bolivia is an IDA blend country, this DSA was not conducted jointly with the World Bank.

2
the public external debt has also decreased from 90 percent to about 80 percent of total, with
Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF) remaining as the main creditor with 37 percent of
total external debt. The rest of the external debt comes mainly from official sources on noncommercial terms, which limits significantly the rollover risk and makes external debt
service very manageable, in particular in light of the strong export earnings from
hydrocarbons and mining.
Main Assumptions
The main assumptions of the baseline scenario for the period 2007–27 are:
•

Average annual real GDP growth: 5 percent until 2012, on account of agriculture recovery,
and mining and hydrocarbons expected project implementation, and 4 percent during 2013–27.

•

Average inflation: 5 percent per year, in line with recent history and medium term
expectations.

•

Export growth: 8 percent until 2012 due to expected developments in the natural gas sector
(notably, as specified below, increase in exports to Argentina), and 4½ percent afterwards.

•

Import growth: 10 percent in the 2007–12 period as some of the expected investment projects
have a significant imported content. Average of 4 percent per year in the long term.

•

Natural gas price: contract prices until 2012 moving consistently with WEO projections, and
for the period 2013–27 constant in real terms at US$5 dollars per thousand cubic feet.

•

Natural gas volumes: growing within current capacity levels until 2010 (average of
35 million of cubic meters per day), increasing early in the next decade to reflect expected
additional natural gas exports to Argentina, up to 60 million of cubic meters per day, stable
after 2013.

•

FDI: in line with expected investments for the hydrocarbons and mining sectors.

•

The profile of the average concessionality of the public sector borrowing is projected to
evolve in line with the existing official loans in the pipeline. Over the longer run,
concessionality is expected to decrease gradually.

•

The evolution of domestic public debt is consistent with the path for the overall fiscal balance
and available domestic financing.

3.
Given Bolivia’s overall macroeconomic outlook, its external debt is expected to
remain sustainable throughout the projection period. In the 20-year projections, the fiscal
position shifts from overall surpluses between 1 and 2 percent of GDP in the period 2007–12
to small surpluses of about 0.5 percent of GDP in the outer years of the projection—
reflecting among other things declining hydrocarbons-based revenues in relation to GDP.
Nevertheless, the overall performance under baseline assumptions yields very manageable
indebtedness and debt service levels. Thus, the stock of total public and private external

3
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall to about 24 percent by 2012 and stabilize at the range of
15 percent by 2027. At the same time, while the composition of public external debt is
expected to gradually shift into less concessional sources over time, the NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratio would reach single digits by 2027.2 Consequently, Bolivia’s risk of debt distress is low.3
This outcome holds even under significant stress tests.
4.
The standard stress testing shows that Bolivia’s favorable external debt situation
is fairly resilient to severe exogenous shocks (Table 2). The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
deteriorates most under the simulation based on historical averages. Since such averages
reflect the crisis period of 2002–03 (when the primary fiscal deficit reached over 6 percent of
the GDP) and incorporate only partially the recent development of natural gas exports, the
simulated debt ratio approaches the LIC DSA thresholds by the end of the projection period.
All stress tests also lead to higher but stabilizing ratios, below levels considered risky. Flow
indicators also remain manageable under most of the stress tests, except under the historical
trends simulation, which results in a return to still sustainable but very high debt levels.4
5.
However, the outlook for public debt sustainability could be less favorable under
a scenario of significantly lower energy prices. An alternative scenario based on lower oil
prices (by 30 percent compared to baseline), starting in 2008, would show a deterioration in
the fiscal position throughout most of the projection period. However, since public sector
deposits now stand at 17 percent of GDP, the impact should be seen mostly in the path of net
public debt, as the authorities could finance the fiscal deficits by drawing from those deposits
up to a point, and only then resorting to new borrowing. Such alternative scenario would
diverge from the baseline net public debt-to-GDP ratio by up to about 18 percent of GDP by
2027 (Figure 1). Similar effects could also be observed under a scenario of disruption in
hydrocarbons production, or in case of a delayed implementation of the new natural gas
production/pipeline projects to enable increased exports to Argentina.

2

Residuals shown on Table 1 are explained by the significant reserve accumulation expected during the
projection period due to the strength of the balance of payments.

3

The World Bank’s 3-year average IDA Resource Allocation Index (IRAI) classifies Bolivia as a medium
performer with respect to the overall quality of its macroeconomic policies and the related risk thresholds on
NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios (40 and 150 percent, respectively) leave the country’s current
levels with significant safety margins.
4

The historical test has been estimated on the basis of 5-year averages to leave out the extremely volatile years
of the recent past. At the same time, for FDI we take only the average of the last four years to avoid an
extremely positive bias due to the significant investments in hydrocarbons in the early years of this decade.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 17, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia
On July 13, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bolivia.1
Background
The economy has continued to benefit from rising natural gas export volumes, which has been
compounded, over the last two years, by high hydrocarbons and mining export prices. Real
GDP growth has been around 4–4½ percent, mainly driven by an expansion in hydrocarbons
and mining-related activities. The external current account has recorded large surpluses, and
net international reserves have risen to historically high levels. The fiscal position has improved
sharply and—reflecting also debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)—
Bolivia’s public debt has declined markedly. Financial sector stability has improved, with
comfortable levels of liquidity and full net foreign assets (NFA) coverage of deposits, although
vulnerabilities remain. The key economic trends of the past year are projected broadly to
continue in the period ahead, although with a somewhat lower fiscal surplus.
However, inflation has picked up in recent months, due in part to negative supply shocks but
also to rapid monetary expansion. While part of the recent price increases has been associated
with floods and one-time adjustments in some administered prices, both core and headline
inflation have displayed an upward trend since the last quarter of 2006, driven by higher prices
of nontradable goods and services. The Central Bank has responded to rising price pressures

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

by increasing its open market operations and by appreciating the Boliviano against the U.S.
dollar under the crawling peg regime.
Significant changes in hydrocarbons policy have been implemented over the last two years,
resulting in a higher government tax take and a greater public sector role in the sector.
Following a national referendum in August 2004, a new hydrocarbons law was enacted in May
2005 and a related decree issued in May 2006. The main effects of the new legislation have
been: (a) a “migration” of the contracts with the foreign companies operating in Bolivia, from
risk-sharing contracts to an arrangement whereby all production is surrendered to the state
energy company YPFB, which has been made the country’s sole exporter of natural gas; (b) a
permanent increase in natural gas royalties, from 18 percent to 50 percent of turnover; and (c) a
requirement that YPFB regain control over the five hydrocarbons companies that were
privatized in the 1990s.
Following a boom in the late 1990s, which included large-scale privatization, private investment
levels in Bolivia have been depressed in the past few years. While there has been significant
FDI in the mining sector and public sector investment has increased, this has not been enough
to overcome the fall in other private investment, notably in foreign hydrocarbons-related
investment. As a result, Bolivia’s overall investment-to-GDP ratio, as well as the share of private
investment in total investment, are among the lowest in the region.
Even though social indicators have improved in recent years, Bolivia’s levels of poverty and
inequality are persistently high. In 2005, extreme poverty amounted to 37 percent of the
population, while absolute poverty reached 60 percent. Also, income inequality was among the
highest in the region. Although Bolivia will be able to meet some of the Millennium Development
Goals (e.g., child mortality, maternal health, gender equality, and water and sanitation),
achievement of other goals by 2015, such as those of eliminating extreme poverty and universal
primary education, remains a significant challenge.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued strong performance of Bolivia’s economy, with
booming hydrocarbon and mining exports contributing to rapid accumulation of external
reserves and a large fiscal surplus. GDP growth has been satisfactory; inflation remains
moderate, albeit with some pick-up in recent months that is partly attributable to exogenous
shocks; and the public debt has declined because of debt relief and an active debt management
strategy.
Directors noted, however, that poverty remains high in Bolivia, in part because of the limited
employment impact of growth in the hydrocarbons and mining sectors. They stressed the
importance of implementing policies conducive to a recovery of private investment from its low
level and to a diversification of the economy, which they saw as critical for sustained economic
growth and poverty reduction in the medium term. In particular, Directors highlighted the need to
improve the investment climate, including through greater legal and institutional stability and
maintaining a rules-based approach toward private investment. Some Directors encouraged the

3
authorities to re-consider their decision to exit from the World Bank’s investment dispute
settlement framework.
Directors commended the authorities’ strong emphasis on safeguarding macroeconomic
stability. A key challenge in this respect is to manage the large revenues from hydrocarbon
exports in a manner compatible with price stability and maintenance of export competitiveness.
In light of this, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintain a fiscal surplus,
which they also saw as consistent with a prudent long-term use of the hydrocarbon resources.
They stressed that this will require considerable control over expenditure, including at the
subnational level. They suggested that the authorities develop a realistic medium-term
expenditure framework, taking into account the country’s absorptive capacity.
Directors underscored that structural reforms should make the budget a more effective
developmental and poverty-reducing tool. They encouraged the authorities to consider reducing
the large and poorly targeted hydrocarbon subsidies, while introducing properly designed
measures to protect the poor. Improvements of the tax system, intergovernmental relations, and
the budget process should also be a priority. These reforms would release fiscal resources for
financing development and poverty-reducing spending.
Directors noted the modest nominal appreciation of the Boliviano over the last two years under
Bolivia’s current exchange rate regime. Given the upward pressure on the equilibrium exchange
rate stemming from the rapid growth of Bolivia’s energy exports and indications that the
currency may be undervalued, many Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to exercise
greater exchange rate flexibility within the crawling peg regime in the period ahead. They
believed that greater flexibility will also help reduce dollarization and forestall the adverse
distributional impact that would result from allowing inflationary pressures to take hold. Over the
medium term, this increased flexibility could be followed by a gradual and properly sequenced
transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime, for which Fund technical assistance could
help provide a roadmap. Some Directors, however, expressed concern about a move toward
greater exchange rate flexibility, pointing to the impact on competitiveness of the nonhydrocarbon sectors of a currency appreciation, as well as to balance-sheet, inflation, and
dollarization risks that would arise from increased volatility under a more flexible exchange rate
system. Directors also encouraged the authorities to use open market operations more actively
to tighten monetary conditions and reduce inflationary pressures.
Directors commended the authorities’ success in maintaining financial stability, while
encouraging further action to implement the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program
recommendations in order to address remaining vulnerabilities. Key issues include closer
monitoring of banks’ loan provisioning and solvency; introducing prudential regulations to
mitigate credit and market risks, particularly credit risks arising from dollarization; amending the
legislation governing corporate bankruptcy and restructuring; strengthening the Financial
Intelligence Unit and legislation against money laundering; and elimination of the financial
transactions tax because of its adverse effect on financial development. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to subject the recently created development bank to standard prudential

4
requirements, while stressing the need to prevent undue competition with the microfinance
sector.
In the hydrocarbons sector, Directors considered that the new operating contracts with the
foreign energy companies constitute an important step towards a more favorable investment
climate. However, they observed that the authorities now face the challenge of securing the
major additional investments that will be needed to fulfill their export commitments to Argentina
while satisfying rising local demand. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to seek
mutually acceptable arrangements with foreign investors.

Statement by Javier Silva-Ruete, Executive Director for Bolivia
and Victor Hugo De la Barra, Advisor to Executive Director
July 13, 2007
1. We thank the staff for their assessment of the current situation in Bolivia as well as
the policies suggested as a result of their appraisal, reflecting the commendable
efforts of the mission staff, which we highly appreciate.
Background and Overview
2. A number of indicators confirm that Bolivia's economy showed a satisfactory
performance in 2006. In fact, the GDP growth rate was 4.5 percent, which is the
highest it has been since 1998. For 2007, the GDP growth rate is projected to be
lower (4 percent) due to the floods in the first quarter that affected agriculture. The
balance of payments attained positive results in 2006 as exports reached $3.9 billion
and the trade surplus was $1.1 billion, partly due to the positive international
environment reflected in higher prices for Bolivian exports. Additionally, the balance
of payment was positively boosted by foreign remittances and, as a result,
international reserves reached a historic record level of $3.3 billion.
3. Projections for the current account are very positive, not only because of international
prices but also due to increased exports in the coming years, as the government has
reached agreements in negotiating contracts with foreign oil and mining companies.
In addition, in 2006, the government negotiated an increase in the price of exports of
natural gas with Argentina and has since signed a new contract for additional gas
exports to that country. In 2007, Bolivia also reached an agreement to modify the
price of exported gas in one of the contracts signed with Brazil. Therefore, fiscal
consolidation is gaining decisive footing and it will be supported by additional
income from the other economic sectors.
4. The political situation of Bolivia has reached stability as the President, Evo Morales,
has a high level of acceptance and popularity, as measured by recent independent
polls. While sensitive political issues remain, all political parties and the population
are enjoying their civil and political rights, which reflects the fully democratic
environment that the current administration is engaged in. Despite unavoidable
disagreements in the political arena, the government has been reasonably successful
in passing important legislation.
5. The Constitutional Assembly, formed in August 2006, is still working on the new
Constitution, through an ample debate and full freedom of expression. Because of the
necessity to reach consensus ?to introduce social inclusion and other important
changes for a sustainable political stability? the members of the Constitutional
Assembly have decided to extend their sessions until December 2007. The broad

2
agenda of the Constitutional Assembly includes, among other issues, the autonomy of
the administrative regions and both the government and parliament have supported
this decision. If the Constitutional Assembly approves the modification to the
structure of the main institutions of the Executive and Legislative branches (for
instance, suppression of one of the chambers of the National Congress or the
presidential reelection, which is not allowed under the current Constitution), the
current administration might call for an early general election.
Fiscal Policy
6. Strong fiscal consolidation is being attained, in line with the goals set in the National
Development Plan, approved in May 2006. The overall fiscal surplus for 2006 was
4.5 percent of GDP, which is the highest surplus in 66 years, mainly due to
hydrocarbon revenue, as a result of international prices and the 2005 Hydrocarbon
Law, which allows for a greater government intake from royalties and taxes. This
increased intake allows the government to expand on expenses for health, education,
and infrastructure. The new contracts with foreign oil companies will allow further
developments in the hydrocarbons sector and boost the economy.
7. The authorities are committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability and are aiming
to keep the balance of the public sector positive, while using fiscal expenditure to
enhance the capacity of the economy and reduce poverty, especially in rural areas.
Revenues, expenditures, and the composition of financing are all being addressed in
order to get a more efficient and sustainable public sector.
8. On the revenue side, the measures implemented this year and in late 2006, together
with strong GDP and export growth (mainly in gas), are expected to maintain revenue
over 30 percent of GDP, supported by the recent modifications of gas export prices to
Argentina and Brazil. The authorities are planning to extend the tax base by revising
taxes on the gambling sector and coca leaf production. Implementing or reforming
taxation on other sectors, such as the informal commerce, is under evaluation and the
authorities expect to apply it gradually over the medium term. In addition, other
measures on the administrative side have been implemented to enhance efficiency in
tax collection and increase revenue. Among these measures are special tax audits and
on-site inspections by tax officers.
9. On the expenditure side, the wage bill for top officers was reduced in 2006, which
allowed a reallocation of expenditure favoring education and health. In 2007, some
items on the fiscal budget were suppressed, such as the so-called "Reserves for
Expenditures", which, in the past, was used to finance spending that was neither
transparent nor accountable. Capital expenditure in 2007 is greater than in 2006, in
accordance with the goals of the National Development Plan, which seeks to build
and improve infrastructure, as well as social spending. New and existing public

3
investment projects have been deemed a priority, which mainly involve building
roads to link regions and cities in order to facilitate production and commerce. Since
the authorities are aware of the need to continue the fiscal consolidation efforts, they
have taken decisive actions to improve the quality of expenditures in the medium
term ?particularly those aimed at poverty reduction? as well as to identify priorities to
enable targeting a high social return.
10. Regarding the expenditure of the sub-national governments, the central government
has the capacity to monitor their spending through the financial accounts, in order to
avoid a negative impact on the public sector balance. Moreover, these entities are
subject to the rules of public sector institutions, therefore, their projected expenditures
have to be included in the national budget.
11. The authorities are concerned about the current revenue sharing and expenditure
allocation system that creates structural imbalances between central government and
sub-national governments and undermines the scope for fiscal management. In this
regard, the authorities' objective is to reduce the earmarking problem and their
intention is to deposit the receipts from the difference between the new and current
prices of natural exports of gas to Argentina and Brazil in a fund that will be managed
by the Ministry of Finance. Additionally, the authorities expect that the Constitution
would set new spending obligations for sub-national entities and, consequently, the
central government will be able to reallocate resources to prioritized national projects.
12. With regard to the temporary freeze on fuel prices, while this measure may be
technically considered a backward step, it is necessary in order to avoid adverse
social reactions. Price increases are expected to resume after changing the energy
matrix over the medium term, in order to increase natural gas domestic consumption
and gradually reduce fuel subsidies and smuggling. However, it is not prudent to
move into a fully "automatic" price-adjustment mechanism.
13. The reform of the pension system is still under evaluation but the authorities are fully
aware of the need to preserve macroeconomic stability while finding a means to
address the demands of affiliates who were affected by the pension system reform
implemented in 1996 and are facing difficulties in retiring, due the new requirements
established under the 1996 Pension Law.
Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Policies
14. The conduct of monetary policy is carefully geared towards preserving adequate
liquidity conditions and monitoring inflation developments. As foreign currency
inflows grew rapidly in response to higher exports and remittances, international
reserves have continued to grow strongly during 2006 and 2007 and the base money
has expanded. However, additional Open Market Operations (OMO), and

4
accumulation of public deposits at the Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) -reflecting the
complementariness between fiscal and monetary policies- along with the exchange
rate appreciation have partially offset such an expansion. The base money expansion
remains high, although it has been partially matched by an increase in real demand
for domestic currency, which is related to the strong growth of the economy and the
reduction of financial dollarization. The CBB has absorbed liquidity, mostly in
domestic currency instruments and lengthening maturities, while in the past, mostly
short-term foreign currency denominated securities were available for OMO.
Increased placements in local currency mitigate debt-management risks, and serve as
a means to reduce financial dollarization.
15. The crawling peg regime in the past has contributed to maintaining competitiveness
and the small devaluations were prudent and necessary in order to preserve the health
of the highly-dollarized financial system, thus the crawling peg had mainly gone
towards depreciation in line with the outcomes of the current account. In the context
of increasing foreign currency flows and a positive current account, the CBB reversed
the crawling peg direction to appreciation from July 2005 onwards. Thus, the
exchange rate regime -still a crawling peg one- also contributed to offsetting the trend
in the reserve money, although it affected the competitiveness of exports. Therefore,
recommendations from the staff in this regard are already being applied, and the
government will exercise more exchange rate flexibility as needed to prevent
inflationary pressures, in combination with other anti-inflationary measures. Being a
land-locked country, which still lacks sufficient road infrastructure, Bolivia faces high
costs of transportation, which harms competitiveness of its exports. In the medium
term -as the external and fiscal sectors strengthen- the authorities will consider a more
flexible exchange rate regime.
16. Looking forward, the authorities are conscious that the trend of growing international
reserves will remain in place, therefore, in addition to appreciating the domestic
currency, they are looking for a more dynamic use of OMO, as well developing a set
of measures to offset the corresponding effect on the base money, in order keep
inflation under control. One of these measures would be creating a new CBB security,
which would be issued directly to the public. To implement this measure, the CBB is
preparing a set of necessary conditions, in order to avoid unwanted outcomes.
Another measure the authorities will put in place is expanding the use of bank
accounts for employees (approximately 340,000), whose salaries are not yet delivered
through the banking system.
17. Moreover, the authorities have decided to allow Pension Fund Administrators to
increase the share of their portfolio invested abroad from 3 percent to 13 percent. This
change will help to offset partly the accumulation of international reserves. If
necessary, the authorities could increase that share up to 50 percent, as stated in the
Pension Law. Additionally, the Central Bank will introduce higher legal reserve

requirements and adjust the policy interest rate.
18. The financial sector stability has improved as it showed positive growth in 2006 and
2007, nonperforming loans have reduced, provisions have increased, and profitability
has also improved. Despite these achievements, the authorities are aware of the
remaining vulnerabilities in some of the entities of the banking system and close
supervision will be applied. Credit risk regulations are serving well even for those
borrowers that generate revenues in domestic currency and are affected by the
depreciation of the exchange rate. Additionally, the Bank's Superintendence is
preparing new prudential regulations to deal with market risk and it is working on the
2003 FSAP recommendations. Financial dollarization has significantly decreased in
Bolivia from 90 percent in December 2003 to 73 percent in June 2007. This evolution
is a consequence of the recent developments in the real and fiscal sectors, the trend of
the exchange rate, the widening of the spread between the buying and selling
exchange rate, the financial transaction tax ?which is now levied only on foreign
currency denominated operations? and the settling of inflation-indexed financial
instruments.
Development Policy and Structural Reforms
19. Development of the hydrocarbons sector is a key factor to Bolivia's future and to
attaining a sustainable reduction in poverty levels. Being aware of this, the authorities
are doing their utmost to put in place a framework for the exploitation of their vast
hydrocarbons reserves, allowing room for private investment, both foreign and
domestic. The authorities' ultimate goal is to arrive at a framework that promotes the
development of the sector, with the proper checks and balances in place to ensure a
fair share of the benefits for the Bolivian people.
20. The state oil company (YPFB) is again the main player in the sector and it will be
strengthened and capitalized for conducting investments, on its own or in association
with friendly governments or other foreign enterprises. The finalization of
negotiations and signing of new contracts between YPFB and foreign oil companies
that already were operating in Bolivia shows that the government is willing to
welcome foreign investment in the hydrocarbon sector as a partnership or another
type of contract. This achievement has also reduced social tensions and has
empowered the executive branch with the popular backing for this new framework.
Foreign investment diminished in 2006, but it will expand from 2007 onwards
because of the once new contracts, which allow investors a faster investment
recovery; therefore, foreign investors have incentives to additional investments and to
continuing operating in Bolivia. Moreover, unlike the former ones, the Congress
approved these new contracts, which confer them a real legal safety.
21. Mining is another key sector for the Bolivian economy; therefore, it was necessary to

6
revise the operating framework that allows a sustainable development over the
medium and long term for both private and public enterprises. Thus, the government
has decided to modify the royalties and tax regimes so the Ministry of Finance gets a
fair share of the boom of this sector, while allowing private enterprises to continue
operating under these new rules. Additionally, the authorities are about to sign a
contract with an international company that will enable the exploitation and
industrialization of the great deposits of iron in the east of the country. This contract
will positively impact the current account from the year 2010 onwards.
22. The public policy applied in those sectors sought to correct severe biases and
distortions of the privatization contracts signed between 1993 and 1996, which led to
an unfair share for the Bolivian state. Such a situation was politically unsustainable,
because of the emerged discontent; therefore, those contracts had to be renegotiated
according to the current Bolivian legal framework. This policy has been only applied
to the privatized enterprises, while in the rest of the private sector the legal
framework was not -and by no means will be- modified by neither the Executive nor
the Constitutional Assembly; hence, there are no disincentives for private
entrepreneurs. This issue was used politically and was wrongly related to the
hydrocarbons and mining policy.
23. The government has started to implement its five-year National Development Plan.
This plan is based on four strategies: economic aimed to increase productivity; socialcommunity oriented to improve the social safety net; international relationship aimed
to enhance the external sector in economic, political, and cultural ambits; and social
empowerment oriented to strengthen democracy through promoting social inclusion.
24. The authorities are aware that private investment is important to growth and job
creation, so they emphasize that public investment in other economic sectors will be
just complementary to private investment. In this vein, the government supports the
enlargement of small and medium-sized companies, facilitating them credit access.
These sectors are labor intensive and their expansion would help reduce
unemployment, which is the major cause of poverty. To promote private investment,
the government has established a second-tier public development bank (BDP) to
finance micro-entrepreneurships, preserving competition within the financial system.
In addition, the government is engaged in obtaining access to foreign markets for
non-traditional exports and has obtained an extension of the Andean Trade Preference
Drug Eradication Act (APTDEA) in the United States Congress, which enables dutyfree access to United States markets for a number of nontraditional Bolivian exports.
25. Regarding the land tenure, in 2006, Congress already modified the Land Law to
implement a redistribution of unproductive or illegally obtained land, to improve its
use and increase employment in rural areas. Therefore, no further developments

7
should be expected in this regard in the Constitutional Assembly.
26. The overall performance of Bolivia's economy should not only be considered a result
of the positive 2006 international environment, but also a consequence of
macroeconomic policies and changes in the relationship with foreign companies
operating in Bolivia, which have contributed to reduce Bolivia's vulnerabilities. As
already stated, monetary and fiscal policies were sound and adequately managed in
order to keep inflation under control. The change in the government's relationship
with foreign oil companies led to higher fiscal revenue and a considerable fiscal
surplus, which made it possible to implement new programs to address the need for
helping the poor, like the incentives provided to low-income class students for
encouraging school attendance. The government intends to continue on the same path
of fiscal discipline and pro-poor and pro-growth development policies.
