REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation
with the Republic of Croatia
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Michele Shannon
May 21, 2009

Discussions. Zagreb, March 26 to April 7, 2009. The mission met with Prime Minister Sanader;
Minister of Economy Polančec; Finance Minister Šuker; Croatian National Bank (CNB) Governor
Rohatinski; other senior officials; and representatives of social partners, think tanks, and the
private sector. A press conference was held at the end of the mission.
Team: Messrs. Arvanitis (head), Atoyan, Jafarov (all EUR), Prokopenko (MCM), and Rother
(SPR). Mr. Galac (OED) also joined the discussions.
Consultation focus: The discussions focused on the impact of the global economic and financial
turmoil on Croatia, and on policies needed to maintain financial and external stability and pave
the way for sustained recovery.
Policy advice. The staff report advocates: (i) a cautionary monetary policy stance until external
pressures abate to support the authorities’ exchange rate strategy in this period of heightened
uncertainty; (ii) spending restraint to achieve the budget target and alleviate pressures on domestic
credit markets; (iii) careful monitoring of the banks’ credit portfolio, including through diagnostic
reviews of banks, and preemptive measures to strengthen the banking system; (iv) continuing and
further enhancing cooperation with foreign parent banks and their supervisors to ensure adequate
external financing; (v) upgrading the framework for resolution of impaired assets; and
(vi) advancing structural reforms to raise potential growth and reduce external imbalances.
The authorities’ position: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s diagnosis and noted that
financial stability was their key priority. There was broad agreement on the monetary framework
and policy requirements, and the authorities noted steps taken to strengthen banking oversight and
high frequency monitoring of banks. They also stressed their effort to contain the fiscal deficit in
2008 and in 2009, including through spending cuts. Structural reforms remain an important policy
objective.
Exchange rate: De jure managed float with no predetermined path; de facto other managed float
under the Fund’s classification. Croatia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange rate free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions.

I. CONTEXT
1.
Strong capital flows and rapid credit growth in recent years helped Croatia
reach high levels of prosperity, but also increased vulnerabilities. Annual GDP growth
accelerated to 4–5 percent, per capita incomes advanced further toward the EU average, and
unemployment declined to the lowest levels since Croatia’s independence (Table 1). But
domestic and external imbalances also widened considerably. Rapid credit growth led to a
significant debt build-up; prevalent foreign currency borrowing aggravated balance sheet
vulnerabilities; and booming domestic demand led to surging trade deficits, moderated only
partially by strong tourism earnings.
2.
Policies aimed to lessen the imbalances, but limitations soon became evident. A
stable exchange rate helped keep inflation and inflation expectations low (notwithstanding a
temporary blip in early 2008 due to the spike in food and energy prices) but was also
conducive to unhedged foreign currency borrowing. The authorities aimed for a balanced
budget by 2010–11, but the fiscal stance lacked sufficient force to ease demand pressures.
Banking supervision and regulation were strengthened in 2007–08, but proved to be only
partially effective in restraining the strong credit demand. The need for structural reforms
was well acknowledged, but their implementation was slow (Box 1 discusses the authorities’
reaction to past Fund advice).
3.
Croatia is now in the midst of a sharp adjustment, with external factors
aggravating existing imbalances. Markedly lower private capital inflows and tight domestic
credit conditions force domestic demand to contract while plummeting external demand
exacerbates pressures on the tradable sector. Economic activity is decelerating fast, with
manufacturing production, construction, and exports declining sharply (Figure 1).
4.
Risks to financial stability have increased. External vulnerabilities remain
substantial, with a large stock of external debt and sizable external financing needs in 2009
and 2010; concerns are mounting about the private sector’s ability to meet its obligations;
and the financial sector is highly vulnerable to deteriorating cross border funding conditions
and worsening credit portfolios.
5.
Thus far, a robust policy response has helped Croatia navigate the crisis
relatively well. In the face of a fluid situation, a proactive and forceful monetary policy has
succeeded in maintaining the orderly functioning of markets and averting destabilizing
pressures on the kuna. A revised budget adopted in April provided a more realistic
framework for 2009. However, downside risks are significant in the period ahead as the
declining economy and financing constraints start to feed on each other.
6.
Against this background, this year’s Article IV consultation focused on ways to deal
with the current challenges and help the economy to emerge more resilient from the crisis.

5
Box 1. Croatia’s Reaction to Past IMF Advice
Croatia and the IMF have an excellent working relationship and a constructive policy dialogue.
The authorities maintained a tightly managed exchange rate regime, in light of balance sheet
exposures, and recognized the constraints this imposes on fiscal and structural policies to
ensure adequate demand restraint and boost export growth and productivity. In this context, the
headline general government budget balance was reduced in 2007–08, although budget revenue
overperformance was partially spent, instead of saved as staff recommended. On financial
sector policies, there was broad agreement on the need to strengthen prudential regulations to
ensure adequate risk management in banks, but differences emerged on the nature of some
administrative lending controls that staff advised against. The recommendations of the recent
FSAP Update have been broadly implemented (Appendix I). On structural reforms, progress
has been slow and Croatia still lags behind most other peer countries on business environment
indicators. This said, the recently enacted health care reforms help relieve pressures and bring
the system closer to sustainability.
At the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultations (concluded on May 16, 2008), Executive
Directors welcomed strong economic growth in recent years, accompanied by improvements in
policies. They noted in particular, the reduction in the general government deficit and
continued strengthening of financial supervision. Concerns focused mainly on rising external
imbalances, pointing out to the need for continued policy efforts to mitigate resulting
imbalances and create an environment conducive to sustained high growth.

II. BALANCE SHEET VULNERABILITIES AND STRAINS

8.
Large current account deficits and external debt. While a part of financial inflows
was in the form of FDI, external borrowing increased rapidly. To some extent, this was an
inadvertent side effect of measures to rein in domestic credit growth, as corporates switched
increasingly to external borrowing. Much of the external flows went into consumption and
nontradables (construction, real estate, and wholesale and retail trade), feeding into higher
imports and a widening current account deficit. At 83 percent of GDP (200 percent of
exports), total external debt is relatively large. More importantly, external liabilities maturing
in 2009 amount to €13 billion (some 29 percent GDP) giving rise to liquidity risks in the
current adverse financial environment.

Rapid credit growth, although more
contained than in peer countries. Banks,
mostly foreign owned, were instrumental in
intermediating capital inflows. With easy
access to external funding and ample capital
injections from parent banks—to avoid
regulatory costs on foreign borrowing—bank
credit as a share of GDP increased steadily
from 53 percent in 2002 to 77 percent in 2008.
About half of the loans were distributed to the
household sector. While bank loans to the
corporate sector are sufficiently diversified,
the share of manufacturing or exportenhancing sectors is relatively small.

Significant balance sheet exposures to exchange rate risk. Lower interest rates on
foreign borrowing and foreign currency denominated loans became increasingly attractive for
private sector borrowers, even if the private sector had no financial or natural hedges. About
three quarters of corporate debt and 90 percent of household debt are external and foreign
currency-denominated. Only a small fraction of bank loans (about 5 percent of household and
9 percent of corporate loans) are hedged. To some extent, high euroization of financial assets
mitigates these foreign currency exposures. In particular, large foreign currency deposits by

7
households reduce currency mismatches at the aggregate level, although there could still be
mismatches at the individual level between borrowers and depositors. Net foreign currency
liabilities of the nonfinancial corporates remain large at around 50 percent of GDP.

Banks are well capitalized but vulnerable. At end-2008, the aggregate capital
adequacy ratio of the banking sector was 14.5 percent (vs. the regulatory minimum of
10 percent). This reflected the long-lasting preference of foreign parent banks to inject capital
in their Croatian subsidiaries rather than to extend loans, which until recently were subject to
high marginal reserve and foreign currency liquidity requirements. The level of
nonperforming loans is relatively low (about 5 percent of total loans), with the
nonperforming loans net of provisions standing at around 12 percent of the capital. These
good indicators notwithstanding, banks are vulnerable to funding and credit risks.

Funding risk. While the loan-to-deposit
ratio of Croatian banks of 113 percent
compares favorably to that of other
countries in the region, banks also
became increasingly dependent on
foreign funding. About one quarter of all
bank liabilities is due to nonresidents
(mainly to parent banks, concentrated in
Italy, Austria, and Germany).2 This has
increased their vulnerability to external
developments and contagion risks, both

Credit risk. Although bank balance sheet mismatches in foreign currencies or interest
rate are small, the large currency and interest rate exposures of the private sector
could translate into credit risk for banks. The results of the most recent stress tests
conducted by the CNB reaffirm banks’ vulnerability to credit risk, particularly risks
induced by an exchange rate depreciation.

III. COMPETITIVENESS CONCERNS
13.
A long period of nominal exchange rate stability accompanied by large trade
deficits raise concerns about the adequacy of Croatia’s competitiveness. These are
amplified by the recent strong depreciation of several competitor country currencies.
14.
The evidence on external competitiveness is mixed. On the one hand, the real
exchange rate has appreciated only moderately over the past decade compared to other CEE
countries. Moreover, standard IMF analysis suggests that the real exchange rate is not
significantly misaligned (Box 2).3 However, the export sector has benefited little from the
strong capital inflows (including FDI) experienced in recent years, and has been stifled by
long-standing structural issues, an unfriendly business environment, and relatively high unit
labor costs (Figure 2). Unlike in neighboring countries, the share of Croatia’s small and
narrow export sector in GDP remained flat over the past decade, and Croatia’s share in world
and EU imports has stagnated (Figure 3). As a result, growing imports responding to a
consumption and inward-oriented investment boom, gave rise to large trade and current
account deficits. Although the current environment is forcing a significant current account

The public sector balance sheet is
relatively robust, although less so than
elsewhere in the region. At around 34 percent
of GDP, the government’s total debt is
moderate. About two thirds of this debt is in
foreign currency. Including liabilities of

state guarantees raises the total public debt to

adjustment (trade data for the first two months of 2009 suggest exports falling by 15 percent

tradable sector performance so that it can take up the slack from the nontradable economy.

Box 2. Assessing Croatia’s Real Exchange Rate
Quantitative estimates of misalignment suggest that Croatia’s real exchange rate is close to its
equilibrium, with most calculations indicating a modest overvaluation in the 2–3 percent range.
These point estimates, however, need to be interpreted with caution given large uncertainty
regarding structural changes and the pattern of capital flows in the years ahead.
Macroeconomic balance approach. The current account ‘norm’ was estimated based on the
CGER panel regression coefficients (Croatia is included in the sample used in the panel
regression). The underlying current

(ii) translating this difference into an exchange rate adjustment consistent with bringing the CA
balance to its NFA-stabilizing level. Acknowledging the difficulties involved in determining an
adequate NFA target with precision, the table above shows equilibrium current account balances
for a variety of plausible levels conditional on the economy’s growth performance. The analysis
suggests that even in the case of a very conservative NFA target of -34 percent of GDP, which is
less than half of Croatia’s current NFA level, the degree of exchange rate overvaluation would
remain below 5 percent.

11
IV. MACRO-FINANCIAL CHALLENGES
15.
The combination of adverse feedback loops between vulnerabilities, primarily in
private balance sheets, deteriorating financial conditions and a weakening economy, give rise
to a number of policy challenges in the period ahead.
A. External Funding and Financial Stability
16.
While the impact of the global financial turbulence on Croatia was relatively
limited in the first part of 2008, financial pressures intensified quickly in the second half
of the year.
•

Financial asset prices became very volatile after October 2008, sovereign spreads shot
up, and the Zagreb stock market plunged (Figure 4).

•

External financing conditions tightened and the strong inflow of private external debt
came to an abrupt halt in late 2008.

Financial market jitters, including
uncertainties about the financial
health of parent banks, escalated to a
mini bank run in October. Domestic
banks responded to these pressures
by increasing their foreign financing
and, since January, by drawing down
their foreign assets, facilitated by
regulatory changes.

In the fragile post-October environment, monetary policy was geared to support
financial stability and maintain a broadly stable kuna. The CNB addressed emerging
liquidity shortages through active use of regulatory requirements and repo auctions, while it
maintained policy rates (the repo auction rate) broadly stable at 6 percent (Box 3 for a list of
measures). This together with intermittent intervention that resulted in a reserve loss of
€0.9bn between September 2008 and March 2009 succeeded in stabilizing markets,
strengthening confidence, and limiting the depreciation of the kuna against the euro
(Figure 5). More recently, and particularly in late March and April, market sentiment started
to show signs of improvement, spreads declined from their recent highs, and the exchange
rate appreciated somewhat since March 2009.

Box 3. Financial Measures in Response to the Crisis
•

The amount of guaranteed bank deposit was increased from HRK 100,000 (€14,000) to
HRK 400,000 (€56,000) in October 2008, after banks experienced a spate of household deposit
withdrawals. In addition, the parliament authorized the government to increase the limit further
if necessary. Together with adequate support from the CNB and parent banks, this measure
helped stop and reverse deposit withdrawals.

•

The marginal reserve requirement on banks’ foreign borrowing was eliminated in
October 2008. This facilitated attraction of new funds from parent banks abroad.

•

The general reserve requirement was reduced from 17 percent to 14 percent in December 2008,
and the foreign currency liquidity ratio was lowered in three steps from 32 percent in May 2008
to 20 percent, releasing liquidity in the system. In February, the CNB increased the limit on
banks’ open foreign exchange position from 20 percent to 30 percent. The resulting increase in
bank liquidity helped stabilize the foreign exchange market and improve domestic credit
conditions, and facilitated a €750 million syndicated loan of six domestic banks to the
government.

•

The CNB has tightly managed kuna liquidity through its weekly reverse repo transactions. In
December 2008, the CNB increased the kuna share of allocation of reserve requirements on FX
deposits from 50 percent to 75 percent to boost demand for kuna. These measures helped
reduce selling pressure on the kuna, at the expense of increased volatility of interest rates on the
interbank money market.

•

In November 2008, the CNB simplified rules for bank access to the emergency liquidity
assistance. This provided a signaling effect on the capacity of the CNB to act quickly, even
though this facility has not been used so far.

•

The government stepped up efforts to secure funds for the state development bank, HBOR,
from international institutions to support exporters and SMEs.

•

The authorities impressed upon banks the importance of keeping their profits in Croatia.

B. Public Finances Under Pressure
19.
Revenues have been weakening rapidly and budget financing has turned
increasingly difficult (Table 2).
•

While revenue was buoyant for most of 2008, this situation turned around in
late-2008. Tax revenue, particularly VAT and excises, started to underperform
reflecting collapsing trade volumes and softening economic activity. For 2008 as a

2008.4 Overall, the general
government budget deficit declined to 0.9 percent of GDP, compared with the budget
target of 1.1 percent of GDP.

•

Revenue underperformance continued in 2009. Budgetary pressures and lack of
access to foreign financing forced the government to increase its domestic borrowing,
increasingly in foreign currency.

•

The authorities initially adopted a general government deficit target of 0.9 percent of
GDP for 2009, but the worsening economic outlook made the budget approved in late
December 2008 increasingly untenable. A revised budget was approved in April (see
discussion in ¶38).
C. Credit Constraints and Solvency Concerns

20.
Domestic credit growth has held up, but headline numbers mask a significant
shift in the structure of credit. Since December 2008, government borrowing has increased
significantly, offsetting a steady retrenchment of lending to households (Table 3). Corporate
borrowing has remained high, as corporates have increasingly shifted toward domestic
sources of financing. In the absence of new foreign funding, bank competition for deposits

has increased. In March–April, interest rates on new deposits doubled to 6.5–7 percent from
3.7 percent in September 2008.

21.
Lending conditions are likely to become tighter. With increased public sector
demand for credit, tightening lending standards, and higher risk aversion, credit constraints
are likely to emerge. Corporates (households) are likely to experience pressures on both sides
of their balance sheet as sales (income) come under pressures while the cost of funding has
increased. The deepening recession and tightening of funding conditions will likely cause
nonperforming loans to increase.
22.
The intensification of financial euroization is a reflection of higher risk
perceptions. Foreign currency deposit now accounts for over 60 percent of all deposits, and
almost all new lending in 2009 is linked to foreign currencies (Figure 6).

V. OUTLOOK
23.
With the global environment and domestic conditions unsettled, projections are
subject to an unusual high degree of uncertainty. Real GDP growth has been marked
down to -3.5 percent for 2009 on the back of declining consumption and investment. As
prospects for a recovery in Europe and normalization of financial markets are fragile, growth
is expected to remain subdued in 2010 (0.3 percent), weighed down further by weak
domestic demand conditions (Table 4). Inflation is projected remain low in the coming years
(under 3 percent), in view of downward pressures on prices from the output gap.
24.
The current account deficit is projected to shrink considerably, but would still
leave significant external financing needs, exceeding €16 billion in 2009 and €13 billion
in 2010 (Tables 5–7).
•

Private capital inflows are projected to cover most of the external financing needs.
These would decline sharply but remain positive, with (i) sizable FDI inflows
reflecting mainly retained earnings of foreign banks and corporates; (ii) a moderate
drawdown of bank foreign assets; and (iii) rollover of about 90 percent of maturing
debt, reflecting recent experience and strong commitments from parent firms to
maintain exposure to local subsidiaries and corporate clients. The public sector is
assumed to place a eurobond and increase its access to financing from the World
Bank, the European Investment Bank, and other multilaterals. External financing
conditions would normalize in 2010. Under these assumptions, central bank reserves
would fall by about €1.6 billion in 2009 and €0.6 billion in 2010.

•

Potential deviations from this path are possible, both on the upside but particularly on
the downside if the ongoing global financial turmoil were to persist or deepen. An
alternative scenario highlights the sensitivity of the outlook to changes in the behavior
of Croatia’s foreign creditors. Assuming that banks could only rollover 85 percent
and non-FDI corporates only 60 percent of their long-term debt (and 95 percent and
80 percent of their respective short-term debt) in the remainder of the year (with
assumptions for the current account and FDI unchanged), the loss of central bank
reserves would increase to €2.5 billion in 2009, reducing the reserve cover of shortterm debt (by residual maturity) to about 60 percent.

25.
The authorities broadly agreed with the risk assessment in the staff’s analysis.
Ministry of Finance officials considered that a softer growth downturn of about 2 percent
could still be possible, based on expectations of stronger recovery in the second half of the
year. CNB officials, however, were more pessimistic, concerned with downside risks, and
expect a GDP contraction of 4 percent. Private sector forecasts ranged between -2 and
-5 percent while the consensus forecast centered at -3 percent. The authorities considered the
staff’s financing assumptions under the baseline and particularly under the alterative scenario
to be overly pessimistic.

VI. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

27.
Given the risks in the current juncture, discussions centered on policies to increase the
resilience of the economy to the ongoing turmoil and reduce vulnerabilities.
A. Preserving Market Stability and Anchoring Expectations
28.
Exchange rate and financial stability remain at the center of the authorities’
policies. They view these two as interlinked and inseparable objectives. While some limited
exchange rate flexibility has been allowed in recent months, the authorities are determined to
avoid a sharp exchange rate depreciation that could lead to large balance sheet effects
undermining financial stability and cause a sharp adjustment in inflation expectations. They
are aware that the large current account deficits in recent years would need to be reduced to
more sustainable levels. But they noted that fiscal consolidation to contain domestic
absorption and structural reforms to improve export competitiveness and support shifting
resources from the nontradable to the tradable sector can help deliver this adjustment.
29.
Staff acknowledged the difficult trade-offs involved in deciding on the exchange
rate policy. On the one hand, the existing policy has provided a valuable nominal anchor,
there is little evidence of a significant exchange rate misalignment, and a sharp depreciation
could have large balance sheet effects. On the other hand, rising labor costs in combination
with exchange rate depreciation in some neighboring countries risk eroding competitiveness,
hampering growth potential, and widening imbalances in the future. Staff emphasized that
the authorities’ exchange rate strategy would require securing adequate external financing
and strong macroeconomic policies to bolster market confidence. In addition, crisis
management should not detract from the urgent need to make swift progress with structural
reforms.

17
30.
In the near term, a cautious monetary policy would be required until balance of
payment pressures abate. The CNB’s active liquidity management through repo auctions
and Lombard loans and relaxation of reserve and liquidity requirements have helped alleviate
tensions. But staff noted that the recent practice of setting the repo rate and rationing the
amount auctioned has led to a nontransparent system and increased interbank market rate
volatility. Staff and the authorities agreed that overall liquidity conditions in the banking
system would need to remain tight, constrained by the need to reduce pressures on the kuna.
Bolstering market confidence is key, including to help prevent further financial euroization.
The latter increases currency risks, undermines the effectiveness of monetary policy, and
limits policy options down the road. Staff viewed the recent increase in the kuna share of
allocation of reserves requirements on FX deposits and lowering of the foreign currency
liquidity ratio as steps in the right direction, providing stronger disincentives to further
euroization.
31.
Tight liquidity conditions, increasing risk premia, and a more cautionary
attitude by banks would likely constrain credit growth. So far, credit growth has been
strong, but could slow down considerably in the period ahead. While the CNB reduced
reserve requirements to ease banks’ lending constraints, the ability of monetary policy to
respond to domestic credit conditions should be carefully weighed against exchange rate
pressures. In this context, fiscal policy would need to be supportive of monetary policy
objectives and the public sector’s borrowing needs should be contained to avoid crowding
out private sector lending.
B. Preparing the Banking Sector for a Difficult Period Ahead
32.
Aided by tight prudential requirements, banks entered the crisis with relatively
strong profitability and capital positions. Strong prudential ratios, including high liquidity
requirements and risk weighting for foreign currency lending, have generated a cushion for
banks (Figure 7, Table 8).
33.
Although the banking sector has been resilient, it remains vulnerable to liquidity
risks. The CNB has intensified its monitoring of liquidity and credit risks and is prepared to
intervene, if necessary, in case of adverse liquidity shocks. Reserve requirements provide
partial liquidity cover of banks’ liabilities and therefore some protection in the event of
liquidity pressures. To expand policy space, the authorities have also simplified and
enhanced access of banks to the CNB’s emergency liquidity assistance window.
34.
The authorities recognize the crucial importance of securing high roll-over rates
on maturing external liabilities to reduce banks’ liquidity risk. To this end, they maintain
close cooperation with foreign parent banks and their home supervisors. Through the first
quarter of 2009, the roll-over rates on liabilities to parent banks have been around
100 percent. But in the current unsettled environment, the prospects of smooth refinancing
can not be assured, including because of regional spillovers, and, therefore, continued
vigilance would be required.

18
35.
The weak macroeconomic outlook requires preventive measures to strengthen
the banking sector. The economy is in unchartered waters, with a dramatic downturn at a
time when corporate and household leverage are at historic high levels. Banks credit
portfolios are likely to weaken in the period ahead. The authorities have strengthened their
stress testing capabilities and have updated these tests recently.5 However, the underlying
assumptions still remain optimistic relative to the economic outlook. It would be important
that the authorities undertake a diagnostic review of the financial condition of all individual
Croatian banks, based on stress tests to identify banks which need to enhance their capital
buffers. These should be required to present a viable program to increase their capital. To
avoid a negative impact on credit growth, the capital increase should be achieved by further
injections by shareholders. In this regard, staff welcomed the intention of the largest banks to
restrict dividend payments.
36.
The authorities have taken steps to improve preparedness to manage a potential
crisis. The CNB should continue to monitor closely bank risk management policies and
lending standards, in order to be able to promptly address any emerging risks. At the same
time, the framework for resolution of troubled assets should be upgraded. The authorities
should proceed with the planned adoption of the new foreclosure law which would help
speed up the resolution of bankruptcies. An efficient foreclosure framework, including
through the introduction of private bailiffs, which is envisaged under this new law, would
complement the voluntary restructuring of problem loans through refinancing and
lengthening of maturities, as contemplated by banks as a first line of defense against the
anticipated increase in distressed assets
37.
The planned formalization of the interagency coordination on crisis
preparedness and management should be advanced. While many elements of Croatia’s
contingency framework to deal with banks in distress are consistent with international best
practices, there is no formalized mechanism for interagency coordination on crisis
preparedness and management.6 A memorandum of understanding between various agencies
dealing with financial stability issues (Ministry of Finance, CNB, HANFA, and deposit
insurance fund) is currently under preparations, and is expected to be adopted shortly. As
other countries’ experience shows, having an ex ante formalized mechanism for
communication among authorities should facilitate effective action.

5

The most recent stress tests conducted by the CNB based on the end-September 2008 data show that banking
sector resilience to macroeconomic shocks is strong. In a scenario of 2 percent decline in GDP and a 10 percent
depreciation of the exchange rate, the nonperforming loan ratio would increase by 120 percent from its low
base, but the capital adequacy ratio would fall by only 2.2 percentage points (see details in the CNB's Financial
Stability Report, No 2, 2009).

6

Recent amendments to the laws on credit institutions and deposit insurance addressed a number of
weaknesses. For example, the legal protection of the CNB was strengthened and the timeline for payments of
insured deposits was shortened.

19
C. Fiscal Discipline Remains Key
38.
The revised budget adopted in
April is targeting a general government
budget deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP.
Compared with the original budget,
revenues are projected to decline by
2.9 percentage points of GDP, mainly on
account of lower VAT and social security
contributions. Spending is set to decline by
2.2 percentage points of GDP, through a
wide range of spending cuts, including a
freeze of salaries of civil servants and state
employees.7

39.
Staff agreed that the deficit target, which implies a cyclical tightening of
1 percent of GDP in 2009, was broadly appropriate. Croatia’s vulnerable external
position, tight domestic financing conditions, and the need to preserve space for crisis-related
contingencies leave little room for a more accommodative stance.
40.
However, a more negative macro outlook than assumed in the budget would
result in a higher deficit. Staff considered that the deficit could exceed 2.0 percent of GDP,
and the discussions focused on risks to budget execution. In particular, the budget is
optimistic in the VAT collection projections and the recent sharp decline in VAT revenues
shows their sensitivity to the economic cycle. Social security contributions may also be lower
than envisaged in the budget, reflecting the rapidly weakening economy. Broader tax
collection efforts could also weaken in the downturn. On the other hand, pressure for more
government spending is very strong. Staff urged the authorities to rein in spending
commitments to achieve the budget deficit objective and avoid the re-emergence of public
sector arrears, which can have damaging ripple effects throughout the economy, undermining
payment discipline. In this context, staff welcomed the recent health sector reforms to
improve cost recovery, including through income-tested increase in co-payments and premia,
aimed at reducing the stock of overdue payments.
41.
To prevent a higher deficit, a strategy should be developed to: (i) contain a
possible decline in taxpayers’ compliance, including by public enterprises, focusing on
highest revenue risks and improving tax administration; and (ii) develop contingency
measures that could be adopted quickly with a supplementary budget. Spending restraint
should be the lynchpin of any adjustment since the expenditure-to-GDP ratio in Croatia is
among the highest in the region, while the tax burden is among the heaviest, discouraging

20
employment and labor force participation. Possible measures include curtailing subsidies;
improving cost recovery for social services; containing the growth of privileged pensions;
better targeting social benefits while protecting the most vulnerable; and scaling back the
public investment program. The authorities noted recent improvements in tax collection and
the increase in the assessment base for social welfare in line with previous staff advice. They
argued that the introduction of tax identification numbers (TIN) and the ongoing upgrading
of information technology at the tax administration office would further support tax efforts
and help better target social benefits.
42.
The budget deficit should be financed without putting undue stress on the
banking system. Staff estimates the gross financing requirement at about 11 percent of GDP,
to which the borrowing requirement of public enterprises for quasi-fiscal operations would
add another 2 percent of GDP. Of this, short-term treasury bills account for about 5 percent
of GDP, which are rolled over as they mature. The February syndicated loan and a planned
eurobond placement in May would cover about 3½ percent of GDP, leaving a residual
borrowing need for the general government of about 2½ percent of GDP. To avoid crowding
out private sector credit, the authorities should advance their efforts to increase absorption of
EU and World Bank funds.
43.
The authorities agreed that a supplementary budget might be needed, but stated
that it was too early to have another revision to the budget. They explained that they
would pursue further expenditure cuts even without a supplementary budget to avoid a
significant deviation from the budget balance, pointing to the experience in late 2008, when
spending cuts more than offset the underperformance of revenues and reduced the budget
deficit below the 2008 budget plan target.
44.
For 2010, there was agreement that the fiscal policy stance needs to be
supportive of the overall policy framework and bolster the structural fiscal position.
The authorities have not yet announced their specific intentions for 2010 given large
uncertainties ahead. Staff’s baseline projections suggest that a (headline) deficit of
2½ percent of GDP could be reached by a modest structural improvement. However, staff
noted that structural reforms would be needed to put public debt back on a declining path and
roll back the weight of the public sector in Croatia’s economy. Given the large share of
entitlements in the budget, civil service reform and rationalization of the structure of
government operations is urgently needed. In addition, the restructuring of loss-making SOEs
should be advanced to reduce subsidies on a permanent basis. Finally, while the pension
system needs to be reformed, staff urged the authorities to refrain from changing the second
pillar of the pension system. This could have a devastating effect on already battered capital
markets and erode investor confidence. Instead, staff recommended reforming the pay-asyou-go Pillar I of the pension system to ensure its sustainability in line with recommendation
of the 2008 IMF report on expenditure rationalization.

21
D. Advancing Structural Reforms
45.
Staff and the authorities agreed about the need to accelerate structural reforms.
In an environment of reduced capital inflows, productivity needs to improve to achieve
growth rates in excess of 4 percent over the medium term as envisaged by the authorities.
There was agreement that the emphasis needs to be given to judicial and administrative
reforms and anti-corruption measures (key areas for strengthening the business environment),
as well as restructuring and privatization of loss-making SOEs, and improving flexibility in
labor markets (Figure 8). On the latter, staff recommended reforms to address incentive
structures both on the (labor) supply and demand side, including measures to reduce
significant labor supply disincentives (e.g., incentives for early retirement and very generous
benefits for parts of the labor force); and measures to boost labor demand by reducing
rigidities in the formal labor market, which are large by regional standards.8 On SOEs, staff
welcomed the authorities’ intention to restructure and privatize the shipyards in 2009 and
urged the authorities to accelerate the restructuring and final privatization of the subsidiaries
of the railroad company and state assets held in the Privatization Fund.9
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Croatia’s recent solid growth performance has been disrupted by the worst
global crisis in sixty years. Confronted with strong headwinds from the regional downturn
and the still unsettled financial markets, domestic demand and trade flows are declining
rapidly and labor markets have begun to soften. Growth is expected to decline by about
3.5 percent in 2009, and to remain sluggish in 2010.
47.
In this fragile juncture, economic and financial stability hinges crucially on the
maintenance of strong policies. Private sector indebtedness swelled during a period of
ample liquidity, with a large part of the financing supporting consumption and nontradable
sectors. Now, vulnerable private sector balance sheets and significant external financing
needs pose risks and constrain policy flexibility. The authorities have the difficult task of
facilitating an orderly private sector adjustment to more sustainable levels of current account
deficit and debt, while cushioning the impact of the crisis. They are determined to keep the
kuna broadly stable. In this period of heightened uncertainty, the current exchange regime
provides a useful anchor. But it is also constraining other policies and limits policy space to
cushion the downturn. Most importantly, it needs to be supported with adequate external
financing, continuing efforts to limit the financing needs of the public sector, and a faster
pace in implementing structural reforms to help the recovery and lessen future external
imbalances.

8

While some progress has been made in increasing labor market flexibility, Croatia has unusually low
participation and employment rates, as well as high rates of youth and long-term unemployment.

9

As of April 2009, the fund’s portfolio comprised 850 companies, in 87 of which the state is a majority owner.

22
48.
Monetary policy has been supportive of external and financial stability. The
policy stance has been tight, while the CNB’s liquidity management operations through repo
auctions and loans and changes in the reserve and liquidity requirements have helped
alleviate liquidity pressures. Cautionary policy should continue until external pressures abate.
49.
The authorities have rightly focused on ensuring adequate external financing.
High debt rollovers are needed to protect bank and corporate balance sheets and thus support
financial stability and a stable exchange rate. The CNB should continue to monitor banks’
debt exposures and maintain already close cooperation with home supervisors of foreign
parent banks. Going forward, rollover risks may become more pronounced particularly in the
corporate sector, including public enterprises. In this regard, it would be important to track
developments closely, using the CNB’s monitoring system to obtain relevant information on
banks and their most important corporate clients.
50.
The financial sector needs vigilant supervision, larger capital buffers, and
measures to strengthen the contingency framework to deal with banks in distress.
Although bank solvency ratios remain satisfactory, the economic downturn will weaken bank
credit quality and increase vulnerabilities. Staff encourages the authorities to undertake a
diagnostic review of the financial conditions of all banks, and those with potential
recapitalization needs should be asked to raise their capital buffers. The authorities should
also proceed with upgrading the framework for resolution of troubled assets and the adoption
of the new foreclosure law to speed up resolution of corporate and household bankruptcies.
Many elements of the contingency framework are consistent with international best practice.
However, the authorities should proceed quickly to adopt a memorandum of understanding
on crisis preparedness and management coordination between various agencies dealing with
financial stability issues to facilitate an effective response if needed.
51.
A strong fiscal policy is key to weathering the crisis. The revised budget deficit
target is appropriate under current circumstances. A cyclical tightening was necessary in
view of tight external conditions and the risk of government financing crowding out lending
to the private sector. Were the creditworthiness of the government to come into question, risk
premia would increase, financing conditions would worsen, and pressures on the currency
would intensify. To achieve the current fiscal target and avoid the re-emergence of public
sector arrears, the authorities will need to rein in spending commitments, including through a
supplementary budget; and develop a strategy to contain a possible decline in taxpayers’
compliance. The financial situation of public enterprises should be carefully monitored to
reduce risks from contingent liabilities.
52.
A credible fiscal position is needed to ensure medium-term sustainability and
maintain market confidence. Reducing budget rigidities and rationalizing public spending
while improving the quality of public services will go a long way toward durably scaling
back the weight of the government in the economy. There is room in 2009 for starting with a
civil service reform, and rationalization of the structure of government operations. Other
desirable measures include improving cost recovery for social services, advancing the
restructuring of loss making SOE to reduce subsidies, streamlining social spending by

23
making use of the recently adopted tax identification numbers, and reforming the first pillar
of the pension system to help ensure its sustainability.
53.
Crisis management should not detract from the need to tackle long standing
structural shortcomings. The economy needs to emerge from the current juncture more
resilient and dynamic. To help raise potential growth and narrow the current account deficits,
faster and deeper reforms are needed to reorient the economy towards the tradable sector.
This involves notably raising labor productivity and improving the business environment.
The privatization of loss making SOEs also needs to be completed swiftly. In this regard, the
restructuring and privatization of the shipyards in 2009 would send a strong signal to
investors, support ongoing EU accession negotiations, and help contain the significant drain
on the public resources.
54.

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV Consultation on a 12-month cycle.

1/ Assets include gross loans, interbank loans, investment portfolio of banks, total interest income, total off-balance sheet claims.
2/ Liquid assets are on a net basis. They include deposits at banks and at the central bank, short-term government and central bank paper,
and overnight loans extended; less required reserve funds, central bank loans received, and overnight loans received. The sharp decline in
liquidity in 2005 coincided with the start of reverse repo operations by the CNB that gave banks market-based access to liquidity when needed.
3/ Commercial banks only. End-year FSIs, based on audited annual financial statements, can differ slightly from quarterly data.
4/ Includes kuna-denominated instruments linked to foreign currencies.
5/ Based on unconsolidated audited financial statements following IAS; not in line with the IMF FSI Compilation Guide.
6/ 2008 data corresponds to the third quarter.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian
dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna
on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and
demand in the interbank market, with tight management by the CNB. Croatia’s de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “other managed arrangement”
from January 1, 2009. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs.
On May 19, 2009 the official exchange rate was kuna 7.379325 per euro (middle
rate).

VIII.

Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for
the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to the
Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision 144(52/51).

IX.

Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on May 9, 2008
(IMF Country Reports Nos. 08/158 and 08/159 available at:
http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm). Croatia is on the 12-month
consultation cycle.

Annex II. Croatia: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though some
improvements would be desirable. While remedial action has been taken to improve data
coverage and reliability in most cases, progress in some instances has been impeded by
insufficient resources and issues regarding coordination among government agencies. Croatia
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
A. National Accounts
2.
The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices
and at constant (2000) prices for the main categories of expenditure and main industry
groupings. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between
expenditure-based and value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of
coordination between the CBS and the Croatian National Bank (CNB) in reconciling tourism
receipts estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the selfemployed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (iii) inadequate data for measuring changes in
inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data
for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector. Other shortcomings include: (i) inadequate
conversion of government finance statistics from a cash to an accrual basis; (ii) inadequate
price deflators; and (iii) late publication of annual data, which show large differences with
quarterly data.
B. Prices
3.
The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a 2005 Household Budget Survey. Between
rebasing, the weights are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are
collected at different time periods in the month for different product groups but in all cases
between the thirteenth and the twenty-first day of each month. The indices are released
around the fifteenth day of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine
towns, but the weights are based on a sample of households in the whole country. A
harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat
methodology, but is not released for the time being to avoid confusion. A core CPI is also
calculated based on a methodology developed by the CNB. The CBS also releases a monthly
producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following month. The weighting
system of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is changed every five
years, while weights are partially corrected every year.
C. Wages and Employment
4.
The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and
employment by sector. Earning data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are

7
based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each
industrial category. They do not cover a significant part of the working population, including
persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, farmers, and the military and police.
5.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A
preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first
time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is
now being conducted on a regular basis. The CBS released semi-annual results from 1998,
and began releasing quarterly results in 2007 with a lag of about four months. The difference
between the survey-based unemployment rate and that based on the registered unemployed
has recently been reduced.
D. Government Finance Statistics
6.
The authorities have started presenting budget plans based on the ESA 95 framework,
but government finance statistics produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM framework
(GFS) have been available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). Data normally come with a lag of 30 days, but recently the lag has been much longer:
the latest observation is from November 2008. While preliminary data were provided to the
mission, the publication of final data would reduce uncertainties around the fiscal policy
stance. Revenue data are reliable, and expenditure data on a cash basis are available
according to GFS classifications (economic and functional) for the central budget and the
budgetary funds. The data on central government financing in the MoF reports are not
reconciled with those in the CNB’s monetary survey and balance of payments data, with
substantial discrepancies owing partly to different methodologies and definitions of
government. Following the recommendations of the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force,
comprising staff from the MoF, CNB, and CBS was formed to reconcile central government
financing data produced by these institutions; after a slow start.
7.
The detailed data on domestic public bonds published in the Monthly Statistical
Review are now augmented by a central government debt table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin,
which also reports stocks of central government guaranteed debt. The MoF prepared a
database with government guarantees in July 2003 that has been used to monitor
developments in the stock and flows of guarantees.
8.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are
available only on a quarterly basis and usually with a lag of 30 days. Recently, the lag has
been much longer, and no data have been available for the period after the second quarter of
2008. Again, while preliminary data were provided to the mission, the publication of final
data would reduce uncertainties around the fiscal policy stance. Local government data are
partial as they include the operations of the 53 largest municipalities. Annual cash data
through 2007 for the general government and its subsectors are published in the 2008 GFS
Yearbook. Up-to-date monthly data for the budgetary central government were reported for
publication in the IFS until November 2008. All data for the GFS Yearbook and IFS have
been reported in the GFSM 2001 framework.

8
E. Monetary Data
9.
Compilation of monetary statistics published by the CNB is consistent with the
recommendations of the IMF’s 2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Data on the monetary survey, including separate records for deposit money banks and the
balance sheet of the CNB, are published monthly with four- and two-week lags, respectively.
The CNB is planning to extend its statistical framework to balance sheet information of
investment funds and insurance companies. In March 2002, the CNB started collecting
financial information (balance sheets and investment structure) from investment and pension
funds; the data are not yet published, but used for internal purposes. According to the CNB,
the inclusion of other financial corporations in monetary statistics depends on the
harmonization process of the monetary statistics with the statistical reporting requirements of
the European Central Bank. In November 2006, the CNB reported monetary data in the
format of Standardized Report Forms for December 2001 to the present. These data accord
with the concepts and definitions in MFSM and were published, along with the corresponding
metadata, in IFS and the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
F. External Sector Statistics
10.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data are generally available with a lag of
two months and are subject to substantial revisions in subsequent releases; trade data are
available with a lag of one month and data on international reserves are available the next
day on request. Travel survey methodologies were modified in 2002, 2004, and again
in 2005, while the method for estimating the cost of insurance and freight was modified in
early 2004. The most recent modification of tourism revenue contributed to an upward
revision of the current account deficit for 2004 equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP. Net errors
and omissions have ranged from 2½ to 3¾ percent of GDP since 2003, and are negative. The
coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and accurate.
11.
A large part of external debt was contracted prior to the dissolution of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and
London Club creditors in 1995 and 1998, respectively. The CNB compiles external debt data
according to the requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and
Users, 2003, and began disseminating external debt data in the second quarter of 2003. The
inclusion of hybrid and subordinated debt instruments, repos, late interest, and interest
accruals and arrears has caused an upward adjustment in the external debt series compared to
previously released data. Quarterly data on the international investment position are available
on the CNB website up to 2008:Q4.

Annex III. Croatia: World Bank Relations
1.
The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia
for FY09–12 in September 2008, just before the full onset of the global financial crisis. The
goal of the CPS is to support the completion of Croatia’s EU accession process, the rapid
convergence of its income level with that of current EU member states in a fiscally, socially
and environmentally sustainable fashion. This overarching goal is in line with the
Government’s priorities expressed in various government programs. In pursuing this goal,
the Bank Group program aims at contributing in the following four areas:
•
•
•
•

sustaining macroeconomic stability;
strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU;
improving the quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and
increasing the sustainability of long-term development.

2.
The EU accession agenda remains a cross-cutting theme in the design and
implementation of the Bank Group program. In the selection and design of operations,
primary consideration is given to the assessment of proposed projects’ support of Croatia’s
EU accession agenda. In the case of social sectors not covered under the EU acquis,
consideration is also given to how projects complement the EU accession efforts. Project
components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds, especially following the
accession, have high priority.
3.
The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$1.0–
1.4 billion for investment operations over the four-year period. The CPS also includes an
upside scenario, with possible development policy lending amounting to some US$1.4–
1.8 billion. The lending program will be based on and complemented by analytical work,
particularly in the areas of public expenditure reform, governance, investment climate, and
climate change.
4.
In FY09, the Bank’s Board has already approved three loans exceeding
US$240 million, for the continuation of the Rijeka gateway and coastal cities pollution
control programs, and for the improvement of emergency medical services, as well as a GEF
grant. At the request of the authorities, to help mitigate the impact of the global economic
crisis and provide funding for the private sector, the Bank has agreed to prepare a credit line
of about EUR100 million for exporters, through HBOR, the Croatian development bank, and
commercial banks. Other projects under preparation focus on judicial reforms, disaster risk
management and mitigation, port development, irrigation, and education. This program might
be adjusted, if necessary, to help address the consequences of the global economic downturn.
5.
Currently, the World Bank finances 18 operations in a wide range of sectors with a
combined loan amount of close to US$1.1 billion. IFC’s portfolio amounts to about
US$340 million, and MIGA guarantees exceed US$40 million.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 15, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Croatia
On June 2, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Croatia. 1
Background
The global crisis brought an end to Croatia’s multi-year economic expansion. After reaching
5.5 percent in 2007, GDP growth decelerated to 2.4 percent in 2008 and the downdraft
intensified further in the first months of 2009. Domestic demand and exports started to contract
on the back of sharply diminished capital inflows and deepening recession in the EU and other
regional trading partners. For the year as a whole, staff projects real GDP to decline by 3½
percent. Weighed down by weak domestic and external conditions, GDP is expected to grow
only slightly in 2010.
The crisis exposed underlying vulnerabilities in Croatia’s economy. As elsewhere in the region,
the high growth rates relied on an unsustainable credit boom, facilitated by easy access to
domestic and foreign financing, notwithstanding prudential and other credit measures taken by
the authorities to curb credit growth. External debt reached high levels, with banks and
corporates increasingly dependent on foreign funding. At the same time, domestic debt also
swelled rapidly, predominantly in foreign currencies and mostly by unhedged borrowers.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Croatia is now in the midst of a sharp adjustment. A robust policy response has helped Croatia
navigate the crisis relatively well, but downside risks remain significant. While the external
imbalances are receding from the previous high levels, the adverse economic and financial
conditions feed on each other, amplifying the downturn, reducing access to much needed
external financing to cover sizable external liabilities maturing in 2009–10, and eroding the
private sector’s debt servicing capacity. While banks have comfortable cushions from relatively
strong profitability and capital positions, the vulnerability of the domestic financial sector to
external funding and credit risks has increased.
In response, the Central Bank of Croatia (CNB) has taken a number of measures to maintain
the orderly functioning of markets, avert destabilizing pressures on the kuna, and help address
the fallout of the crisis on the financial system. In particular, the CNB addressed liquidity
shortages through active use of regulatory requirements, repo auctions, and intermittent
foreign currency intervention. It maintained close cooperation with foreign banks to secure
adequate external funding and reduce banks’ liquidity risk. And it strengthened the oversight
and monitoring of the banking system and upgraded stress test exercises. While these
measures succeeded in stabilizing markets and preparing the banking system for the
challenges ahead, heightened uncertainty has fueled deposit and loan euroization.
Fiscal policy has been under pressure. Revenues, especially VAT and excises, started to
underperform in late 2008, reflecting sharply lower trade volumes and declining economic
activity. In response, the government reduced cash spending on goods and services, limiting
the 2008 general government deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP. Based on a wide range of
spending cuts, including a freeze of salaries, the revised budget for 2009 aims for a deficit of
1.6 percent of GDP, entailing a cyclical tightening. However, the fiscal deficit is likely to widen
to above 2 percent in 2009 due to a further deterioration of macroeconomic conditions. The
government’s domestic borrowing has recently risen sharply, with the government increasingly
competing for resources with the private sector in the current tight credit environment.
Structural reforms remain an important policy objective and key to help the economy emerge
from the current crisis more resilient and dynamic. However, recent progress has been slow,
and Croatia still lags other central and eastern European countries on business environment
indicators.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, along with other countries in the region, Croatia has been
severely affected by the global economic downturn and the continuing strains in financial
markets. Real GDP is expected to contract this year—for the first time since 1999. Sharply
lower capital inflows have triggered a correction in the external imbalances built up in recent
years, but they also amplify pressures on the private sector in view of its relatively large debt
overhang and sizable external financing needs.
Directors commended the authorities for the timely and well-targeted policy response, which
has helped to maintain market confidence and mitigate the initial impact of the crisis. Monetary
policy, including through liquidity operations and changes in reserve and liquidity requirements,

3
has helped to alleviate liquidity pressures on banks and supported a broadly stable exchange
rate. Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals, and considered that, in the current uncertain juncture, the
authorities’ exchange rate policy has helped anchor macroeconomic stability, particularly in the
presence of large balance-sheet exposures to currency risk. At the same time, the exchange
rate strategy limits policy options to cushion the downturn, and a cautionary monetary policy
will need to be continued until external pressures abate. Moreover, this exchange rate policy
also requires adequate external financing and support from prudent fiscal and financial sector
policies, as well as faster implementation of structural reforms to bolster competitiveness.
Attention to competitiveness issues was seen as important especially in view of recent strong
depreciations of several competitor country currencies.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to secure adequate external financing. They
underlined the need for continued monitoring of banks’ liquidity positions and close
cooperation between domestic banks and their foreign parent banks, as well as between home
and host supervisors. Directors welcomed the rollover arrangements in the banking sector,
but cautioned that rollover risks in the corporate sector are particularly pronounced, underlining
the importance of tracking developments closely.
The banking sector remains resilient, with relatively strong profitability and capital positions,
aided by prudent regulatory requirements. However, loan quality could suffer as the recession
deepens and financing conditions tighten. Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake a
diagnostic review of the financial conditions of all banks, and to require those with potential
recapitalization needs to raise capital buffers. The framework for resolution of troubled assets
could also be upgraded, including through a swift adoption of the new foreclosure law. While
many elements of Croatia’s contingency framework to deal with banks in distress are
consistent with international best practice, Directors saw scope for improving interagency
coordination on crisis preparedness and management.
Directors considered the cyclical tightening envisaged in the revised 2009 budget appropriate
in light of the tight financing conditions. They welcomed the recent eurobond issue, which
signals investor confidence in the authorities’ policies and helps reduce the government’s
domestic financing needs. However, in view of the downside risks to revenue collection,
spending commitments should be reined in, and a strategy should be developed to contain a
possible decline in taxpayers’ compliance and to avoid the re-emergence of public sector
arrears. Looking forward, Directors stressed the importance of rationalizing public spending
without unduly compromising the delivery of public services. They welcomed the authorities’
actions to improve public financial management, and encouraged stepped up efforts to
modernize the civil service, improve cost recovery for social services, reduce subsidies, and
better target social spending.
Accelerating structural reforms is crucial to raise productivity growth, boost Croatia’s growth
potential, and facilitate real adjustment by reorienting resources towards the tradable sector.
Directors stressed the importance of further improving the business environment, advancing
labor market flexibility, and swiftly completing the restructuring and privatization of loss-making
state-owned enterprises.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for the Republic of Croatia
and Tomislav Galac, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 2, 2009
Croatia’s first priority for the past several years has been implementation of far-reaching
administrative, social, and economic reforms aimed at benefiting optimally from the
country’s ongoing European integration. This process has been progressing well in the areas
of trade and investment for a number of years, while political integration reached its first
milestone with Croatia becoming a full member of NATO in April 2009. The authorities are
working arduously to complete the remaining legislative reforms in the context of the
ongoing EU accession negotiations by the end of this year, and prepare for their future
practical implementation.
The Croatian authorities value their continuing cooperation with the International Monetary
Fund. They had constructive and fruitful discussions with the team led by Mr. Arvanitis
during the 2009 Article IV Consultations with the Republic of Croatia. The authorities
welcome the thorough staff analysis and broadly agree with the staff assessment.
Economic performance and outlook
The global financial and economic crisis has begun to affect Croatia since the last quarter of
2008. A short-lived drop in bank deposits, a spike in market measures of sovereign credit
risk, and sudden depreciation pressures occurred soon after the Lehman Brothers collapse, as
a consequence of a negative shock to depositors’ and investors’ confidence. The extent and
potential negative effects of these events were successfully curbed by an array of swift and
decisive official measures, as also highlighted by staff.
The spillovers in the real sector were relatively limited in 2008, although the drop in private
consumption in the fourth quarter did lower the average growth for the year to just 2.4
percent (compared to 5.5 percent in 2007). Also, the surge in global commodity prices earlier
in the year pushed the average CPI inflation to 6.1 percent, its highest level in a decade. At
the same time, the slow but persistent deterioration of Croatia’s long-standing external
imbalances continued, with the current account deficit increasing to 9.4 percent, and external
debt reaching 82.9 percent of GDP by the end of the year. The fiscal policy response to these
developments was timely and appropriate, as confirmed by staff, and the general government
deficit accounted for 0.9 percent of GDP in 2008.
High frequency indicators point to a significant further deterioration of growth prospects for
2009, as investments and exports are being hit hard, in addition to the continued weakness in
private consumption. Moreover, public consumption and investment will have to be curbed,
as the current financing conditions leave little, if any, room for countercyclical policies. In
the baseline, it can be expected that the GDP will drop between 3 and 4 percent in real terms,
while the trend decline in unemployment will be reversed. At the same time, in the short run,
inflation presents a secondary concern while the goods trade deficit should decline. These
projections are still subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty, as they hinge upon external
factors that will determine the important tourist revenues and the availability and cost of

2
external financing in the period ahead, both critical for covering the balance of payments
needs.
Fiscal policy
The authorities have successfully pursued fiscal consolidation over the last several years: the
general government deficit has declined from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2004, to 0.9 percent by
2008, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 37.9 to 33.5 in this period. However,
the authorities recognize that a more aggressive curbing of current expenditures is needed to
achieve both the short-term goal of a balanced budget by 2011, and the medium-term aim of
reducing the role of the government in the economy and solidifying the sustainability of
public finances. Their commitment to these goals has been reaffirmed in April of 2009, when
the revised budget involving wide-ranging spending cuts was adopted, aiming for a general
government deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009.
The revised budget involves a sizable reduction of current expenditures, including a rollback
of the recent increase in public employees’ wages. At the same time, it provides for
unchanged or modestly larger expenditures related to the most vulnerable social categories,
and to corporate sectors particularly hard hit by the crisis. The authorities contend and staff
agrees that the revised budget strikes the right balance between the limited fiscal space and
the need to protect the vulnerable and support the hardest hit parts of the economy.
Moreover, the authorities also committed to undertaking a combination of additional
spending cuts, postponements, and budget revisions if the underlying fundamentals
deteriorate further.
Looking forward, the planned medium-term fiscal consolidation will be further supported by
a number of legislative and administrative measures implemented during the past year or
being implemented now, to improve the public finance management framework. The new
budget law was adopted, providing for a three-year, rolling budget framework, and
implementation of sophisticated safeguards against fiscal risks. The personal (tax)
identification number has been in use since January to assist in better targeting social benefits
and combating corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering. A comprehensive social
healthcare reform with the aim of partial cost-recovery has been successfully launched. And,
the authorities have also committed to reviewing the effectiveness of the implemented
pension system reforms after 2011 in providing a sound basis for the long-term financial
sustainability of social pensions, an important goal advocated by staff.
Monetary policy
Monetary policy has been for years aimed at maintaining broad nominal exchange rate
stability - a policy that has served the small, open, and highly euroized Croatian economy
well. While holding a tight rein on consumer price inflation, since 2003 the Croatian National
Bank (CNB) has also focused on proactively mitigating external vulnerabilities. In the
absence of a well-functioning interest rate channel, the CNB has resorted to a number of
direct, counter-cyclical monetary and prudential measures. Overall, the measures
implemented produced considerable results in the period 2003-2008, with bank credit growth

3
in Croatia markedly lower than in the peer countries. Moreover, the measures significantly
reduced the degree of financial euroization and provided incentives for most banks to raise
additional capital and liquidity buffers. As a consequence, the financial system entered the
global financial crisis from a position of strength.
The CNB’s response to the first wave of the global financial collapse has been to secure the
bank liquidity while at the same time preserving the stability of the nominal exchange rate.
The marginal reserve requirement on foreign borrowings has been abolished, the foreign
currency liquid reserves requirement has been reduced, and the general reserve requirement
has been lowered and modified, altogether significantly increasing the banks’ foreign
currency liquidity. At the same time domestic currency liquidity has been held appropriately
tight through judicious use of the discount window and regular weekly repo operations with
banks. By the end of April, as market confidence returned, both the nominal exchange rate
and short-term interest rates related to the repo rate stabilized.
Looking forward, the CNB intends to continue with the policy of tightly managing the
kuna/euro nominal exchange rate, to preserve confidence in the financial system, curb the
systematic balance sheet risks, and prevent imported inflation and inflation expectations from
creeping back. The central bank also stands ready to act swiftly in case of further deposit
outflows or profit repatriations that would undermine the capital positions of systemically
important banks. Provided that the recent stabilization of the exchange rate and interest rates
persists, and that inflation remains on a downward path, the CNB will weigh its short-term
focus on financial stabilization against the risk of a credit crunch, as suggested by staff. In
this regard, the central bank will also seek support from the fiscal policy in avoiding the
crowding out of the private sector from the domestic financial market by the government. In
this regard, the government has already met the key benchmark on May 27th when it
successfully placed its first Eurobond issue in over five years.
The authorities fully agree with staff that this choice of monetary policy presupposes a strong
adjustment in the fiscal and private non-financial sectors in the short run, supported by a
faster implementation of structural reforms to increase public confidence in the financial
system in the short run and increase the competitiveness of the economy in the medium term.
Likewise, the authorities welcome the staff’s assessment that Croatia’s long-standing
external imbalances also reflect structural deficiencies, especially in the tradable sector,
while there is no compelling evidence of real exchange rate misalignment.
Structural reforms
Significant progress has been achieved in reforms aimed at improving the overall business
environment: 1) the administrative capacity and the role of the Competition Agency has been
strengthened; 2) electronic registers of national regulations, non-tax government revenues,
and recipients of social benefits and state aid have been or are being established; and 3) the
company registration procedures have been further simplified. Most notably, further progress
in reducing the backlog of court cases has been achieved, and a judicial reform strategy for
the period 2008-2011 was adopted aimed at raising the overall quality and speed of judicial

4
procedures. Related to this, a new anti-corruption strategy was adopted, and the number of
high-profile cases investigated and prosecuted increased rapidly.
Regrettably, the global financial crisis has negatively impacted the pace of the privatization
process of large loss-making SOEs in the railways and shipbuilding sectors. Nevertheless, the
authorities are working diligently to meet their stated goal of exiting from the ownership
structure of the remaining enterprises in these two sectors by the end of 2009. The
government is also examining the modalities for privatization of the remaining companies
still in the state portfolio.
Overall, in spite of the large number of complex and comprehensive structural reforms that
have been implemented during the past year or are being implemented during 2009, their full
impact on the economy will only be felt with a lag. Thus, the authorities would like to
caution against reliance on synthetic indicators of the business environment for assessing the
recent progress on structural reforms in Croatia.
