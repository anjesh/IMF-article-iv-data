Article IV Consultation. The mission took place soon after the second inauguration of
President Uribe, who won re-election for another four-year term by a wide margin in
May 2006. This timing offered a good opportunity to assess the government’s economic
policy strategy through 2010, drawing on lessons from the past four years. The Staff Report
for the 2005 Article IV Consultation, together with the views of the Board and the authorities,
was published on May 9, 2005 on the Fund’s website.

•

Fund program. The authorities will exit from formal Fund support when the current
(precautionary) Stand-By Arrangement ends on November 2, 2006. This arrangement was
approved in April 2005 in the amount of SDR 405 million (35 percent of quota on an annual
basis). Colombia has no outstanding credit from the Fund and has accepted Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4.

•

Third Review. In their letter dated October 16, 2006 the authorities request completion of the
third and final review. The staff supports this request. All quantitative performance criteria
for end-June 2006 were met with substantial margins. The structural performance criterion for
July 2006 (submission of a 2007 budget consistent with a CPS deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP)
and the continuous performance criteria were observed. Key structural benchmarks were met,
including submitting reforms of the tax system and intergovernmental revenue sharing.

•

Discussions. A staff team visited Bogotá from August 21 to September 1, 2006. It met with
the Minister of Finance, Mr. Alberto Carrasquilla; the General Manager, Mr. José Uribe, and
the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República; the Director of the National Planning
Department, Ms. Carolina Renteria; other senior government officials, members of Congress,
and representatives of the private sector. The team comprised R. Rennhack (Head),
R. García-Saltos, H. Kamil (all WHD), I. Adenauer (FAD), S. Reichold (PDR), and D. Gray
(MCM). Mr. Steiner (OED) participated in all policy discussions.

•

Statistics. Colombia has high-quality economic statistics and subscribes to the SDDS. A data
ROSC was completed in September 2006.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The authorities will exit from formal Fund support when the current arrangement
expires on November 2, 2006.
The economy continues to perform well, although there are some signs of possible
overheating. In 2006, Real GDP is expected to grow by about 5 percent for the third year in
a row, and the economy is probably operating near capacity. Inflation is targeted to fall to 4
½ percent, the lowest level in decades. The external current account deficit is projected at
1.6 percent of GDP, while net international reserves would reach about 150 percent of shortterm debt by end-2006. Financial indicators remain sound. The 2006 elections strengthened
confidence, as President Uribe won re-election by a wide margin.
The authorities have begun to address the risk of overheating, although demand
policies may need to be tightened further. The central bank is commited to achieve its
inflation target and has raised its policy interest rate by 100 basis points since April 2006.
However, staff recommends that fiscal policy play a more supportive role in containing the
growth in demand to ease the burden on monetary policy. The staff sees clear benefits to
limiting the combined public sector (CPS) deficit in 2006 to around 1 percent of GDP,
below the target of 1.5 percent of GDP.
Over the next four years, the government’s macroeconomic policies aim at continuity.
The authorities’ medium-term goals are as envisaged in the program. Fiscal policy is being
framed with the goal of reducing public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2010. Monetary policy
will be aimed at lowering inflation further to 2-4 percent over the medium term.
The authorities plan to deepen structural reforms. They recently submitted to congress
comprehensive reforms of the tax system and of intergovernmental transfers, and in the
coming months intend to present for congressional approval financial sector reforms and a
free trade agreement with the United States. The authorities have also introduced a plan to
capitalize Ecopetrol to improve its efficiency. Staff supports these reforms, but notes there is
scope to improve the tax system further, including by reducing the number of VAT rates
further and phasing out the financial transactions tax.
Staff broadly supports this strategy, but with the following caveats. The authorities’
medium-term fiscal plan will strengthen the economy and build resilience. However, staff
pointed to the benefits of bringing public debt decisively below 40 percent of GDP to provide
greater protection from shocks, such as a possible downturn in the global economy. The
flexible exchange regime adopted in 1999 continues to serve Colombia well, but staff
believes that less reliance on foreign exchange intervention would be helpful. The transition
to risk-based supervision in line with Basel II will need to proceed with due caution.
Staff recommends completion of the third and final review. All quantitative performance
criteria for end-June 2006 and the structural performance criterion for July 2006 were
observed and the indicative targets for end-September 2006 are expected to have been met.

5
I. OVERVIEW
1.
Since 1999, economic policies have sought to place the country on a path of
sustainable growth, which would help reduce unemployment and poverty. The strategy
focused on fiscal reforms and consolidation, policies to reduce inflation, and measures to
strengthen the financial system. With the support of three successive Fund arrangements,
numerous reforms were adopted that have reduced public debt, brought inflation to the
lowest level in decades, and restored the health of the financial system after the 1999 crisis
(Box 1).1 As a result of these efforts and aided by a favorable global economy, real GDP rose
by 5 percent a year in 2004–05, after having stagnated in 1999–2002.
II. OUTLOOK FOR 2006
2.
The economy continues to perform well in 2006. Real GDP is expected to rise by
5.2 percent (4.5 percent in the program), led by strong growth in private demand and
continued robust export growth and closing the estimated output gap (Table 1). The surge in
investment in recent years has supported gains in labor productivity. Urban unemployment
fell to 13.1 percent in July, compared with 14.8 percent a year earlier. Inflation has remained
under 5 percent, although it rose from 3.9 percent in June to 4.6 percent in September, and
the Banco de la República intends to keep inflation at 4.5 percent by end–2006, as targeted.

Taxes. Several reforms and improved tax administration boosted public tax revenues
from 17 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 21 percent of GDP in 2006.
Fiscal decentralization. Laws approved in 2001–02 delinked intergovernmental
transfers from current revenues and set spending and borrowing limits on territorial
governments. Starting in 2004, these entities began to run an overall surplus.
Pension reform. Three reforms were approved in 2002–05 that raised contributions
and trimmed benefits for all pensions, and eliminated special regimes, including for
teachers and the military. This reduced the actuarial deficit of the pension system
from 200 percent of GDP in 2000 to 148 percent of GDP in 2005.
Fiscal responsibility law. Since 2004, all levels of government must justify their
fiscal targets in the context of a 10–year analysis of the sustainability of public debt.
Public sector administration. Numerous steps were taken to streamline staffing levels
and improve the efficiency of the public health system and of public enterprises,
including by making Ecopetrol compete on a level playing field with private oil
companies and establishing strong corporate governance for ISA.
Budget framework. After congress declined to approve the revised budget code, a
budget decree was issued in 2005 that implemented many elements of this code.

Monetary policy

Inflation targeting. In 2000, an inflation targeting framework was adopted.

Privatization. Divested all but one of the banks held by the public sector.
Financial supervision. In 2006, a new financial superintendency was formed out of
the merger of the superintendencies of financial institutions and of securities.
Provisioning levels brought up to international standards.
Capital Markets. A securities market law was approved in 2005 that strengthened
clearing and settlement procedures, market integrity and corporate governance.

Exchange system

•

Exchange rate policy. In September 1999, a flexible regime was adopted.
Article VIII. In 2004, Colombia accepted the obligations of Article VIII. Only two
exchange restrictions in effect as of September 2006.

3.
The 2006 elections have strengthened confidence. President Uribe won re-election
by a wide margin in May 2006, with widespread support for his handling of the economy and
the security situation. His 6–party coalition won a majority in both houses of congress in
March 2006 and the 2003 political reform is expected to strengthen party discipline.
Elections for mayors and regional governors will take place in October 2007.
4.
The authorities expect the combined public sector (CPS) deficit to reach
1.5 percent of GDP in 2006, as targeted, with a primary surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP
(Tables 2–5). This would reduce public debt to around 45 percent of GDP, and with public
sector deposits estimated at 13 percent of GDP, net public debt would fall to about
32 percent of GDP. The central administration deficit would be contained to just under
5 percent of GDP, benefiting from rapid growth in tax revenues as well as restraint of noninterest spending that offsets higher interest payments.2 High world oil prices and real
increases in regulated domestic fuel prices are strengthening the operating surplus of
Ecopetrol (the state petroleum enterprise) to 4.0 percent of GDP.3 However, the surplus of
local and regional governments is likely to amount to 0.9 percent of GDP, somewhat less
than expected, as these governments may raise spending ahead of the 2007 local elections. In
July 2006, the government submitted a 2007 budget consistent with a CPS deficit of
1.7 percent of GDP (structural performance criterion).

After the elections, the government has imparted new momentum to key
structural reforms. It submitted in July a comprehensive tax reform and, in September, a

In 2006, interest payments are expected to rise by 0.7 percent of GDP, because of higher domestic interest
rates as well as a change in the accounting of interest payments adopted at the time of the second review.

Ecopetrol has a monopoly on local production and sales of petroleum products, and sells diesel and regular
gasoline at well below international wholesale prices. For the past few years, the government has been raising
the retail and wholesale prices of these products in real terms, although more slowly than the rise in world oil
prices. In August 2006, it sold regular gasoline at 70 percent and diesel at 50 percent of the international
wholesale price. In 2005, these subsidies cost Ecopetrol 1.7 percent of GDP in foregone revenues.

constitutional amendment to modify the system of intergovernmental transfers (both
structural benchmarks for August 2006). In August, the government sold a majority stake in
the Cartagena refinery that had been fully owned by Ecopetrol (structural benchmark for
June 2006). Negotiations on a free-trade agreement with the United States were completed.
6.
Since April 2006, the Banco de la
República (BR) has been tightening monetary
policy. The BR raised its policy interest rate by a
total of 100 basis points in April–September, to
7.0 percent, to ensure inflation remains under
control. Between April and June it sold almost
US$1 billion under an intervention rule to limit
excess volatility, with an activation threshold of
+/- 2 percent.4 In July–August it reversed
direction and purchased about US$400 million
using the same rule, as the peso appreciated.

15 percent year-on-year at end-2005 to 27 percent year on year by June, as the real lending
interest rate fell to 7.6 percent (Table 6). In May, the government announced that it would
sell Granbanco—a bank created by the restructuring of Bancafe—and issued regulations for
the securities market law by June and for computation of market risk in August.

The external current account deficit is expected to remain at 1.6 percent of GDP
in 2006 (Table 7). The trade balance is projected to deteriorate, as imports, especially of
investment goods, continue to grow faster than exports even though commodity prices
remain favorable. However, this trend is being offset by lower external interest payments and
continued growth in family remittances. Net capital inflows are projected to amount to
1.6 percent of GDP, led by strong net foreign direct investment. The overall balance of
payments is likely to register a small deficit.

Vulnerabilities have been reduced, as the economy has recovered from the
effects of turbulence in international financial markets earlier this year. Between
February and June, domestic asset prices fell sharply and the peso depreciated in response to
uncertainty about monetary policy in the United States. Colombia was one of the emerging
markets hit hardest by the May–June turbulence, with prices of equity and government
securities ripe for a correction.5 Since June, equity prices have recovered to their level of

By January 2006 equity prices had almost quadrupled since mid-2004 and yields on government securities had
declined to about 6 percent. There was a growing presence of highly leveraged purchases of equity. The stock

III. DISCUSSIONS ON MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY
10.
The government’s medium-term strategy will provide continuity of economic
policies to enhance credibility and confidence. Economic policies for
2006–07 will aim to preserve the main elements of the medium-term policy framework
supported by the program.7 The authorities noted the strong growth in investment in recent
years might be raising the growth in potential output, but to be cautious they estimated that
potential output was rising by 4-4 ½ percent a year. For this reason, real GDP is expected to
grow by 4.5 percent in 2007 and then is projected to rise by 4 percent a year in 2007 and
beyond. Inflation is targeted to decline from 4½ percent in 2006 to the range of 2–4 percent a
year over the medium term. The external current account deficit would average a sustainable
2 percent of GDP over the medium term, financed by private capital inflows. Public debt
would decline to 40 percent of GDP by 2010, as envisaged. This outlook does not incorporate
any likely effects of the free trade agreement with the United States. (See para. 26)

6

The BR estimates that a 200 basis point rise in the yield curve would produce losses equivalent to one-third
of 2005 banks’ profits.
7

The government presents this framework to congress in June of each year, as required by the Fiscal
Responsibility Law.

The authorities aim to deepen reforms to raise sustainable economic growth and
improve social conditions. For this reason, they are aiming to create a climate more
conducive to growth and poverty reduction by:

The staff supported the main elements of this approach, and suggested some
adjustments to limit the risks to the outlook. The staff suggested that it may be necessary
to tighten fiscal and monetary policy as the economy may be beginning to overheat. The
output gap appears to have closed, inflation has increased in recent months and credit to the
private sector is accelerating. It recommended that the government adopt a more ambitious
fiscal policy over the medium term to bring public debt substantially below 40 percent of
GDP, in light of the risks to the global economic outlook (Box 2). Staff also encouraged the
authorities to limit the central bank’s foreign exchange intervention and to proceed cautiously
in adopting risk-based financial supervision in line with Basel II.

Oil has been a declining sector since 1999. Over the past 10 years, proven reserves have
fallen by 50 percent to 1.5 billion barrels by end-2004, as exploration has not led to the
discovery of any new major oil fields. As a result, both production and exports have dropped
significantly since 1999. Since 2002, Colombia’s net oil exports have averaged 4 ½ percent
of GDP, similar to Mexico and well below the oil export share in Ecuador and Venezuela. In
recent years, the mix of Colombia’s oil exports has shifted towards heavier crudes, selling at
a wider discount with respect to the WTI. Colombia could become a net oil importer by
around 2010, unless there are significant oil discoveries in the coming years.
Because of these trends, growth, inflation and the external sector have become less
sensitive to movements in world oil prices. The authorities estimated that a 20 percent rise
(fall) in the world oil price would raise (lower) real GDP by a moderately, 0.2–0.3 percent
after one year. The regulation of domestic prices of gasoline and diesel at subsidized prices
insulates inflation. The effect of changes in world oil prices on the external current account
deficit would be partially offset by the flexibility of the peso and changes in economic
growth.
Public oil revenues have also become less sensitive to the world price of oil. Since 2003,

A. Fiscal Policy
13.
The authorities commented that they have been taking advantage of
exceptionally strong fiscal performance to reduce public debt. In this context, their
analysis indicated that—because of the stronger than expected fiscal performance in
2004–05—they could reduce public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2010 with the primary
surplus declining to 2.1 percent of GDP starting in 2008, below the range of 2½ to 3 percent
of GDP contemplated in the program (Table 8). 8 Moreover, they noted that public debt net of
deposits would fall to 32 percent of GDP in 2007.
14.
For 2007, the proposed CPS deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP is consistent with this
debt objective. Public revenues would remain stable at about 32 percent of GDP, while total
spending would rise in relation to GDP to improve infrastructure and to broaden the coverage
of health and education programs (Box 3). The primary surplus would decline to 2.4 percent
of GDP, and public debt would decline slightly to 44 percent of GDP. The government
recently issued a bond for US$1 billion to help pre-finance the deficit in 2007, as well as to
reprofile existing maturities. The central administration deficit would remain slightly below
5 percent of GDP. The government continues to trim domestic fuel price subsidies, allowing
Ecopetrol to raise its operating surplus to 4.4 percent of GDP and to invest more in oil
exploration. The surplus of local and regional governments would fall to 0.8 percent of
GDP 2010.
15.
The staff commented that—now that the economy is near capacity—fiscal policy
may have to take a more prominent role in containing near-term demand pressures, as
well as keeping public debt on a sustainable path. For 2006, it urged the authorities to
limit the CPS deficit to close to 1 percent of GDP, noting that the target of 1.5 percent of
GDP would allow rapid growth in public consumption when private demand was already
expanding rapidly. They noted that it would be feasible to contain the CPS deficit as the staff
suggested, in view of the strong revenue performance, but left open the question of whether
and how fiscal policy would respond to the prospect of overheating. They added that
monetary policy would remain the primary tool to contain excess demand pressures.

8

If world oil prices were to decline by US$10 per barrel relative to the authorities’ projection, the operating
surplus of Ecopetrol would fall by an estimated 0.1–0.2 percent of GDP.

The authorities aim to reduce the poverty rate from 49 percent in 2005 to 39 percent by
2010, and to 15 percent by 2019, while improving income equality. Key policies include:
• Extend coverage of primary education and basic health care to the entire population by
2010. A national registration system has been developed to identify the most
vulnerable groups of society and grant them access to social programs. The
government would provide more schools and teachers to allow for 1.5 million more
students. Lending for higher education would also be increased. Basic health service
would be extended to 7 million more persons.
• Expand assistance to low-income families. The program Familias en Acción provides
nutrition and education to families in extreme poverty. Mothers receive a cash
benefit, provided their children attend 80 percent of their school classes. The program
has been extremely successful, and the government will extend this program from
over 620,000 families today to 1.5 million families
• Improve programs for the displaced population. Over 1.8 million people are
registered as displaced, because of Colombia’s security situation. Special assistance
to them includes food aid and basic needs kits, subsidies for rents, and psychosocial
care. The government also aims to ensure that all displaced persons have access to
basic health care and primary education by 2010.
• Strengthen the alternative development program. Currently, about 50,000 families
benefit from the program to provide alternative sources of income to coca-growing
farmers through social and environmental training, as well as targeted subsidies.

15

16.
The staff suggested that the authorities’ fiscal plan for 2007 and beyond—while
sensible—could be more cautious. Specifically, it recommended that the primary surplus
remain at 2.7 percent of GDP starting in 2007. The lowering of the primary surplus
envisaged for 2007 and beyond could provide too much stimulus to demand in the coming
years. A stronger fiscal policy would also provide a larger cushion to weather shocks. The
staff estimated that sustaining a primary surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP starting in
2007 would reduce public debt to 37.5 percent of GDP by 2010 and 34.6 percent of GDP by
2011 (Annex).9 The staff discussed an adverse risk scenario with a disorderly unwinding of
global imbalances that could drive up country risk premia and external interest rates, lower
world commodity prices (including for oil) and slow global growth, which in turn would
dampen growth in Colombia and raise the public sector’s debt servicing costs. Under such an
adverse scenario, staff estimated that public debt would remain manageable at 40 percent of
GDP in 2011, if the primary surplus were to remain at 2.7 percent of GDP. In response, the
authorities stressed that fiscal policy would remain directed at keeping public debt on a
sustainable path, but believed their approach provided sufficient protection, while allowing
for needed spending on social programs and infrastructure.

The scenario assumes a slower drawing down of deposits than assumed by the authorities, as these deposits
offer only limited flexibility in financing the CPS deficit. Many of the deposits are held by Ecopetrol or local
and regional governments or represent earmarked revenues.

B. Fiscal Structural Reforms
17.
Tax reform. The reform submitted to congress in July is designed to promote
investment and growth by simplifying tax administration, narrowing the differences in
marginal effective tax rates across sectors, limiting the taxation of capital and lowering the
cost of financial intermediation (Box 4). The authorities are working with congress to
approve this reform by end-2006. The staff supported the reform, while noting a few areas
for possible improvement. It pointed to the benefits of phasing out the FTT, which distorts
financial intermediation and yields less revenue over time as evasion increases,10 and
beginning to eliminate the so-called parafiscal taxes, which discourage employment in the

10

A recent OECD study finds that FTT’s do not provide a reliable source of revenue over the medium term, as
evasion grows over time and rises by more than increases in the tax rate. It also points to evidence of financial
disintermediation caused by the FTT. See Baca-Campodonico, J., L. de Mello and A. Kirilenko (2006), “The
Rates and Revenue of Bank Transaction Taxes,” OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No. 494.

17
Box 4. The Case for Tax Reform
Several studies show that Colombia’s tax system is inefficient and distortive. The income
tax has a high top marginal rate that discourages investment and has encouraged special tax
breaks that create significant horizontal inequities. The VAT has 10 different rates and many
exemptions and deductions that cut the base and the productivity of the tax. The financial
transactions tax rate of 0.4 percent and the stamp tax on medium- and long-term bank loans
of 1.5 percent discourage financial intermediation. Indirect taxes on labor significantly add to
the cost of employment in the formal sector. Local governments earn revenues through a
cascading sales tax (ICA) that varies by jurisdiction. Also, Colombia has had 7 tax reforms
since 1990, generating uncertainty about tax burdens that deters investment.

1/ Tax collected in percent of GDP divided by main VAT rate and top income tax rate.
2/ Taxes paid by employer or employee to finance social security, health and unemployment insurance, and
contributions to social programs as percent of salary.
3/ In Brazil, the number of VAT rates varies by state and is very high in some states.

The key elements of the government’s proposal include:
• Reducing the number of VAT rates to 5, while broadening the base to include almost
every product; low-income households would be compensated for their higher VAT
payments through direct government transfers.
• Lowering the top income tax in stages from 38.5 percent to 32 percent for
corporations and individuals, while raising the minimum threshold of income subject
to tax and removing most exemptions and deductions (including mortgage interest
and voluntary pension contributions). These changes are expected to make the income
tax more progressive.
• Limiting the taxation of capital, by allowing investment to be fully deductible in the
first year.
• Eliminating the stamp tax on bank loans and the wealth and remittance taxes. The
financial transactions tax (FTT) rate would stay at 0.4 percent, but with an exemption
for accounts with monthly transactions below a certain threshold.

18

formal sector. The authorities replied that they had proposed to phase out the FTT over 4
years, but found no political support for an increase in the general VAT rate that would have
been required to offset the loss in revenue. They added that the parafiscal taxes fund
important social programs with strong political support. The staff also cautioned that the fullexpensing provision was probably an excessive incentive for investment and could lead to a
higher than expected revenue loss initially. The authorities noted that tax administration
could effectively monitor the use of this provision and added that the additional investment
and growth would help sustain tax revenues over the medium term.
18.
Intergovernmental transfers. This reform proposes to limit the growth in transfers
from the central government to local and regional governments to 3.5 percent in real terms in
2009 and 2010, and then to 2 percent in real terms from 2011 onwards.11 Currently, the
Constitution mandates that these transfers grow by 2.5 percent a year in real terms through
2008; in 2009 these transfers would rise by 1.5 percent of GDP and then grow in line with
current revenues of the central administration. The staff agreed with the authorities that this
reform was crucial to avoid a significant widening of the deficit of the central administration
and preserve the credibility of fiscal policy.
19.
Ecopetrol capitalization. The government aims to increase the commercial
orientation of Ecopetrol to provide greater scope to invest in oil exploration; otherwise the
enterprise will virtually disappear over the next 10–15 years, as it exhausts its reserves.12 In
September, the government submitted a law to congress that would allow Ecopetrol to sell
shares for up to 20 percent of the enterprise’s value and to strengthen its corporate
governance to allow it to operate on a commercial basis and possibly be removed from the
the government’s fiscal indicators and targets. Domestic fuel price subsidies would be
dismantled in the next two years. Starting in 2007, Ecopetrol will receive the international
wholesale price for diesel and regular gasoline, and the government will record the subsidy
as an explicit expenditure, financed through increased dividend payments from Ecopetrol. By
mid–2008, these prices would be fully liberalized. The staff fully supported this approach
and recommended several steps to strengthen Ecopetrol’s commercial orientation, including
by giving its board more independence from the government and completely removing the
subsidies.13 However, it urged the authorities to consider carefully the fiscal effects of
increased spending by Ecopetrol, especially if the enterprise were removed from the
government’s fiscal indicators and targets.
20.
Other public enterprise reform. In January, the government sold a majority stake in
Telecom (the state communications enterprise), and it intends to sell Ecogas (the state gas
11

The proposal also allows for some faster real growth in transfers if real GDP rises by more than 4 percent.

12

In 2004, ISA—an electricity distribution company where the government owns 60 percent of the shares—was
deemed by the Fund to be commercially run and was removed from the program definition of the public sector.
Thus its investment was not constrained to help achieve a target for the CPS deficit.
13

These steps are fully explained in Chapter [–] of the Selected Issues Papers.

19
distribution company) in 2006. The authorities are continuing to strengthen the commercial
orientation of other public enterprises. Staff found that Isagen (the state electricity generation
and commercialization company) can be deemed commercially run, and presents a low fiscal
risk according to FAD criteria, which would allow it to be excluded from the definition of the
combined public sector starting in 2007.
21.
Revenue earmarking and budget rigidities. Revenue earmarking and mandatory
expenditure still amount to over 90 percent of all outlays. As mandated by the 2005 budget
decree, the authorities have evaluated some earmarked revenues in the 2007 budget, and
proposed to phase out several of these. The authorities pointed out that intergovernmental
transfers—one of the most important rigidities—would decline in relation to GDP if congress
approved the proposed reform. Pensions—another significant rigidity—would begin to
decline in relation to GDP next decade, based on the three pension reforms approved under
President Uribe’s first government in 2002–2006, and the authorities felt there was virtually
no political support for yet another pension reform, at least in the near term. Transfers to
universities also had strong political support.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
22.
The inflation targeting framework has been successful in reducing inflation and
anchoring expectations. The staff noted that inflation targeting appeared to have reduced
the persistence of inflation and increased the
9
importance of forward looking expectations in

inflation expectations, however, have risen in

recent months to above the inflation target for
2006. Long-term inflation expectations are about
6
4½ percent, slightly above the medium-term

target range of 2–4 percent. The authorities
reiterated that they would adjust monetary policy

23.
The central bank communicates its views
on monetary policy transparently, but staff
suggested that limiting foreign exchange
intervention would send a clearer signal. The
Executive Board of the Banco de la República
explains its policies in several ways, including through quarterly inflation reports, semiannual reports to congress and numerous seminar presentations. However, the staff suggested

14

20

that the central bank’s foreign exchange intervention, which has been sizable since end-2003,
could at times send a confusing signal about the intentions of monetary policy. It added that a
narrow threshold for an automatic intervention rule could invite speculation, if the central
bank were perceived to be obliged to intervene. For this reason, it recommended that the
threshold for the excess volatility rule be widened to +/- 4 percent, its level prior to October
2005. The authorities responded that the foreign exchange purchases between December
2003 and early 2006 moderated the appreciation of the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar without
undermining the central bank’s ability to meet its inflation target.15 It noted that the excess
volatility rule is transparent and has helped dampen undue exchange rate volatility without
providing investors an incentive for one-way bets.
24.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the flexible exchange rate regime
introduced in 1999 continues to serve

Colombia well (Box 4). It has supported real

authorities agreed that this analysis, while
useful, should be interpreted with caution, as
estimates of long-run determinants of the real exchange rate are subject to significant
uncertainty.

15

06

A Banco de la República study found that the foreign exchange purchases slowed the appreciation of the
peso. However, these purchases raised the volatility of the peso, most likely because the market believed the
central bank would never subordinate its inflation objective to concerns about the exchange rate. See Toro,
Jorge and Juan Manuel Julio, “Efectividad de la Intervencion Discrecional del Banco de la República en el
Mercado Cambiaro,” Borradores de Economia, No. 336, Banco de la República, 2005.

Box 5: Assessment of the Real Exchange Rate
Colombia’s real effective exchange rate displayed significant fluctuations in recent
years—including a sharp depreciation between March and June 2006. After reaching
the most depreciated level in more than a decade in early 2003, the real exchange rate
appreciated subsequently by more than 25 percent through March 2006, as growth
recovered and the political and security situation stabilized. Since then, the peso depreciated
in real effective terms by about 8 percent through early September.

Based on an econometric model of the long-run determinants of the real exchange
rate, the peso currently appears to be in line with fundamentals. Using annual data from
1961 to 2005, staff estimated the relation between the real exchange rate and commodity
prices, net foreign assets, GDP per capita relative to trading partners, government
consumption, and security conditions. The model suggests that about half of the observed
appreciation since 2003 is explained by higher commodity export prices and improvements
in the security situation. The rest represents primarily a reversal of the likely overshooting
of the peso in 2002–03. As a result, in 2005, the REER was on average close to the
projection of the model and the current REER remains only slightly more depreciated than
the average in 2005.
Alternative approaches broadly confirm these results. The current account deficit
reached 1½ percent of GDP in 2005 and is projected to widen to about 2–2½ percent of
GDP over the medium term at the current level of the real exchange rate. Such a current
account deficit would be sustainable and would broadly stabilize the net foreign asset
position as a share of GDP. Recent trade performance also suggests the absence of
competitiveness problems and major imbalances. Growth of non-traditional exports
remained at about 15 to 20 percent in U.S. dollars through 2005 and early 2006. While
imports have also been growing at similar rates, this has been driven mostly by buoyant
investment activity—including foreign direct investment.

banks’ ability to take forward positions with
offsetting spot transactions. The authorities
commented that turnover in the forward foreign exchange market in the last two years
increased significantly notwithstanding the limit on cash positions.
D. Trade Policy
26.
The government is continuing to liberalize trade. The free trade agreement (FTA)
with the United States will be submitted to both congresses later this year or in early 2007. It
covers a broad range of issues including trade in goods and services, investment, intellectual
property rights, government procurement, and labor and environmental standards. The
preferential access to the U.S. market granted under ATPDEA would become permanent, and
improve in certain areas, such as textiles and processed food. Several recent studies estimate
that the agreement would lead to moderately higher real GDP in Colombia, significantly
more trade, especially with the United States, and foreign direct investment, with a slight
deterioration in the external current account deficit.18 These studies highlight that the longterm economic effects could be more beneficial for Colombia, if the agreement sets off a
process of restructuring that enhances the efficiency gains. The authorities estimate that the
agreement would generate a small loss in tax revenues in the first four years, and after that
the treaty’s positive effects on growth would offset any loss in revenue. ATPDEA is set to
expire at end-2006, and to cover any gap in preferential access, legislation has been
submitted in the U.S. congress to extend ATPDEA for two more years. The authorities
estimate that a temporary loss in trade preferences would have little effect, as exporters might
be reimbursed for the temporary rise in their costs. The authorities commented that the
withdrawal of Venezuela from the Andean Community would have little near term effect on

trade, as the existing rules call for retaining preferential access for a five-year transition
period. However, this situation did introduce some uncertainty into long-term trade relations.
E. Financial Sector
27.
The government is preparing reforms to deepen capital markets to encourage
more non-bank financing and broaden access for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Colombia’s financial system faces several impediments—such as the stamp and financial
transactions taxes, forced investment requirements, uncertain creditor rights and a somewhat
outdated regulatory framework—that have raised the cost of capital and discouraged nonbank financing. The reforms, which are being developed in consultation with the World
Bank, would seek to overhaul the financial sector legislation to make it consistent with
universal banking, strengthen creditor rights, improve credit bureaus and help develop an
annuities market to support the private pension system.
28.
The authorities intend to move forward to implement a risk-based supervisory
framework consistent with Basle II. Staff supported this approach but urged them to
proceed at a cautious pace to ensure that banks and supervisors gained sufficient experience
with the new system of analysis. MCM has provided technical assistance to improve the
modeling of credit and market risk and has presented the framework of contingent claims
analysis. The authorities remained committed to submitting, by no later than November
2006, a law that would strengthen the independence of the financial superintendency
(structural benchmark for August 2006), but prefer to include this reform in the broader
financial sector reforms that would most likely be introduced in October.
29.
Now only one bank is publicly owned. On October 12, Granbanco was sold to a
domestic bank for about US $900 million (0.3 percent in GDP). Banco Agrario is the only
remaining public bank. The authorities are planning to issue by December 2006 regulations
to strengthen its governance in line with the recommendations of MCM.
F. Article VIII
30.
Colombia maintains two exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII.19 The tax
reform proposes to eliminate the tax on outward remittances. The central bank has partially
relaxed the exchange restriction arising from the special regime for hydrocarbons exporters,
but is still considering the steps necessary to completely remove the restriction.
IV. THIRD AND FINAL PROGRAM REVIEW
31.
Performance under the program remains strong. All quantitative performance
criteria for end-June 2006 and the structural performance criterion for July 2006 were
observed and the indicative targets for end-September 2006 are expected to have been met.
The continuous performance criterion barring the introduction of exchange restrictions and
multiple currency practices was also observed. Almost all structural benchmarks have been
met: (i) the tax reform was submitted in July 2006; (ii) the reform of intergovernmental

transfers was submitted in September 2006; (iii) regulations to implement the securities
market law were published by June; and (iv) a majority stake in the Cartagena refinery was
sold to a private investor in August. The authorities intend to submit the draft law to
strengthen the independence of the financial supervisor no later than November 2006. The
remaining structural benchmark—the preparation of a draft law to reduce revenue
earmarking not mandated by the constitution—will not be observed, although the authorities
are taking other measures to scale back budget rigidities over time. Upon completion of the
review, Colombia would be eligible to purchase up to SDR 405 million (52.5 percent of
quota) until the arrangement expires on November 2, 2006 (Tables 9 and 10).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
As the period of formal Fund support comes to end, Colombia’s economic
medium-term outlook is favorable. The policy strategy of fiscal reform and consolidation,
low inflation with exchange rate flexibility and strengthening financial supervision—aided
by a favorable global economy—has enabled the economy to enter a virtuous cycle of strong
investment-led growth and a sustainable external current account deficit. The recovery from
the international financial market turbulence earlier this year shows that the economy has
become more resilient in the face of shocks.
33.
The authorities have begun to address the risk that the economy may be
beginning to overheat. Monetary policy will continue to be the primary tool to manage
excess demand pressures. The Banco de la República has already raised its policy interest
rate by 100 basis points since April 2006, and is commited to maintain this tightening phase
as needed to achieve the inflation target. However, now that the economy is probably
operating near capacity, the staff recommends that fiscal policy play a more supportive role
in containing the growth in demand to ease the burden on monetary policy. The staff sees
clear benefits to limiting the CPS deficit in 2006 to around 1 percent of GDP—below the
target of 1.5 percent of GDP—preferably by restraining the growth in public consumption.
Moreover, the authorities’ plan to lower the primary surplus in 2007 and beyond may add too
much stimulus when the private sector is likely to provide a strong impetus for growth.
34.
Over the medium term, the authorities remain fully committed to keeping public
debt on a sustainable downward path. They intend to reduce public debt to 40 percent of
GDP by 2010, as envisaged. Staff agrees this profile will strengthen the economy and build
resilience. However, a larger primary surplus that would bring public debt decisively under
40 percent of GDP would provide greater protection from shocks, such as a possible
downturn in the global economy.
35.
Key structural reforms are moving forward, now that the political transition is
over. The proposed constitutional amendment is crucial to preserve the credibility of fiscal
policy by reforming the system of intergovernmental transfers. The government’s proposed
tax package is another key reform that will help make the economy more competitive by
simplifying Colombia’s complex and distortionary tax code. The reform correctly aims to be
revenue-neutral, as total public revenues are almost a third of GDP. Scope remains to
improve the tax system by reducing the number of VAT rates further, phasing out the
financial transactions tax and beginning to eliminate at least some of the parafiscal taxes,
which discourage formal sector employment. The proposed full-expensing provision for

25
investment appears overly generous. The staff notes that an unfinished task is to reduce
revenue earmarking and budgetary rigidities. The authorities intend to scale back over time
the two largest mandatory expenditures—intergovernmental transfers and pensions—but
more action in this area would be useful. The authorities have introduced a sensible plan to
capitalize Ecopetrol, which seeks to improve its efficiency, slow the depletion of Colombia’s
oil reserves and bring domestic fuel prices in line with world market conditions. However,
several steps are required to improve the commercial orientation of Ecopetrol, including by
making its board more independent of the government and removing the subsidies of diesel
and regular gasoline.
36.
The flexible exchange rate regime introduced in 1999 continues to serve
Colombia well. It has supported real economic growth by allowing relative prices to adjust
to external shocks and reducing the volatility of domestic interest rates, and the exchange rate
appears to be broadly in line with the fundamentals. The staff believes that less reliance on
foreign exchange intervention would allow the flexible regime to work more effectively and
would send a clearer signal about the stance of monetary policy. In that context, it would
urge the authorities to widen the threshold for the automatic intervention rule.
37.
The authorities are taking steps to strengthen the financial system. The transition
to risk-based supervision in line with Basel II will need to proceed with due caution to ensure
that banks and the superintendency are fully ready to implement this complex system. The
recently merged financial superintendency is designed to provide more effective oversight of
financial intermediation. It will be crucial to submit to congress as early as possible the
proposed legislation to enhance the independence of the superintendency. The likely sale of
Granbanco is a welcome step that will leave only one bank in the public sector.
38.
The authorities are continuing to remove exchange restrictions subject to
Article VIII. The staff recommends approval of the retention of the multiple currency
practice and exchange restriction arising from the tax on outward remittances through
December 31, 2007 or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation, whichever is
earlier. Approval is recommended as the tax is maintained for nonbalance of payments
reasons; the authorities are working towards eliminating it by end-2006 as part of the tax
reform proposal currently before congress; and the tax does not materially impede
Colombia’s balance of payments adjustment nor discriminates among, or harm the interest
of, other Fund members. The authorities have eased the exchange restriction arising from the
special foreign exchange regime for hydrocarbons exporters. However, there is still no clear
timetable for the full removal of the restrictive aspects of this regime and staff does not
recommend approval of this restriction.
39.
Economic performance under the Stand By Arrangement continues to be
favorable. In 2006, the economy will continue to perform well. All performance criteria for
June and July 2006 have been observed. On this basis, staff recommends completion of the
third and final review.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12–month
cycle.

Annex I. Colombia: Debt Sustainability Analysis
In the baseline scenario with authorities’ policies, both public and external debt stay on
a sustainable path through 2011. The baseline scenario is broadly consistent with the
WEO, and assumes the government would generate a primary surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP
on average for 2007–11, which would allow public debt to decline to 39.5 percent of GDP by
2010 and 37.2 percent of GDP by 2011. The external current account deficit for 2007–11
would increase slightly to 2.2 percent of GDP on average. This is consistent with a more
moderate rate of growth of Colombian trading partners and small deterioration in Colombian
terms of trade, as presented in the latest WEO. Provided policies remain strong, capital
inflows are expected to continue —albeit at more moderate pace—, and total external debt
would decline to 26 percent of GDP by 2011.
The major downside risk to the outlook is a possible worsening of the external
environment. The elements of such scenario could include: a sharp slowdown in the growth
of Colombian trading partners (growth lower by 1 percentage point compared with the
baseline), tighter conditions in global financial markets out of concerns with inflationary
pressures in the US (increase by 100 basis points in world interest rates relative to the
baseline), and a worsening in the Colombian terms of trade (a fall by 10 percent in the price
of commodities compared to the baseline). This shock could translate into lower real
economic growth in Colombia. Under this more adverse scenario, and assuming the primary
surplus remains at 2.1 percent of GDP over 2007–11, public debt would decline to 43 percent
of GDP in 2010 and 42.1 percent of GDP in 2011. On the external side, the main effects
would be a worsening of the trade balance by about 0.4 percent of GDP per year and the
increase in the external debt by 3 percentage points of GDP to almost 29 percent of GDP by
2011.
Standardized bound tests
Public Debt. Even under the extreme cases of accelerated depreciation of the peso vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar or a significant slowdown in growth, public debt would remain on a
sustainable path. Assuming a one time 30 percent depreciation of the peso vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar in 2007, or a slowdown of real GDP growth by 1.3 percent a year over 2007–11
(to 2.7 percent instead of 4 percent), the ratio of public debt to GDP would increase almost
two percentage points in 2011 with respect to its 2006 levels, instead of following a declining
trend as in the baseline projection with authorities’ policies. This resilience reflects the
baseline assumption that the primary fiscal balance would remain at 2.1 percent of GDP. If
the primary surplus were to average 1.1 percent of GDP over this period, public debt would
still decline to 42.4 percent of GDP by 2011.
External Debt. Colombia’s external debt profile remains sustainable under all alternative
scenarios. A higher external interest rate or slower economic growth would have little effect
on the evolution of external debt, while a higher non-interest current account deficit would
raise external debt to 32.5 percent of GDP by 2011. A one-time 30 percent depreciation of
the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar would raise external debt to 34.7 percent of GDP by 2011.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Covers the combined public sector (Non-financial public sector balance plus quasi-fiscal balance of the central bank and costs of financial restructuring- FOGAFIN and FINAGRO). Debt is measured in gross terms.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessments:

A safeguards assessment of the Banco de la República (BRC), completed on
October 24, 2005, found that the recommendations from the 2003 assessment had been
implemented. The assessment report concluded that there continue to be no major
vulnerabilities in the BRC’s safeguards framework, and consistent with the 2003 assessment,
it recommended that the BRC continue progress toward the full adoption of IFRS.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In September 1999 the Banco de la República floated the peso. At end-August 2006, the
exchange rate was Col$2,396 per U.S. dollar. The authorities accepted the obligations of
Article VIII in August 2004. Colombia maintains the following two exchange measures,
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: a) an exchange restriction arising from a special
foreign exchange regime for the hydrocarbon sector that limits the availability of foreign
exchange for branches of foreign corporations that choose to participate in the regime and b)
a multiple currency practice and an exchange restriction arising from a tax on remittances
abroad of nonresident income which is withheld when the foreign exchange is purchased.

APPENDIX II. COLOMBIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS1
The World Bank and Colombia’s Development Strategy
Colombia’s National Development Plan is built on four pillars: (i) provide security to all
Colombians; (ii) foster sustainable economic growth and employment generation under
macroeconomic and price stability; (iii) build a more equitable society; and (iv) increase the
transparency and efficiency of the State. The World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) strategy seeks to
support Colombia’s quest for development and peace. The Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Colombia was discussed by the Bank’s Board in January 2003 and since then
Colombia has received about US$2 billion in loans, of which nearly 60 percent consists of
fast-disbursing operations. A CAS Progress Report was prepared in September 2005. It
follows along the same pillars of the original CAS with an additional “peace pillar” that
envisions activities to support social policies for populations affected by conflict.
The World Bank Program for FY 2005–06
In line with the CAS, since June 2004, the IBRD has prepared development policy loans to
support fiscal reform, financial sector reform, the labor and social sector reform, and
environmental management. Labor and social sector reforms have been supported by a series
of development policy loans and a technical assistance loan that aims to improve knowledge,
develop effective instruments, and strengthen the ability to carry out such reforms. The
environment development policy loan series is being complemented by a technical assistance
loan to support the inclusion of environmental and social policies in government programs
and to strengthen the capacity of the major relevant institutions.
The WBG’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) will also
support a program to increase business productivity and efficiency, and a program in
monitoring and evaluation. The Bank’s support for the Government of Colombia’s program
for promoting greater business productivity consists of a three-phased series of programmatic
development policy loans. The second phase extends the support to other areas of
microeconomic reform, including upgrading the quality and certification standards necessary
to allow enterprises to take advantages of an even more open economy, and further supports
reforms to foster the supply of credit and increased transparency and access to financial
services. The Bank will continue its support in strengthening Colombia’s Monitoring and
Evaluation system through an investment loan. The WBG’s International Finance
Corporation (IFC) focuses on supporting new forms of public-private partnerships, while the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) focuses on the provision of political risk
guarantees for private sector investments; hands-on technical assistance for investment
promotion intermediaries; and the dissemination of information on investment opportunities
in Colombia.

Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
The WBG is helping Colombia implement its reform agenda in the following areas of BankFund collaboration:
• Assisting fiscal reforms, notably reforming the tax system, strengthening tax
administration, implementing a fiscal responsibility law, and reforming the public sector.
• Reforming the transfers from the central government to subnational governments.
• Reforming the pension and social security systems.
• Fostering financial sector and capital market developments.
• Broadening and deepening the scope of Colombia’s anticorruption program.
• Combating money laundering.

In September 2003, the IADB Board of Directors approved the Bank’s strategy for Colombia
for the period 2003–2006. The strategy identifies three overarching objectives: (i) lay the
foundations for economic revival and jump-starting growth; (ii) foster social progress and
make sure society’s most vulnerable are protected; and (iii) strengthen governance and
further modernization of the State. These objectives constitute the framework for the Bank
activities in Colombia.
To help reinvigorate the economy the Bank is working to foster competitiveness and will
support agricultural development and natural resources management. To foster social
progress and ensure that society’s most vulnerable are protected, Bank’s actions will
improve social protection systems and will promote the coverage, quality, and efficiency of
essential social services. In the governance and modernization of the State area the Bank will
support national public sector reforms and local governments management capacity building,
moreover, the Bank will promote initiatives to foster transparency and combat corruption,
and will support judicial branch reforms.
From the Bank’s standpoint, the implementation of the strategy is constrained by the
country’s fiscal deficit and security issues. Both constraints have implications for the size of
the lending program, the mix of lending and non-lending products, and the prospects for
achieving the strategy objectives. The Bank is in the process of preparation of a new country
Strategy for Colombia that will cover the period 2007–2010.
II. LENDING
Under the current strategy, the Bank has approved 20 new loans amount US$3.584 million.
74% of these resources were approved through rapid disbursement operations. As of
September 15, 2006 the country’s portfolio consists of 29 loans an amount equivalent to
US$2,159 million. These resources are distributed among 26 investment loans
(US$1,159 million) and three policy-based loans (US$1,000 million). In addition, the
country portfolio with Colombia includes 32 non-reimbursable technical cooperation
operations (US$20.8 million). Through the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), which
finances private sector investment projects, Colombia has 37 non-reimbursable operations
(US$19.3 million) and 2 loans (US$2.2 million). The IIC has 16 active projects totaling
US$154.3 millions, and the Private Sector has active three operations totaling US$108.6
million.

(US$200 million) and social development (US$200 million), and two investment loans to
support hospital reorganization (US$60 million) and citizen services in Bogota
(US$10 million). For the remainder of 2006, the Bank projects approving three additional
operations totaling US$130 million to support Colombian sub-national governments in the
areas of education, urban development and infrastructure.

Bogotá, Colombia
October 16, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
In 2006, Colombia’s economy is likely to prolong its good performance, as the continuity of
strong policies has improved confidence and promoted vigorous growth in investment. Real
GDP is expected to grow by 5.2 percent, while inflation is targeted to decline to
4.5 percent—the lowest level in decades. The external current account deficit is likely to
remain low at 1.6 percent of GDP, owing to the strength of world commodity prices as well
as robust growth in non-traditional exports. The economy handled with little difficulty the
volatility in international financial markets earlier this year, providing a clear indication that
it has become more resilient.
The Fund’s support through the Stand-By Arrangement that expires in November 2006 has
helped provide a transparent policy framework and fortify confidence. We are requesting the
completion of the third and final review under this arrangement. The performance criteria at
end-June 2006 and end-July 2006 and the continuous performance criteria have been
observed and the program agenda has been completed (Tables 1 and 2). With regard to the
structural benchmarks, in July 2006 we submitted a revenue-neutral tax reform designed to
cut distortions and in September 2006 the draft constitutional amendment to reform
intergovernmental transfers was presented. We plan to submit a draft law to strengthen the
independence of the financial supervisor no later than November 2006. The 2007 budget
presented to congress in July includes some provisions to trim earmarked revenues over time.
Over the medium term, we remain fully committed to strengthening policies further to
sustain economic growth and to make the economy more resilient. We intend to keep fiscal
policy on a sustainable path with a view to reducing public debt to 40 percent of GDP by
2010, limit annual inflation to the range of 2–4 percent in the medium term and to continue to
deepen structural reforms. We look forward to maintaining a strong policy dialogue with the
Fund in the context of annual Article IV consultations.

Sincerely yours,
/s/

APPENDIX V. COLOMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The data provided by the authorities are generally adequate for surveillance. Colombia is in
observance of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Colombia is availing itself of a
flexibility option on the timeliness of certain production, monetary and external data. A
mission visited Bogotá during September 5–16, 2005 to prepare a data ROSC, which will be
published shortly.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the
national accounts, although the Banco de la República (BR) compiles the financial accounts.
Estimates of GDP and expenditures are based on an outdated base year (1994). However, the
DANE is in the process of compiling new series with 2000 as the new base year.
Compilation has conformed to the recommendations of the 1993 SNA since 1995. However,
there are shortcomings in estimates of gross fixed capital formation as some agencies use
different source data and sampling techniques. Estimates of illicit activities focus on
agricultural output and do not include downstream value added.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of
public revenue, expenditure, and financing data. While significant progress has been made,
there is still a need to improve the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, develop timely and
reliable data on the finances of local governments, and improve monitoring of floating debts.
Data cover the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), but coverage of “above-the-line”
operations of units outside the national administration is not exhaustive due to capacity
constraints.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting database for the
public sector. The GAO accounting classification is bridged to the GFSM 2001 framework to
compile GFS on accrual and cash bases. The GFS compiled are sent to the Statistics
Department in the IMF for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS
Yearbook).
Monthly data have been reported for publication in IFS and annual data on the consolidated
general government on accrual and cash bases have been reported for publication in the 2006
GFS Yearbook. The last year for which data were reported was 2005.
Financial sector statistics
The BR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Superintendency of
Banks and the Superintendency of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund
technical assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues of data quality,
including interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency. The
introduction of a new call report form in March 2005 will significantly improve the quality of

51
monetary statistics. The authorities are in the process of migrating to the new standardized
forms for reporting monetary data to STA.
Balance of payments and external debt
The BR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments data. Quarterly
data have been produced since 1994, and the BR adopted the BPM5 standard in 1998.
Balance of payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade
zones. Improved surveys, particularly in the service sector, have enhanced coverage and
consistency. Financial account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than
registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BR, in consultation with the DANE,
develop a methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely
basis. The BR should reclassify some FDI equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjust
the related investment income series accordingly. Also, it should continue efforts to identify
government bonds issued abroad and purchased by residents as well as those purchased by
residents on the secondary market.
The BR compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics,
External Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 7, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Colombia
On October 30, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Colombia.1
Background
In early November 2006, Colombia exited from a period for Fund support that began in 1999.
Since then, numerous reforms were adopted that have reduced public debt, brought inflation to
the lowest level in decades, and restored the health of the financial system after the 1999
crisis. As a result of these efforts and aided by a favorable global economy, real GDP rose by
5 percent a year in 2004–05, after having stagnated in 1999–2002.
The economy continues to perform well in 2006. Real GDP is expected to rise by 5.2 percent,
led by strong growth in private demand and continued robust export growth. Urban
unemployment fell to 13.1 percent in July, compared with 14.8 percent a year earlier.
The Banco de la República intends to keep inflation within a range of 4–5 percent by end–
2006, as targeted. The economy has recovered swiftly from the effects of turbulence in
international financial markets earlier this year, indicating that vulnerabilities have been
reduced.
The authorities expect the combined public sector deficit to reach 1.5 percent of GDP in 2006,
as targeted, which would reduce public debt to around 45 percent of GDP and allow deposits
held by the public sector to reach 13 percent of GDP.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The government has imparted new momentum to key structural reforms. In July it submitted to
congress a comprehensive tax reform and, in September, a constitutional amendment to
modify the system of intergovernmental transfers. The authorities are also seeking
congressional approval of a plan to enhance the commercial orientation of Ecopetrol. In the
coming months, they intend to present to congress several financial sector reforms and a free
trade agreement with the United States.
Since April 2006, the Banco de la República (BR) has been tightening monetary policy.
The Banco de la Republica raised its policy interest rate by a total of 125 basis points in April–
September, to 7.25 percent, and is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to ensure
inflation remains under control.
The external current account deficit is expected to remain at 1.6 percent of GDP in 2006, fully
financed by net capital inflows, led by strong net foreign direct investment. By end-2006, net
international reserves are expected to reach about US$15 billion (150 percent of short-term
debt on a remaining maturity basis).
Financial indicators remain sound. Through end-June, bank liquidity and loan portfolio quality
were adequate, and bank solvency exceeded the minimum regulatory requirement of
9 percent.
Over the next four years, the government’s macroeconomic policies aim at continuity.
The authorities’ medium term goals are as envisaged in the program. Fiscal policy is being
framed with the goal of reducing public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2010. Monetary policy
will be aimed at lowering inflation to 2-4 percent a year over the medium term. The authorities
have proposed structural reforms in the areas of taxes, intergovernmental transfers, and the
commercial orientation of public enterprises, and in the coming months will present legislation
to broaden domestic financial deepening and establish free trade with the United States.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated Colombia for the successful completion of the Fundsupported program and exiting from the use of Fund resources. Directors commended the
authorities’ policy strategy of fiscal reform and consolidation, low inflation with exchange rate
flexibility, and strengthening of the financial system, which has enabled the economy to enter a
virtuous cycle of strong investment–led growth and a sustainable external current account
position. They noted that the recovery from the international financial market turbulence earlier
this year underscores the economy’s increased resilience in the face of shocks.
Directors welcomed the tightening of monetary policy since April 2006 to help address the risk
of overheating. At the same time, Directors underscored the benefits of limiting the combined
public sector deficit in 2006 to below the budgeted level to contain the growth in demand and
ease the burden on monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to keep public debt on a sustained downward
path to strengthen the economy and build resilience. A number of Directors agreed that the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation program provides sufficient protection against
exogenous shocks, while providing fiscal space to meet important infrastructure and social

3
investment needs. However, many Directors considered that a larger primary surplus that
would bring public debt decisively below 40 percent of GDP would provide a greater protection
from shocks. These Directors cautioned that the authorities’ plan to lower the primary surplus
in 2007 and beyond may add too much stimulus when the private sector is likely to provide a
strong impetus for growth.
Directors welcomed the renewed momentum for structural reforms. They remarked that the
reform of intergovernmental transfers was crucial to preserve the credibility of fiscal policy,
while the tax reform would help make the economy more competitive by simplifying Colombia’s
complex and distortionary tax code. Directors called on the authorities to phase out the
financial transactions tax and eliminate the parafiscal taxes, which encourage informality in the
financial and the labor markets. They noted that an unfinished task was to reduce the
widespread revenue earmarking to allow for greater expenditure flexibility. Directors also
welcomed the decision to increase the commercial orientation of Ecopetrol and supported the
authorities’ plan to deregulate the domestic prices of gasoline and diesel by mid-2008.
Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has served Colombia well.
They judged external competitiveness to be adequate, in view of the broad-based growth in
exports and the sustainable level of the external current account deficit. In this context, many
Directors considered that less reliance on foreign exchange market intervention would provide
a clearer signal about the stance of monetary policy, while a number of other Directors agreed
with the general foreign exchange policy stance of the authorities. Directors agreed that the
development of market-based hedging mechanisms would reduce the need for foreign
exchange intervention during periods of high volatility.
Directors welcomed the continuing efforts to strengthen financial supervision. They agreed
with the authorities that the transition to risk-based supervision in line with Basel II should
proceed with due caution to ensure that banks and the financial superintendency are well
prepared to implement this complex system. Directors urged the authorities to submit to
congress the proposed legislation to strengthen the independence of the financial
superintendency. They welcomed the recent privatization of Granbanco and the authorities’
plans to issue regulations to strengthen the governance of Banco Agrario, the only remaining
public sector bank.
Directors commended Colombia for accepting the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4, and welcomed the authorities’ intention to remove one of the remaining exchange
restrictions that is subject to Fund approval.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Final Review Under Colombia's Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third and final
review of Colombia's performance under an 18-month SDR 405 million (about US$597.6
million) Stand-By Arrangement approved on April 29, 2005 (see Press Release No. 05/95).
Colombia has not drawn under the arrangement, and the authorities have indicated that they will
not make any drawings before the arrangement expires on November 2, 2006.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Colombia on Monday, October 30, 2006
Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair made the following statement
“Colombia’s economy continues to perform well in 2006. Strong economic growth is helping to
lower unemployment and poverty, while inflation is declining in line with the authorities’
targets. The external position remains robust, supported by favorable terms of trade and sizable
net capital inflows, while the continued moderation in the combined public sector balance will
reduce public debt further. The economy has recovered swiftly from the turbulences in
international financial markets earlier this year, underscoring the increased resilience of the
Colombian economy in the face of shocks.
“While demand policies will need to guard against the risk of overheating in the short-term, the
government’s macroeconomic policies aim at continuity over the next four years, consistent with
the medium-term goals envisaged by the authorities in the Fund-supported programs. In this
respect, the authorities are framing fiscal policy with the goal of reducing public debt to 40
percent of GDP by 2010, while monetary policy will aim at lowering inflation to international
levels over the medium term in the context of a flexible exchange rate policy. The authorities are
proposing structural reforms to raise sustainable economic growth and improve social conditions,
with specific reforms steps proposed in the areas of taxes, intergovernmental transfers, and the
commercial orientation of public enterprises. In the coming months, the authorities will present
legislation to deepen domestic financial markets and to conclude a free trade agreement with the
United States.
“Over the medium-term, the authorities’ strategy of continued reforms within a supporting
framework of macroeconomic stability will enable the economy to continue to enjoy strong
investment-led growth and support a sustained reduction in poverty,” Mr. Kato said.

Statement by Roberto Steiner, Alternate Executive Director for Colombia
October 30, 2006

On behalf of my authorities, I would like to thank management and staff for the support and
advice they have provided Colombia. After three precautionary arrangements dating back to
1999, Colombia is now in a position to return to the standard Article IV relationship with the
Fund. My authorities look forward to continuing with the constructive policy dialogue that
has always characterized the relationship between Colombia and the Fund.
Main Developments Under the Fund-Supported Arrangements
My authorities appreciate the well-written set of papers that attest to the progress
achieved by Colombia over the last few years, particularly since 2002. A strong policy
framework, an enhanced security situation and a favorable external environment have
delivered major improvements in all economic indicators. GDP growth is likely to average
5.2 percent in 2004-2006, more than twice the rate observed in 2000-2003. Inflation is now
close to 4.5 percent, a remarkable feat for a country not long ago labeled as the moderate
inflation country par excellence – inflation having averaged 21 percent during 1983-1999.
Progress has also been impressive on the fiscal front, with the CPS deficit averaging 0.6
percent of GDP in 2004-2005. The primary surplus increased from 0.3 percent of GDP in
2002 to 4 percent in 2005, while public debt declined from 57 to 46 percent of GDP. NIR
have been replenished and now cover more than 150 percent of short term debt.
These results have been underpinned by a wide range of structural reforms. There is
hardly any topic in which the government has not strived to introduce far-reaching changes,
although in some instances either Congress or the Courts failed to support or to uphold those
efforts. All levels of government are now constrained by a fiscal responsibility law, tax
revenues have been enhanced, the fiscal position of local governments has been strengthened,
the actuarial deficit of the public pension system has been trimmed by one quarter and there
has been a notable improvement in the administration of SOE’s. The government has
divested itself from all banks except the agricultural bank, which has always been a public
entity. The recent privatization of Granbanco was a success, with the auction clearing at more
than twice the base price. Private banks are profitable and well-capitalized and their loan
portfolio is sound. A new supervisory authority was formed to facilitate consolidated
supervision and a securities market law has strengthened clearing and settlement procedures,
market integrity and corporate governance. In September 1999 a flexible exchange rate
regime was adopted and in 2000 inflation targeting was formally introduced.
The program was implemented in full, with all reviews undertaken in a timely manner.
All quantitative PCs were met and, except for congressional approval of a reform of the
budget code, all structural PCs were complied with. Other than revenue-earmarking, the rest

2
of the features of that reform were incorporated through executive decrees. Likewise, most
structural benchmarks were completed. Congress recently approved the 2007 budget, which
is consistent with a CPS deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP. It is now discussing a revenue-neutral
tax reform and has voted positively at the committee level the constitutional amendment that
makes permanent, with minor alterations, the transitional arrangement governing transfers to
local governments. Next year Congress will consider the FTA with the U.S. and a financial
sector reform that improves creditor rights and enhances the independence of the supervisor.
The 2006 Article IV Consultation
In staff’s opinion there are signs of overheating, which call for a further tightening of
policies. Noting that monetary policy has been tightened and that the policy interest rate has
been increased by 100 bps since April 2006, staff calls for the 2006 fiscal target to be
tightened by 0.5 percent of GDP. My authorities certainly remain vigilant to the possibility
that the economy might be growing beyond potential, though it should be borne in mind that
the private investment to GDP ratio has doubled since 2002 and, consequently, it is likely
that potential output itself has been expanding quite rapidly.
The government believes that due to revenue over-performance, the 2006 fiscal deficit could
turn out to be some 0.5 percent of GDP smaller than originally envisioned. Willingness to
refrain from spending this revenue over-performance should not, however, be interpreted as
an agreement to target a lower than originally envisioned debt to GDP ratio for 2010. Since
2002 my authorities have made it clear that their medium term fiscal target is to reduce
the debt burden to 40 percent of GDP by 2010. While under the conditions prevailing a
few years ago this implied a primary surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP, fiscal over-performance
since 2004 and current conditions indicate that the same debt target can now be reached with
a slightly lower primary surplus. In the 2002 and 2005 IMF programs as well as in the 2006
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework the authorities have consistently stated that the main goals
for macroeconomic policy are to reduce the debt ratio to 40 percent by 2010 and inflation to
the 2-4 percent range in the medium term. These goals are well in line to being met.
As has been the case throughout the IT regime period, the central bank is willing to
further tighten monetary policy if needed to meet its inflation target. The Selected Issues
paper attests to the effectiveness of Colombia’s IT regime, with inflation on a declining trend
and with expected inflation now playing a larger role as a determinant of current inflation, a
clear signal of enhanced central bank credibility. These results have occurred within a
flexible exchange rate regime in which the central bank occasionally intervenes – in a
discretionary manner or through pre-announced rules – and in which a most welcome
replenishment of international reserves has taken place. The central bank has always made it
a point to ensure that its intervention in the F/X market does not jeopardize the attainment of
the inflation target. Net intervention in 2005 was, in any event, much smaller than in 2004.

3
Since 2003 staff has questioned central bank intervention in the F/X market, alleging
that this could compromise the inflation target if not sterilized, that quasi-fiscal costs
would ensue if sterilized, and that, by offering what staff understood to be one-sided
bets to markets, speculative capital inflows could become a problem. None of these
concerns has materialized, to a great extent due to the fact there has been a significant
increase in money demand, which the central bank has accommodated without placing at risk
the inflation target. The central bank has never had a target for the exchange rate, and my
authorities fully agree with staff that it would be a major mistake to offer markets one-sided
bets. Colombia’s recent experience is indicative of the fact that an IT regime can be credible
and effective even though the exchange rate is not on an entirely clean float.
Staff correctly points out that long-term inflation expectations are about 4 ½ percent,
slightly above the medium term target. While this can be ascribed to less than full
credibility in a context of disinflation, it is important to bear in mind that in other successful
IT countries such as the U.K. and Chile expectations only converged to the medium term
target once observed inflation actually met that target. My authorities believe that expected
inflation should decline over time, as inflation is reduced towards the medium term target.
My authorities welcome staff’s work on the determinants of the equilibrium real
exchange rate, a valuable contribution to a burgeoning literature on the subject. There
being many different specifications offering widely different results, my authorities believe
that all estimates should be interpreted with caution. Staff’s assessment that Colombia’s real
exchange rate is currently in line with fundamentals seems consistent with the fact that the
current account deficit has been and is expected to remain moderate and sustainable.
Staff supports ongoing efforts to deepen structural reforms, but calls for further
improvements in the tax code. My authorities wanted to phase out the FTT. To maintain
revenue neutrality, this could only have been done by increasing the VAT. When the idea
was floated in Congress, it became evident that enough support could not be obtained for
such a move. Staff welcomes the initiative to reduce the top income tax rate, but believes it is
overly generous to allow investment to be fully deductible in the first year. While
acknowledging a slight adverse fiscal impact in the short term, my authorities feel that over
the long term the scheme is fiscally sound and not very different from the rather complex and
arbitrary depreciation scheme now in place. My authorities are committed to broadening the
VAT base and reducing the number of rates. It is worth noting that most of the differentiated
rates apply only to automobiles, depending on engine size. It is unlikely that this generates
major distortions or compliance costs. Box 4 shows that the productivity of Colombia’s VAT
is acceptable by regional standards and higher than in countries with fewer tax rates.
The government is more sanguine than staff and believes that under current trends
Colombia would become a net oil importer in 2015, not in 2010. As a result of higher
prices, enhanced security and a new contractual framework more favorable to private

4
investment, new explorations have gone up from 14 in 2002 to 59 in 2005. Higher prices
have also rendered profitable investments in fields that had been taken out of production. On
subsidies, the government has consistently increased fuel prices – albeit at a time when
international prices increased faster. Subsidies are now explicit in the budget, and this should
assist the policy of further reducing them. The government is keen on improving governance
and efficiency at Ecopetrol. In order to expand the Cartagena refinery, Ecopetrol recently
associated itself, as minority stakeholder, with the Swiss firm Glencore. The government has
proposed legislation allowing Ecopetrol to receive a 20 percent private sector capital
injection. Actions are being taken in order for the company to be run on a commercial basis,
not for the sake of removing it from the public sector, but rather to enhance the value of a key
state asset. While staff rightly calls for continued monitoring of the enterprise in order to
minimize fiscal risks, my authorities believe that Colombia’s largest fiscal risk is running out
of oil. Curtailing Ecopetrol’s investment would only enhance such a risk.
My authorities agree with staff’s call for caution in the transition to risk-based bank
supervision. A strategy has been designed taking into account the technical resources
available at the Financial Superintendency. After a judicious analysis, the Superintendency
feels it is prepared to transition towards risk-based supervision of market risk, but is taking a
more cautious approach with regard to credit and operational risk. In the process, it has
received valuable TA from the Fund. My authorities are also appreciative of ICM support in
the area of hedging instruments. While noting that hedging for currency risk has increased
significantly in the recent past, staff correctly points out that there are several areas for
improvement of the hedging of foreign exchange risk as well as interest rate risk.
The tax reform proposal being considered by Congress eliminates the tax on outward
remittances, a restriction under Article VIII. The central bank does not have a schedule
for amending the regime for hydrocarbon exports because, following changes introduced as a
result of Fund advice, it is not persuaded that the regime entails any restriction under Art.
VIII. It is quite telling that in p. 44 of the report it is stated that there is “an exchange
restriction arising from a special foreign exchange regime for the hydrocarbon sector that
limits the availability of foreign exchange for branches of foreign corporations that choose to
participate in the regime” (our emphasis). My authorities cannot accept that a regime in
which participation is voluntary and whose existence is supported by those eligible to
participate could be meaningfully considered an exchange restriction.
