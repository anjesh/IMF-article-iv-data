IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Luxembourg
On May 11, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation with Luxembourg.1
Luxembourg’s economic model, emphasizing fiscal stability, openness, firm prudential
oversight, and responsiveness to investor needs, is delivering strong growth. Buoyant financial
services exports contributed to real growth of close to 3 percent in 2014, with strong job creation.
Growth is projected at 2½ percent this year, bolstered by the ECB’s quantitative easing.
Budget 2015 launched a multi-year fiscal consolidation aimed at offsetting falling revenues from
electronic commerce. Faced with a projected reduction in these revenues by up to 1.3 percent of
GDP this year, the budget targets a broadly balanced general government position in 2015, and
moderate surpluses in 2016–18.
The economy faces important challenges going forward. Evolving international tax transparency
standards, in which Luxembourg is participating fully, could impact the revenue base. Financial
sector complexity occasionally tests oversight arrangements, where maintaining a strong
regulatory and supervisory reputation is central to attracting international business. Finally,
population aging will give rise to significant spending pressures over the long term, necessitating
further reforms to the pension system.

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors commended Luxembourg’s continued strong macroeconomic
performance underpinned by fiscal prudence and sound institutions. Directors noted that the
main policy challenge ahead is to strengthen an economic model that has served the country well
but will be tested by changing international financial regulations and tax regimes. Continued
further fiscal and structural reforms to diversify the economy and lift youth and women’s
employment are needed to support growth prospects.
Directors noted that the current budget and medium-term fiscal plan appropriately address falling
value-added tax revenues from electronic commerce. They also supported the authorities’ goal to
maintain budget surpluses over the medium term. In this regard, Directors agreed that deeper
reforms are needed to ensure that the pension system is resilient to population aging. They
welcomed the decision to bring forward by one year a review of the impact of earlier reforms.
Directors also welcomed the creation of the new sovereign wealth fund, and saw merit in
boosting its funding with future windfall receipts, including from divestment proceeds.
Directors welcomed Luxembourg’s continued participation in EU and OECD/G20 tax
transparency initiatives. They encouraged the authorities to assess the impact of any tax base
erosion at home and to develop options for diversifying revenue sources. Directors also pointed
to the need to seek further expenditure savings based on expenditure reviews.
Directors encouraged the authorities to fully adopt legislation related to the EU banking union in
order to maximize the benefits of Luxembourg’s participation. They took note of the recent
passage of the law to establish a systemic risk committee with an appropriately broad remit
which will contribute to further strengthening of the financial sector. Directors also
recommended reviewing the oversight of nonbank holding companies that control banks as well
as their nonbank subsidiaries. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to advocate
for strong arrangements at the EU level while exploring the limited options Luxembourg could
take using national discretion given the harmonized EU rules.
Directors agreed that structural reforms to diversify the economy beyond the financial sector are
helpful to improve Luxembourg’s long-term growth. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
further enhance the business climate and raise youth and women’s participation in the labor
force. Directors also recommended additional active labor market policies, including more
effective training programs, as well as reforms to reduce skills mismatches and boost incentives
to work. A number of Directors noted that adjusting the wage indexation mechanism could help
preserve the competitiveness of Luxembourg’s economy.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the
views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Luxembourg’s main challenge is to strengthen an economic model that has served
it well. Growth was close to 3 percent in 2014, and is projected at 2½ percent in 2015,
with continued strong job creation. The model emphasizes maintaining fiscal stability
and openness, practicing conservative prudential oversight, and responding to investor
needs. This combination has been a magnet for international financial business, nowhere
more so than in the investment fund industry, where assets under management have
more than doubled since 2008, to €3½ trillion. Recent challenges to this model
necessitate a proactive approach to adjust to a changing landscape.
The authorities’ commitment to positive engagement in the international tax
transparency agenda supports a proactive approach. Having adjusted fiscal policy for
lower revenues from electronic commerce, they should also address the additional base
erosion that could now arise, exploring options to make the tax system more robust. At
the same time, they should pursue further reforms to make the pension system more
resilient to population aging. These policy initiatives, along with the authorities’
commitment to a modest budget surplus over the medium term, should fortify
Luxembourg’s ‘AAA’ sovereign credit standing.
Equally, Luxembourg also plans a series of actions to uphold its reputation as a
firm and sophisticated financial regulator. These include faster passage of EU banking
laws, where the banking union promises to be especially beneficial for Luxembourg,
operationalizing a purposeful systemic risk committee, and being a voice for strong
cross border oversight. On the latter, effective EU regulatory arrangements for nonbank
companies that control banks should form a particular focus, given the large volume of
intragroup activity transiting through Luxembourg.
Provided the challenges ahead are well managed, growth in the near term could
beat staff’s baseline, helped by a firmer euro area recovery. In the medium term,
however, the success of the authorities’ initiatives to diversify the economy will play out
against a backdrop of lower potential growth. It is doubly important, therefore, that
efforts are also underway to better equip workers with relevant skills and to lift youth
and women’s participation in the labor force.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Luxembourg’s economic success rests on the twin pillars of stability and openness. Its
responsive, low tax, financially centered economic model has served it well, with growth outpacing
the euro area in most years (Box 1 and Figure 1). Latest figures show real GDP expanding by
2½ percent y/y in the first three quarters of 2014, with net service exports as the largest driver.
Box 1. Luxembourg: Some Defining Traits
 A stable political environment with a tradition of consultation with social partners. After
19 years under Prime Minister Juncker, a coalition of three other parties took office in late 2013. In its
Programme Gouvernemental, the new government committed to focus on policies to manage the
public finances soundly and keep gross debt below 30 percent of GDP; promote growth, sustainable
development, and social cohesion; and fight unemployment.

 A demonstrated ability to adapt to large economic shocks and
reposition the economy. This has included early steps to embrace
capital account openness and adapt prudential and legal
frameworks, making Luxembourg a center for eurobond issuance
and many other financial flows and activities.

 A complex financial hub that serves all of Europe. The focus is
on low margin, high volume business, especially valuation, custody,
settlement, and legal services to funds. The sector includes:

 A banking system with assets of some 16 times GDP. Dominated
by units of foreign banks, some with key roles in group liquidity
management, the system also houses locally active banks (that
lend domestically) with assets of about 2¾ times GDP.

2,250

 The second largest investment fund industry in the world. Global
assets of almost €3½ trillion amount to some one-tenth of the
global total or 70 times GDP, with most funds enjoying EU
“passports.”

1,750

 A systemic international central securities depository,
Clearstream Banking S.A.. Active in custody, settlement,
collateral management (including triparty repo and securities
lending), and issuance services, Clearstream is an infrastructure
platform of similar importance as Belgium’s Euroclear and the
U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.
 A modestly sized insurance industry with assets of about 4 times
GDP. Life insurance dominates with some two-thirds of total
assets, followed by reinsurance, then property and casualty.

 A record of fiscal conservatism. A central government net asset
position of about 20 percent of GDP leaves Luxembourg as one of
two euro area sovereigns rated ‘AAA’ by all major rating agencies.

The large role of commuting workers leaves unemployment among residents relatively
elevated despite strong job creation, while falling inflation has tracked euro area trends
(Figure 2). Job growth has exceeded 2 percent y/y, although almost half of the new jobs go to cross
border workers, leaving the domestic unemployment rate at 7 percent. Residents’ incentives to take
low paying jobs are limited by a generous welfare system. Inflation has tended to exceed that in
neighboring countries, reflecting in part wage indexation and, this year, a VAT rate increase.

The banking system appears well capitalized, although profit conditions are tight
(Figure 3). There were 143 credit institutions as of February 2015. Capital ratios are high, as is capital
quality, with fully loaded Basel III capital requirements easily met by most banks. The ECB’s
Comprehensive Assessment identified an end 2013 capital shortfall at one bank operating in
Luxembourg (an Italian bank with a Luxembourg subsidiary), but deemed this eliminated by capital
raisings during 2014. Although only a few banks lend locally, credit to domestic households and
firms amounts to some 90 percent of GDP. Declining interest margins are partly offset by growing
fee income from various services for the investment fund industry. Banks with negative net income
in 2014 accounted for some 4 percent of system assets.
4.
Search-for-yield inflows and buoyant equity markets are driving strong growth in the
investment fund industry (also Figure 3). The total number of funds stood at 3,893 as of February
2015. Assets under management have more than doubled since 2008, increasing by half a trillion
euros in the last seven months alone. With some 85 percent of these assets in products compliant
with the Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive,
equity is sourced through extensive distribution networks across the EU and beyond, and the

proceeds are mostly invested abroad. Strong net investment inflows reflect a search for yield at a
time of falling bank deposit rates, with corporate cash pools playing a significant role.

The central bank is a net creditor to
the Eurosystem, and has asked the
government for more capital. Large TARGET2
net claims (reflecting banking system net
foreign assets) expand the monetary authority’s
balance sheet, helping reduce its capital to asset
ratio to the lowest in the Eurosystem. The
government has pledged to augment the
central bank’s capital base going forward.

confirm its role as a financial hub (Figure 4).
The large surplus on financial and other services is increasingly offset by growing deficits on
investment income linked to growth in investment fund assets. Staff’s External Balance Assessmentlite (EBA-lite) suggests the current account surplus is somewhat below norm, and the real effective
exchange rate remains close to its long-term equilibrium value (Appendix I). The positive net
international investment position is dwarfed by gross asset and liability positions reflecting the
domiciliation of multinational corporations (MNCs), securities issuers, banks, and funds.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Staff’s baseline has growth slowing from almost 3 percent in 2014 to 2¼ percent over
the medium term (Figure 5). Near-term prospects have brightened with those for the euro area.
Potential growth has likely fallen from pre crisis levels, however, including as a result of financial
sector activity shifting from banks to funds, where value added is smaller. Combining filtering
techniques and production function approaches, staff puts potential growth at 1½–2¼ percent.

The macroeconomic projections are fraught with more than the usual degree of
uncertainty. As a city state economy, Luxembourg displays all the attendant patterns of strong
growth, high output volatility, and sometimes large revisions to historical data. Migration,

Foreign tax policy initiatives that could diminish Luxembourg’s tax base and financial
sector events that could blemish its strong reputation are the main country-specific risks. EU
and OECD initiatives to tighten tax transparency standards, along with U.S. proposals to tax offshore
cash pools of U.S. firms, could hurt Luxembourg’s standing as a destination for FDI and a center for
corporate treasury operations (Box 2). The failure of the Espírito Santo group of companies last year
reminded that Luxembourg’s reputation for strong prudential oversight can be tested in unexpected
ways even when other competent authorities are in charge under EU law. Although such processes
or events could see some activities migrating away—with adverse impacts on total factor
productivity, exports, jobs, and revenues—the authorities’ strategy of engagement in the relevant
international fora is the correct risk management approach.
10.
Near-term growth risks are broadly symmetric around staff’s baseline. Assuming the
Luxembourg-specific challenges are well managed, domestic demand and net exports could beat
the baseline. While the impact on disposable incomes of lower oil prices is largely offset by higher
VAT (a rate hike took effect on January 1, 2015), that on investment from cheaper term funding and
lower threshold returns on projects related to the ECB’s quantitative easing (QE), and from the EU
Investment Plan, could surprise positively. Goods exports would suffer should there be a protracted
period of slow growth in advanced economies. Service exports are tied to demand from global
investors for asset management services, where the positive effects of QE are tempered by
expectations of U.S. tightening.
11.
Should geopolitical tensions or renewed financial stress in the euro area trigger a
surge in global financial market volatility, the effects for Luxembourg could be mixed. On the
one hand, a severe reversal of benign financial conditions would hurt equity market performance
and risk appetite, triggering valuation effects and outflows from the fund industry. On the other

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

hand, the banking system could once more receive safe haven inflows, as was the case during the
global financial crisis in 2008–09.
Box 2. Luxembourg: Selected Tax and Tax Transparency Initiatives
Several tax initiatives underway abroad have ramifications for Luxembourg:

 The OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. Launched in 2013 at the G20’s
request, the project identifies 15 areas for action. In late 2014, the OECD issued recommendations in
seven of these, proposing measures to curb hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences
in tax treatment across countries as well as “treaty shopping” and other forms of arbitrage. The
OECD also called for automatic information sharing on the allocation of profits, economic activity,
and taxation of MNCs. Recommendations in the remaining eight areas are due later in 2015.

 EU rule changes and investigations:
 In 2014, the Directorate General for Competition launched probes into whether transfer pricing
at four MNCs in the EU, two of which are in Luxembourg, could involve impermissible state aid.
 In January 2015, new anti abuse provisions were added to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive that
governs intragroup profit distribution, closing loopholes related to hybrid loans and mandating
other steps to ensure that “tax arrangements reflect economic reality.”
 In March 2015, the Commission presented a package of tax transparency measures as part of its
agenda to tackle corporate tax avoidance and harmful tax competition in the EU, including a
legislative proposal for automatic sharing of advance cross border tax rulings.
 Going forward, the Commission also plans to present an action plan on corporate taxation,
which could include a re-launch of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal and
ideas for implementing the BEPS recommendations.

 U.S. overseas taxation. The U.S. federal budget for fiscal 2016 proposes a one-time 14 percent tax on
the stock of accumulated overseas profits of U.S. corporations and a 19 percent tax on future
profits. These profits are currently not subject to U.S. taxation until repatriated, which motivates U.S.
firms to hold an estimated $2 trillion abroad, including in jurisdictions such as Luxembourg.
Luxembourg, in turn, is increasing tax transparency. The authorities have commenced automatic
exchange of information on interest payments under the EU Savings Directive (from 2015). They will
extend this to other sources of income as well as account balances (from 2017), and are committed to
implementing the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax
Matters (by 2017). They also exchange, upon request, firm specific tax rulings with other EU countries,
and have strengthened information requirements for tax ruling applications and related procedures.
Luxembourg has also made progress in AML/CFT in recent years. Next steps will need to center on
the 2012 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, where effective implementation would
necessarily include stricter approaches to tax crimes and transparency.

12.
In the macroprudential domain, there is some risk that a protracted period of low
interest rates could spawn a credit fueled housing bubble (Figure 6). Credit to households has
been growing by about 7 percent y/y, yet household debt seems managable (data vary by source). If
a bubble were to develop, housing prices could correct, compressing household consumption or
triggering defaults and possibly disrupting credit to the economy. With rising housing prices
spanning decades, reflecting population and job growth combined with zoning and other rules that
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

LUXEMBOURG

constrain supply, there seems no immediate reason to expect a correction, although pockets of risk
are possible. Separately, volatile aggregate credit to firms reflects the prevalence of MNCs with cross
border financing arrangements and treasury operations run out of Luxembourg.

The authorities shared staff’s assessment of macroeconomic risks, but viewed the

challenges to Luxembourg’s economic model and growth prospects more favorably.
Considering improving indicators for the euro area, boosted by QE, they view growth of almost
3 percent in 2014 as a reasonable guide to medium-term performance. The strength and diversity of
the financial sector as well as government efforts to diversify the nonfinancial economy were
highlighted as supporting factors, as were the commitment to fiscal prudence, the track record of
political and social stability, the region’s skilled multilingual labor force, and the business friendly
environment with responsive authorities and modern infrastructures. Recognizing the importance of
reinforcing financial sector oversight arrangements and engaging fully in EU and international
processes to enhance tax transparency standards, and having refined the scope of advance tax
agreements (or so-called rulings) for Luxembourg resident taxpayers, they expressed confidence that
any resulting changes would serve to strengthen Luxembourg’s economic model. To illustrate, they

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

pointed to the fact that the move toward tax transparency had had no material impact on the level of
bank deposits: inflows from high net worth clients and nonfinancial corporations attracted by
sophisticated one-stop-shop services have smoothly offset outflows from smaller depositors.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
Luxembourg’s strong general government net asset position of over 40 percent of
GDP affords some flexibility in tackling significant revenue and long-term pension challenges
(Figure 7). Budget deficits, when they occur, are driven by the central government, with the social
security fund generating surpluses and borrowings by other arms of government limited by law.
Gross debt, which has risen from single digits pre crisis to 23 percent of GDP in 2014 (driven in part
by state support for Fortis, where shareholdings are now profitable), is still among the lowest in the
EU. The long-term pension position is challenging, however, and international tax transparency
initiatives could have adverse implications for the revenue base. As a small open economy, it is
appropriate that the authorities are targeting a budget surplus over the medium term.

Budget 2015 launches a multi year fiscal consolidation to address falling e-VAT
revenues. Under a phased shift in EU taxation on e-commerce from domicile of seller to residency
of purchaser as legislated in 2008, retained e-VAT revenue is set to more than halve in 2015, to
about 1 percent of GDP, and halve again by 2018. In response, the authorities have raised VAT rates
by 2 percentage points, expected to yield ½ percent of GDP in 2015 with the full impact kicking in
from 2016, and have introduced a temporary personal income tax to balance the budget, set at
½ percent of income. After an expenditure

Luxembourg’s first medium-term budgetary plan envisages additional cost savings,

established Fiscal Council, as required under the
EU Fiscal Compact.
17.
The government’s fiscal package also includes a small wealth fund. Recognizing the
transient nature of certain revenues, the plan is for fuel duties and remaining e-VAT totaling about
€50 million annually to flow to the fund, which has a target size of €1 billion (just over 2 percent of
2014 GDP) by 2035. Observing that this is small relative to the projected future financing needs of
the pension system, and too small to exert a meaningful disciplining impact on fiscal policy, staff
suggested options be considered to transfer some central government financial assets to the fund,
and that all future extraordinary receipts (divestment proceeds, principally) be channeled to it.

recommendations to: (i) abolish early retirement schemes to raise the effective retirement age;
(ii) introduce progressive reductions of the replacement rate; (iii) limit credits for time spent outside
work; (iv) institute actuarial neutrality around the statutory retirement age; and (v) index the
retirement age to longevity. The authorities could use the upcoming review of pension finances in
2016 to adopt at least some of these changes.
19.
In light of global tax initiatives, staff recommended the authorities develop options to
make the revenue system more robust and achieve additional expenditure savings (Selected
Issues, Chapter I). Taxes on the financial sector and on cross border retail trade (in fuel, tobacco, and
other goods) yield over a quarter of total revenues. Significant receipts could prove susceptible to
changes in EU and OECD tax standards and U.S. moves to tax U.S. firms’ profits held abroad. The tax
challenge should be quantified as details evolve, with the 2015–16 tax policy review providing a
good opportunity to assess options, including adjusting property related taxes, corporate tax
exemptions, and selected financial sector levies. Further expenditure savings should also be sought,
informed by regular expenditure reviews. On both the revenue and expenditure sides, the effort
should be to identify measures that are equitable and durable and minimize the drag on growth.
20.
Staff also advised that care be taken to ensure that firm specific tax rulings avoid
encouraging unduly complex structures, especially in the financial sector. Demand for such
rulings often reflects the lack of harmonization across national tax regimes, and there are benefits in
providing certainty to firms. Recently, however, it has become apparent that some rulings could give
rise to layers of holding companies transacting with each other in hybrid instruments, which in the
financial sector can multiply challenges for regulators and supervisors.
21.

The authorities stressed their commitment to sound fiscal policies. They expressed

confidence that their budget targets for 2015 and the medium term will be met or exceeded, with
planned consolidation measures either implemented in full or substituted with equally strong

alternatives. On pensions, they agreed that long-term population projections by Eurostat that assume
large net immigration should be viewed with caution, and acknowledged the importance of further
structural reforms.
22.

They underlined their commitment to engaging fully in EU and OECD standard setting

on tax transparency, but maintained that it is still early to assess revenue impacts if any. With
most rules still evolving, they held that the various initiatives have not yet translated into specific risks
to the revenue base that would warrant a policy response. The Ministry of Finance emphasized that it
is closely monitoring developments in the EU and OECD in order to make adjustments as necessary to
be fully compliant with international standards. In any event, Luxembourg is participating fully in
exchanges of tax information, including for firm specific rulings upon request. Regarding corporate
taxes, the Ministry of Finance noted that rates and exemptions are being analyzed in detail in view of
the envisaged tax reform. Regarding taxes on fuel and tobacco, it asserted that initiatives aimed at EU
harmonization have not gained traction and that rates are finely tuned to avoid increasing CO2
emissions while preserving fiscal revenues. Regarding indirect financial sector taxation, the Ministry of
Finance stressed that no comparable tax exists in other financial centers and hence any adjustment
must be carefully pondered. Stressing the merits of approaching the tax policy review as a consultative
process, the Ministry also emphasized the need for a continued strong role for expenditure measures.

B. Financial Sector Policies
23.
The European banking union should be especially positive for Luxembourg, and the
transition to it needs to be accelerated. Financial stability issues center on the banking system
given maturity transformation and leverage. Given the system’s large size and extensive foreign
ownership, Luxembourg will benefit particularly from the common backstop of the Single Resolution
Fund, which will eventually exceed 100 percent of Luxembourg GDP. The more integrated prudential
oversight under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) should help remove blind spots for
Luxembourg supervisors, shedding light on potentially important risks emanating from foreign
operations of large complex banking groups with units in Luxembourg. Resource constraints and
other factors have delayed Luxembourg’s transposition of the Fourth Capital Requirements Directive
and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Further delays should be minimized, and
efforts made to also promptly adopt the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive.
24.
In anticipation of BRRD requirements, the authorities are proactively putting in place
new bank resolution arrangements. Hitherto, failing credit institutions have been resolved under
Luxembourg’s Banking Act of 1993, which provides a few bank specific provisions that prevail over
the corporate bankruptcy code. The nascent resolution function is being assembled at the
Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), the national competent authority for bank
and investment fund regulation and supervision. The new resolution department in the CSSF is
already collecting and reviewing bank information for resolution planning purposes, using existing
supervisory powers to gather information. Once the BRRD is transposed into national law (which
must occur by end 2015 at the very latest), the CSSF will become the recognized national resolution

16

authority for both banks and bank holding companies and will interact closely with the Single
Resolution Mechanism at the EU level.
25.
Recently exposed limitations in EU oversight arrangements for cross border banking
groups suggest Luxembourg should move proactively to reinforce sound approaches (Selected
Issues, Chapter II). Banco Espírito Santo, Portugal’s third largest bank, was brought down in mid 2014
by weaknesses at its Luxembourg based holding companies, at the bank itself, and other group
entities. The experience highlighted potential lacunae in EU oversight arrangements for cross border
banking groups, where the identification of nonbank companies exercising “dominant influence”
over banks is principles based, and the approach to the mixing of banking and commerce is
permissive. EU laws do not directly apply requirements on nonbank companies that control banks to
hold capital and thus be a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries. However, although the EU
Capital Requirements Regulation does not mandate such norms, it does not forbid member states
from writing these or other rules for such companies into national law. Luxembourg’s reputation for
prudential conservatism would be well served by taking measured action at home, while also
leading a broader debate at the EU level.
26.
Maximizing the benefits of participation in the banking union may require additional
national supervisory resources and coordination arrangements. Banks owning more than
80 percent of Luxembourg banking assets fall under the direct supervision of the ECB, either
individually or through consolidated supervision of euro area parents. Both the CSSF and to a more
limited extent the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg (BCL), responsible for liquidity supervision,
contribute to SSM joint supervisory teams (JSTs) for these significant institutions. The CSSF’s staff
strength increased by one-quarter over 2013–14 while its complement of bank supervisors doubled.
CSSF and BCL supervisors are now engaged in 32 JSTs (of which five are for banks headquartered in
Luxembourg). Resources should be expanded further as needed, where the increase in CSSF fees
from 2013 was helpful. The CSSF and BCL could also consider a memorandum of understanding
formalizing their respective responsibilities on JSTs as well as modalities for information sharing.

with the related risk of sharp drops in fund
value. The investor base that would absorb
such losses is overwhelmingly in Europe (U.S. promoters are barred from marketing non U.S. fund
products to U.S. retail investors and thus also distribute mostly in Europe). By contrast, roughly half
of total assets are invested outside Europe, and roughly half of those in the United States. In parallel,
the insurance industry’s investment portfolios and profitability also merit close monitoring, where
current low interest rate conditions may challenge the life segment in particular.
29.
A systemic risk committee tasked with macroprudential oversight should be formed
promptly. After several iterations, recently passed legislation provides for an appropriately broad
reach, extending well beyond banking. The committee will bring together the financial sector
authorities (the BCL, the CSSF, and the Commissariat aux Assurances for insurance) and the Ministry
of Finance, collectively tasked with analyzing and assessing macrofinancial stability and systemic risk
and recommending corrective actions. Duties should include not only risk monitoring but also the
identification of regulatory gaps and impediments to effective policy action. Thus one focus for the
committee could be the housing market, another should be links between banks and funds, and yet
another might be arrangements for holding company oversight in a cross border context.
30.
Growth in the housing exposures of locally active banks warrants continued
monitoring and readiness to deploy additional macroprudential tools if needed. Housing prices
and mortgage lending continue to rise, raising concentration risks. Some households could become
overstretched. In late 2012, the CSSF took positive steps to dampen these risks, advising banks to

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

limit loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to 80 percent and imposing higher risk weights on mortgages with
higher LTV ratios. Staff advised the authorities to step up data collection on property lending, and to
prepare appropriately targeted macroprudential tools for deployment if needed.
31.
The upcoming Financial Stability Assessment (FSA) will provide an opportunity for a
deeper dive into financial sector issues. As a systemic jurisdiction, Luxembourg is subject to
mandatory FSAs. The last Financial System Stability Assessment was discussed by the IMF Executive
Board on May 13, 2011. Assuming the next Article IV Consultation concludes on or before
May 13, 2016, the next FSA may feed into the 2017 Article IV Consultation. Emphasizing the benefits,
staff encouraged the authorities to proceed early with the next FSA.
32.

The authorities agreed that the banking union presents important opportunities and

that delays in transposing related EU directives are regrettable. The CSSF noted that the
integrated cross border approach to supervision under the SSM is already engendering a more timely
flow of information on risks to the Luxembourg units of foreign banking groups. It stressed both ability
and willingness to increase staffing contributions to JSTs, yet pointed out that, as its fees have been
calculated for supervision of the domestic system, there may be constraints to its participation in the
consolidated supervision of parent banks in other national jurisdictions. The CSSF also observed with
satisfaction that the switch to automatic exchange of financial account information has been managed
smoothly. The Ministry of Finance, in turn, attributed the legislative delays to the surge in EU directives
just as a new national government took office. It assured that the transpositions are now underway.
Keen to first build a track record implementing new AML/CFT standards, the Ministry deems a later
FSAP more productive, but has not yet taken a formal decision.
33.

The authorities pointed to both national and EU initiatives that will reinforce

Luxembourg’s strong brand name in finance. At the national level, the legislation that has
established a systemic risk committee will improve financial sector oversight, as will implementation of
a proposal to restrict the use of a bank’s franchise name by unregulated and unaffiliated nonbanks,
thereby cutting unwanted reputational linkages. The authorities agreed that Luxembourg’s reputation
would be well served by initiating and leading a debate on EU regulatory arrangements for nonbank
companies that control banks, where Luxembourg is an important home and host jurisdiction, and
decided in principle that they would do so. They felt that downside risks to the financial sector and the
broader economy had receded with the improving euro area outlook. They underlined that the
diversification of the financial sector is contributing to financial stability and is mitigating downside
risks to the economy. At the same time, they recognized that the housing market merits continued
monitoring, where better data collection is a work in progress.

C. Policies for Growth
34.
Education and labor market reforms would help support economic diversification. In
the financial sector, several new activities look promising, including alternative investment funds,
Islamic finance (where in September 2014 Luxembourg became the first sovereign issuer of a euro
denominated sukuk), and renminbi operations (where the same month one Chinese bank subsidiary
in Luxembourg was granted clearing privileges with the People’s Bank of China). Beyond finance, the
logistics sector has the potential to employ a relatively large number of low skilled workers, which
would help lower structural unemployment. The remaining priority sectors (biotech, ICT, green
technology) are more specialized, requiring more advanced skills. Staff asserted that the education
system should deliver quality commensurable with high public spending. Vocational training, in
particular, should be made more nimble. More active labor market policies and better targeting of
social benefits could raise labor force participation rates and preserve incentives to work.
35.

The authorities agreed that well crafted reforms would support diversification efforts,

pointing to various initiatives aimed at improving labor market functioning. They are focusing
on increasing women’s participation in the labor force, including by removing disincentives to work,
and are continuing to modernize the employment agency so jobseekers can receive more personalized
treatment, supported by better links to employers. A raft of training schemes is underway to increase
the employability of youth and the long-term unemployed, while reforms of the minimum guaranteed
income scheme for households seek to promote participation of second earners in the workforce.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The core challenge Luxembourg faces is to strengthen an economic model that has
served it well, where reputation is critical. The model emphasizes maintaining fiscal stability and
openness to labor and capital, practicing prudentially conservative financial sector oversight, and
responding swiftly to investor needs. The main priorities facing policy makers include making the tax
system more robust, taking steps to buttress Luxembourg’s reputation as a sophisticated and
proactive financial regulator, and making the pension system more resilient to population aging.
37.
It is appropriate that Luxembourg, as a small open economy where labor and capital
flow freely across borders, is targeting budget surpluses over the medium term. Medium-term
fiscal targets and measures to achieve them are broadly appropriate. Periods of strong growth
should be used to increase buffers. Budget 2015 and the medium-term fiscal plan are a strong
response to falling e-VAT revenues. The new wealth fund, too, is a positive step, although as set up
it is too small to exert a meaningful impact on fiscal discipline. At a minimum, future divestment
proceeds (including from significant state shareholdings in the financial sector) should flow to it.
38.
Deeper pension reforms should not be deferred. Although the government’s large net
asset position affords some flexibility, social security assets of about 30 percent of GDP prefinance
only part of the large future increase in age related spending. EU projections for very strong

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

population growth should be treated with caution because migratory flows are difficult to predict
and are themselves a function of solid macroeconomic, including fiscal, fundamentals.
39.
The authorities should continue to engage fully in EU and OECD tax transparency
initiatives, assess the impact of any tax base erosion at home, and work to develop options.
Taxes on the financial and corporate sectors and on cross border retail trade yield sizable revenues.
Tax challenges and risks should be quantified, and the upcoming tax policy review used to identify
options. Further expenditure savings should also be sought. On both the revenue and expenditure
sides, measures should be found that are equitable and durable and minimize the drag on growth.
40.
Turning to the financial sector, the banking union is especially positive for
Luxembourg, and no effort should be spared to promptly adopt related EU directives. By
taking an integrated approach across countries, the SSM is better able to shine light on important
risks. The revised arrangements for a systemic risk committee, with a reach extending well beyond
banking, are promising. Duties of the committee should include not only monitoring and containing
macroprudential risks but also identifying regulatory gaps. As macroprudential tools are readied for
use, the choice of instruments should be informed by relevant data gathering and analysis.
41.
Advocating for better EU oversight arrangements for groups that include banks will
show Luxembourg in a positive light. Luxembourg’s tradition of capital account openness, itself
supported by well articulated policies for exempting banks’ claims on their affiliates from large
exposure limits, has fostered large cross border financial flows. As many of these flows are
intragroup, effective oversight of banking conglomerates is central to Luxembourg’s standing as a
financial hub. All options should be explored, therefore, all steps taken, and all lessons shared on
how best to improve oversight of nonbank holding companies that control banks as well as their
nonbank subsidiaries. Luxembourg’s proposal to sever unwanted reputational links by restricting the
use of a bank’s franchise name by nonbanks claiming no affiliation is a sound starting point and
should be implemented. This and other changes should be promoted at EU level.
42.
In other policies to lift growth prospects, diversification efforts need to be supported
by steps to equip workers with relevant skills. Job creation is strong, yet joblessness among
residents remains elevated by historical standards, reflecting the important (and positive) role of
cross border workers as well as generous benefits for, and skills mismatches among, residents.
Vocational training in particular should be made more nimble. Steps being taken to lift youth and
women’s participation in the labor force are welcome.
43.
Staff recommends the next Article IV Consultation with Luxembourg be held on the
standard 12 month cycle.

Table 3. Luxembourg: Risk Assessment Matrix1/
Source of risks
Business model risk:

Relative likelihood and
transmission channels
Medium

Impact if realized
High

Impact of changes in
financial sector
regulatory landscape
larger than expected

Luxembourg’s attraction as a
financial center for cross border
activities could diminish, and
financial and commercial flows
routed through Luxembourg
could decline

Business model risk:

Medium

High

Changes in EU and
international taxation
rules result in further
revenue losses

A significant share of revenue
relates to cross border activities,
including remaining e-VAT,
corporate taxes, and fuel and
tobacco excises

Significant hit to
revenues, growing
deficits, and shrinking
government net worth

High

Medium

G-RAM risk:
Protracted period of
slower growth in
advanced economies
(including the euro
area)

Strong trade and financial
linkages make Luxembourg
particularly vulnerable to
developments in the euro area.

G-RAM risk:
A surge in financial
market volatility as
investors reassess
underlying risk

High
Portfolio reallocation in
investment fund industry, bond
market stress in euro area, and
possible safe haven inflows
through the banking system

G-RAM risk:
Protracted period of
low interest rates
spawns excessive
mortgage borrowing
and housing price
increases

Low
Stability risks limited by large
buffers at banks and full
recourse lending, so the greater
risk may be of compression of
consumption if households
become overstretched

Significant impact on
total factor
productivity, growth,
exports, jobs, and
revenues

Exports and overall
growth held back

Low
Moderate impact on
domestic economy
unless the global
stress is especially
severe

Medium
Hit to domestic
demand and overall
growth, with possible
modest disruption of
domestic credit

Policy response
A range of proactive
steps, consistent with
relevant standards, to
preserve
Luxembourg’s
reputation as a solid
financial jurisdiction
Proactively adjust tax
and expenditure
policies and advance
pension reform

Diversify financial
services exports
toward non euro
area markets and
advance structural
reforms to boost
competitiveness
Monitor financial
sector exposures,
conduct stress tests,
and ensure robust
contingency
planning for
operational risks
Monitor risk
concentrations and
stand ready to take
well targeted
macroprudential
measures

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario
most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of
the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 percent and 50 percent).
The RAM reflects staff’s views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions
with the authorities. Non mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Historical Scenario

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment
1.
The EBA-lite approach extends to more countries than the EBA. The EBA-lite
methodology estimates a country’s current account norm based on economic fundamentals, cyclical
factors, and desirable policy variables. Using a calculated elasticity, exchange rate misalignment is
derived as the adjustment necessary to restore the current account balance to its norm.
2.
Luxembourg’s shrinking current account surplus is somewhat below the norm as
estimated using the EBA-lite methodology. The growing surplus on financial and other nonfactor
services (over 37 percent of GDP) is increasingly offset by deficits on workers’ remittances
(17 percent of GDP) and net investment income (15 percent of GDP). The latter reflects the
distribution of investment returns linked to the strong growth in investment fund assets booked in
Luxembourg. As a result of this and other factors, the current account surplus narrowed from more
than 10 percent of GDP in 2006–07 to about 5 percent in 2013–14. Using the EBA-lite approach, it is
projected at some 3½ percent of GDP below its norm of 8 percent of GDP in 2015, suggesting
scope for modestly higher domestic savings going forward, consistent with the thrust of staff’s
policy advice. Nonetheless, the deviation from the norm is relatively small for so open an economy.
3.
On staff estimates, the exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals. The
EBA-lite methodology indicates Luxembourg’s real effective exchange rate is overvalued by about
2½ percent relative to its equilibrium level. Thus there is no evidence of substantial misalignment.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance, although macroeconomic data are sometimes
released with a significant lag. The Central Service for Statistics and Economic Studies (Statec)
regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and provides an advance release
calendar for main statistical releases at http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/agenda/calendrierdiffusion/index.html.
Online access to Statec’s databases is available to all users simultaneously at the time of release
through the Statistics Portal of Luxembourg. Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic
data and analysis are:
Statistics Portal of Luxembourg
Statec
Central Bank of Luxembourg
Ministry of Finance

http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/
http://www.statec.public.lu/fr/index.html
http://www.bcl.lu/en/index.php
http://www.mf.public.lu/

National Accounts: Luxembourg avails itself of the flexibility under the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) for the timeliness of its national accounts, generally disseminating national
accounts data not later than four months after the reference period (the SDDS timeliness
requirement for the national accounts is three months). Reduction of the reporting lag would aid
surveillance.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Luxembourg has been a subscriber to the SDDS since May 12, 2006. Luxembourg uses SDDS
flexibility options also on the timeliness of the analytical accounts of the central bank.
No data ROSC is available.

2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION
Prepared By

European Department

This supplement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report on April 27, 2015. The thrust of the staff appraisal is unchanged.
The authorities have published their Stability and Growth Program update, with
new macroeconomic and fiscal projections through 2019. Released on April 30, the
update shows a small general government surplus in 2015, rising to 0.7–0.9 percent of
GDP in 2016–19. The projected impact of fiscal measures is broadly unchanged, as is
the list of measures. The revenue path, however, benefits from notably stronger growth
assumptions than those of staff: in 2015–16, real GDP is projected to expand by
3.6–3.8 percent on foot of better near-term prospects for the euro area supported by
quantitative easing; in 2017–19, it is shown settling at around 3 percent reflecting more
conservative estimates for potential growth relative to those at the time of the budget.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Luxembourg
and Amela Hubic, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 11, 2015

The authorities thank the staff for their analysis. The country report provides a broadly fair
and balanced assessment of the economic situation in Luxembourg.
A stable political and social environment, sound public finances and a modern legal and
regulatory framework are key elements of the strong Luxembourg economic model. This
model is further supported by a skilled and multilingual workforce, a business-friendly
environment with modern infrastructure and the country’s openness to the world.
Luxembourg is one of the two euro area countries to maintain an AAA credit rating with a
stable outlook from all three major credit agencies, demonstrating the market’s confidence in
the country, and its macroeconomic and financial fundamentals.
Recent economic developments and outlook
After a slight contraction in 2012, the economy started to recover in 2013 and is expected to
register a real GDP growth of 3 percent or more in 2014, driven by resilient domestic
demand and strong net services exports. The authorities project the economy to grow by 3.8
percent in 2015 and on average by 3 percent over the period 2016-2019. The projected lower
medium-term growth is based on a number of factors, namely: (i) slower recovery of the euro
area economies; (ii) progressive exit from accommodative monetary policy in the euro area;
and (iii) less favorable stock exchange developments.
In line with plunging oil prices, average inflation fell sharply in 2014 to 0.6 percent, down
from 1.7 percent in 2013. The low inflation environment is likely to limit the impact of the
2 percentage point increase in VAT rates in 2015. It is expected to be 0.3 percent in 2015.
Over the medium term, the inflation is projected to average 1.4 percent.
Strong and dynamic job creation led to an employment increase of 2.4 percent in 2014.
Employment is projected to further increase by 2.7 percent in 2015, and to average 2 percent
over the medium-term. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stabilized at 6.9 percent
at the end of 2014 and is expected to decline slowly in the coming years. Unemployment
tends to become more structural, reflecting some skill mismatches. The authorities’ efforts to
tackle this issue include continued modernization of the employment agency in order to
better connect the job seekers and employers, as well as the removal of disincentives to work.

2
Also, they took several steps to increase women and youth participation in the workforce. For
example, the EU initiative called ‘The Youth Guarantee’ has now been implemented.
The authorities have also paid careful attention to developing a climate conducive to business
and investment, which should help pursuing efforts to diversify the structure of the economy.
Specific sectors of growth such as logistics, ICT and bio- and eco-technologies have been
chosen for this purpose. These diversification efforts are already starting to bear fruit, in
particular in the rapidly growing ICT sector and logistics. Some of these new activities will
also help to tackle the long-term unemployment of low-skilled workers. The diversification
of the financial sector across business types, investment destinations and customer bases is
expected to further enhance the diversification of the financial sector itself.
Public finances
Luxembourg’s public finances remain sound. The country has managed to maintain its low
level of public debt as well as a significant budgetary safety margin with respect to the
Maastricht deficit reference value of 3 percent of GDP. Moreover, significant assets to fund
future pension liabilities - 29 percent of GDP at the end of 2014 - have been accumulated and
set aside in a dedicated and specialized fund. However, the country is facing a series of
structural challenges that may impact its public finances. Potential growth is declining and
the high degree of openness of the economy and its specialization in financial services make
public revenue vulnerable to high volatility. Also, several tax initiatives - such as the
OECD/G20 BEPS project or EU rule changes and investigations - that are underway might
have some consequences for the public revenues. The ageing population will also impact
public finances over the long-term.
In line with the 2015 update of the Stability Program, fiscal consolidation needs to amount to
€1 billion in structural terms for the 2015-2019 period. The aim is to ensure a gradual and
sustainable return to a balanced central government budget by the end of the government’s
tenure. The recently adopted Zukunftspak details the legislative agenda and sets out the
priorities for these consolidation measures and beyond.
In 2015, public finances are characterized by three main factors: (i) entry into force of the
new regime for the VAT on e-commerce that resulted in a loss of VAT revenues of about
1.2 percent of GDP; (ii) implementation of a counter-financing strategy with an estimated
impact of more than 1 percent of GDP; and (iii) improvement of the macroeconomic
conditions with a positive impact on government revenue. The conjunction of these three
elements is expected to allow the general government balance to reach a broadly neutral
stance in 2015, from a surplus of 0.6 of GDP in 2014.
On the expenditure side, the authorities finalized a comprehensive expenditure review which
has been used as a tool to prioritize savings over the next five years. The analytical phase was
finalized in June 2014 and provided the government with a report that lists a menu of
potential savings measures. Commitment to these spending cuts is underscored by the
government’s Zukunftspak, amounting to 1.7 percent of GDP. Knowing that the fiscal
situation would deteriorate significantly in 2015 in the absence of additional consolidation
measures, the authorities decided to act firmly by frontloading a significant number of the

3
identified measures and incorporating them in the 2015 and 2016 budgets. They remain
committed to fully implement all planned consolidation measures.
On the revenue side, the implementation of the 2008 EU Council Directive in the area of
supply of services has, as expected, had a negative impact on e-commerce VAT revenue. In
order to compensate this revenue loss of around €617 million (1.2 percent of GDP), the
authorities privileged the use of indirect and personal income taxation. In their view, this type
of consolidation measures is less harmful for economic growth. The government increased
all VAT rates by 2 percentage points with the exception of the reduced 3 percent rate on
basic goods, in order to shield the poorest households. This measure is expected to generate
0.6 percent of GDP of additional revenue. A temporary personal income tax, set at 0.5
percent of income, has also been introduced and is expected to generate additional revenue of
0.2 percent of GDP. Lastly, the favorable economic developments are expected to generate
additional revenue of about 0.3 percent of GDP, and additional expenditure savings of about
0.15 percent of GDP.
The authorities believe that it is premature to assess the revenue impacts, if any, potentially
stemming from the EU and OECD standard settings on tax transparency. With most rules
still evolving, the various initiatives have not yet translated into specific risks to the revenue
base that would warrant a policy response. The authorities are closely monitoring
developments in the EU and OECD in order to make the necessary adjustments to be fully
compliant with the international standards. The authorities remain committed to sound fiscal
policies. Therefore, in addition to the recent expenditure review, a tax policy review will take
place in 2015-2016. The authorities’ objective is to review the structure, composition and
economic rationale behind several taxes while preserving the current level of fiscal revenue.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is at 23 percent in 2014 - entirely denominated in euro - well below
the 60 percent level of the Maastricht criteria. Also, taking government assets into account
the public sector is even a net creditor. In order to diversify the public debt structure and to
further develop Islamic finance in Luxembourg, the authorities have successfully issued the
first euro-denominated Sukuk in October 2014. The public debt is projected to remain around
24 percent of GDP over the period 2015-2019, demonstrating the authorities’ commitment to
keep the public debt below 30 percent of GDP.
A law establishing a multi-year budgetary framework was adopted in 2014 and has already
been implemented for the 2015 Budget. The framework applies to all levels of government
and includes multi-year expenditure ceilings for the central government - consistent with the
new EU requirements under the legislative “six-pack” and the Fiscal Compact. Furthermore,
an independent Fiscal council has been set up. The council is provided with sufficient
resources and expertise in order to perform its mandate as defined under the relevant law, and
is expected to be fully operational for the 2016 budgetary process.
The authorities are aware of the importance of putting the public finances on a sound footing
in the long-term and have already introduced several initiatives, namely: health care reform
(since 2011), pension reform (since 2013) and consolidation measures following the
expenditure review (since 2015). They concur with the staff’s view about the need to place

4
the old-age pension system on a sustainable path and that the pension system still suffers
from some costly rigidities. Therefore, deeper pension reforms remain necessary. Under the
2013 pension regime, the authorities have an opportunity to appraise, using actuarial studies,
every 5 years, the consistency between the assumptions underlying the reform and the
updated financial trajectory of the scheme. Given the importance of this expenditure item and
the need for its further reform, the authorities have decided to advance the review by 1 year.
In this context, the authorities agreed with staff that the long-term population projections by
Eurostat, assuming large net immigration, should be viewed with some caution.
Financial sector
Luxembourg’s financial sector, a financial hub within the euro area that serves private and
institutional investors from all over the world, remains resilient and sound. Staff rightly notes
that significant regulatory changes at the European and international level represent
challenges. The authorities are closely monitoring the regulatory changes under way and
stand ready to take the necessary measures with a view towards consolidating and
strengthening the competitiveness of the financial sector in the long run. The continued
efforts of the Luxembourg authorities to diversify the forward-looking financial sector across
business activities, investment destinations and customer bases will also in the future
contribute to financial stability, growth and job creation.
Banking sector. The aggregate banking sector balance sheet has contracted with the financial
crisis. However, it stabilized in 2013-2014, reflecting an increase of asset values but also
some new inflows. The capitalization and liquidity ratios are sound, and the non performing
loans (NPLs) are very low. The banking sector continues to be profitable and remains an
important liquidity provider. The ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment did not identify any
capital shortfall in Luxembourg banks and showed that the six Luxembourg credit
institutions which underwent the Comprehensive Assessment, are robust, reliable and
sustainable. The authorities believe that the European banking union will be especially
positive for Luxembourg - a view supported by staff - as the more integrated prudential
oversight under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will eliminate eventual ‘blind
spots’ for the national supervisors. In this regard, the authorities are committed to
reinvigorate the country’s tradition of prompt implementation of EU financial services
directives.
The investment fund industry remains an important component of the financial system, and it
continues to growth rapidly. The industry has benefited from favorable financial markets and
has increased the amount of assets under management, also thanks to new inflows. It
continues to invest in a diversified class of assets and caters to a diverse pool of investors.
Regulatory issues. The authorities have continued to make substantial progress with
strengthening financial sector supervision. They have further enhanced on-site supervisions
and increased significantly the staffing resources of the supervisory authority (CSSF).
Similarly, the Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) has expanded and reinforced its
supervisory activities. The BCL will also provide the Secretariat for the recently formed
national Systemic Risk Committee. Lastly, the authorities committed to progressively increase
the capital base of the BCL starting this year.

5

The Systemic Risk Committee (SRC), involving the banking, market and insurance
supervisors, the BCL and the Ministry of Finance - established by law on April 1, 2015 - will
further strengthen the collaboration and exchange of information. The SRC will improve
financial sector oversight by, among other duties, closely monitoring the links between the
banks and the fund industry as well as the developments in the housing market. The
authorities took note of staff’s recommendation that the Committee’s duties should include
the identification of regulatory gaps and impediments to effective policy action.
Lastly, the authorities are looking forward to undertake the Financial Stability Assessment
(FSA) exercise scheduled for 2016. This exercise should help strengthen Luxembourg’s
financial model further, which has proven to be resilient in the recent global crisis.
Other issues
Tax transparency. The authorities underline their strong commitment to engaging fully in the
EU and OECD standard settings on tax transparency. This commitment has been supported
by several recent actions by the authorities, namely: an introduction of automatic exchange of
information on interest payments under the EU Savings Directive (since January 1, 2015), an
extension of this automatic exchange to other sources of income as well as account balances
(starting in 2017), and an implementation of the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of
Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (by 2017).
Housing market. Both structural and cyclical factors continue to contribute to the divergence
between supply and demand in the housing market. On the demand side, several factors play
a role, such as: high demand from residents and cross-border workers; relatively high
population and immigration growth; government policies on housing benefits; and low
mortgage interest rates. On the supply side, administrative constraints and low recurring
taxes on real estate property seem to be the restraining factors. In the recent expenditure
review, the authorities introduced changes to some policies regarding housing that are
expected to reduce somewhat the demand. Also, the SRC is expected to monitor high
domestic residential real estate exposure of domestically-oriented banks, which is important
for financial stability. The Committee will be in a position to recommend additional macroprudential measures should financial stability become in peril.
Remark
The authorities regret that some of their concerns expressed during various meetings with the
staff about the selected issues report were not taken into account. In particular, they believe
that the issue of the holdings’ regulation and supervision should rather be dealt with in a
different report (e.g. the IMF euro area staff report) instead of in the Luxembourg selected
issues report, as it mainly highlights potential shortcomings in the EU legislation. These
shortcomings need further consideration at the EU level, and cannot be solved unilaterally by
the Luxembourg authorities. Preserving a level playing field in financial markets at the
European level is a priority for the authorities.
