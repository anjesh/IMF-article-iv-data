EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
¾ Recent developments. While the oil boom has kept economic growth buoyant since
2004, inflation accelerated in 2006, fueled by expansionary fiscal policy and
transportation bottlenecks. The overall fiscal and external current accounts had large
surpluses, but the non oil fiscal deficit widened significantly.
¾ Article IV Consultation discussions. Staff proposed a strategy to boost sustainable
growth underpinned by: (i) a medium-term fiscal strategy that would reduce the non oil
deficit; (ii) reforms to improve public spending, budget transparency, and oil sector
management; and (iii) measures to reduce the cost of doing business. On the budget,
while the authorities presented to parliament a 2007 budget in line with staff
recommendations, they generally prefer flexibility in each budget year to accommodate
priority investment spending. They also prefer a more gradual approach to financial
sector and trade reforms.
¾ PRGF performance. The June 2006 performance criterion on the adjusted primary fiscal
balance was missed by 2.7 percent of GDP, and cumulative expenditure overruns at endyear 2006 were an estimated 5 percent of GDP. Most structural measures were also
missed. Staff cannot therefore recommend the conclusion of the third review under the
PRGF arrangement. Discussions on a possible staff-monitored program (SMP) to bring
the authorities’ program back on track continue.
¾ Key risks. The election cycle could further compromise fiscal discipline and delay
structural reforms. New large and nontransparent loans linked to foreign-financed
projects could jeopardize Congo’s debt sustainability and weaken its
governance/transparency agenda.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Past Fund advice centered on the need to improve fiscal management, adopt a
medium term framework, strengthen transparency and good governance, and create an
environment favorable to private sector activity. The authorities have made some progress
on transparency and governance, but fiscal and other structural reforms are lagging.
2.
The political debate is focused on the June/July 2007 parliamentary elections.
Pressure for higher government spending is mounting. Relations between the government
and civil society have deteriorated with the trial of two oil transparency activists.
3.
After two years of satisfactory performance, expenditure overruns and delays in
structural reforms in 2006 have derailed the PRGF-supported program. Discussions
continue on an SMP to establish the track record needed to resume discussions on the PRGFsupported program.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PRGF
4.
Macroeconomic performance was strong in 2004-05, but weakened in 2006.
Growth eased in 2006 as oil growth moderated from its rapid pace in 2005. Solid non oil
growth helped keep overall GDP growth above the average of the Communauté Économique
et Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale (CEMAC) region (Figures 1 and 2). Inflation accelerated
in 2006, reaching the highest level in the CEMAC in December (8.2 percent year-on-year),
fueled by expansionary fiscal policy and transportation disruptions (Figures 3 and 4). The
external current account registered large surpluses in 2005–06 because of higher oil export
receipts.
5.
Broad money expanded rapidly in 2005-06, mainly reflecting increases in net
foreign assets stemming from higher oil prices. Gross foreign assets soared to 26 percent
of GDP in 2006 (15 months of imports), from 13 percent in 2005, a significant part of which
was not sterilized. Credit to the private sector remained sluggish, reflecting: (i) limited
lending opportunities; (ii) the high cost of credit; and (iii) legal and institutional constraints in
recovering collateral.
6.
The health of the banking system is improving, partly reflecting the
recapitalization and privatization of one troubled bank. The cost of privatizing the bank
to the government budget was CFAF 14 billion (0.4 percent of GDP), given the negative net
worth of the bank. Nonetheless, the privatization process was not transparent and could cost
the government budget at least CFAF 6 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) more than the value of
the bank, according to an independent consultant.1 The buyer also has the option until

Price differentials fluctuate due to various factors, including shifts in regional supply-demand
balances for each main crude oil category. Price differentials have varied considerably over time. The
gap between Congolese blend price and the Brent price widened sharply during the second half of
2004 and early 2005, rising from about $2.10 a barrel in June 2004 to $5.30 in December 2006 with a
peak of $8.50 a barrel in December 2004. This partly reflected the strong growth in world demand for
light oil blends, and increases in freight costs, notably in 2004-2005, which producers of heavy fuels
were only partly able to pass on to their customers.

September 2007 to transfer additional assets deemed non-performing to the government,
which could push up further the budgetary cost. Under the regional rating system, three
banks were found in good condition at end-December 2005, while the fourth one was
reported to be in a fragile situation.
7.
New borrowing has eroded some of the recent improvement in external debt
indicators. The debt cancellation of about $1,7 billion and the rescheduling of outstanding
arrears done in the context of the 2004 Paris Club agreement have cut the public debt burden
from 213 percent of GDP in 2004 to an estimated 78 percent of GDP in 2006. Since the
March 2006 Paris Club agreement, the authorities have signed bilateral agreements with
8 Paris Club creditors. The last phase of the Paris Club agreement has not been activated as it
hinges upon satisfactory implementation of the PRGF arrangement. Most of the new external
borrowing was contracted with China—primarily for the electricity sector and partly on
nonconcessional terms—with commitments totaling $829 million (12 percent of GDP) at
end-2006. The authorities also signed a framework agreement with China in June 2006 for
cooperation in the areas of oil exploration, infrastructure, and social development, though its
financial terms are not yet available. The authorities have reached a tentative agreement with
London Club creditors on debt relief consistent with the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative.

8.
The PRGF-supported program went off-track in 2006 owing to large
expenditures overruns. Oil and non oil revenues were higher than programmed (text table).
The authorities, however, missed the June 2006 performance criterion on the adjusted
primary fiscal balance by 2.7 percent of GDP. Additional spending authorized by the October
2006 revised budget without prior consultation with Fund staff brought the expenditure
slippages to an estimated 5 percent of GDP at the end of 2006. Transfers to the refinery
(CORAF) more than doubled in 2006, reaching CFAF 65.7 billion (1.7 percent of GDP). The
non oil primary deficit surged to an estimated 44 percent of non oil GDP in 2006 (up from 27
percent in 2005).
9.
The authorities have not yet provided comprehensive fiscal data for 2006 to
allow Bank and Fund staff to assess the quality of investment spending. Limited
available data suggests that spending overruns were mostly in non-priority areas.
Furthermore, the authorities did not meet the conditions for the CFAF 50 billion adjuster on
additional investment spending authorized by the Board at the time of the second PRGF
review: the relevant projects were not approved by the World Bank and not awarded through
transparent and competitive procurement procedures.
10.
There were significant delays on the structural front, mainly reflecting political
concerns, capacity weaknesses, and limited donor assistance. The divestiture of other
business interests by both management and the executive board of the SNPC was met (end-

9
September 2006 structural performance criterion). However, the other performance criterion
on the diagnostic study of the commercialization of the SNPC and most other structural
benchmarks were missed. The audit covering the awarding of the Marine XI oil concessions
was published with a delay (Box 1).
Box 1. Key Findings and Recommendations of the Marine XI Audit2
The audit identified: (i) the weaknesses and limitations of government institutions involved
in the awarding process; (ii) the lack of regulations to implement the existing Code des
Hydrocarbures, in particular the lack of procedures for the awarding of contracts under
competitive conditions; (iii) the absence of clarity regarding the role that SNPC should play
as holder of mining rights in the process of negotiation of new contracts and its participation
in setting up of associations with private operators; (iv) the lack of regulations governing the
selection process in awarding contracts to local and foreign operators; (v) the potential
conflicts of interest between the oil sector and SNPC management; (vi) the lack of effective
controls; and (vii) the deficiencies in the Code of Penal Law as it does not cover conflicts of
interest in the oil sector.
The report recommends immediate measures to clarify the role that SNPC, issue a decree that
all new contracts are subject to an open international competitive bidding, and establish a
registry of qualified firms. Over the next few months, the authorities should also consider
establishing: (i) a new institutional framework that provides a clear separation of
responsibilities between the sector authorities and the national oil company SNPC; (ii) a
regulatory framework and implementation procedures to enhance current control
mechanisms, including those related to control, filing, data management and informationrelated procedures; and (iii) the adoption of regulations to implement the existing Code des
Hydrocarbures.

11.
Progress on the triggers for the HIPC completion point has been slow. As
detailed in the accompanying joint Bank-Fund report, the authorities have made progress on
the triggers in the forestry and social sectors. Progress otherwise has been slower than
envisaged in the action plan agreed to in August 2006.
III. ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
12.
The Article IV Consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of large
fiscal slippages in 2006 and pressures to increase spending in the run-up to the
upcoming elections. They centered on a strategy to increase sustainable growth while
preserving fiscal and external sustainability (see the selected issues papers (SIP)
accompanying this report).
2

See http://www.mefb-cg.org/

10
A. Medium-Term Scenarios and Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
13.
The medium-term outlook hinges on strong oil prices and production. Oil
production is expected to rise until 2010. The non oil growth rate is projected to remain at the
current level over the medium term. Inflation would gradually decline as the fiscal stimulus
is removed in the adjustment scenario. The external current account would continue to record
large surpluses in the next few years, contributing to a large build-up of international
reserves.
14.
Congo’s fiscal stance is not sustainable. Without fiscal adjustment, external debt
ratios would exceed sustainability thresholds by 2011 (Figure 5). The authorities did not
favor an immediate fiscal adjustment, as they anticipate increased growth, higher oil
revenues, and larger current account balances from potential new oil discoveries.
15.
Congo’s debt would become sustainable only after fiscal adjustment and full
delivery of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative (Appendix I). The non-adjustment
scenario and stress tests signal significant vulnerability to shocks, especially without changes
to bolster fiscal policy, raise growth, and increase foreign direct investment. In contrast, in
the adjustment scenario, the ratio of total public debt (external and domestic) to revenue is
projected to be sustainable for the next 20 years. The recently contracted new loans also
highlight the need to limit new borrowing, given their impact on the debt ratios over the next
decade.
16.
Based on this analysis, the discussions centered on an adjustment scenario to
achieve fiscal sustainability that allows room for priority spending.
17.
External competitiveness is key to developing the non oil sector and increasing
sustainable growth. Non oil exports (excluding wood) make up a small share of exports and
the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 8.4 percent in 2006, reflecting higher
inflation. Estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate confirm that expansionary fiscal
policy in 2006 led to an overvaluation of the REER (Figure 6). A continuation of this trend
could slow non oil economic growth and further compromise fiscal and debt sustainability.3

B. Policy Discussions
18.
The discussions centered around much-needed reforms to create the conditions
for higher growth and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In
particular, the authorities must avoid the procyclical spending of the 1980s, which together
with the civil war, contributed to increasing the overall deficit and debt burden and lowered
living standards (Figure 7). Staff proposed a strategy for sustainable growth that calls for (i) a
medium-term fiscal strategy aimed at moving toward fiscal sustainability in the long run;
(ii) reforms to improve the quality of public spending and increase transparency in budgeting
and the oil sector; and (iii) measures to reduce the cost of doing business to promote private
sector investment and higher non oil growth.
Anchoring fiscal policy to a medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS)
19.
Congo has one of the highest non oil fiscal deficits in sub-Saharan Africa
(Figure 8) and limited oil resources. The non oil primary balance has also deteriorated
since 2003. Such high deficits are clearly unsustainable given that oil production is expected
to peak in 2010 and be exhausted in about 20 years. The authorities attributed the slippages
in 2006 in part to higher outlays for security (owing to conflicts in neighboring countries),
the presidency of the African Union, and urgent priority investments.

20.
The mission highlighted the need for an MTFS that explicitly addresses both the
country’s limited oil resources and its development needs. Staff favored anchoring the

15
MTFS to a permanently sustainable non oil primary fiscal balance (Chapter II of the SIP).
This strategy would keep government spending as a percent of GDP constant, even after oil
resources are depleted, as new financial assets would yield enough interest income to finance
higher spending. The sustainable non oil primary deficit is estimated at around 13 percent of
non oil GDP, well below the 27 percent of 2005 and the 44 percent in 2006 (text table).4
Given the size of the deficit, fiscal policy should seek to reach sustainable deficits gradually
over the next 15 years, while allowing room for priority spending.

21.
For 2007, staff urged the authorities to pass a budget consistent with restoring
macroeconomic stability. Oil revenue would decline because of slowing production from
maturing oil fields and lower international prices. The staff proposed current primary
expenditures decline marginally on account of lower transfers to the oil refinery, while
capital spending increase to about 12 percent of GDP. The non oil primary balance would
thus decline by about 5½ percentage points to 38.6 percent of non oil GDP. While this drop
would reduce inflationary pressures, it would, nonetheless, loosen the non oil primary
balance by 10 percent of non oil GDP, compared with the program target for the second
review.
22.
The authorities agreed there is a need for prudent fiscal policy in the long run,
but argued for flexibility within each budget year for priority investments. For 2007,
they argued that the social rate of return on railway, electricity, water, and sanitation projects
outweighed the negative return on financial assets held at the BEAC. The authorities
therefore originally proposed capital spending of 15 percent of GDP. While acknowledging
the need to strike a balance between sustainability considerations and the country’s
4

Includes foreign-financed capital expenditure. A fiscal sustainability analysis anchored to maintaining
constant per capita spending (in real terms) yields similar results.

16
development needs, staff noted that the authorities’ proposed fiscal stance was unsustainable.
The mission emphasized the need to undertake a fiscal adjustment starting in 2007 to move
towards a sustainable non oil primary deficit. The authorities subsequently presented a
budget in line with staff’s recommendation but indicated their wish to discuss additional
capital spending for a possible supplementary budget, once improvements in public financial
management had been implemented. In this context, the mission also underscored the need to
accelerate implementation of public financial management (PFM) reforms to improve the
transparency of oil revenue management and the quality of spending. Finally, given the
envisaged increase in the government’s net asset position associated with the MTFS, the
mission urged the authorities to seek ways to increase the rate of return on financial assets.
The recent agreement to change the investment policies at the BEAC to increase the
remuneration of reserves could help in this regard.
23.
The authorities agreed on a policy of no new non-concessional external
borrowing. They however did not share the staff’s recommendation that concessional loans
should be contracted only if they do not jeopardize debt sustainability and are consistent with
Congo's strategy to enhance transparency and good governance. The mission urged the
authorities to continue negotiating with all creditors (including litigating creditors) on terms
consistent with the enhanced HIPC initiative.
Improving public financial management
24.
The composition and quality of public spending in 2006 deteriorated sharply.
Investment spending in health and education only accounted for 15 percent of total capital
spending. In addition, subsidies to the national oil refinery were significantly higher than
spending on primary education. A large portion of current expenditure was executed using
exceptional spending procedures, and many public investment contracts were awarded
without transparent procurement and open competitive bidding. For 2007, in the absence of
adequate information, staff could not evaluate the authorities’ proposal to increase capital
spending. The authorities shared staff’s advice to strengthen public finance management
(PFM) (Box 2 and SIP, Chapter III). With assistance from the World Bank, they
subsequently drafted a PFM action plan. Bank and Fund staff are of the view that this action
plan is a good start but still requires improvements, including details on each action, as well
as an extension to cover the reform of the expenditure chain and the management of public
investment projects.

17

Box 2. Staff Recommendations to Improve Public Financial Management
In cooperation with World Bank staff, the mission advised the authorities to
¾

Implement a new functional classification of the budget to improve transparency
and track poverty-related expenditures. The Fund is providing technical assistance,
but progress so far has been slow.

¾

Comply with the organic budget law, particularly in delineating responsibilities
between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning on investment
spending.

¾

Limit the recourse to exceptional spending procedures, consistent with the organic
budget law.

¾

Streamline current transfers, including by rapidly eliminating subsidies to the
domestic refined petroleum products, to increase pro-poor and infrastructure
spending.

¾

Implement a new public investment management system, with World Bank
assistance, to better align investment spending to the priorities in the PRSP.

¾

Establish a new procurement code in line with best international standards.

¾

Strengthen customs administration and the fight against tax fraud and corruption on
the revenue side.

¾

Improve the monitoring of the expenditure chain and control, with technical
assistance from the Fund.

Reducing the cost of doing business
25.
Congo ranks as one of the lowest countries in the world in terms of the ease of
doing business. According to the World Bank database, the cost of starting a business,
constraining labor legislation, difficulties in registering property and enforcing contracts,
limited access to credit, and restrictions on border trade are particular concerns (Table 13).
The mission underscored the importance of reforms that liberalize the price of energy and
basic commodities, strengthen governance, develop the financial sector, and promote
external trade (SIP, Chapters IV-VI).
26.
The authorities acknowledged that administered prices distort the efficient
allocation of resources and promote black markets. While they liberalized the price and
import of cement in February 2007, they did not support rapid liberalization of prices on
other important products, citing inflation concerns and social pressures. On domestic
petroleum product subsidies (1.9 percent of GDP in 2006), the authorities agreed in principle

18
to increase gradually the prices of jet oil, gasoline, and diesel. They argued that any increase
in electricity tariffs would be inappropriate given the country’s frequent blackouts and should
await completion of ongoing electricity projects.
27.
Governance and transparency must improve in order to attract foreign
investment to the non oil sector. Staff stressed that major governance concerns remain.
Recognizing that widespread corruption inflates the cost of doing business, the authorities
committed to step up efforts to establish transparent and effective institutions. They also
agreed to raise public awareness about the government’s agenda to fight corruption (text
table). They observed that good governance is a two-way process that must also involve
foreign companies that exploit Congo’s natural resources.

The mission expressed concern about the limited access to and high costs of
financial services in Congo (Text Table). The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment;
but they indicated that Congo’s financial sector has just emerged from a long and costly
restructuring that has yet to bear fruit. The mission encouraged the authorities to (i) widen
public access to and lower the cost of financial services by promoting the introduction of new
financial instruments, such as credit cards, automatic teller machines, and micro credits;
(ii) increase competition by surrendering the licensing rights to the COBAC, liberalizing
deposit and lending rates, helping microfinance institutions compete with banks, and
promoting cross-border competition within the CEMAC as recommended by the CEMAC
regional FSSA; and (iii) strengthen loan recovery and expand the types of collaterals, which
would help reduce interest spreads.

29.
The authorities stated that liberalizing interest rates was beyond their discretion
since monetary policy is set at the regional level. They insisted that the national authority
should maintain the right to license banks to ensure the health of the banking sector. On
licensing microfinance institutions, they took the view that the current procedure should be
kept to ensure the good quality of new entrants.
30.
Progress in Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) has been slow. The authorities acknowledged that Congo’s lack of a financial
intelligence unit (FIU) kept the CEMAC AML/CFT legal framework from being
implemented. Staff welcomed the authorities’ draft decree specifying the organization,
function, and financing of the FIU, and their plans to establish this unit soon. In the third
quarter of 2006, the authorities organized a workshop to educate stakeholders about the role
of the FIU.
31.
Trade practices both at the regional and national levels hinder Congo’s external
trade. The authorities noted the importance of external trade and emphasized the benefits
Congo could reap as the port of Point Noire expands into a regional hub. While recognizing
that tariffs are high and that other trade taxes add to the complexity of CEMAC’s trade policy
regime, they see deficient infrastructure as a larger barrier to trade. The mission also noted
the wide use of tariff exemptions (particularly for the oil sector) since 2004, which have
raised governance concerns and hurt revenue collection; onerous documentation
requirements for imports and exports; and weak preshipment inspections. The authorities
indicated their openness to discuss ways to simplify the structure of tariffs and other fees in
the context of CEMAC, eliminate nontariff barriers, and strengthen customs administration.
They are seeking technical assistance to fight customs fraud and collect trade-related
statistics.
32.
Staff met with representatives of parliament, civil society, trade unions, and the
employers’ associations. These stakeholders had serious concerns about governance and the
cost of doing business in Congo. They supported (i) the establishment of an anticorruption

20
committee with meaningful representation from civil society; (ii) submission to parliament of
an anticorruption law that regulates conflicts of interest in public administration and helps
tackle fraud; and (iii) public procurement reforms.
33.
The statistical database needs improving. In particular, the national accounts data
and balance of payments statistics need to be revamped. The authorities committed to
submitting a statistics law in 2007.
IV. DISCUSSIONS ON A STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
34.
Discussions on an SMP are ongoing. With the third review held up by large
spending overruns and delays in key structural reforms, the authorities requested an SMP
during the mission of October 2006. A second round of discussions took place in
February/March 2007 in Washington. Following the discussions, the authorities presented a
2007 budget in late March 2007 to parliament in line with staff recommendations. Policy
discussions on the pace and nature of structural reforms continue.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Congo is at a crossroads. Higher oil exports and fiscal revenues in the past two
years, together with prospects for additional debt relief and peace consolidation, could pave
the way for higher sustainable growth and greater progress on the MDGs. Such a desirable
outcome depends on the policy choices the authorities will make in the next few years.
36.
Policy implementation in 2006 was disappointing. The government increased
spending without addressing weak budgetary controls and a nontransparent procurement
system. The bulk of additional spending was for capital projects under government control.
Fiscal policy is thus straining absorptive capacity, as evidenced by rising inflation and supply
shortages. The supplementary budget passed in October 2006 worsened the fiscal slippages,
further straining the economy.
37.
It is imperative that Congo avoid repeating the boom-and-bust cycle of the
1980s, especially given the projected decline in oil production within the next decade.
Sound macroeconomic policies, built around a sustainable fiscal strategy, should enable the
authorities to meet pressing investment needs without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability
or fiscal sustainability. While the overall magnitudes presented in the draft 2007 budget
appear broadly appropriate, further action is required to strengthen the quality and
composition of government spending. In addition, the authorities should frame capital
spending in the context of a simplified medium-term expenditure framework to ensure
budgetary allocations reflect government policy priorities.
38.
Improved public financial management is crucial for creating the conditions for
sustained growth and poverty reduction. Key reforms to build a sound PFM system
include expenditure prioritization, the introduction of a functional classification of the

21
budget, an overhaul of public investment management, elimination of exceptional spending
procedures, adoption of a procurement code in line with best international standards, and
transparent oil resource management.
39.
Stronger implementation of the transparency and governance agenda would
promote growth. In this regard, the anticorruption committee being established must be
independent and represent civil society. The implementation of the anticorruption law is
expected to lead to improvements on governance in public administration and provide a way
to manage conflicts of interest. Finally, adopting the recommendations of the audit of the
Marine XI oil concession would maximize government revenue and establish transparency in
awarding oil concessions.
40.
Developing the financial sector would advance economic diversification. Congo’s
low financial intermediation hinders investment and economic growth. Reforms should
include measures to simplify licensing procedures, improve access to financial services, and
increase regulatory transparency. The privatization of a troubled bank in 2006 in a nontransparent and costly way to the budget is regrettable.
41.
The trade regime needs to be rationalized and made more transparent. Priorities
should be to spearhead trade reform in the context of the CEMAC, adopt a transparent trade
regime, minimize bureaucratic procedures for exports and imports, and gradually phase out
exemptions. The authorities are also encouraged to work with their CEMAC partners on
lowering the common external tariff.
42.
There is a need to lower the cost of doing business to attract private investment.
While the liberalization of the price of cement is a positive step in this direction, the
authorities should press ahead with comprehensive reforms aimed at liberalizing domestic
energy and commodity prices.
43.
Mixed progress in implementing triggers for the HIPC completion point is cause
for concern. Corrective steps to minimize delays and establish a better record under an SMP
would help revitalize the PRGF-supported program. This would unlock debt relief and pave
the way for higher growth and poverty reduction.
44.
Congo’s data needs to improve in terms of quality, timeliness and coverage to
ensure adequate surveillance and monitoring of program implementation; and data
provision to staff should be on a regular and timely basis. The authorities should seek
external support to improve data quality.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 14, 2002.

1

In view of the structural shift in GDP starting in 2005 stemming from significantly higher oil prices, some of the ratios to GDP may
not be comparable to past levels.
Projections for the GDP deflator are based on terms of trade projections, which include a prudence factor, with oil price
projections reduced by US$10/barrel relative to WEO price forecasts.
3
The large decline in net domestic assets for the projection period reflects an important buildup of assets in the oil revenue stabilization account.
4
Including grants.
5
Revenue (excluding grants) minus noninterest current expenditure minus domestically-financed capital expenditure and net lending.
6
Including public transfers.
7
From 2006 onward, oil revenue forecasts incorporate a prudence factor, with oil price projections reduced by US$10/barrel relative to WEO price forecasts.
8
Additional revenue that would be generated by using WEO forecasts for world oil prices, that is, without applying the prudence factor.

Appendix I: Republic of Congo—External and Public
Debt Sustainability Analyses (DSA)1
Congo’s debt level and debt service obligations have increased recently after the decrease in
debt burden stemming from HIPC relief in 2006. Two scenarios elaborated in the DSA
suggest that the probability of debt distress under the continuation of current policies is high
unless a substantial fiscal adjustment is undertaken. Based on existing debt ratios and on this
analysis, the Republic of Congo is rated as at a high risk of debt distress, taking into account
full unconditional delivery of HIPC and MDRI debt relief. The risk would be higher if the
analysis assumed only interim assistance.
Background
1.
The sustainability of Congo’s external and total public debt is assessed using the
Fund-Bank debt sustainability framework for low income countries. The previous DSA
was carried out in the context of the HIPC decision point in March 2006, using end-2004
outstanding debt data. This DSA assumes unconditional delivery of HIPC and MDRI debt
relief in 2009.
2.
In 2006, total external debt is estimated at $6.5 billion (text table) or 75 percent
of GDP.2 The bulk of this debt is owed to bilateral official creditors and commercial
creditors, the shares of which represents 42 and 50 percent of outstanding debt, respectively;
multilateral creditors only account for 8 percent. Debt owed to Paris Club creditors fell as a
share of the total from 55 percent in 2004 to 35 percent in 2006, reflecting the granting of
traditional debt relief in 2005 as well as interim debt relief received from some creditors in
2006, following the HIPC decision point.
3.
New borrowing has contributed to a significant increase in the stock of debt and
in the debt service burden. Congo contracted a loan for $551 million from China on
concessional terms in December 2005, which adds to a previously unrecorded 2003 loan of
$238 million, with repayments coming due in 2008. In addition, in June 2006 the Congolese
government signed a non-concessional loan from China in the amount of US$32 million and
a Framework Agreement that allows for further borrowing. Financial details of this
agreement have not yet been communicated to IMF staff.

This DSA was prepared jointly by the World Bank and IMF staff.

The analysis is based on end-June 2006 debt data provided by the authorities during the October 2006 mission.
The data at end-2006 are therefore preliminary staff estimates.

4.
External debt service data used for the purpose of this DSA reflects full delivery
of traditional debt relief, and additional HIPC debt relief on Cologne terms as of 2006
(Table 1). Multilateral debt service payments are those included in the March 2006 HIPC
decision-point document. Bilateral and commercial debt service payments are calculated
taking into account: (i) the HIPC decision point in March 2006; and (ii) an assumed
completion point being reached in 2009. Assuming full delivery of debt relief in 2006, the
stock of debt is estimated to be $5.7 billion. In contrast, if debt relief from bilateral non-Paris
Club or commercial creditors is excluded, the stock of debt at end-2006 rises to $6.5 billion.
5.
Based on the information provided by the authorities, external debt service
payments on new borrowing included in the analysis are:
¾ a $238 million loan signed in 2003, with a maturity 15 years, 0.2 percent interest, and a
5-year grace period;
¾ a $552 million loan signed in December 2005, with a 17-year maturity, 0.2 percent
interest, and a 5-year grace period;
¾ a non-concessional loan for Renminbi 250 million with a maturity of 20 years, an interest
rate of 2 percent (plus a management fee of 3.5 percent paid upfront in 2006 and a yearly
commitment fee of 0.3 percent), and an 8-year grace period;
¾ a $6 million loan signed in 2005 with BADEA, with a maturity of 20 years, an interest
rate of 1 percent and a grace period of 10 years.

40
In addition, it is assumed that the Framework Agreement signed with China in June 2006 will
result in an increase of debt service payments of $3.4 million (equivalent to 10 percent of the
projected new debt service payments with non-Paris Club creditors for the period 2011–
35)3.starting in 2011, reflecting a 5-year grace period and repayments ending in 2025. This
latter assumption does not affect the conclusions of the analysis.
6.
As of end-2006, domestic debt amounted to CFAF 345 billion (8.9 percent of
GDP), based on the information provided by the Congolese authorities. This comprises
social debt (including pensions) of CFAF 266 billion, commercial debt of CFAF 75 billion,
and public enterprise debt of CFAF 4 billion. Arrears make up 99 percent of the stock of
domestic debt. Domestic debt at end-2006 was CFAF 175 billion lower than at end-2005,
mostly due to the cancellation of commercial debt for CFAF 57 billion, payments of arrears
on social debt (including pensions) for 57 billion, and payments to local banks.
7.

The analysis develops two scenarios:

¾ a non-adjustment scenario, which assumes that the authorities will continue with their
current fiscal policies, maintaining the non oil primary deficit at 44.2 percent of non oil
GDP in 2006 throughout the projection period; and
¾ a baseline scenario that targets a trend decline of the non oil primary deficit to 24 percent
of non oil GDP in 2012, and to 13 percent by the end of the projection period.
8.
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the two scenarios for the period
2007-12 are shown in Table 2. Over the longer term, real GDP is projected to grow annually
by around 5 percent, while inflation is expected to average 3 percent. Exports are projected to
grow by around 3 percent a year. A cautious approach to oil price projections is applied by
subtracting a $10 prudence factor from the $63 per barrel projected by the WEO. Both
scenarios assume the same accumulation of gross international reserves. At the same time, oil
production is assumed to decline starting in 2011. In the non-adjustment scenario, the
financing gap is assumed to be financed externally at non-concessional terms as commercial
debt. Non-concessional loans are assumed to pay an interest rate of 5 percent, have a 1 year
grace period, and a maturity of 10 years. These terms are the same as those assumed in the
HIPC decision-point document. Domestic debt is assumed to be fully amortized in the next
ten years: commercial debt is assumed to be paid back within 5 years; and social debt is
assumed to be amortized over 9 years, with payments of CFAF 30 billion per year.

External and Public Debt Sustainability
9.
Congo is classified as a poor performer using the Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA).4 This rating implies that the thresholds used to assess the
risk of debt distress are lower than those used to assess eligibility for the HIPC Initiative:
NPV of debt to exports of 100 percent and NPV of debt to revenue of 200 percent. Congo
qualified for the HIPC Initiative on the basis of a threshold NPV of debt to revenue ratio of
250 percent.
10.
The debt sustainability outlook is strikingly different from one scenario to the
other. Under the non-adjustment scenario, even after debt relief is granted under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative, Congo’s debt in NPV terms would breach all sustainability
thresholds by 2011. In contrast, a medium-term fiscal strategy envisaging a decrease in the
non oil deficit would bring Congo’s debt ratios to within sustainable bounds, as shown in the
baseline scenario.
11.
Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP is expected to
decline smoothly, albeit at a lower pace than projected in the HIPC decision-point
document, as a result of the newly contracted external debt. At end-2006, the NPV of
external debt is estimated to be 75 percent of GDP and 87 percent of exports. This implies a
decline from the 2005 levels, when the NPV of debt was 99 percent of GDP and 122 percent
of exports (Table 1). The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio declines steadily under this scenario to
about 12 percent by 2026. The path projected under the baseline scenario is very similar to
that projected in the LIC DSA published in the HIPC decision-point document (Figure 1).

Independently of whether the three-year moving average or the 2005 classification is used.

42
12.
Under the baseline scenario, the external debt service indicator also suggests a
moderate burden. The projected debt-service levels are below the indicative threshold in the
medium and long term. The debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios
nonetheless rise faster than projected at HIPC decision point: this reflects the newly
contracted external debt, with debt service payments falling due starting in 2011.
13.
Under the non-adjustment scenario, both Congo’s external and public debt
become unsustainable by 2011, even after the granting of debt relief at end-2009. Debt
indicators consistently show that Congo would reach debt levels above the indicative
thresholds in NPV terms by 2011.
14.
Figure 2 illustrates the debt dynamics of Congo’s total domestic and external
public debt. Under the non-adjustment scenario, Congo’s debt ratios (NPV debt-to-GDP,
NPV debt-to-revenue, and debt service-to-revenue) increase sharply as a result of cumulative
financing gaps. In contrast, the baseline scenario show that public debt indicators remain
within sustainable bounds. In this latter scenario, the NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio is
projected to decline from 172 percent in 2006 to 29 percent by 2026. The debt service-torevenue ratio is projected to decline from 22 to less than 2 percent by 2015, but to increase
thereafter due to payments on the newly contracted debt (Table 3 and Figure 2).
15.
Stress tests under the baseline scenario confirm Congo’s vulnerability to
plausible shocks, in particular to a fall in FDI inflows, lower real GDP growth, and a
depreciation of the CFA franc to the US dollar (Table 4). Under the most extreme stress test
(a shock to non-debt creating flows), the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would remain above its
30 percent indicative threshold until 2016.
16.
In summary, the analysis shows that, with Congo’s high debt level, keeping the
non oil fiscal deficit unchanged over the long run endangers debt sustainability, even if
HIPC completion point is reached. In the absence of significant fiscal adjustment, Congo is
likely to face debt distress well within the 20-year forecast horizon, given that sustainability
indicators quickly breach the policy-dependent indicative thresholds in the forecast horizon
in the non-adjustment scenario. An adjustment of policies, in particular a reduction of non oil
deficits in the long run, would bring Congo’s debt onto a sustainable path: this outcome
would be contingent on the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies, thus highlighting the
need to ensure that new borrowing in the period ahead is lower than it has been in recent
years.

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of Central
African States, of which Republic of Congo is a member. A safeguard assessment of the
BEAC completed on August 30, 2004 found that BEAC has implemented a number of
measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since the 2001 safeguards assessment,
but further progress needs to be made in key areas (see IMF Country Report No. 06/262;
June 30, 2006).

1

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

10

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

4

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Congo’s currency is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 = Euro 1. On December 31, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc was
CFAF 749.30 per SDR. Congo does not impose any restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
X.Article IV Consultations:
Consultations with Congo are on a 24-month cycle, based on the Board decision on
consultation cycles in program countries. The 2004 consultation discussions started in
Brazzaville in February 2004 and concluded in Washington in March 2004. The staff
report (www.imf.org) was considered by the Executive Board on June 10, 2004.

Annex II—Republic of Congo:
Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of March 26, 2007)
A.

Partnership in the Republic of Congo’s development strategy

1.
After four successive conflicts 1993, 1997, 1998/99 and 2001/03, civil peace has been
gradually restored since the ceasefire was signed in 2000 and a peace agreement with the last
active rebel group was reached in March 2003. Since the ceasefire and adoption of the new
Constitution in 2002, the country has been largely at peace, to the great benefit of Congolese
people. Congo has now completed a five-year transition period, including ratification of the
presidency of Denis Sassou-Nguesso, and election of a parliament and a senate, in 2002. The
international community re-engaged in Congo in 2001 following the clearance of arrears to
the Bank and the Fund. The PRGF arrangement approved by the IMF Board in December
2004 paved the way for financing from donors including the AfDB, and the debt
rescheduling by the Paris Club. More recently the HIPC Decision point approval in March
2006 has led to the strengthening of dialogue as well as the international community
engagement in Congo. The HIPC floating completion point triggers focus on the following
issues: (i) preparation of a full PRSP, (ii) maintenance of macroeconomic stability, (iii)
alignment of public spending with priorities identified in the PRSP, (iv) strengthening of
public finance management, (v) improvement of governance in the natural resource
management, (vi) improvement of regulation in the telecom sector, (vii) improvement of
services in education, health and the prevention of HIV/AIDS; and (viii) transparency in
external debt management.
2.
The main external development partners in Congo include: the European Union, the
African Development Bank (AfDB), the French Agency for Development (AFD), the UNDP,
the World Bank and the IMF. The main areas of intervention are on governance, urban
development, transport, health, education, environment, and public finance. The AFD and the
AfDB issued their assistance strategies in 2005 for 2005-07 while the World Bank is
preparing an Interim Strategy Note for the next FY07-08.
B.

World Bank Group (IDA, IFC and MIGA) assistance strategy

3.
In 2001, the Bank reengaged in Congo in the context of a Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS). The first TSS (Report 21328-COB) for the Republic of Congo, to guide
operation for the period 2000-02, was endorsed by the Board on January 16, 2001. It focused
on the consolidation of the peace process and the physical reconstruction of the country. The
second TSS for FY03-05, endorsed by the Board in September 2003 (Report 26566-COB),
aimed at helping Congo to break out of the conflict trap. It was anchored on four interrelated
pillars: (i) creating jobs through economic growth and diversification, (ii) repositioning the
public sector and enhancing its capacity, (iii) mitigating short- and medium-term risks to the
social environment, and (iv) providing resources to support socio-economic development and
stability through enhanced external assistance and debt relief. The Bank provided financial

6
support and policy advice in these areas through lending and non-lending instruments.
4.
As of March 26, the World Bank portfolio in the Republic of Congo consisted of 4
IDA operations with a total commitment of $87 million, out of which $58 were disbursed.
Table 1 below shows the status of the Bank’s portfolio in Congo. Operations have focused
on: (i) supporting the implementation of reforms aimed at transparency and efficiency of
public resource management (Economic Recovery Credit, and Transparency and Governance
Capacity Building Project); (ii) supporting socio-economic infrastructure rehabilitation and
rural development (Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Living Conditions
Improvement, Emergency Recovery and community Support, and the Basic Education
Support); and (iii) supporting national policies and programs in the area of HIV-AIDS (HIVAIDS and Health Project). Two projects were closed recently, the ERC at end December
2006 and the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Living Conditions Improvement at
end January 2007. One project is currently under preparation, the Agriculture and Rural
Roads Rehabilitation Project ($20 million). A supplemental to the Transparency and
Governance Capacity Building Project is being prepared ($15 million; grant).

5.
The lending program is complemented by a number of grants, including a $17 million
Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program grant that became effective in
August 2006.
6.
The analytical work program carried out under the TSS FY03-05 consisted of a
Public Expenditure Review (PER), a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), a combined
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAR), an Education sector review, and an Agriculture Policy Note.

7

Interim Strategy Note
7.
An update of the Bank’s assistance strategy in the form of an Interim Strategy Note
(ISN), is currently under preparation. The proposed ISN covers the period FY07-08 and
includes an IDA grant envelope of SDR62 million (or $80 million equivalent). It is expected
to be presented to the Board early May 2007. This would be followed by a full Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), once the full PRSP is in place. On the basis of large broad
consultations carried out on in the country as well as during the HIPC Decision Point
discussions, the proposed ISN focuses on the following two pillars:


Scaling up the governance focus, especially with regard to oil sector governance,
public financial management, with an emphasis on budgeting and public investment
management, and corruption. This ISN is strategically timed to support the HIPC
floating completion point triggers, which will serve as interim benchmarks for the
governance reform. This scaled-up reform effort will continue to complement other
ongoing donor initiatives, such as the Bank-supported Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative.



Creating the foundation for equitable growth, through improved implementation of
poverty alleviation programs, with special emphasis on health, underserved
communities in urban areas; and the rural sector to foster economic diversification
and address poverty issues.

IFC
8.
IFC has no current investments in Congo, but is closely following developments in
the privatization of the railway. In addition, it is also exploring opportunities in the financial
sector restructuring, SME development, infrastructure rebuilding, and development of the oil
sector and mining.
MIGA
9.
Congo has contributed to the General Capital Increase in March 2003. MIGA has no
exposure in Congo, and there is no active application.
C.

Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas

10.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting policies to help Congo strengthen civil peace, sustain macro-economic stability,
improve governance, consolidate the social recovery, and promote sustainable development.
Exchange of information and discussion on progress in the implementation of the reform
program under the PRGF Program and the HIPC initiative take place on a regular basis
between the Bank and the Fund. Joint missions will be carried out to review progress.

Annex III—Republic of Congo: Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, despite
weaknesses in national accounts and balance of payments statistics. The statistical
infrastructure is being slowly rebuilt after the civil strife of 1997 and December 1998–
October 1999, during which administrative infrastructure suffered severe damage and many
records were lost. Since October 2001, a STA resident statistical expert has been assisting the
authorities with the macroeconomic statistics.
A STA multisector mission visited Brazzaville in May 2002 to conduct an assessment of
the statistical system. The mission’s general finding was that macroeconomic statistics are
weak and suffer from the absence of a national statistical program and shortages of financial,
physical, and human resources. It recommended measures for improvement, which are being
followed up by the statistical advisor.
The Republic of Congo has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since November 5, 2003; however, the metadata posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) has not been updated or certified since 2003.
Real sector statistics
National accounts data are weak, with inconsistencies, both internally and with the balance of
payments. Estimates for the informal sector are based on information that dates back to 1978.
The Directorate General of Statistics (DGS) of the Ministry of Finance provides Fund
missions with a breakdown of GDP by expenditures and sectors, both in nominal and real
terms. Historically, data on oil sector transactions have been weak, raising questions about
transparency in the inter-play of the oil companies operating in the country and the
government agencies dealing with them.
Annual data on employment in the central government are available from the Ministry of
Finance, but they are not consistent with data from the civil service roster of the Ministry of
the Civil Service. As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the context of the postconflict program, the government completed an audit of public service employees and
established a new civil service payroll roster. Data on employment in the private sector are
not available.
Movements in the prices of commodities consumed by households are recorded for the
capital city of Brazzaville (weights for 1977 and price reference period of December 1977)
and the second-largest city of Pointe Noire (price reference period of January 1996 and
weights for 1989). Weights no longer reflect current household consumption patterns. Data
are compiled on a monthly basis. The authorities intend to compile a CPI that is harmonized
with other CEMAC countries.
Government finance statistics
Compilation of government finance statistics (GFS) is neither comprehensive nor
systematic. The Tableau des Opérations Financières de l’État (TOFE) is based on several
disparate sources rather than a comprehensive set of accounting statements. Financing data

10
are currently obtained from monetary statistics instead of the government accounts. As a
result, the consistency between government finance and monetary and financial statistics
cannot be ascertained.
At the time of the May 2002 multisector mission, the Balance des comptes du Trésor, a basic
and essential treasury source document, as well as other sources, were not made available to
the producers of the TOFE.11 The mission recommended that systematic procedures be
established for the compilation of government finance statistics, based, to the extent possible,
on a unified set of accounting and administrative records.
TOFE compilers do not have access to relevant financial statements of the Société Nationale
des Pétroles Congolais (SNPC), which carries out several operations on behalf of the
government (notably in the oil sector).
In 2003, the Congo reported GFS data to STA for publication in the GFS Yearbook using the
GFSM 2001 template but, no data has been reported since and no fiscal data has been
reported for publication in IFS since 2001. The compilation of GFS statistics to be reported
to the Fund should be carried out in close cooperation with the compilers of the TOFE.
Progress is underway to address these shortcomings. In February/March 2003, a FAD followup mission found that most of the recommendations of the 2001 FAD mission on expenditure
management, in particular with regard to the centralization of all government revenue and
execution of public expenditure through the budget, are being implemented, and steps have
been taken to computerize the expenditure chain.
The Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement (CCA) produces comprehensive data on the
outstanding stock of external public debt, including arrears and its composition, together with
detailed projections on debt service due. These data are provided to Fund missions. However,
the debt-stock data cannot be reconciled with flow data in the balance of payments. The CCA
also produces domestic debt data.
There is no centralized, comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises.
However, some information has been made available to Fund missions by individual
enterprises.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monthly data on monetary statistics for the Congo, as well as for the other members of the
Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), are regularly reported to
the Fund in electronic form by the regional central bank (BEAC). Accuracy of monetary data
11

This compilation is not undertaken on the basis of treasury accounting records, to which the compilers
themselves do not have access. The mission examined the Excel worksheet used for the compilation of the
TOFE and made recommendations for improvements, although it could not establish the links between that
worksheet and the primary data sources.

11
may be hampered by large cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC member
countries. However, the Congo is moderately affected by such movements: 5.7 percent of
banknotes issued in the Congo by the BEAC national directorate circulate in Cameroon and
about one percent in Gabon, while currency in circulation in the Congo includes about
2.6 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and about 3.4 percent from Gabon.
The monetary and financial statistics mission that visited the BEAC headquarters in May
2001 provided technical assistance on the compilation and timeliness of monetary statistics.
The mission discussed an action plan for the implementation of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for the introduction of an area-wide page in IFS for the
CEMAC. Following the 2001 mission, a regional workshop on monetary and financial
statistics was organized by the BEAC in Libreville (Gabon) in May 2002 to support the
implementation of the MFSM in the CEMAC countries. The new page for CEMAC was
published in the January 2003 issue of IFS.
The May 2002 multisector mission found that the institutional coverage of government and
of nonfinancial public sector in monetary statistics are outdated and need to be revised.
External sector statistics
As in other CEMAC countries, the national agency of the BEAC is responsible for the
collection and the dissemination of balance of payments data. The balance of payments
statistics are prepared on an annual basis while the compilation system has been specifically
designed to produce quarterly data. Through 1994, balance of payments data were compiled
in the framework of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fourth Edition. The BEAC provides
annual data on exports of goods and services and on capital flows other than public debt.
Since 1995, data are being prepared using the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition. In
2006, balance of payments data for 1995 through 2005 were reported to the Fund for
publication in International Financial Statistics.
In May 2002, the technical assistance mission found the compilation system and procedures
to be conceptually sound but flawed in their application due to the absence of documented
sources and methods, understaffing, and insufficient training. This situation has resulted in
significant delays in the production of balance of payments statistics and, in general, poor
monitoring of the quality of the input data provided by the statistical respondents.
Furthermore, the opacity surrounding certain transactions in the oil sector introduces an
important element of imprecision. In addition, net investment flows are overestimated by
significant unrecorded disinvestment operations that are part of the tax regime arrangements
obtained by oil-drilling nonresident companies.
In February 2007, an expert reporting to the IMF’s Statistics Department outlined a number
of recommendations aimed at improving institutional arrangements for balance of payments
statistics compilation.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 25, 2007
Since the issuance of the staff report for the Article IV Consultation, www.imf.org, the
Congolese authorities have provided the following information, which does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal:
¾

The estimate for real GDP growth in 2006 has been revised downward to 6.1 percent,
reflecting lower non oil GDP growth (5.8 percent).

¾

Consumer price inflation (year-on-year) declined to 6.1 and 5.2 percent in January
and February 2007, respectively. The slowdown was mainly attributable to lower
food and energy prices.

¾

Revised expenditure data show a somewhat higher non oil primary deficit for 2006
(44.8 percent of non oil GDP, 0.6 percentage points higher than in the staff report),
reflecting higher subsidies to the oil refinery and transfers to local governments.
Information on the financing of the deficit is still pending.

¾

The authorities have launched an audit of the national oil refinery (CORAF).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Congo
On April 25, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo.1
Background
The implementation of the PRGF-supported program was broadly satisfactory in 2004-05; but
expenditure overruns and delays in structural reforms pushed the program off track in 2006.
Discussions are continuing on a staff-monitored program aimed at establishing a solid track
record that could pave the way for resuming discussions on the PRGF-supported program.
Macroeconomic performance was mixed in 2006. Real GDP growth is estimated at 6.1 percent
in 2006, reflecting higher oil prices and production as well as robust non oil GDP growth.
However, inflation accelerated in 2006 to 8.2 percent (year-on-year), fueled by the expansionary
fiscal policy and transportation disruptions. The external current account registered a large
surplus on account of higher oil export receipts.
Fiscal performance was disappointing. Oil and non oil revenues were higher than programmed,
but expenditure slippages are estimated at 5 percent of GDP at end-2006. As a result, the non
oil primary deficit rose to an estimated 45 percent of non oil GDP in 2006, a large increase from

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
27 percent of non oil GDP in 2005. Moreover, the composition and quality of public spending
deteriorated, raising concerns about budgetary execution and expenditure control.
Broad money expanded rapidly in 2006, reflecting the unsterilized increase in net foreign assets
stemming from higher oil prices. Gross foreign assets soared to 29 percent of GDP in 2006.
Credit to the private sector remained sluggish.
Debt relief has improved the external debt indicators, but accelerated new borrowing could
undermine debt sustainability. Following debt relief granted by the Paris Club creditors and
multilateral creditors, the debt stock declined to 86 percent of GDP in 2006 from 213 percent of
GDP in 2004. However, recent new external borrowing commitments of $829 million as of end2006 could jeopardize debt sustainability.
On the structural front, performance was mixed in 2006. While the certification report by the
national audit office on conflict of interest in oil management was submitted to the government
and published, most other structural measures were not met. The audit of the awarding of the
Marine XI oil concession was completed and published with a delay. It revealed serious
weaknesses in the decision-making process, which could lead to significant conflicts of interest.
Progress in implementing the triggers for the Completion Point for the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative has been slow.
The outlook for 2007 and the medium term is uncertain. On the positive side, higher oil prices
and the prospects for debt relief under the HIPC have created favorable conditions that could
pave the way for higher sustainable growth and enable Congo to reach the Millennium
Development Goals. On the negative side, the rapid increase in government spending, against
the background of significant absorptive and administrative capacity constraints, could
jeopardize macroeconomic stability, fiscal sustainability, and external competitiveness.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the acceleration of economic growth in recent years, reflecting favorable oil
market conditions as well as higher non-oil activity. Looking forward, Directors emphasized that
containing inflation, strengthening public financial management, enhancing financial
intermediation, and improving governance and the business climate are crucial for achieving the
authorities’ growth objectives and making progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors regretted the fiscal slippages in 2006 which contributed to the failure to complete the
third review under the PRGF arrangement. They supported the authorities’ intention to limit
spending in 2007 as part of efforts to restore fiscal sustainability and reduce inflationary
pressures—key priorities in the context of the Republic of Congo’s membership in a currency
union. Directors considered that the draft 2007 budget was broadly appropriate. They noted that
it would help meet pressing investment needs without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.
Nevertheless, Directors stressed that further actions will be needed to achieve fiscal
sustainability, and that these actions should be framed within a medium-term fiscal strategy,
incorporating a trajectory to reduce the non-oil deficit.

3

Directors encouraged the authorities to make further progress in public financial management,
including by prioritizing expenditure—with appropriate emphasis on health and education. Also,
it will be important to introduce a functional classification of the budget and to eliminate
exceptional spending procedures. Directors emphasized that these measures are essential to
improve the quality of spending and to increase the growth potential of the economy. While
recognizing the need for improved infrastructure, Directors emphasized that progress in this
area would require greater transparency in procurement.
Most Directors expressed concern about the accumulation of non-concessional debt, and called
on the authorities to adhere strictly to their commitment to control future borrowing and to work
toward debt sustainability in the context of the HIPC and the MDRI—using the DSA as a guide
for future borrowing. A few Directors cautioned, however, that borrowing limits should not
unduly constrain growth opportunities.
Directors considered that recent steps to improve oil sector transparency are in the right
direction. However, they called upon the authorities to strengthen the sector’s finances and
reduce oil subsidies. They looked forward to the audit of the national oil refinery (CORAF). More
generally, Directors called for an acceleration of governance reforms, including through the
setting up of an independent anticorruption committee and the passage of a comprehensive
anticorruption law. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement the
recommendations of the audit of the Marine XI oil concession, and they called on the
government to adhere to the provisions of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intentions to develop the financial sector in support of their
efforts to diversify the economy and increase financial intermediation. They expressed concern
about the privatization of a troubled bank in 2006 in a nontransparent and costly way for the
budget. Looking ahead, Directors called for a simplification of licensing procedures and
improved access to financial services. It would also be useful to move away from interest rate
controls, in consultation with the Banque des États de l’Afrique Centrale.
Directors observed that the exchange rate peg within the Communauté Économique et
Monétaire de l'Afrique Centrale (CEMAC) continues to provide a credible anchor for economic
policy. However, the real appreciation of the currency will need to be monitored carefully to
maintain external competitiveness. Directors encouraged the authorities to spearhead trade
reforms in the context of the CEMAC, adopt a transparent trade regime, minimize bureaucratic
procedures for exports and imports, and gradually phase out exemptions. They noted that
lowering the common external tariff would require the cooperation of the other CEMAC partners.
Directors underscored that achieving the medium-term growth objectives will require improving
the business environment and lowering costs. They noted that liberalizing domestic energy and
commodity prices will help foster greater private sector activity, and welcomed the recent
decision to liberalize the price of cement.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reach understanding with staff on a

4
staff-monitored program that could bring the PRGF arrangement back on track. Most Directors
also expressed concern about the limited progress toward implementing the triggers for the
HIPC completion point. A few Directors suggested that the HIPC triggers should be
re-examined. Directors urged the authorities to implement corrective steps promptly, thereby
moving forward quickly to unlock debt relief and pave the way for higher growth and poverty
reduction.
Directors regretted that gaps in the provision of economic data continue to hamper effective
surveillance and the monitoring of the program. They called upon the authorities to ensure a
regular and timely provision of high quality data, including details on external financing.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for the Republic of Congo
April 25, 2007
I. Introduction
On behalf of my Congolese authorities, we thank Management and staff for their continued
engagement with the Republic of Congo, as reflected by extensive consultation and
constructive policy dialogue held during the last six months. We also wish to express our
appreciation to Management for the frank dialogue held recently with H.E. President Denis
Sassou Nguesso in Libreville Gabon, during the inauguration of the AFRITAC-Centre. We
would like to commend staff for the well-written and comprehensive set of reports prepared
for Board consideration, including the Selected Issues report, which identifies key strategic
areas that could help Congo increase its growth in a sustainable manner, while preserving
fiscal and external sustainability.
Since the Republic of Congo embarked on a Fund program, supported by the PRGF
arrangement in December 2004, the country has continued to make progress in securing
macroeconomic stability and implementing structural reforms, as well as developing an
interim Poverty Reduction Strategy. In March 2006, reflecting these achievements, the
Republic of Congo became the 29th country to reach the decision point under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative. At the same time, important steps were taken to consolidate further the peace
process and to put the democratic institutions required by the 2002 constitution.
While macroeconomic performance remained strong in 2006, however, program
implementation registered some slippages, on account of expenditures related to political and
regional factors, including a plan to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa, if the
Presidential elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were to fail. Also, the African
Union Chairmanship of UN Security Council membership of Congo contributed to such
spending. Taking stock of this situation, my authorities are committed to take corrective
actions in the context of a staff-monitored program (SMP), in order to bring the program
back on track before the end of this year.
Discussions on an SMP started during the mission of October 2006 in Brazzaville, and
continued in February-March 2007 in Washington, DC. A high level Congolese delegation,
led by the Senior Minister, Minister of Planning and the Minister of Economy, Finance and

2
Budget, came to Washington, DC. Another round took place during the 2007 Spring
Meetings to reach understanding on remaining outstanding issues. At this stage, my
authorities are of the view that there is basis for common understanding on the key elements
of the SMP. In a recent correspondence, staff appreciated this common understanding.
II. Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Performance under the PRGF
Congo’s macroeconomic performance in 2006 was favorable. Despite the moderate
slowdown in economic activity compared with 2005, Congo’s economic performance in
2006 has remained strong, with real GDP growth estimated to have grown by 6 ½ percent,
due mostly attributable to higher oil prices and production, as well as robust non oil GDP
activity. Non oil sector GDP is estimated to have reached 6.3 percent, mostly driven by
strong activity in the construction sector. As rightly noted by staff, the non oil growth helped
maintain overall GDP growth above the CEMAC region. The external current account
recorded large surpluses in 2005-06, averaging 13 percent of GDP, due mostly to higher oil
export receipts. In contrast, inflation accelerated under the pressure of higher petroleum
product prices and transportation disruptions associated with the poor conditions of the
railway (CFCO) linking the main cities in the Congo and the Port of Pointe-Noire. In the
fiscal area, revenue performance was strong, as oil and non oil revenues were higher than
programmed, which also contributed to the overall fiscal surplus, estimated at 19.8 percent of
GDP. Although pro-poor spending was lower than programmed, its level grew by 0.5
percentage point to 5.4 percent of GDP, compared with 2005.
In the banking sector, credit to the private sector was sluggish, reflecting limited lending
opportunities, the high cost of credit, as well as legal and institutional constraints in
recovering collateral. The health of the banking system is improving, partly reflecting the
recapitalization and privatization of one troubled bank.
Congo’s level of indebtedness improved recently, mainly as result of the traditional relief
granted by Paris Club creditors since 2005, as well as interim debt relief obtained from some
creditors, following the HIPC decision point in Marc 2006. Since then, the authorities have
signed bilateral agreements with 8 Paris Club creditors. The authorities have also reached a
preliminary agreement with London Club creditors on debt relief, consistent with the
enhanced HIPC Initiative. They also expect to reach an agreement with other commercial
creditors (excluding litigating creditors) in the last quarter of 2007. Moreover, since June
2006, Congo has not contracted any new external debt.

3

The PRGF-supported program implementation registered some slippages, largely owing
to expenditure overruns. As noted earlier, these slippages in 2006 were due in part to higher
outlays for security (owing to conflicts in neighboring countries), the Presidency of the
African Union, and urgent priority investments. Some progress has been made on structural
reforms envisaged under the PRGF program. In particular, the authorities have published the
audit report on the awarding of the Marine XI oil field concession in 2005. They have
liberalized the price and import of cement in February 2007. Despite some delays, most of
the measures are underway. Congo has also fulfilled the performance criteria on
centralization of all public revenue and execution of all public payments by Treasury;
transparency in oil sector, including quarterly certification of oil revenue by internationally
reputed audit firm, and disclosure of internal and external debt. These elements, plus my
authorities’ commitment to follow public procurement procedures, based on international
tender bids, are testimony of the evolution of a good public finance management system that
can assure efficient implementation of public expenditure and adequate tracking of pro-poor
spending.
I would also like to recall most of structural reforms undertaken in recent years by the
authorities, which include the recent steps taken to reintegrate into the Kimberley process,
and the efforts made to refocus SNPC activities on its core activities. In this connection, two
SNPC affiliates have been liquidated and a number of subsidiaries of SNPC Services have
ceased operations. New procurement guidelines were introduced to ensure competitive
bidding both for work contracts and for the purchase of goods and services.
It is also worth noting that after the consultations last October with the Fund staff in
Brazzaville, the country experienced frequent torrential rains, causing important damages in
the transport infrastructure (railway), health and urban sanitation system, electricity and
water supply. This calamity compounded the long outstanding state of dilapidation in these
sectors, which followed from protracted conflict, which befell the country, and whose
aftermath is yet to be fully overcome. In light of these circumstances and following a
discussion between the government and Parliament in Brazzaville, an agreement was reached
on an emergency program, covering the following areas: (i) rehabilitation of the railway
linking Brazzaville and the Sea Port of Pointe-Noire, the country’s single most supply route;
(ii) rehabilitation and strengthening of the energy and safe water network; (iii) rehabilitation
of a dilapidated national referral hospital in Brazzaville and; (iv) urban upgrading and (v)
rehabilitation of the traffic in the Congo River for a proper navigation. To finance this

4
emergency program, the authorities needed an additional envelope. Their request has been
weighted against the short-term macroeconomic risks that these additional investment
spending might entail, in terms of inflation and deterioration of the quality of investment,
taking account of weak absorptive capacity and administrative constraints.
My Congolese authorities are also fully aware of the remaining weaknesses that need to be
addressed, which include enhancing transparency in the management of natural resources,
the strengthening of budget management, reducing the cost of doing business, alleviating of
poverty and bringing the country’s debt burden down to more sustainable levels. They wish
to reiterate their determination to continue with implementation of the economic policies and
to take all necessary measures to stimulate private sector led-growth and fight poverty. They
will pursue efforts to work on the necessary steps to reach the completion point under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.
III. Macroeconomic and Structural Policies for 2007
My Congolese authorities recognize the importance of implementing prudent policies and
accelerate structural reforms, in order to sustain growth and achieve the MDGs. They are
determined to take necessary steps to create conditions for broad-based economy and poverty
alleviation.
Fiscal Policy for 2007 and Reforms
For 2007, the authorities are committed to prudent policy, in order to preserve debt
sustainability and macroeconomic stability. On the revenue side, revenue is expected to
decline, in line with lower expected oil prices and a stable oil production level until new
operations progressively take over older ones. Against this background, my authorities
submitted to the Parliament a draft budget for 2007 that is consistent with the understanding
reached with staff on an SMP. Among key fiscal objectives set for 2007 is the need to
strengthen the framework for the mobilization of oil and non-oil revenues and raise pro-poor
spending, while taking account of absorptive capacity constraints. The authorities are also
determined to improve the quality of spending and strengthen the public financial
management (PFM) and reduce losses in public enterprises. In order to strengthen the oil
revenue mobilization, the authorities will continue their efforts to ensure that the quarterly
certification of oil revenues and reconciliation of oil revenues accounts; and other measures
will be pursued. With regard to non-oil revenues, the focus will be on measures to strengthen

5
tax and customs administration, combat fraud and tax evasion and limit discretionary tax and
customs exemptions.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are committed to undertake major reforms to address structural weaknesses in
key sectors of the economy with the view of improving efficiency and limiting potential costs
on future budgets. To improve the business climate, the authorities have liberalized the price
and import of cement in February 2007. On the adjustment of petroleum product prices, they
will adopt a decree before the end of 2007. On governance and transparency, the authorities
are committed to step up efforts to establish transparent and effective institutions. They also
agreed to raise public awareness about the authorities’ agenda to fight corruption. Regards
trade policy, my authorities are open to discuss ways to simplify the structure of tariffs and
other fees in the context of CEMAC, eliminate nontariff barriers, and strengthen customs
administration. On AML/CFT, a workshop was organized to educate stakeholders about the
role of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).
IV. Progress in Implementing Triggers for HIPC Completion Point
With regard to the implementation of the HIPC triggers, progress was made on triggers
related to the forestry and social sectors. However, my authorities are also aware of the
limited progress made since last August. This situation is due to a combination of factors,
notably capacity constraints; and the need to build consensus. Nevertheless, my Congolese
authorities, at the highest level, are fully committed to pursue efforts to minimize delays and
establish a strong record under an SMP that would revitalize the PRGF-supported program.
This will enable the country to create conditions for higher growth and poverty reduction.
My authorities remain keenly aware of the need to improve social indicators and accelerate
progress towards achieving the MDGs. Considering all the factors above, may authorities
will make every effort to bringing their program to a successful conclusion.
My authorities acknowledge that timely and regular provision of data is essential for a
productive policy dialogue between the Republic of Congo and the Fund. Despite the
capacity constraints facing the country, the authorities are determined to address this issue. In
this regard, a statistics law will be submitted this year.

6
V. Conclusion
My Congolese authorities are thankful to the Fund and the international community for their
engagement with the Republic of Congo, as reflected by the sustained constructive policy
dialogue held recently both in Brazzaville and in Washington. My Congolese authorities are
committed to continuing working closely with their partners to achieve the goals of sustained
growth and poverty alleviation and to strengthen institutional capacity. In this context, my
authorities are hopeful that they can continue to rely on the support of the Fund and the
broader international community to help them create a solid foundation for economic
development and poverty reduction.
