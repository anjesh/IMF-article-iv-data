I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Weaker global economic conditions underscore the importance of addressing
Portugal’s long-standing challenges, building on recent achievements. Portugal has
accumulated substantial macroeconomic imbalances, and the policy challenge is to smooth
the adjustment, containing domestic demand while increasing productivity and flexibility,
rebalancing growth to the external sector. The weaker global conditions should thus be taken
as a reason to strengthen efforts to reignite the stalled convergence process: continuing fiscal
consolidation and reform; keeping the financial sector sound; and raising the economy's
supply capacity; and improving its competitiveness.
2.
Growth will likely slow to about 1 percent in 2008 and to about ¾ percent in
2009. The current account deficit is projected to widen somewhat over this period and
inflation to pick up in 2008 before declining in 2009. The risks to growth seem tilted to the
downside, in particular, the slowdown in credit growth, prompted by the international
financial turbulence, could be more pronounced. Inflation risks, however, seem tilted to the
upside.
3.
Decisive action has reduced fiscal imbalances and enhanced credibility.
Following substantial overperformance in 2007, the government appropriately tightened the
2008 deficit target. However, the cut in the VAT rate and some measures to support those
most affected by higher commodity prices and interest rates will reduce the structural
consolidation in 2008.
4.
Fiscal consolidation needs to continue in 2009, and there is no scope for any
further discretionary loosening. To ensure the credibility of achieving the Medium-Term
Objective (MTO), even by 2011, and to avoid jeopardizing the gains achieved so far,
structural consolidation should be at least ½ percent of GDP in 2009, which should be
achievable on current policies. Any further measures to mitigate recent commodity price and
interest rate increases should continue to be well targeted, temporary, offset by other
measures, designed to maximize the supply response, and avoid distorting price signals.
Efforts to enhance the quality, transparency, and durability of fiscal consolidation need to
continue.
5.
The financial system remains sound and well supervised. While global financial
tensions and the macroeconomic outlook have heightened some existing vulnerabilities, the
Bank of Portugal has been pro-active in addressing them, and they should remain
manageable and the system resilient. Some further enhancements to the financial stability
framework could be considered, including further strengthening liquidity supervision and
the deposit insurance system, ensuring adequate capital buffers, and speeding the
implementation of the Basle II framework.

3
6.
At the root of Portugal’s economic problems lies anemic productivity growth
and a significant external competitiveness gap. Important steps are being taken to address
these challenges. These need to be followed through and assessed, and further reform should
focus on making the economy more flexible and competitive:
•

The recent agreement on reforming labor relations is a welcome step forward.
The envisaged higher rate of social security contributions on fixed-term contracts,
however, should be reconsidered.

•

The ambitious and broad-ranging SIMPLEX program continues to improve the
business climate, and its priority on licensing in 2008 is well placed. Advantage
should be taken of the need to implement the EU Services Directive to make a clean
sweep of regulations at all levels of government. The recent public administration
reforms should also be built upon to continue to enhance public sector productivity.

•

Competition in domestic markets needs to be further enhanced. Strengthening
judicial system efficiency would improve the Competition Authority’s effectiveness.
For electricity, it will be important that regulated tariffs are set to ensure full cost
recovery that the roadmap for the end of regulated prices be developed, and that
opportunities be grasped to increase competition in domestic generation.

7.
The reform momentum needs to be maintained. Policies should avoid jeopardizing
recent achievements and long-term goals for short-term gain, preserving the continuity of
adjustment and reform, and avoiding policy drift that Portugal can ill-afford.
8.

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on the regular 12-month cycle.
II. CONTEXT: GLOBAL HEADWINDS BUFFET THE RECOVERY

9.
Portugal’s euro-adoption boom turned into a post-adoption bust. The economy
boomed in the run-up to euro entry as real interest rates plummeted; investment,
consumption, and wages surged; and fiscal policy loosened, narrowing the income gap with
the EU-15. But expectations of higher productivity and growth proved optimistic, and the
economy was saddled with macro imbalances: a competitiveness gap; wide current account
and fiscal deficits; and, high household, corporate, and government debt.
10.
A modest recovery had been underway. Growth picked up over the previous two
years, driven by strong external demand (reflecting a cyclical pick-up in the euro area) and a
recovery in business investment. The current account deficit remained around 10 percent of
GDP, swollen by continued strong import growth and the widening income account deficit
(reflecting the large and growing external indebtedness). Consumer price inflation had been
moderating before picking up in recent months, but since late 2007 has been below that of the
euro area (in part due to lower regulated prices). Modest employment growth failed to keep

4
up with continuing labor force growth, leading to unemployment rising to above the euro area
average. Limited real wage growth and some improvement in productivity implied little
change in unit labor costs.

Recent high frequency indicators suggest the economy is being buffeted by
headwinds from the global financial turmoil. Growth slowed sharply in 2008:Q1, largely
reflecting weaker exports and investment. More recent data for industrial production, retail
trade, and confidence also look weak. Banks have so far been able to sustain credit growth by
increasing retail deposit funding, though mortgage growth is slowing. Forward-looking
indicators point to significantly slower credit growth as the scope for further retail deposit
funding narrows, and banks tighten credit standards.

The financial system has come under pressure but has so far weathered the
storm. While write-offs arising from U.S. subprime exposure were minimal, CDS spreads for
the main banks increased substantially, equity prices declined, and banks’ funding through
securities dried up. Debt issuance shows signs of recovery in 2008:Q2, although funding

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS: DOMESTIC
IMBALANCES AGGRAVATED BY GLOBAL TENSIONS

13.
Staff project growth to slow to about 1 percent in 2008, and to about ¾ percent
in 2009. Key factors behind the slowdown are spillovers from the weaker global outlook
(Box 1), higher commodity prices, the stronger euro, and the fallout from the financial
turbulence. Thereafter, staff project a modest recovery towards potential and gradual
adjustment in the stretched balance sheets, with household consumption growth below that of
GDP and business investment growing modestly, constrained by Portugal’s still-large

12
competitiveness gap and weak economic prospects, but with some further structural reform
and rebalancing of growth towards the external sector as wages and prices are contained.
14.
Risks to growth seem tilted to the downside. In particular, the balance sheet
adjustment—prompted by the global financial turbulence—could be more rapid, dampening
growth over the next few years, which could be exacerbated by failure to implement
structural reforms. On the upside, exports could strengthen, driven by somewhat stronger
partner country growth and the ongoing restructuring process, especially in the short term.

Box 1. Portugal: Growth Spillovers
Portugal is becoming increasingly integrated in
the global economy, and growth appears to have
become more synchronized with its partners.

Portugal’s economy is particularly sensitive to
developments in Spain. Staff estimates suggest that, based just on trade links, a one
percentage point decline in Spain’s real growth would lead to a decline of about half a
percentage point in Portugal’s real exports and 0.14 percent in GDP. Given the latest
WEO exercise projects growth to slow by some 3 percentage points in Spain between
2007–09, this would lower Portuguese growth by about half a percentage point over
this period.

Inflation should stay below the euro area average, though wage growth and high
producer prices pose a threat. The continued weak economy, combined with the VAT rate
reduction in July, should allow inflation to moderate in the second half of the year and remain
below the euro area average. The risks though are for higher inflation in the near term, as
recent stronger wage growth and higher producer price rises may yet be passed on.

The current account deficit is projected to widen, through 2009 but narrow
gradually thereafter. Higher oil prices alone are likely to increase imports by some
3 percent of GDP between 2004–08. In the medium term, import growth is projected to
moderate in line with weakening domestic demand and export shares to be maintained,
resulting in the current account moderating slightly to about 10 percent of GDP by 2013
(with the income account deficit rising to 7 percent of GDP). The main downside risks are
that domestic demand does not moderate and competitiveness deteriorates.
17.
The authorities recognized that the macroeconomic outlook, driven by external
shocks, had deteriorated significantly. The Bank of Portugal’s recently revised projections
are broadly in line with staff’s for 2008, and the somewhat higher growth in 2009 is largely
due to their more positive external assumptions. The Ministry of Finance is also likely to
revise down their projections in the forthcoming budget. The authorities underscored,
however, that achievements over the past two years have placed Portugal in a stronger
position to face the current adverse shocks from the financial market turmoil and higher
commodity prices.

IV. THE POLICY AGENDA: PROMOTING ADJUSTMENT AND GROWTH
18.
Policies should focus on fostering the smooth unwinding of macro imbalances to
address the main challenges to domestic 1 stability: i) achieving fiscal soundness;
ii) ensuring financial stability; and iii) enhancing growth and competitiveness. Given the
rigidity of the economy and the accumulated macro imbalances, meeting these challenges
will likely prove long and demanding—marginal changes are not enough, and a critical mass
of supply-oriented reforms is necessary to rebalance growth to the external sector and reignite
the convergence process.
A. Challenge 1: Achieving Fiscal Soundness
19.
Decisive action has reduced fiscal imbalances and enhanced credibility, putting
the fiscal accounts on a stronger footing to face the current more difficult economic
circumstances. Since 2005, the deficit has fallen by 3½ percentage points of GDP to
2.6 percent of GDP in 2007—the lowest level for some 30 years, allowing Portugal to exit
the Excessive Deficit Procedure a year earlier than envisaged and the debt-to-GDP ratio to
fall. The consolidation has, appropriately, been driven by containing primary current
spending. Revenue overperformance has also contributed, due in significant part to enhanced
revenue administration. While euro area countries in general have also improved their fiscal
position over the past two years on the back of favorable cyclical conditions, the
improvement was largest in Portugal.

Accounting for less than 2 percent of euro area GDP and financial assets, and 4 percent of euro area country
current account imbalances, Portugal has only a minimal impact on the union’s balance of payments and hence
external stability.

17
20.
The deficit fell by more than a percentage point of GDP in 2007, exceeding
targets. This considerable overshooting stems mainly from higher revenue, which was
largely saved. Current revenue increased by nearly a percentage point of GDP in the year,
about half of which seems due to improved administration. Two facts stand out:
•

The lion’s share of the revenue overperformance came from buoyancy in income tax,
especially corporate. This reflected more taxpaying firms and better financial results
by large taxpayers. In contrast, indirect tax revenue declined slightly due to moderate
household consumption growth.

•

Primary spending continued to fall—both as a share of GDP and in real terms—
driven by the wage bill, reflecting the elimination of automatic career progression,
base wage growth below inflation and a two-for-one hiring policy. Unemployment
benefits also declined reflecting tighter criteria introduced in 2006.

21.
Fiscal consolidation is set to continue in 2008, though at a slower pace. Following
substantial overperformance in 2007, the government appropriately tightened the deficit
target to 2.2 percent of GDP. However, the cut in the VAT rate by a percentage point 2 and
some specific measures to support those most affected by higher commodity prices and
interest rates 3 will reduce the structural consolidation to somewhat below ½ a percent of
GDP.
2

3

The tax cut is estimated to reduce revenue by 0.4 percent of GDP on an annual basis.

These included suspending the inflation adjustment of the petroleum excise, a 25 percent increase in child
support, lower toll charges, and higher interest rate deductibility for low-income households. While in general
staff does not support tackling interest deductibility, the measure introduced was well targeted, with limited
implication for distorting price signals.

18
22.
The fiscal authorities emphasized the adjustment in 2008 needs to be assessed in
the context of the consolidation process that started in 2005. Two years of significant
overperformance had to be balanced against the growing pressures to respond to short-term
output-stabilization and social assistance concerns. They argued that the cut in the VAT rate
announced in March aimed at providing some stimulus to the economy given stronger than
expected overperformance in 2007 and the early signs of weakening economic activity. As
the economy was further buffeted by the external shocks, additional measures were required
to support those most affected by high commodity prices and rising interest rates.

recent commodity price and interest rate increases should continue to be targeted, temporary,
offset by other measures, designed to maximize the supply response, and to avoid distorting
price signals. Indeed, as the heightened spreads on Portugal’s government debt indicate, there
is little room for maneuver, and the costs of slippage are high. The MTO may also need
eventually to be improved upon to address longer-term pressures such as population aging.

The fiscal authorities agreed with staff on the extent of the needed consolidation.
They acknowledged that the previously envisaged consolidation of 0.8 percent of GDP in
2009 had become less realistic given economic developments, and to ensure the credibility of
achieving the MTO and to not undermine gains achieved so far, structural consolidation of at
least a ½ percent of GDP should be targeted. The new fiscal targets would be spelled out in
the context of the 2009 Budget to be published in October.
26.
Efforts to enhance the quality, transparency, and durability of fiscal
consolidation need to continue. In particular, progress should continue to be made on
performance-based budgeting and a binding medium-term framework. Continued progress
needs also to be made on divesting and reforming public enterprises, including greater use of
performance evaluation, centralizing the ownership function in the Ministry of Finance, and
enhancing transparency in public accounts. Especially in the current economic context, the
program to make public agencies pay on time needs to be strictly enforced and possibly made
more ambitious.
B. Challenge 2: Ensuring Financial Stability
27.
While Portugal’s financial system remains sound and well supervised,
vulnerabilities have risen. Portuguese banks’ reliance on wholesale funding raises liquidity
risks, and banks are exposed to market risk through employees’ pension funds and banks’

20
own investment portfolios. High household and corporate debt increases credit risk given
rising interest rates and the weak macroeconomic outlook, and loan concentration in some
banks to certain sectors and large exposures appears significant.
Portuguese banks rely relatively heavily on
wholesale funding...

Staff’s stress tests indicate that the current environment poses risks, although
these seem manageable, and the system should be resilient.
•

Simulation of the evolution of the main balance sheet components indicate that while
credit growth will likely decelerate, it would not grow more slowly than nominal
GDP. A credit crunch seems unlikely except in a rather extreme scenario where banks
cannot rollover maturing securities and a large proportion of interbank loans, for
example, due to a worsening of the global liquidity situation.

•

Analysis of corporate balance sheets suggests that declining profits and increasing
interest rates could almost triple existing corporate nonperforming loans.
Nevertheless, bank profitability, provisioning and capital levels should provide

21
adequate buffers to absorb this shock, although some banks would likely need to
reinforce their capital positions. 5

Liquidity shocks are more of a concern but
again seem largely manageable. Compared
to peers, Portuguese banks’ liquidity
appears a little low in general on some
measures, but at the consolidated level,
banks are required to cover 90 percent of
one-month liabilities plus financing gaps
over a one-year horizon with liquid assets.

vulnerabilities and have been pro-active in
addressing them. Banks with weaker capital
ratios have been strongly encouraged to raise capital, and two large private banks and one
small one have increased capital through rights issuance and profit allocation, while others
have announced plans to increase capital by year-end. Banks were recently encouraged to
increase their portfolio of securities that can be used as collateral for central bank lending as a
precautionary liquidity measure, although Portuguese banks have made relatively little use of
ECB funding due to the increase in retail deposit funding. The Bank of Portugal has
enhanced monitoring of banks’ liquidity positions and banks’ plans to address potential
liquidity shortfalls.
30.
These measures are welcome, and some further enhancements to the financial
stability framework could be considered. Many of these are already under consideration,
including in the context of ongoing changes in the international financial architecture. To
further strengthen liquidity supervision, a zero maturity gap could be required at the 15-day
or one-month horizon and, in line with recommendations from the Basel Committee,
haircuts for structured products might warrant reconsideration. The Bank of Portugal should
ensure that banks have appropriate internal limits on sectoral credit concentrations and large
exposures, in compliance with the internal controls instructions. Stress tests could be more
proactively used to assess the adequacy of capital buffers. If Tier I capital ratios were to fall
significantly below 7 percent, banks should be encouraged to raise capital. In the context of
Basel II implementation, banks’ own risk-management models should be validated. The
transition to full economic provisioning might also usefully be completed.
5

Stress tests of corporate balance sheets assumed a 30 percent decline in profitability and 100 b.p. increase in
financing costs. Bank stress tests assumed that NPLs would reach 3 percent of total loans, in line with the
corporate stress test and historical data, and a 50 b.p. decline in net interest margins. Banks were required to
maintain current provisioning levels.

22
31.
In the context of EU-wide revision of deposit insurance schemes, the
opportunity should be taken to further enhance the deposit guarantee fund (FGD). In
particular, the maximum period for the payment of guaranteed deposits could be
substantially shortened. Consideration could also be given to updating the guaranteed
amount, setting a target coverage ratio for FGD resources, including the minimum cost
principle for the FGD, and to altering the provider of emergency FGD lending from the
Bank of Portugal to the Ministry of Finance.
32.
Given Portugal’s external imbalances, household savings need to rise over time.
Recent reforms of the social security system and the benefits of enhancing banks’ domestic
retail funding also call for more proactive promotion of household savings. A key channel for
such savings are occupational pension schemes, but these are relatively undeveloped—
consideration should be given to conducting a public financial literacy campaign and to
introducing “soft compulsion” schemes that require opting out of, rather than into,
occupational pension schemes (e.g., the U.K.’s “National Pensions Savings Scheme” or the
New Zealand “Kiwisaver” plan).
33.
The authorities welcomed staff recommendations to further enhance the
financial stability framework, indicating that many of the measures were already under
consideration. On further strengthening liquidity supervision, requiring banks to implement
a zero maturity gap at the 15-day or one-month horizon would be considered, but this was not
a priority as most banks tend to maintain net positive liquidity positions for those time
horizons. The authorities agreed that transition to economic provisioning on an individual
basis, similar to what is already implemented at the consolidated level, would be desirable.
While acknowledging the difficulties in setting the appropriate parameters to conduct stress
tests in the current environment, the authorities considered that they could take more
advantage of banks’ internal stress tests for supervisory purposes. The areas for enhancing the
FGD would also be considered in the context of EU-wide revision.
C. Challenge 3: Enhancing Growth and Competitiveness
34.
At the root of Portugal’s problems lies a
severe lack of productivity. This in turn reflects a
rigid economy, as well as other structural factors
relating to human capital and the justice system.
Unlike other EU countries, including those with
weak growth (such as Italy), unemployment has
risen, apparently structurally as the historical
relationship with the output gap seems to have
broken down. Employment protection legislation
remains among the most restrictive in the OECD,
and total factor productivity growth has been

Weak productivity, combined with strong wage growth and external shocks, led
to Portugal losing competitiveness since the mid-1990s, which has not been regained.

eight years to eliminate). Portugal had been losing
export market shares until 2005 but has regained some ground since. Nonprice indicators for
recent years suggest some improvement, but not as fast as peers, and not sufficient to
significantly reduce the competitiveness gap (Box 2).
Box 2. Is Portugal Gaining Competitiveness by Restructuring? 1/
Standard measures indicate that Portugal has a sizeable competitiveness gap. But it is often
countered with anecdotal evidence of restructuring by export industries. Could such
restructuring imply that Portugal is substantially more competitive than standard indicators
suggest?
Evidence in the last decade suggests that some restructuring has taken place, but the scope has
been limited and the pace slower than competitors’. On the positive side, Portuguese firms were
able to diversify their export products and upgrade their technological content, albeit from low
bases, and also entered markets with less competition. Less encouragingly, the sectoral
allocation of FDI was not the most conducive to future growth, and Portugal had less FDI in
manufacturing than its peers. Portugal also tended to export relatively less to the world’s
dynamic countries, and although it managed to increase market share in those markets, they
were from extremely low levels. Portugal also tended to specialize in products with slow growth
in global demand, and improvements in export quality were limited and slower than its main EU
competitors. There was also little sign of restructuring in terms of service exports.
On balance, restructuring has likely alleviated some of the competitiveness gap but not enough
to substantially offset the broader structural shortcomings weighing on external performance.
Looking forward, further restructuring may be required in the export sector, as the dynamics of
competition from emerging markets plays out, especially as these countries may intensify their
upgrading.

Reflecting the loss of competitiveness, the current account deteriorated to
around 10 percent of GDP. Unlike other euro area countries with large current account
deficits (e.g., Spain, Greece), Portugal has not been growing fast, and Portugal’s current
account deficit exceeds other euro area countries’ with low growth and competitiveness
problems (e.g., Italy), partly due to the deteriorating income account. Reflecting the difficult
international capital market conditions, foreign financial investment in Portugal and bank
issuance of long-term debt abroad have fallen sharply, as has the accumulation of foreign
assets by residents. There has also been a shift from portfolio investment toward other
investment (interbank borrowing and deposits).

37.
The authorities agreed that Portugal continues to face a competitiveness gap, but
Bank of Portugal officials expressed concern about the staff’s quantitative assessments
based on standard indicators. They felt the presence of such a gap was not fully consistent
with a robust recovery in export market share over the past few years despite the substantial
euro strengthening. In addition, such indicators suffered from methodological shortcomings
and masked the fundamental restructuring underway in some sectors of the economy. The
fiscal authorities also considered that these indicators do not capture the positive spillover
effects from the efficiency gains resulting from the implementation of public sector
administration reform.
38.
The authorities’ strategy to boost competitiveness focuses on enhancing
productivity and the business environment.
•

The recent agreement on labor relations signed by the social partners can be expected
to facilitate internal flexibility for companies, rationalize collective bargaining,

27
encourage firm-level agreements, and streamline procedures for dismissal. It also
envisages an increase in the rate of social security contributions on fixed-term
contracts by three percentage points (financing a cut of one percentage point for
permanent contracts).
•

Public sector employment is being cut, and wages contained, while being restructured,
helping to moderate economy-wide wage growth and enhance public sector
efficiency.

•

The ambitious and broad-ranging SIMPLEX program continues, as recognized by all
interlocutors, to significantly improve the business climate. The focus for 2008 is on
streamlining licensing.

39.
These are important achievements and need to be followed through and
assessed. Further reform should focus on making the economy more flexible and
competitive.
•

The recent agreement on reforming labor relations is a welcome step forward.
The envisaged increase in the rate of social security contributions on fixed-term
contracts by three percentage points, however, should be reconsidered: experience
from Portugal, and other EU countries, show that such contracts are an important path
to traditional, open-ended employment for many and have proven critical to boosting
employment. The test of the new agreement will be in its implementation and whether
it improves the working of the labor market. This will need to be carefully monitored
and further actions, such as eliminating the automatic extension of collectively agreed
contracts and broadening the scope for individual dismissal, could be considered.

•

The SIMPLEX program continues to improve the business climate, and its
priority on licensing in 2008 is well placed. It will be important to broaden the
participation of local governments, building on recent efforts; ensure that small and
medium-sized businesses are included in the benefits; and, to follow through with
plans to assess effectiveness. In this context, advantage should be taken of the need to
implement the EU Services Directive to make a clean sweep of regulations at all
levels of government. The recent public administration reforms should also be built
upon to continue to enhance public sector productivity.

•

Competition in domestic markets needs to be further enhanced. The Competition
Authority should build on its encouraging first five years to continue to advocate and
enforce competition. Enhancing judicial system efficiency would also support the
Authority’s effectiveness.

28
•

For electricity, integration with the Spanish market is continuing, but it will be
important that regulated tariffs are set to ensure full cost recovery that the roadmap for
the end of regulated prices be developed, and that opportunities be grasped to increase
competition in domestic generation.

40.
The authorities welcomed staff’s endorsement of the labor agreement but
underscored the rationale for the envisaged higher social security contributions on
fixed-term contracts. They emphasized the measure aimed at reducing abuse of the system
and that the lower rate on permanent contracts, coupled with new steps to streamline
procedures for dismissal, would encourage creation of permanent employment.
41.
The reform momentum needs to be maintained. Policies should avoid jeopardizing
recent achievements and long-term goals for short-term gain, preserving the continuity of
adjustment and reforms and avoiding policy drift that Portugal can ill-afford. In this context,
consideration could be given to developing mechanisms to formulate a “catch-up” growth
agenda, which could broaden social support and could be rapidly acted upon by the next
legislature (elections are due in October 2009). Mechanisms that have worked well for other
countries include expert committees (e.g., Australia’s Productivity Commission, a range of
commissions in France, and the U.K.) or stakeholder committees to generate a consensus
based on a shared diagnosis (e.g., Spain’s Toledo Pact or the Conseil d’Orientation des
Retraites in France).

1/ For 2008–10, staff projections are based on unchanged policies, and the envisaged savings from the reforms that have already been introduced (for example, of the social security system), and
thereafter unchanged structural primary balance.
2/ Structural balance calculated using staff's estimate of the output gap.
3/ One-off measures consist of the transfer of the postal pension fund in 2003, the state enterprises pension funds in 2004, securitization and asset sales.
4/ Calculated using the staff's estimates of potential output. Asset sales, including UMTS receipts, the transfer of pension funds and securitization are netted.

1/ For 2005 and 2006 the figures are for the sample of institutions that are already complying with IAS, accounting as of December
2004 for about 87 percent of the usual aggregate considered. To ensure comparability, the figures for 2004 for this subsample are also
presented.
2/ The sample of banking institutions under analysis was expanded in order to include the institutions that adopted IAS only in 2006.
3/ On accounting basis; consolidated.
4/ On a consolidated basis. NPLs are defined as credit to customer overdue. For comparable 2004 and 2005 figures. The concept of
NPL is only applicable at an individual level and for prudential purposes. The following definition of NPL's will be used: principal and
interest past due for more than 90 days (amount overdue only) + future installments of loans fallen due and classified as doubtful,
according to criteria that include initial maturity, the time elapsed since the first installment fallen due, and the relative importance of
fallen due installments in each loan.
5/ Based on weighted averages of lending rates to households and to nonfinancial corporations and of deposit interest rates for the two
sectors.
6/ PSI Financial Services (Euronext Lisbon); 01/01/2000 =100.
7/ Three-month residual maturity horizon.
8/ FX liabilities include foreign currency deposits and deposit-like instruments of resident nonmonetary sector and claims of nonresident
vis-à-vis resident monetary financial institutions (excluding Bank of Portugal).

Table 8. Portugal: Status of Implementation of FSAP Main Recommendations
Recommendation
Short-term stability issues
► Continue to carefully monitor key risk areas:
- household debt, especially toward more vulnerable
subgroups of household borrowers;
- corporate debt developments;
- banks’ lending concentrations; and

- banks’ external borrowing and the associated pricing and
liquidity risks.

Status

Results of the new round of the wealth survey have become available in early 2008.
Refinement of existing statistics for cohorts of corporate sector and development of credit risk
analytical tools were introduced.
Instruction 17/2007 on concentration risks require banks to adopt internal limits on exposure
concentrations to certain sectors and regions. However, banks have yet to establish this
internal limits.
The frequency of liquidity monitoring has been increased. In early 2008 banks were required
to report liquidity stress test results and contingency plans to deal with prolonged wholesale
funding distress.

► Continue to ensure bank capital levels are consistent with
the evolving risk outlook and if necessary impose additional
capital requirements using the discretion available under
Basel II.
► Continue to foster banks’ systems to accurately measure,
monitor, and adequately control risks, and further strengthen
the BdP’s supervisory capacity in this area.

In some cases, Bank of Portugal has been proactive encouraging banks to increase capital,
particularly in recent months. Most major banks have either increased capital or announced
capital increases.

► Perform further stress testing on the financial system at
appropriate intervals, taking into account banks’ linkages
with the insurance sector and their employee pension funds.

A new run of stress-tests encompassing the whole range of materially relevant risks to the
banking system is programmed to take place in the second half of 2008.

Structural and longer-term issues
► Improve the judicial framework for debt recovery by
speeding up court processes in particular.
► Enhance the financial independence of the securities and
insurance supervisors, Comissão do Mercado de Valores
Mobiliários (CMVM) and the Instituto de Seguros de Portugal
(ISP).

► Transfer the management of the guarantee fund for Motor
Third Party and workers compensation from the ISP to other
organizations.
Refinements to supervisory and safety net arrangements
► Fully implement the new system for risk profile
assessment of credit institutions and other financial
intermediaries, as planned; and
► In insurance supervision, set appropriate fit and proper
criteria for members of governing bodies of insurance
undertakings and intermediaries, strengthen corporate
governance requirements, and establish rules or guidelines
on market conduct regarding the problem of fraud.

Banks' risk management systems have been enhanced recently following the adoption of
Basel II. BdP's capacity in this area is also being strengthened namely in the context of the
adoption of a risk rating system (MAR).

Not yet Implemented
The Government has approved the inclusion of a permanent provision on the subject of the
surplus and the freezing of CMVM budget lines that will be published and come into force this
summer. There is also a proposal for the revision of the Ministerial Order setting CMVM
supervisory fees. The ISP has already submitted to the Government a proposal to amend its
Charter in order to replicate the provision that has been included in the State Budget Law
since 2006, setting out that the general budgetary and public accountancy rules regarding
freezing of funds, carry-over and use of surplus, and the twelfth expenditure system are not
applicable to ISP.
The draft law that implements the transfer of the management of the Guarantee Fund for
Motor Third Party and Workers Compensation Fund from the ISP to a new public company
was in public consultation until 14th of July and it now under scrutiny by the Government.

Banco de Portugal's risk assessment system (MAR) is already in force. During 2008, and after
being fully tested during 2007, throughout its application to a sample of institutions, this
methodology is being used to guide on-site examinations to all the major banks. Additionally,
Banco de Portugal is under development a software tool to support MAR.
A draft law, currently under Government consideration after a period of public consultation,
will:
a) Set fit and proper requirements for senior management; the supervisory authority could
recommend the replacement of a senior manager that does not comply with the fit and proper
requirements;
b) Establish a duty for insurance undertakings to approve and monitor standards of business
conduct and ethical behavior code for the industry;
d) Require insurance undertakings to establish a specific and autonomous complaint
management function and to set out an Ombudsman;
e) Introduce an obligation to insurance undertaking to have a policy regarding the prevention,
detection and report of insurance fraud.

Fund Recommendations

Implementation

Front-load the adjustment in 2007 and 2008 to
make the objective of meeting the MTO by 2010
more credible, by following through on central
administration restructuring.

The 2007 deficit target was surpassed without oneoff measures. The improvement was driven by
expenditure reduction especially of the wage bill,
and significant revenue overperformance.
However, the cut in the VAT rate and some
stimulative measures will reduce the structural
consolidation in 2008. Additional measure will
likely be needed to reach the MTO.

Strengthen budget planning and control and move
toward comprehensive multiyear budget targets.

Good progress with pilot programs to implement
performance-based budgeting. The plan is to
move to performance-based, medium-term
budgeting with expenditure ceilings.

Take steps to make the labor market more
flexible in the context of the labor code review.
These include easing employment protection
legislation, eliminating the automatic extension of
collectively agreed contracts to firms not part of
the agreement, and making procedures less
cumbersome.

The recent agreement on reforming labor
relations is expected to facilitate internal flexibility
for companies, rationalize collective bargaining,
encourage firm-level agreements, and streamline
procedures for dismissal. However, the envisaged
increase in the rate of social security contributions
on fixed-term contracts may hamper employment
creation and needs to be carefully monitored.

Extend the SIMPLEX program to simplify the
permit system, especially at the local level, to
further strengthen the business environment.
Enhance competition further in domestic markets,
especially in network industries and some service
sectors.

Significant progress with the SIMPLEX program to
streamline licensing. Progress in increasing
competition in the domestic market, for example
with the notaries.

Appendix II. Portugal: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Notwithstanding some
recent improvements, statistical weaknesses continue to hamper the assessment of economic
developments. Portugal subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and the
relevant metadata have been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Portugal’s
publication policy is characterized by a high degree of openness and extensive use of the Internet. The
Bank of Portugal, Ministry of Finance, and National Statistics Office (INE) have several websites
with long- and short-term economic indicators and data.
2.
Real sector statistics were improved in the fall of 2000, when INE published a full set of
national accounts based on ESA95 methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates. Shortcomings in
timely and high quality monthly and quarterly data on output, employment, and total wage
compensation hamper the monitoring of within-year developments in the labor market.
Unemployment data also suffer from statistical problems caused, inter alia, by frequent revisions to
the measurement of unemployment and sampling rotations.
3.
Fiscal sector data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to ESA95,
sizably altering revenue and expenditure and hampering comparisons across years. From 2001
onward, budgets have been presented in a manner consistent with recent changes in national and
fiscal accounting methodology. Intra-year budget data are available only on a cash basis. In 2002, INE
started to publish data for the Social Security Fund on a monthly basis with a 45 days delay, and in
2003 for the Autonomous Funds on a quarterly basis with a 75 days delay. Except for the local and
general government, data broadly meet the SDDS timeliness standards. Quarterly general government
statistics on an accrual basis are available as derived from the national accounts statistics.
4.
Trade and balance of payments data are provided according to the IMF’s fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The external trade data meet the timeliness standards, although
revisions are frequent and sizeable. The portfolio investment collection system has a simplified
threshold of €500 million, which is relatively high in comparison with many EU countries. The
authorities estimate however, that only about 1.5 percent of transactions are not captured on a
monthly basis by this threshold, and that this reporting simplification does not significantly hamper
the quality of the monthly balance of payments. Moreover, they believe that all transactions below
this threshold are included in the first release of the annual balance of payments data, and the monthly
numbers are revised accordingly.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Portugal
October 1, 2008
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unaltered.
2.
The economy continues to show signs of weakening, driven by the global
slowdown. Output growth slowed to 0.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter
(1.4 percent quarter-on-quarter annualized), largely the result of weaker exports, as external
demand, and private consumption weakened. Gross fixed investment remained relatively
robust and unemployment declined to 7.3 percent in the second quarter as employment
growth picked up. The current account deficit continued to widen, reflecting higher
commodity and oil prices. Short-term indicators, such as the coincident indicator of
economic activity and industrial production, continued to deteriorate. Inflation (harmonized)
declined to 3.1 percent year-on-year in August, still below the euro area.
3.
As envisaged by staff, the fiscal accounts have been affected by weaker activity
but remain broadly on track, though downside risks have increased. Preliminary data
through August indicate that revenue collection remained subdued, mainly reflecting a
significant downturn in VAT receipts, while spending remained contained, in part due to
lower capital expenditure.
4.
The Portuguese financial system appears to be weathering the current
international financial turbulence. Financial markets followed European trends as bank
credit default spreads increased and bank equity prices fell. Some second-tier banks,
however, have been more affected. The government announced new measures to strengthen
supervision and improve the transparency of the financial system. The market regulator also
temporarily banned the short-selling of certain financial stocks.
5.
The deterioration of domestic indicators and the more severe slowdown of
partner countries have worsened the growth outlook. In line with global developments
highlighted in the current World Economic Outlook, export growth is likely to be slower, and
lower consumer confidence, coupled with the weaker economic outlook, will likely further
dampen private consumption and fixed investment. Staff therefore have revised down the
2008 and 2009 real GDP growth projections from 1.0 and 0.8 percent to 0.7 and 0.6 percent,
respectively.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 3, 2008

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Portugal
On October 1, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Portugal. 1
Background
A modest recovery was underway until 2007. Growth rose to 1.9 percent in 2007, led by strong
external demand, which had been driving a notable rebound in export growth in the last two
years. In response, corporate investment gathered steam, which, along with robust private
consumption, led to a pick up in domestic demand. Modest employment growth failed to keep
up with continuing labor force growth, leading to unemployment rising to 8.0 percent in 2007.
Inflation, while below that of the euro area since late 2007, has picked up due to higher food
and energy prices. The current account deficit (including capital transfers) narrowed to about
8½ percent of GDP in 2007.
Real GDP growth is projected to slow to about 0.7 percent in 2008 and to about 0.6 percent in
2009, owing to deterioration in the global outlook, higher commodity prices, the stronger euro,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

and the fallout from the international financial turbulence. Relatively robust external demand is
forecast to lead to a positive contribution from the external sector, while domestic demand is
expected to become more subdued. Private consumption is forecast to remain constrained by
weak employment growth and high indebtedness. While some corporate balance sheet
restructuring has occurred, still-high enterprise debt levels and tighter credit conditions may
restrain the rebound in investment. Some continued fiscal consolidation and structural reforms
are projected to prompt a gradual recovery in competitiveness and productivity.
Decisive government action has reduced fiscal imbalances and enhanced credibility—since
2005, the deficit has fallen by 3½ percentage points of GDP to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007. The
consolidation has been driven by containing primary current spending. Revenue
overperformance has also contributed, due in significant part to enhanced revenue
administration. Fiscal consolidation is set to continue in 2008, though at a slower pace.
Following substantial overperformance in 2007, the government lowered the deficit target to 2.2
percent of GDP. The restructuring of the central administration will play a central role in
achieving fiscal consolidation goals and improving productivity. Recent reforms to the social
security system have significantly improved long-term fiscal sustainability. Important steps to
move to performance-based budgeting are underway.
Portugal’s financial system remains sound and well supervised. The financial system has come
under pressure but has so far weathered the recent global financial turmoil, though
vulnerabilities have risen. Portuguese banks’ reliance on wholesale funding, the sensitivity of
bank employees’ pension funds and banks’ own investment portfolios to stock market returns,
high household and corporate debt, and significant loan concentration in some banks to certain
sectors and large exposures remain sources of risk. The authorities have been pro-active in
addressing these vulnerabilities; for example, banks with weaker capital ratios have been
encouraged to raise capital, and the Bank of Portugal has enhanced monitoring of banks’
liquidity positions and banks’ plans to address potential liquidity shortfalls.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made in addressing Portugal’s long-standing
macroeconomic imbalances, while recognizing that the economic situation remains challenging.
Growth has slowed and near-term risks continue to be tilted to the downside, reflecting
international financial tensions and weaker global macroeconomic conditions. Directors
underscored that these challenges argue for strengthening the reform momentum, building on
gains already made, so as to create the conditions to reignite the income convergence process
with the EU and boost employment growth.
Directors commended the decisive action taken by the government to reduce fiscal imbalances
and enhance credibility. Revenue overperformance and current expenditures that were set on a
downward path have permitted an exit from the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure one year

3
before the deadline. Directors welcomed the continued fiscal consolidation in 2008, and
considered the measures to support more vulnerable groups appropriately targeted. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal consolidation to ensure that the Medium-Term
Objective can be achieved. They considered that a structural consolidation of ½ percent of GDP
in 2009 should be achievable on current policies. Directors stressed that there was no scope for
further discretionary loosening. Efforts to enhance the quality, transparency, and durability of
fiscal consolidation should also continue.
Directors observed that the financial system remains sound and well supervised. Global
financial tensions and weaker macroeconomic conditions have, however, heightened some
existing vulnerabilities, including high household, corporate, and government debt levels and
the relatively heavy reliance of Portuguese banks on wholesale funding. Directors welcomed the
Bank of Portugal’s pro-active efforts in addressing the vulnerabilities. They recommended that
some further enhancements to the financial stability framework could be considered, including
further strengthening liquidity supervision and the deposit insurance system, greater use of
stress tests to ensure the adequacy of capital buffers, and speeding the implementation of the
Basle II framework.
Directors agreed that improving productivity growth and closing the external competitiveness
gap are critical to address Portugal’s economic problems, and noted the important steps being
taken to address these challenges. The ambitious and broad-ranging SIMPLEX program
continues to improve the business climate, and the authorities should build on the recent public
administration reforms and the implementation of the EU Services Directive. Directors
welcomed the recent agreement on reforming labor relations, though the envisaged higher rate
of social security contributions on fixed-term contracts should be reconsidered. Directors also
stressed the need for greater competition in domestic markets, including by strengthening the
efficiency of the judicial system to help improve the Competition Authority’s effectiveness and
developing a roadmap for the end of regulated electricity prices.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Portugal and
José Cardoso, Advisor to Executive Director
October 1, 2008

1. Introduction
We thank the staff for engaging in a frank and constructive dialogue with the Portuguese
authorities, and for the insightful reports and valuable analysis on the recent developments of
the Portuguese economy, which broadly corresponds to the authorities’ position.
When the Portuguese economy was gradually recovering and strengthening its fundamentals,
the world economy was hit by a severe global financial crisis on top of the ongoing hike in
international commodity prices (with oil as a particularly important factor for Portugal).
These adverse conditions inevitably affect a small open highly-integrated economy like the
Portuguese economy. Nevertheless, real GDP growth in 2007 was the highest of the last six
years, boosted by the dynamism of investment and against a backdrop of robust growth in
exports of goods and services, which have been diversifying broadly. The growth in 2007,
although still below EU growth, confirmed the gradual and continuing acceleration of
economic activity that started in mid-2005, with a new impetus from a far reaching structural
reform process. However, given the persistence and severity of the external adverse
environment, the recovery of the Portuguese economy will inevitably slow in 2008 and 2009.
On the structural front, Portugal has been correcting rigidities that have constrained
productivity and competitiveness. The structural measures under the Technological Plan and
the Simplex are progressing well, and a new Labor Code was recently approved by
Parliament and will come into force in January 1, 2009. Additionally, Portugal has been
implementing a successful fiscal consolidation, recognized by the abrogation, one year
before the deadline, of the decision taken by the Council of the EU that Portugal had an
excessive deficit.
The Portuguese authorities, recognizing the harsh conditions that the most vulnerable groups
are presently facing, promptly adopted specific and well targeted measures, but reaffirmed its
strong commitment and engagement not to weaken the fiscal reform process and to continue
the fiscal consolidation. The structural reforms implemented over the past two years have
strengthened the Portuguese economy’s resilience to the international adverse shocks.

2. Economic Overview
2.1 Recent Developments
The recovery that started in the course of 2005 gathered momentum in the following two
years. In 2007, the economic activity recorded a real GDP growth of 1.9 percent, which
compares with 0.9 percent recorded two years before. The most recent data show that in the
second quarter of 2008, year-on-year real GDP grew 0.7 percent. The quarter-on-quarter rate
of growth of real GDP stood at 0.3 percent (0.5 p.p. above that figure for the euro area).
Inflation, measured by the annual average rate of change in the Harmonized Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP), dropped to 2.4 percent in 2007 from 3.0 percent in 2006. The
average rate of change of the euro area HICP also fell in 2007, albeit slightly. In the last
months of the year, prices showed a marked upward trend, driven by the acceleration in
prices of energy and processed food excluding tobacco, but since September 2007
inflation has been lower in Portugal than in the euro area. This led to the narrowing of
the inflation differential to 0.3 p.p. in 2007. With the exception of energy, all major
aggregates contributed to the decrease in the inflation differential. Turning to the most recent
data, year-on-year inflation was 3.0 percent in August (the second lowest of the euro area),
and core inflation (which excludes energy components and fresh unprocessed food products)
was 2.5 percent. In the period from January to August, inflation stood 0.6 p.p. below the euro
area average.
An analysis of the economic growth performance from a demand components perspective
reveals that the acceleration of GDP in 2007 was chiefly associated with the behavior of
gross fixed investment. The recovery in gross fixed investment followed a protracted period
of development below trend and reflected a context of global improvement of business
confidence, in annual average terms. This recovery of gross fixed investment largely
reflected an increased acceleration in machinery and equipment, but was also sustained by a
modest positive contribution from construction. It should be stressed that there is no real
estate bubble in Portugal. The Portuguese real estate boom ended in the early 2000s
and home prices have since risen barely in line with inflation. Steady gross fixed
investment growth (in particular of corporate investment) is fundamental to ensure stronger
and sustained recovery in economic activity. The recent favorable development of this
component does not yet make it possible to draw inferences whether or not it is a sustained
recovery, particularly taking into account the ongoing uncertainty of the international
financial situation.
Private consumption recorded moderate growth in 2007, reflecting inter alia lower
disposable income growth in real terms. Consumption of current goods has decelerated for
the third year in a row, whereas consumption of durable goods has accelerated sharply. This
behavior of durable goods consumption, in particular the car component, was significantly
affected by changes introduced in the vehicle tax, as well as by some measures to simplify
the tax incentive program for the retirement of end-of-life vehicles. Buoyant durable goods
consumption has evolved in parallel with continued high growth of consumer credit.
Exports of goods and services continued to be the most buoyant component of overall
demand in 2007 (with market share revealing higher annual average gains than the

3
previous year), but decelerating in line with the evolution of world trade of goods and
services. External trade developments in 2007 confirmed some structural elements
characterizing the growing integration of the Portuguese economy in global trade flows.
First, the degree of openness of the Portuguese economy, measured from the joint weight of
exports and imports on GDP, rose again significantly. Second, the structure of goods exports
by geographical area, in nominal terms, continued to reflect the growing weight of non-EU
markets, in particular the Angolan market. Finally, buoyant exports of services are
particularly noteworthy (with nominal growth exceeding growth in the euro area), showing
an important development in the comparative advantage of the Portuguese economy. This
buoyancy was the result not only of an acceleration in tourism exports, but also of continued
steady growth in other services, such as those related to transport and the supply of technical
and professional services. In contrast, exports of goods decelerated in 2007, a factor that is
especially apparent in sectors (machinery and appliances, motor vehicles, common metals
and minerals, ores and fuels) that had accelerated significantly in 2006.
Against this background, 2007 recorded a fall in the economy’s net external borrowing
requirements, as a percentage of GDP. These developments reflected a virtual stabilization
of the investment and domestic saving ratios as a percentage of GDP and an increase in
capital inflows. The stability of the investment ratio as a percentage of GDP was observed
both in the private and in the public sectors. The saving rate, however, fell for households
and companies but rose significantly in the public sector. This situation meant that the
combined current and capital account deficit narrowed from 9.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to
8.6 percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting the combination of an improved goods and services
account balance, and a widening capital account surplus, but a deteriorating income account
balance.
2.2 Future Prospects
In a small open highly-integrated economy, the international environment has a significant
impact. Given the fact that the current shocks are unprecedented in terms of scope,
magnitude and duration, their impact on the economy is highly uncertain.
The expenditure pattern seen in the current economic cycle (explained in the previous
section) contrasts with that of the previous cycle during the first half of the 2000s. In the
previous cycle, private expenditure grew significantly, in a context of a marked decline in
financing costs and increasing private sector indebtedness, which was significantly lower in
that period. In turn, public expenditure in consumption and investment also made a
significant contribution to GDP growth, in a context where lower financing costs and the
resulting decline in interest expenditure were accompanied by an unsustainable increase in
primary expenditure, which resulted in a strong fiscal imbalance.
Additionally, Portuguese banks started to operate in a less favorable environment
regarding their funding in international wholesale markets. Given that these markets are
an important source of funding for Portuguese banks, the protracted period of instability has
implied a tightening of credit standards. A further persistence of the turbulence in
international financial markets should tend to heighten this situation.

4
On top of these, the heightened uncertainty regarding the degree of tightness of
financing conditions will tend to postpone households’ expenditure decisions (given the
pressure on obligations related to household indebtedness, one of the highest in the euro area)
and will tend to postpone non-financial corporations’ investment decisions related to
the expansion of capacity utilization (reflecting also the higher uncertainty about future
demand prospects, in terms of both domestic and external markets).
Any forecast under such quickly-shifting conditions is a very difficult exercise and subject to
review, but it is reasonable to expect that given these external adverse shocks, and in
synchronization with our main trading partners, economic activity will slow in 2008 and
2009, stalling the recent recovery of the Portuguese economy, boosted mainly by exports in
2006 and by investment in 2007.
Current staff projections point to a real GDP growth of 0.7 percent in 2008 and 0.6
percent in 2009, reflecting less buoyant domestic and external demand, due to tightening
financing conditions, negative shocks on wealth, and the sharp deterioration in economic
agents’ confidence. As to the evolution in consumer prices, staff projections point to an
inflation rate of 3.2 percent in 2008 and 2.1 percent in 2009.

3. Fiscal Policy
The successful fiscal consolidation pursued since 2005 has been grounded in decisive
actions to reduce imbalances and enhance credibility. We agree with staff’s assessment
and also note that while euro area countries in general have also improved their fiscal
position over the past two years on the back of favorable cyclical conditions, the
improvement was largest in Portugal (in particular when analyzed in structural terms). We
also agree that fiscal accounts are now on a stronger footing to face the current more
difficult economic circumstances.
In mid-2005, the projections for 2005 pointed to a general government deficit of 6.2 percent
of GDP, and an expected government debt of 66.5 percent of GDP, after being above the 60
percent of GDP reference value already in 2003 and 2004, as revealed in the June 2005
update of the stability programme of Portugal. Based on these projections, in June 2005 the
Commission of the European Communities initiated the excessive deficit procedure (EDP)
for Portugal. In September 2005, the Council of the EU decided that Portugal was in
excessive deficit and addressed recommendations with a view to bringing the situation of an
excessive deficit to an end, by 2008 at the latest. In June 2008, the Council’s decision that
Portugal was in excessive deficit was abrogated, one year before the deadline.
The general government deficit declined significantly from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2005 to
3.9 percent of GDP in 2006, and to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007, therefore below the 3
percent of GDP reference value. During this consolidation process, there was one marginal
one-off operation (related to an extraordinary long-term concession contract for the
exploitation of a dam) worth 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007, that did not have any relevance in
the consolidation effort. The measures underlying the deficit reduction have been of a
permanent nature. The structural balance (the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and
other temporary measures) improved by some 2 p.p. of GDP in 2006, followed by a further
improvement by about 1 p.p. of GDP in 2007, thereby well beyond the fiscal efforts

5
recommended by the Council (defined as 1.5 percent of GDP in 2006 and of, at least, 0.75
percent of GDP in 2007).
Therefore, the government is enforcing its commitment to implement a fiscal policy
that addresses the structural causes of fiscal imbalances through permanent measures,
with ambitious results for the long-run and visible results in the short-run. The implemented
policies markedly reflected a restrictive stance, which has led to a steady increase in the
structural primary balance (3.2 p.p. of GDP in the past two years, according to Banco de
Portugal estimates). In 2007, for the first time after the decision to participate in the euro
area, fiscal policy was markedly restrictive in counter-cyclical terms, given that an improved
structural primary balance was parallel with above-trend real GDP growth. After analyzing
contributions of structural revenue and structural primary expenditure over the years when
fiscal policy was restrictive, it can be concluded that in 2002 the tighter fiscal policy stance
was due to increased revenue, while in 2006 and 2007 it resulted from both revenue and
expenditure (in the past two years as a whole, structural total revenue increased by 1.5 p.p. of
GDP and structural primary expenditure fell by 1.7 p.p. of GDP).
After the targets were surpassed — in two years, the general government deficit was lowered
3.5 p.p. of GDP (2.9 p.p. of GDP in structural terms) — the government decided in March
2008 to reduce marginally the standard VAT rate by 1 p.p. to 20 percent (effective on
July 1, 2008).
At the same time, the government decided to reduce the general government deficit
target for 2008 from 2.4 percent of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP. The deficit reduction
from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2008 represents a small reduction
in fiscal consolidation that has to be understood in the context of the present unfavorable
economic conditions.
Additionally, the government surgically targeted specific measures to address the
difficulties that the most vulnerable groups of the population are presently facing.
Concerning the sustainability of public finances, Portugal was among the Member States
with the highest expected increase in population ageing-related expenditure in the 2005-2050
period. Following the reforms of public pension systems in 2006, Portugal submitted to the
Ageing Working Group and the Economic Policy Committee updated pension expenditure
projections significantly revising the previous forecasts downwards. These projections were
approved in October 2007, leading to the reclassification of Portugal from a high-risk
country to a medium-risk country for the sustainability of public finances, and therefore
joining the classification of 11 other EU countries.
As quoted by staff in last year’s Article IV report, “good results only mean that we are …
able to reach the end of the path faster”. The Council’s excessive deficit procedure
abrogation decision one year before the deadline, and the reclassification of Portugal to
medium-risk country for the sustainability of its public finances, were two major steps,
“but there is still road ahead of us”. In the context of the global financial crisis and the
significant rise in world commodity prices, fiscal consolidation is now much harder.

6
A balanced and sustained budgetary position is instrumental for a macroeconomic stability
framework. Fiscal sustainability reduces uncertainty among economic agents. It creates a
stable and predictable fiscal framework, allowing for the full play of automatic stabilizers
and providing for a full response to structural trends with a fiscal impact, such as population
ageing and rising health expenditure. Reaffirming their revealed determination, the
Portuguese authorities are committed to proceed with the current consolidation process,
with the aim to achieve not only a wealthier future, but also a higher sustainable growth.

4. Structural Reforms: Labor Market, Productivity and Competitiveness
Until the early 2000s, the Portuguese labor market was characterized by lower
unemployment rates and stronger labor force participation than the EU average. But labor
market performance deteriorated after 2001. The effect of the economic slowdown in the
early 2000s was aggravated by the impact of the deep structural changes related to the
forces of globalization. Participation rates have remained relatively high, but the
unemployment rate continued to increase, reaching 8.0 percent in 2007, with long-term
unemployment rising to close to 50 percent (both indicators surpassing EU averages).
Nevertheless, after a decline in 2005, employment recovered in 2006 and 2007.
To cope with the constrains to productivity and competitiveness in the labor market, the
Portuguese authorities invited experts to produce a “White Book on Labor Relations”
in order to reevaluate the existing legal framework and to effectively propose changes to the
labor law, with the objective of i) promoting employment; ii) reducing the segmentation of
the labor market; and iii) ensuring mobility between different types of contracts and
activities. At the same time it aimed at i) providing some protection; ii) developing
adaptability of workers and firms; and iii) encouraging collective contracting. The White
Book was presented in end-2007, and a process of public and social partners’ discussion
followed its publication.
On June 26, 2008, the council of ministers approved a bill on the revision of the Labor Code.
The new Labor Code was approved by parliament on September 18, 2008 and will
come into force on January 1, 2009. A long path was followed during this process that
involved an intense public debate. The Portuguese authorities agree with staff that the new
Labor Code can be expected to facilitate internal flexibility for companies (including
working time), rationalize collective bargaining, encourage firm-level agreements, and
streamline procedures for dismissal. Therefore, it is expected that the new Labor Code will
improve the balance between flexibility and security, by introducing flexibility in the legal
framework, but also by strengthening the effective protection of workers and law
enforcement. Within this more flexible legal framework, the increase in the rate of social
security contributions on fixed-term contracts by three percentage points, financing a cut of
one percentage point for permanent contracts, will contribute to further reducing the relative
cost of permanent employment. The Portuguese authorities share staff’s view that structural
reforms have an important role to play in enhancing productivity and competitiveness. The
labor market reform is a major step that will be accompanied by a strengthening of
competition in domestic markets and by a judicial system reform. The new Labor Code
comes after the latest OECD economic survey on Portugal (on which the staff ground their
comparative analysis on employment protection legislation) and the latest World Bank Doing
Business report.

7
The range of analysis of the World Bank Doing Business Report, by its nature, does not
cover many advances implemented under the Technological Plan and the Simplex. The
Technological Plan is a strategy meant to promote development and to reinforce
productivity and competitiveness in Portugal, based on three axes: Knowledge (which
includes, among many other initiatives, (i) the New Opportunities initiative, that aims to
make the upper secondary level the minimum standard for the qualification of youth and
adults, and (ii) the generalization of the use and offer of broadband internet); Technology and
Innovation (which includes renewable energy, among many other pioneering programs). The
Simplex (Administrative and Legislative Administration Program) consists of a broad range
of measures to fight red tape, modernize public administration, and simplify the life of
citizens and the activity of business.
The availability and sophistication of Online Public Services should strengthen productivity
and competitiveness. Therefore, we are pleased to note that the latest report, disclosed by the
Commission, on Online Public Services Ranking, classifies Portugal as a “fast mover” in
terms of the improvement of online public services from 2006 to 2007. Among 31
countries (27 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey), Portugal
recorded the strongest improvement and is now placed in 3rd position (from the 10th position)
in the fully-online availability index, and 4th position (from the 11th position) in terms of
sophistication (citizen services stand at 84% and business services remarkably attain 100% in
this report’s evaluation). The advances made by Portugal in this ranking reflect the much
broader innovative initiatives in the scope of the strategy of the Technological Plan and in
particular of the Simplex.
The measures already implemented and to be implemented under the strategy of the
Technological Plan and the Simplex have an intrinsic structural nature. Therefore, despite
their recognized impact in the short-run, there will be, as they mature, an impact in the longrun in terms of productivity and competitiveness that needs to be fully assessed.
As to the public sector reform, a wide-ranging and in-depth reform is proceeding with
the objective of enhancing the quality and efficiency of public services, contributing to a
better allocation of resources in the economy and to strengthen public governance.
The main reform areas are human resources management and the reorganization of the public
services. The reforms in the human resources management include: (i) the reform of
contracts, careers and remuneration schemes; (ii) the reform of the services, management and
staff performance assessment systems; (iii) the introduction of an internal mobility scheme
(the mobility pool, which consists in a mechanism for the reassignment of civil servants to
other positions in the public sector, or to the private sector, thereby helping adjustments in
the public sector workforce); and (iv) the recruitment of one new civil servant for every two
leaving. In turn, the reforms in the reorganization of the public services have been
implemented under the Restructuring Programme for the State's Central Administration
(PRACE) and include: (i) the redesign of structures, roles and responsibilities of the public
services; and (ii) the introduction of shared services.
Regarding the external sector, particularly important is the evolution of external demand for
Portuguese goods and services, against the background of a sharp cooling of the EU
economy (which absorbs about 3/4 of total exports) and, in particular, of the Spanish economy
(the Portuguese largest export market which alone absorbs almost 1/3 of total exports). In this

8
area, in the last three years the evolution of exports has clearly confirmed a change, that
started in the beginning-2000s, in the structure of Portuguese exports, towards a higher
openness, product diversification, market diversification, and technological intensity.
This structural change, highlighted in the interesting Background Paper analysis, may reveal
itself as vital in strengthening productivity and competitiveness.
Diversification, namely in renewables, is also the long-term strategy of the Portuguese
authorities regarding energy supply, aiming at reducing external dependence on oil,
promoting economic growth based on new technologies and fighting climate change.
In this area of renewable energy and climate change, the Portuguese authorities reviewed in
2007 the former goals upwards. Portugal is advancing fast in this field, ranking the 5th
position in the EU in terms of electricity production through renewable sources.

5. Financial System
The financial services industry in Portugal is efficient, well-regulated, extremely
competitive and one of the most modern of all Portuguese business sectors. Despite the
difficult economic conditions in Portugal in recent years, banking activity has remained
strong, characterized by a continued expansion of credit. The banks' balance sheets
strengthened in 2006-07, reflecting a solid performance in Portuguese lending and financial
markets, as well as strong growth in activity abroad. Conditions grew more difficult after
mid-2007.
The financial turmoil that erupted in the beginning of the summer 2007 has caused
significant instability in the international financial system. Although Portuguese banks are
not directly exposed (to any significant degree) to the subprime market (or to those
financial intermediaries more exposed to it, among which are the largest global banks), its
implications for the international financial system are relevant for Portuguese banking
groups, as they are financially integrated at the global level, either through the
transaction of other financial instruments (for their own account or for the account of
customers), or through the way they access wholesale funding markets. Portuguese banks
are being affected by changes in global market sentiment. The strong increase in household
and corporate debt in recent years has been partially financed by securitization operations in
international financial markets. Much of this debt is denominated in euros, lowering
exchange rate risks. However, reduced liquidity in the debt securities markets will raise
Portuguese banks' financing costs.
The impact of the ongoing financial turmoil has become more evident in 2008, reflecting
not only the persistence and even some intensification of the turmoil in financial markets, but
also its gradual impact over economic activity.
In this adverse context, profitability observed a clear decline in the first half of 2008 on a
year-on-year basis. This decline was mainly driven by the decrease in income from financial
operations, in line with the adverse evolution of national and international stock markets. The
revaluation of assets has also implied increased provisioning and impairment charges.
The decline in the value of assets has also extended its effects to the capital adequacy of
the main institutions. However, capital adequacy ratios have posted mixed developments

9
among institutions. In fact, while some of the major banking groups undertook capital
increases through the issuance of common stock in the first half of 2008, providing
additional cushion in their TIER 1 capital adequacy ratios, some other banks, in the
overall context of rapid credit growth and unfavourable stock and debt market developments,
saw a decline in their capital ratios. Available information (still preliminary) points to a
decline of around 0.5 p.p. in the overall capital adequacy ratio, from 10.4 percent in
December 2007, while the TIER 1 ratio is estimated to have been stable at 7 percent.
Credit expansion was supported, to a significant extent, by the acceleration of retail
customer deposits. This acceleration has occurred in a context of rising financing costs in
wholesale funding markets and decreasing relative profitability of financial instruments in
the risk categories traditionally assessed as closer to bank deposits (money market funds,
cash funds and indexed bonds funds). The widespread rise in the interest rate of time deposits
reflected increased competition for attracting savings from the public (at the same time, there
were strong mutual fund and treasury savings certificates redemptions).
Non-performing loans (NPLs) to both households and non-financial corporations fell in
2007, reaching 1.7 percent and 1.4 percent of total loans respectively Although posting a
small increase in 2008, default indicators based on the outstanding amount of credit
overdue (and other non-performing loans) remained at very low levels, similar to those
recorded in the previous year.
Liquidity has also been assured via the issuance of debt, especially in May, when market
conditions eased somewhat, and with the recourse to the ECB monetary policy operations.
From the onset of the turmoil in financial markets, Banco de Portugal has maintained close
vigilance on the liquidity situation.
To conclude, the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercise, completed in 2006,
found that Portugal's financial system could "withstand even severe macroeconomic
disturbances".
