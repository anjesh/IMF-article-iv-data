IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Lithuania

On May 28, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Lithuania, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.2
Growth has remained resilient, despite challenges in the external environment. Strong domestic
demand growth on the back of improving labor market conditions underpinned real GDP growth
of 2.9 percent in 2014. Exports held up reasonably well despite Russian import bans and the
incipient recession in the CIS, reflecting a successful diversification drive into new markets and
generally strong competitiveness. External factors were responsible for annual inflation of just
0.2 percent, with 12-month inflation rates dipping into negative territory toward year end.
Growth should remain largely unchanged at 2.8 percent from last year in 2015, as positive
external factors counterbalance negative ones and domestic demand remains robust. The
economic recovery in the euro area and low energy prices are major boons, but the deepening
recession in the CIS and geopolitical uncertainty will hold back growth of exports and
investment. Risks are moderately tilted to the downside, with deepening geopolitical tensions the
main concern, although the effect of lower energy prices could surprise on the upside. Inflation
will turn positive again, but average below zero for the year as a whole.
The main policy challenge will be to secure reasonably rapid convergence with living standards
in Western Europe going forward. With macoreconomic stability and strong policy frameworks
in place, the onus is mainly on structural reforms: fiscal structural reforms to lift spending
efficiency and shift the tax burden away from labor; investment and innovation promotion

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

through use of EU funds and better focused policies; and making the most of demographically
shrinking labor resources through education reform and a modernization of the labor code.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania, Executive
Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Strong economic fundamentals and recent resilience to adverse external factors bode well for the
near-term economic outlook. Legacies from the 2008/09 crisis have been largely worked off,
with external and internal balance in place, strong public finances, private-sector balance sheets
generally healthy, and policy frameworks strengthened in the context of euro adoption. Good
economic performance despite adverse events in the CIS once again underscores the resilience
and flexibility of the Lithuanian economy. Risks have moderated but remain tilted to the
downside and relate mostly to external factors.
Over the medium term, convergence with living standards in Western Europe will depend
critically on advancing the structural reform agenda. Investment needs to increase back to
historical norms, labor resources should to be better utilized to mitigate the drag from worsening
demographics, and more innovation is required in support of moving up the value chain and
remaining competitive as wages converge toward EU levels. Contingent on such reforms, growth
could rise to 3¾ percent over time.
Fiscal consolidation is almost complete but past gains need to be preserved to build more fiscal
space over time. Public finances overperformed last year, but it will take measures of 0.4 percent
of GDP to keep the fiscal deficit from deteriorating this year. The implied neutral stance is the
minimum required under the SGP and broadly appropriate for Lithuania, considering the still
slightly negative output gap. Moderate further consolidation of 0.3 percent of GDP next year
would deliver the staff-recommended target for the fiscal structural balance of -0.5 percent of
GDP, ensuring a steady but gradual decline of the public debt ratio over time, thereby regaining
fiscal space needed to be prepared for future adverse shocks.
Fiscal structural reforms could usefully defuse future spending pressures, raise spending quality,
and improve tax efficiency. Wealth taxes and tax administration should be strengthened to create
room for lightening the labor tax burden, spending programs with subpar results should be
reformed, and areas subject to likely future spending pressures should proactively be tackled.
Formulating a coherent fiscal structural reform strategy could catalyze progress.
The stability of the largely Nordic-owned banking system has further strengthened, with
increased capitalization, lower NPLs, high liquidity, and adequate profitability. Access to ECB
liquidity and SSM participation are newly gained additional safeguards. But supervisors need to
persevere with efforts to strengthen some smaller domestic banks and credit unions with higher

3
risk profiles and lower capitalization. Plans to fundamentally reform the credit union sector are
welcome.
More private sector investment and innovation are needed to securely underpin continued
income convergence. The lack of rebound in private investment after the 2008/09 crisis, still
sluggish credit developments, and relatively poor innovation performance need to be addressed.
Efforts to utilize EU funds and resources under the “Juncker Plan” are welcome, especially to the
extent that they benefit SMEs, which have a hard time securing financing from risk averse banks.
The effectiveness of innovation policies would benefit from reducing fragmentation in the
current setup. An improved outlook for the availability of qualified labor would spur investment
and innovation indirectly.
Making the best possible use of available labor resources in the face of adverse demographics is
of paramount importance. Proposals for reforming the labor code are an opportunity to
modernize labor relations and improve labor utilization. Education reform is of the essence to
equip the labor force with a skill mix that better matches companies’ needs.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook. Lithuania’s economic comeback over the past five years has been
impressive. Real GDP has surpassed its previous peak and external and internal
imbalances have been corrected. Euro adoption in January went smoothly and came
with important upgrades to policy frameworks. Financial stability has increased further.
Resilient growth in the face of recent external challenges speaks to Lithuania’s strong
economic fundamentals and augurs well for the future, but risks in the external
environment persist.
Key policy issues. The Article IV discussions focused on policies to support the next
chapter of convergence with living standards in Western Europe and to ensure
continued stability in the face of population ageing and wage convergence with the EU.


Fiscal policy. Repair of public finances has come a long way, but there is a need for
some further consolidation to build fiscal space. Structural reforms to defuse
spending pressures, raise spending quality, and reduce the tax burden on labor are
also called for. The authorities should take corrective measure this year to avoid
backsliding, target a structural fiscal balance of -0.5 percent of GDP from 2016
onward to put the public debt ratio on a downward trajectory, and articulate a
strategy for fiscal structural reform.



Investment and innovation. Both need to be stepped up. Plans to frontload and
better leverage EU structural funds and tap resources under the “Juncker Plan” are
welcome, especially to the extent they benefit SMEs. Fragmentation in innovation
policies should be addressed. Investment will also depend on structural reforms, in
particular measures that unlock labor resources and attract foreign investors.



Labor resources and structural reform. With one of the most challenging
demographic profiles in Europe, Lithuania needs to make the most of available labor
resources. The labor market is rather flexible in practice, but the rigid and poorly
applied labor code should be modernized, mismatches between skills taught by the
education system and those sought by the labor market need to be addressed, and
budget-neutral alternatives to currently high labor taxation should be actively
considered.

CONTEXT
1.
With euro adoption in January, Lithuania turned the page on the period of adjustment
that followed the 2008/09 crisis. Growth was among the strongest in Europe in recent years,
lifting real GDP above its previous peak and bringing per-capita income to 73 percent of the EU
average (in PPP terms). Internal and external imbalances have corrected, with unemployment below
its historical average and the current account in slight surplus. Households’ and companies’ balance
sheets are generally healthy; the loan-to-deposit ratio of the banking system has fallen well below
100 percent; and fiscal consolidation reduced the deficit to the debt-ratio stabilizing level. Euro
adoption strengthened financial stability by securing access to ECB liquidity. It also came with
important upgrades to policy frameworks, such as new fiscal rules, a fully fledged macroprudential
toolkit, and banking supervision under the SSM. Overall, legacies from the boom-bust cycle are
largely confined to the jump in public debt from some 15 to 40 percent of GDP and still subdued
credit and investment.

2.
The main policy challenge for Lithuania now is to successfully write the next chapter of
convergence with living standards in Western Europe. This requires maintaining stability, notably
securing fiscal space to deal with future downturns and spending pressures, and safeguarding the
strong external position as wages converge and growth of domestic demand outstrips that of
foreign demand. But more is needed to fulfill Lithuania’s aspirations: only higher investment, more
innovation, and structural reforms to make the most of demographically declining labor resources
can underwrite sustained and rapid economic growth.
3.
Far-reaching proposals for a new social model were tabled in March, ahead of general
elections next fall. Since taking office in late 2012, the left-leaning coalition government led by the
Social Democrats accomplished euro adoption, further advanced fiscal consolidation through
expenditure restraint, and continued with energy sector reform, including diversifying gas supplies
with the opening of Lithuania’s LNG terminal in late 2014. Geopolitical tensions surrounding the
situation in Ukraine prompted the reintroduction of the draft and a phased doubling of defense
spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2020. Apart from defense issues, the policy focus is on completing
other projects to diversify energy supplies, fighting the shadow economy, and helping firms open

new export markets to substitute for losses in the CIS. In March, the government unveiled for
general consultation a reform package dubbed the “new social model” that proposes a new labor
code, pension reform, and adjustments to social benefits and employment support programs.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth remained resilient despite a challenging external environment. Solid growth of
2.9 percent in 2014 was mostly driven by domestic demand, as robust wage growth and generally
improving labor market conditions spurred consumption. Unemployment fell to 9.6 percent in the
second semester of 2014—the lowest since the crisis—and vacancy rates rose. Investment picked up
strongly in early 2014 from post-crisis lows amid high capacity utilization, but slowed sharply again
in the second half of the year as Russian import bans and the incipient Russian recession weighed
on business confidence. Despite the difficult external environment, exports have held up reasonably
well so far, reflecting in part a successful diversification drive into new markets.

5.
Inflation averaged a mere 0.2 percent in 2014 and has been negative since December,
reflecting mostly external factors. Falling global energy prices and a 20 percent discount on
natural gas imports from Gazprom drove energy price inflation deeply into negative territory.
Imported deflation and falling world food prices also pulled down prices. Core inflation has been
below 2 percent for the last two years, but currently runs some 50 bps higher than in the euro area,
due to relatively fast-growing purely domestic price components, such as services, and is broadly in
line with historical patterns.1 The risk of debt deflation dynamics taking hold in Lithuania is remote,

External stability strengthened further with euro adoption. For the second year running,
the current account recorded a surplus, reducing the external debt ratio and improving the
international investment position. The trade balance worsened in 2014, reflecting an uptick in import
growth on the back of strong domestic demand. But goods exports excluding oil grew at a robust
6.5 percent and strength in the income balance contained the erosion of the current account
surplus. The external balance assessment estimates that Lithuania’s current account and exchange
rate are broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1). Euro adoption removed a critical vulnerability
previously associated the low reserve coverage under the currency board arrangement.

approved and will apply from next year’s budget onward. Several rating agencies upgraded
Lithuania’s sovereign rating in the context of euro adoption.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
The current account is balanced. External adjustment from current account deficits as large as 15 percent
of GDP during the 2003–08 boom was primarily driven by export growth, rather than import compression,
suggesting that it will be more easily sustained. Staff projects a gradual and moderate deterioration of the
small 2014 current account surplus to a deficit of about 2 percent of GDP by 2020, as still subdued
investment makes a fuller recovery and income convergence buoys consumption. It would be mostly
financed by FDI.
The REER is broadly aligned with fundamentals. According to the EBA-lite methodology, the external
position is currently appreciably better that the “norm” derived from fundamentals, but results need to be
interpreted with caution. The EBA-lite approach does not capture well the pronounced boom-bust cycle that
Lithuania and emerging Europe went through in the past decade. For example, because EBA-lite does not
use backward-looking explanatory variables it makes no allowance for the fact that investment has been
subdued for some time in the aftermath of the bust, to compensate for the excesses of the boom.
Recovering investment should eventually weaken the current account even without much exchange rate
adjustment. While staff also sees the current account in deficit in the medium term, the current account norm
suggested by EBA-lite of -4.8 percent of GDP is on the high side—it would put external debt on an
unsustainable path. Alternative exchange rate

Gross external debt has come down significantly in recent years and now stands at 67 percent of GDP.
Standard tests suggest that it would remain sustainable under a variety of adverse shocks (Figure 1A). Just
over half of external debt is owed by the public sector, of which less than half in turn is denominated in
currencies other than euros. Private external debt mostly consists of debt to parent banks or companies
based abroad and should therefore not be at risk of disruptive withdrawal. The IIP stands at -44 percent of
GDP, reflecting mainly the excess of inward over outward FDI and funding by parent banks of their
Lithuanian affiliates.

8.
Lithuania’s largely Nordic-owned financial system has further strengthened, but a
revival of credit remains pending. The CAR rose to 21.3 percent, the NPL ratio declined to
6.5 percent, and strong deposit growth continues, buoying the liquidity ratio, reducing loan-todeposit ratios to 90.6 percent, and easing net liabilities to parent banks to 11 percent of GDP. The
three largest banks easily passed the ECB’s asset quality review and EBA stress tests. Financial sector
profitability has been satisfactory in recent years, but performance varies across financial institutions.
Supervisors are working closely with some smaller banks and the credit union sector (2½ percent of
system assets) to guard against excessive risk taking and ensure sufficient capitalization, especially
as the CAR rises to 10.5 percent this July following CRD IV transposition. Fundamental reform of the
credit union sector along the lines suggested by the Bank of Lithuania is progressing with the
proposal now under discussion in parliament. Supervisory coordination among Lithuanian, Nordic,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

and European agencies is transitioning to the new setup under the SSM. While mortgage lending
picked up ahead of euro adoption, corporate borrowing continues to contract. Overall private sector
credit declined by 1.1 percent in 2014, amid subdued credit demand and credit standards that
remain demanding, despite gradual loosening since 2012. Housing and equity valuations started
improving from 2012, appreciating at annual average rates of 7 and 16 percent, but remaining
around 35 and 20 percent below the peak levels reached at the height of the boom.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Past resilience augurs well for growth in 2015. Growth is projected at 2.8 percent, broadly
unchanged from last year and led by domestic demand. Consumption will be underpinned by stillsolid wage growth and lower energy prices, while external uncertainties will likely dampen
investment. On the external front, improving prospects for the euro area and continuing efforts to
diversify exports should largely counterbalance the negative drag from the recession in Russia and
the CIS. Consumer price inflation is projected to average -0.3 percent on account of low energy and
import prices. Lithuania will benefit from the ECB’s QE program mostly indirectly through its effect
on euro area activity and prices—eligible and available Lithuanian government securities amount to
only a small fraction of the asset purchases apportioned to the Bank of Lithuania under the program
and banks’ lending policies are unlikely to materially change in the wake of declining sovereign
yields.
10.
Growth is expected to pick up to 3.2 percent in 2016 and to about 3¾ percent over the
medium term, although this remains contingent on underpinning policy reforms. In the nearer
term, a gradually improving external environment would be the main driver and the small output
gap of currently -0.2 percent of GDP would close in 2017. For the medium term, potential growth
has been estimated at 3¾ percent for the post-boom-bust period, compared to actual average
annual growth of 4.4 percent during 1995–2014 (IMF Country Report No. 11/320). But attaining this
growth rate will require structural reforms, especially those that lift investment back to historical
norms, support employment to counteract worsening demographics, and boost innovation to
alleviate slowing productivity growth as Lithuania’s income gap with Western Europe narrows. Rising
investment and income catching-up would push the current account into moderate deficit, which
should be largely financed by FDI. Inflation is projected to pick up as the euro area moves out of
deflation and should run at about 2½ percent in the medium term—slightly higher than in the euro
area and in line with Lithuania’s historical record and the Balassa-Samuelson prediction for catchingup economies.
11.
Risks have moderated but remain tilted to the downside and relate mostly to external
factors. Lithuania is a small and highly open economy, with exports corresponding to 80 percent of
GDP. Trade with the EU dominates, but Lithuania is also an important gateway for trade with Russia
and the CIS. A protracted period of slower growth in either set of trading partners would affect
Lithuania through trade channels with knock-on effects on investment. Geopolitical tensions
surrounding the situation in Ukraine could have stronger effects on confidence and investment than
in the baseline if they became entrenched or escalated further. A surge in global financial volatility

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

may affect Nordic parent banks, which remain reliant on external funding and face domestic
vulnerabilities, and could spill over to their Lithuanian affiliates. Insufficient investment and
upgrading by Lithuanian companies could undermine medium-term growth prospects. On the
upside, the boost to consumption from lower energy prices could be larger than assumed in the
baseline.
12.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on outlook and risks. The Bank of
Lithuania’s growth projections are similar to those by staff while the Ministry of Finance sees upside
potential to its somewhat more conservative baseline. Both assessed underlying fundamentals as
strong, with the outlook mainly clouded by external uncertainty, although successful export
diversification and upgrading in companies remained essential for prospects going forward. They
saw little upside risk from low energy prices to their baselines, but some mentioned good
absorption of EU structural funds and resources under the “Juncker Plan” as potential boons. Slow
growth in trading partners and a further escalation of geopolitical tensions were highlighted as the
main downside risks, with the latter also effecting the economy through the need to raise defense
spending. Regarding global financial volatility and spillovers from Nordic cross-border banks, the
authorities emphasized mitigating factors: limited reliance of Lithuanian subsidiaries on parent bank
funding, strong home-country sovereigns, and access to ECB liquidity. Official inflation projections
are close to those by staff and the authorities also assess risks of entrenched deflation as low,
pointing to robust wage growth and the limited role that price developments have played in postcrisis wage bargaining.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With euro adoption accomplished and supporting frameworks largely in place, discussions focused on
policies to support the next chapter of convergence with living standards in Western Europe, to thrive
in the currency union, and to ensure continued stability in the face of population aging and wage
convergence with the EU. This will require some further budget consolidation and structural reform to
secure fiscal space and address future spending pressure; a boost to investment and innovation; and
structural reforms to make the most of shrinking labor resources. The authorities are open to Fund
policy advice and have implemented many past recommendations (Box 2).
Box 2. Implementation of Past Fund Advice


Fiscal Policy. The Fund’s past advice has focused on public finance repair, putting in place
countercyclical fiscal rules, and shifting from an expenditure-based consolidation toward more
reliance on revenues, especially recurrent wealth taxes. Much consolidation has taken place and fiscal
rules were strengthened in the context of euro adoption, but wealth taxes remain under discussion.



Financial Sector Policy. The authorities have forcefully addressed weaknesses in smaller financial
institutions—two domestic banks were intervened in 2011 and 2013—and supervision has tightened
considerably for credit unions. The Bank of Lithuania has been given wide macroprudential powers, in
line with past policy advice.



Other Issues. Infrastructure projects in the transport and energy sectors are ongoing, with a welcome
focus on more regional integration, along with continued governance improvements in the sectors’
SOEs. Addressing the causes of high structural unemployment through training and tax reforms
remains outstanding, but discussions started on modernizing the labor code and reforming
employment support under the “new social model.”

A. Securing Fiscal Space and Raising Public Sector Efficiency
13.
Lithuania needs ample fiscal space. Low fiscal deficits and debt would allow the authorities
to let automatic stabilizers operate freely in downturns, smooth the business cycle, and avoid
disruptions. In fact, business-cycle fluctuations have been among the largest in the EU, with
Lithuania’s small open economy highly exposed to volatility in trading partners and lacking an
independent monetary policy to cushion downturns. Low public debt would also provide a valuable
buffer against future fiscal costs of aging, which are estimated to add 3.4 percent of GDP annually to
public spending by 2050. Determined fiscal consolidation since 2009 has now arrested the rapid rise
in the public debt ratio, but some further sustained deficit reduction is recommended to put debt
firmly on a downward trajectory and avoid a pattern of rising debt ratios in bad times and merely
stabilizing debt ratios in good times. Staff suggested targeting a fiscal (structural) balance of
-0.5 percent of GDP, which would reduce the debt ratio by a cumulative 5 percent of GDP over the
next five years (as opposed to just 1 percent of GDP in the absence of further consolidation).

and a structural balance of -0.5 percent of GDP in all subsequent years.

14.
For 2015, a neutral fiscal position is broadly appropriate. An unchanged structural fiscal
balance this year is sufficient to keep the schedule for structural deficit targets on track because of
last year’s fiscal overperformance. The implied neutral stance is the minimum required under the
SGP, broadly appropriate for Lithuania considering the still slightly negative output gap, and in line
with the Fund’s euro area wide fiscal advice. Nonetheless, measures of 0.4 percent of GDP are
required to avoid fiscal backsliding, because spending plans and revenue policies in the budget
were drawn up based on more favorable macroeconomic assumptions than are projected now.
Paring back discretionary spending in line with lower inflation could make a limited contribution.
Expanding wealth taxation should be considered, as previously recommended by the Fund.
Untargeted expenditure cuts would clearly be a second best option.
15.
Beyond this year, limited further consolidation is recommended, but various pressures
on public finances will need to be addressed. If the structural balances is kept constant this year,
additional moderate consolidation of 0.3 percent of GDP would be sufficient to reach the
recommended target structural balance of -0.5 percent of GDP in 2016. Nonetheless, fiscal policy
makers will face challenges: expenditure compression undertaken since 2009 could start to unwind,
rising incomes will lead to additional demands on the public sector, and higher defense expenditure
is already committed. In the longer run, aging-related fiscal costs will escalate.
16.
A fiscal structural reform plan could provide useful strategic direction for tackling
pressures and help improve public sector efficiency more generally. Lithuania’s expenditure and
revenue ratios are the lowest in the EU, labor taxation is high, the demographic outlook is among
the most challenging in Europe, and results of public spending programs have disappointed in
several areas. Fiscal structural reform should therefore focus on six priorities:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA



Developing underutilized tax bases. Wealth taxes, such as real estate taxes or car taxes,
currently yield little revenue or do not exist, yet are less distortive than other taxes.3 Energy
excises are also low by European standards.



Strengthening tax administration. Tax administration reforms have improved excise
collections, but there is little evidence that the VAT compliance gap has narrowed since the EC
calculated it as one of the largest in the EU in 2011.4



Reducing the tax burden on labor. As revenues from other taxes improve, labor taxes should
be cut to support job creation and to reduce incentives to work in the black economy or remain
inactive.5



Reducing spending inefficiencies. An IMF staff review of public expenditure found numerous
areas where spending deviates from EU benchmarks and outcomes are subpar (Box 3). One
source of inefficiency is oversized infrastructure in education and relatively high government
employment. In the longer run the size of the public sector should also be linked to the
declining population.



Reforming pensions. Old-age pensions need to be made fiscally and socially sustainable,
primarily by linking the statutory retirement age to longevity. Excessive recourse to disability
pensions needs to be addressed through tighter enforcement of eligibility restrictions.



Better monitoring local government finances. Local government finances were responsible
for negative surprises in 2013, although they improved in 2014 in most municipalities. A recent
IMF technical assistance mission highlighted the need for better monitoring and forecasting,
along with a stronger legal framework.

3

For a discussion of Lithuania’s tax system compared with EU peers, see Country Report No. 13/82.

4

In 2011, the EC estimated Lithuania’s VAT compliance gap at 4.4 percent of GDP, compared to 3 percent of GDP for
emerging Europe on average and 1.9 percent of GDP for Estonia. Since then, VAT receipts have grown by 11 percent
and the VAT base by 18 percent, suggesting that the gap has widened further.

Box 3. From Expenditure Consolidation to Expenditure Efficiency

Years of spending restraint have left Lithuania with the EU’s lowest spending-to-GDP ratio. Extensive
crisis-induced spending cuts successfully brought Lithuania’s public finances under control, but spending
quality may have suffered. Moreover, pressures are likely to emerge going forward as demands on the
public services increase with rising incomes and as the population ages.
IMF staff’s review of public expenditure seeks to identify areas where spending efficiency and
sustainability can be improved. The analysis benchmarks spending in Lithuania against that in other
European countries, adjusted for differences in per-capita income. It considers levels and composition of
public expenditure according to economic and functional classifications. It also relates them to outcomes to
get a sense of spending quality.
The main findings are as follows:


First, Lithuania’s spending level and spending structure differ widely from EU benchmarks.
Benchmarking a cross-classification of functional and economic categories shows that relative
under-spending is widespread. It is most pronounced in outlays for goods and services (except for
education) and social protection spending (driven by low old-age pensions). But there are also areas
where spending exceeds that of EU peers, prominently in education, health sector wages, and
sickness and disability benefits.



Second, public services can be improved by prioritizing quality over quantity in the wage bill.
Although the public wage bill as a share of GDP is similar to the EU benchmark, public employment
levels are relatively high and average public sector wages relatively low, which raises questions
about the public sector’s ability to attract and retain qualified staff. Linking reform of public
employment to future wage increases could help improve efficiency and contain pressures on the
wage bill.



Third, social spending may be unsustainably low. Social spending below the EU benchmark likely
contributes to Lithuania’s high income inequality. Low old-age pensions may create spending
pressures as the population ages. Sustainability of the pension system can be improved and
inequality alleviated through parametric reforms (such as increasing the retirement age), better
targeting of non-pension spending (such as increased use of means-testing of social assistance),
reducing high spending areas (such as disability benefits), and raising gross pensions but subjecting
them to more progressive income taxation.



Fourth, education outcomes are below par despite high spending. Data point to low and
declining student-teacher ratios and class sizes, poorly targeted financing, and mismatches between
fields of study in tertiary education and labor market needs. Rationalizing resources according to
the number of students served could help reduce spending and improve quality over time,
including through school consolidation and a gradual reduction in the number of teachers.



Fifth, health outcomes are poor despite public-sector health spending comparable to the EU
benchmark. Moreover, population aging is set to exert spending pressures. These could be
alleviated by strengthening the role of preventive and primary health care and reducing spending
on far more expensive tertiary care.

17.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s recommendations. They are committed to
avoiding a widening of the fiscal deficit in 2015, but count on tax administration improvements and
budget underexecution rather than tax increases to achieve it. Their fiscal policy will be guided by
national and European rules for the MTO, which should result in a reduction of the public debt ratio
similar to the one advocated by staff. They welcomed the idea of a strategy for fiscal structural
reform as a roadmap for policy decisions, but noted that strengthening wealth taxation remained
politically difficult. They found staff’s review of public expenditure very helpful in identifying areas
for reform and agreed with the urgency of addressing inefficiencies in education and health. Savings
associated with the recent decentralization of social assistance to municipalities demonstrated the
large scope for efficiency gains in public spending programs.

outlook may also make potential investors cautious.
19.
Government support for SME investment is welcome. Access to financing is currently not
a generalized binding constraint for investment, according to surveys and discussions with banks
and company representatives. But with banks very much focused on low risk and established clients,
SMEs find it more difficult than usual to obtain bank financing—19 percent of SMEs reported access
to financing as their most pressing problem, compared to 13 percent in the EU as a whole. The
government will again use EU structural funds to facilitate and leverage SME financing, relying on a
variety of financial instruments, such as loans, guarantees, and venture funds. These support
programs have had a good track record so far, but continued care is needed to ensure that genuine
market failures are addressed and support for unviable businesses is avoided.
20.
Prefinancing of projects under the 2014–20 EU financial framework and the “Juncker
Plan” could provide a useful jolt to investment this year and next. The authorities have
undertaken to prefinance from national sources projects likely to receive EU support under the
2014–20 framework later on. This helps advance EU-supported private and public investment into
2015, ahead of the new framework coming fully on stream. The authorities are also preparing to
secure resources for investment under the EU-wide “Juncker Plan” when it becomes operational later
this year. A modern public-private-partnership framework is in place to carry out infrastructure

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

investment projects under the “Juncker Plan,” although it is not yet integrated into the budget cycle
and has so far been utilized only for a handful of projects.
21.
To remain competitive globally, Lithuanian businesses need to continue to innovate
and modernize, and a more unified policy approach could help in this regard. Innovation
broadly defined as the introduction of new or significantly improved products, processes, marketing
methods, or organizational practices is key for the Lithuanian economy to narrow the income gap
with Western Europe. But according to the European Commission’s innovation scorecard, Lithuania
is only a moderate innovator and trails particularly in the critical category of innovation outcomes.
Lithuania’s new “smart specialization strategy” aims to focus innovation promotion on promising
areas. But more attention needs to be paid to overcoming fragmentation between ministries,
numerous implementation agencies, and various advisory bodies, which can lead to duplication of
efforts and infrastructure, undermine critical mass, and complicate decision making.
22.
Prospects for investment and innovation will also depend on sustainable wage
developments and structural reforms to keep the business environment attractive. While wage
growth has under or overshot productivity gains at
times, Lithuania has a favorable track record of
sustainable wage developments: gaps between
wage and productivity developments tend to selfcorrect over time and Lithuania’s labor share of
income is in line with fundamentals (Box 4). Rapid
wage growth in the past two years reflects
catching-up with faster productivity growth in the
preceding crisis years—a process that has largely
run its course by now, meaning that wage growth
is likely to slow to a pace more consistent with that
of productivity going forward. Regarding structural
reforms, the focus should be on making the most of shrinking labor resources so that investment
and innovation are not hampered by the lack of suitable staff (see below).
23.
The authorities saw EU structural funds and “Juncker Plan” resources as the main
available avenues to support investment in the short run. They agreed that productivity growth
supported by investment and innovation was critical for the next stage of income convergence.
Diminished business opportunities in Russia and the CIS currently weighed on investment, but high
capacity utilization was a potential upside to the investment outlook. They doubted that QE or
substituting capital market for bank financing of large firms would spur investment through
portfolio rebalancing effects, i.e., entice banks to finance riskier projects. This left deploying EU
resources in support of investment as the main policy lever, as the EU 2014–20 financial framework
comes fully on stream in the next 12 months. They agreed that wages in Lithuania remained
competitive and should not hold back investment. There could be somewhat more room for wages
to catch up with past productivity gains than estimated by staff.

The large mismatch between the skills provided by Lithuania’s education system and
those sought in the labor market needs to be resolved. Tertiary enrollment rates are very high—
over 50 percent compared to an EU average of 37 percent—while vocational training is
underdeveloped and overly school-based. Recent legislative changes to roll out apprenticeship
programs more widely are encouraging, but following through with the necessary regulations and
implementation will be essential. Within tertiary education, there is a bias toward studying social
sciences, law, and business administration—they account for 44 percent of graduates compared to
37 percent for the EU on average. As a result, occupational mismatch is high, with 31 percent of
workers occupied in a field other than that of their study, compared to 23 percent for the EU on
average. It will be important to address overcapacity in tertiary education, which is set to grow
further with the decline in the student-age population, improve students’ information about job
market opportunities, and review financial incentives and quality standards for educational
institutions.

26.
The proposed new labor code could modernize labor relations and improve labor
utilization. Lithuania’s labor market is generally flexible, but the current code is outdated, rigid, and
poorly applied. Concrete proposals for a new code in the context of the “new social model” are
welcome. Proposed reforms envisage more realistic rules for overtime, notice periods, and severance
pay that would remove key obstacles for foreign investors, thereby fostering the creation of
relatively well-paying jobs and mitigating emigration pressures. Domestic firms would have fewer
incentives for informality, with productivity benefiting. Modern rules for part-time employment and
job sharing under consideration could increase labor force participation. Explicit provisions
regarding training, along with more cooperative labor relations through improved wage
transparency, dispute resolution, and labor representation in companies, should also help raise labor
productivity.
27.
Reforms of pensions and labor taxation could also support better labor utilization, but
need to be carefully planned and costed. Further increases of the statutory retirement age, once
the ongoing raise to 65 years for men and women is fully phased in by 2026, could make a
significant difference, especially if control over disability pensions is simultaneously strengthened.
Cuts to labor taxes would improve incentives to work, help overcome benefit traps, and reduce
informality. The “new social model” contains proposals in these regards that should be further
developed, to ensure optimal design, long-term fiscal and social sustainability, and budgetary
affordability.
28.
In other structural reforms, further improvement of public enterprise governance is
welcome. Cost effectiveness in Lithuania’s public enterprises is important, considering these entities’
key role in large infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector. Good progress has been
made with the prerequisite governance and transparency arrangements: representation of
independent directors on boards has now reached at least one third in all large limited liability SOEs;
accounting has been separated between commercial activities and public service obligations; and
recent legislation extends requirements for independent directors to other large state entities and
municipal enterprises. However, SOE return on equity has not changed much since 2013 and at
2½ percent remains below the government’s 5 percent target.
29.
The authorities appreciated the mission drawing attention to challenges related to
labor resources. Important steps in reforming vocational training had already been taken and
reform of higher education, including changes to university financing, is under discussion. However,
reforms in these areas were complex and had far-reaching implication for various stakeholders.
Regarding the “new social model,” the government had decided to release the proposals developed
by the expert group commissioned by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs for general
consultation, with the labor code now debated in the tripartite counsel comprising labor unions, the
government, and employer organizations.

Box 4. Wages and Productivity1
In Lithuania, wages and productivity tend to grow broadly in tandem, suggesting that wage
determination works well and developments are sustainable. Wages and productivity should co-move

Analysis of the labor share of income confirms the
long-run alignment of wage and productivity developments and the self-correction of transitory
deviations. The labor share of income can be interpreted as the ratio of real wages to real productivity.
Lithuania’s labor share of income of less than 40 percent of GDP may appear low at first, but a fixed-effects
cross-country panel regression finds that it is in line with fundamentals, such as per-capita GDP, the share
of the manufacturing sector, and the tax structure. The analysis also shows that Lithuania’s labor share of
income somewhat exceeded its fundamental value in the boom period, overcorrected in the subsequent
bust, and has since been gravitating back to the level suggested by fundamentals.

The key to solid wage growth lies in productivity growth, which in turn can be boosted by
innovation. With wage determination working well and reflecting fundamentals there is no need for policy
intervention—one-size-fits-all wage policies could even be counterproductive considering the large
heterogeneity of productivity across sectors and firms. Policies to foster innovation are the more promising
path to better wages. Cross-country firm-level data collected in the EBRD’s Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) shows that more innovation is associated with higher productivity.
And higher productivity should result in higher wages over time.

Strong economic fundamentals and recent resilience to adverse external factors bode
well for the near-term economic outlook. Legacies from the 2008/09 crisis have been largely
worked off, with external and internal balance in place, strong public finances, private-sector balance
sheets generally healthy, and policy frameworks strengthened in the context of euro adoption. Good
economic performance despite adverse events in the CIS once again underscores the resilience and
flexibility of the Lithuanian economy. Risks have moderated but remain tilted to the downside and
relate mostly to external factors.
31.
Over the medium term, convergence with living standards in Western Europe will
depend critically on advancing the structural reform agenda. Investment needs to increase back
to historical norms, labor resources should to be better utilized to mitigate the drag from worsening
demographics, and more innovation is required in support of moving up the value chain and
remaining competitive as wages converge toward EU levels. Contingent on such reforms, growth
could rise to 3¾ percent over time.
32.
Fiscal consolidation is almost complete but past gains need to be preserved to build
more fiscal space over time. Public finances overperformed last year, but it will take measures of
0.4 percent of GDP to keep the fiscal deficit from deteriorating this year. The implied neutral stance
is the minimum required under the SGP and broadly appropriate for Lithuania, considering the still
slightly negative output gap. Moderate further consolidation of 0.3 percent of GDP next year would
deliver the staff-recommended target for the fiscal structural balance of -0.5 percent of GDP,
ensuring a steady but gradual decline of the public debt ratio over time, thereby regaining fiscal
space needed to be prepared for future adverse shocks.
33.
Fiscal structural reforms could usefully defuse future spending pressures, raise
spending quality, and improve tax efficiency. Wealth taxes and tax administration should be
strengthened to create room for lightening the labor tax burden, spending programs with subpar
results should be reformed, and areas subject to likely future spending pressures should proactively
be tackled. Formulating a coherent fiscal structural reform strategy could catalyze progress.
34.
The stability of the largely Nordic-owned banking system has further strengthened,
with increased capitalization, lower NPLs, high liquidity, and adequate profitability. Access to
ECB liquidity and SSM participation are newly gained additional safeguards. But supervisors need to
persevere with efforts to strengthen some smaller domestic banks and credit unions with higher risk
profiles and lower capitalization. Plans to fundamentally reform the credit union sector are welcome.
35.
More private sector investment and innovation are needed to securely underpin
continued income convergence. The lack of rebound in private investment after the 2008/09 crisis,
still sluggish credit developments, and relatively poor innovation performance need to be
addressed. Efforts to utilize EU funds and resources under the “Juncker Plan” are welcome, especially
to the extent they benefit SMEs, which have a hard time securing financing from risk averse banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

The effectiveness of innovation policies would benefit from reducing fragmentation in the current
setup. An improved outlook for the availability of qualified labor would spur investment and
innovation indirectly.
36.
Making the best possible use of available labor resources in the face of adverse
demographics is of paramount importance. Proposals for reforming the labor code are an
opportunity to modernize labor relations and improve labor utilization. Education reform is of the
essence to equip the labor force with a skill mix that better matches companies’ needs.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle.

1/ Excluding foreign bank branches.
2/ Total profits (losses) after tax. Interim quarterly results are annualised.
3/ From end-2005 to Q1-2008, NPLs are loans overdue more than 60 days. Untill 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful and Loss loans categories.
4/ Starting June 2008, non-performing loans are defined as the sum of impaired loans and non-impaired loans that are overdue more than 60 days.
5/ Large exposure means loans granted to the borrower the net value of which equals to, or exceeds, 10 per cent of bank capital.
6/ Credit registry data from 2005. According to Nace 1 up to Sept 2011. Data according to Nace 2 thereafter.
7/ Composition of liquid assets and current liabilities is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
8/ Data as of the end of period.
9/ As defined in Rules for Calculation of Capital Adequacy approved by Bank of Lithuania Board Resolution No. 138 of 9 November 2006.
10/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnights) made between resident banks in national currency within the last quarter of the period.
11/ The large majority of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in euros, to which the national currency is pegged via a currency board arrangement.
12/ Specific provisions include provisions against general portfolio risk until end-2004. From end-2005, due to the change in definition of NPLs, specific
provisions are not directly attributable to the NPLs. Therefore, the ratio may be negative.
13/ Specific provisions include allowances for both individually and collectively assessed loans.

being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2015.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of January 1, 2015, the currency of Lithuania is the euro, which floats freely and independently
against other currencies. Prior to 2015, the currency of Lithuania was the litas. From April 1, 1994 to
February 1, 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at LTL 4 per U.S. dollar under a currency
board arrangement. From February 2, 2002 to Dec 31, 2014, the litas was pegged to the euro at
LTL 3.4528 per euro. Lithuania joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004, and ERM II on June
28, 2004. Lithuania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payment and transfers for
current international transactions except for those maintained solely for the preservation of national
or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Previous Article IV Consultation:
Lithuania is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
May 5, 2014. The Executive Board assessment is available at
https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2014/pr14206.htm and the staff report and other mission
documents at https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41537.0.
Safeguards Assessment:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) was subject to and
completed a safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, (the SBA was
approved on August 30, 2001 and expired on March 29, 2003) on December 10, 2001. The
assessment identified certain weaknesses and proposed appropriate recommendations as reported
in EBS/01/211. The BOL has implemented these recommendations.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP Update mission was completed on November 19, 2007. Fiscal and statistics ROSCs were
completed in November 2002 and December 2002, respectively.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

Resident Representative:
James Roaf (stationed in Warsaw, Poland).
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT): Lithuania’s
compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard, was last assessed by MONEYVAL,
the FATF-style regional body of which it is a member, in April 2012. The assessment report was
published in December 2012. Lithuania was rated partially compliant on nineteen FATF
Recommendations, leading to the application of the first stage of the Compliance Enhancing
Procedure (CEP) to Lithuania. In response, the authorities amended the Criminal Code and the
AML/CFT Law and put in place secondary legislation and guidelines. This extended the list of
punishable activities, criminalized financing of terrorism, reorganized the suspicious transactions
reporting system, strengthened customer due diligence, and extended record keeping requirements.
Lithuania has submitted to date three compliance reports under the CEP procedure. In recognition of
the progress achieved in the key areas of concern, MONEYVAL ended the CEP in April 2015, but
recommended that the authorities address the remaining deficiencies and ensure effective
implementation of its AML/CFT framework in order to exit the regular follow-up procedures.
Lithuania is scheduled to undergo the next round of mutual evaluation under the revised FATF
methodology in the first quarter of 2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a macroeconomic
database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes. Lithuania subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and its metadata have been posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS
specifications for coverage, periodicity and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance
release calendars. A significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various
websites through the Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC data module was
published in November 2002. Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is considered adequate.
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) in accordance with the
guidelines of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) from 2005 data onwards (data before
2005 still follow the European System of Accounts 1995, ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at
constant prices are compiled using the production, expenditure and income approaches. GDP estimates by
production are considered to be more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure and
income, but no statistical discrepancies between these three estimates are shown separately in the
published figures as the discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories (expenditure
approach) and operating surplus and mixed income (income approach). The annual and the quarterly
national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2010. In general, good data
sources and sound methods are used for the compilation of the national accounts, but measuring activity
during the volatile environment of the 2008/09 crisis proved challenging. Moreover, difficulties remain in
measuring the non-observed economy. These estimates are compiled at detailed levels of economic
activity using fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and
updated in 2006, and in 2011. According to the most recent updates, the non-observed economy was
estimated to be 28.5 percent of GDP in 2012.
Price Statistics: Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is
available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is calculated
according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.
Government Finance Statistics: Data on the central government budget execution are available at a
monthly and quarterly frequency. The ongoing treasury project is expected to improve fiscal data quality
substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment of public health care providers and
of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for government operations. A new methodology,
incorporating the GFSM 2014, was adopted in October 2014. Annual and quarterly historical data have
been converted into the GFSM 2014 format back to 2010, with data before 2010 still in the GFSM 2001
format. The MoF is reporting to STA general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). In addition, the MoF is reporting
quarterly and monthly data for publication in the IFS.
Monetary Statistics: The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on
a timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line with the

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following Lithuania’s accession to the
European Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for compiling and reporting monetary data
reflecting the ECB regulations and ESA 2010 on sectorization, valuation and classification of financial
instruments.
Balance of Payments: The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment
position (IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on balance
of payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular basis. Balance of
payments data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the format recommended in the
Balance of Payments Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) from 2004 data onwards (data before 2004 still follow
the BPM5 methodology). The monthly data correspond to several key balance of payments components,
compiled on the basis of a sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some
nonfinancial private sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked to the Fund’s
DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in the World Bank’s Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Data Standards and Quality: The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of
publications, including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data is available on the Internet:


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on
the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);



the BoL website (http://www.lb.lt/statistical_data_tree) provides data on monetary statistics,
treasury bill auction results, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic
indicators;



the SL website (http://osp.stat.gov.lt) provides monthly and quarterly information on economic
and social development indicators;



the MoF (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on the national budget, as well as
information on laws and privatization; and government finance statistics (deficit, debt);



NASDAQ OMX Baltic website (http://www.nasdaqomxbaltic.com/market/?lang=en) includes
information on stock trading at NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock Exchange in Vilnius (the former
Vilnius Stock Exchange).
