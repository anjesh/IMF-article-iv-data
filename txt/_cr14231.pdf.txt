STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THIRD POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth accelerated to 3.1 percent in 2013, driven by a positive net exports
contribution. The broad policy direction is supportive of near term macroeconomic
stability. The key challenge is to transition from stability into an acceleration of medium
term growth. Uncertainty with respect to EU accession remains, and weighs on longer
term prospects.
Fiscal Policy. The 2014 central government deficit target must be met, even in the face
of weaker revenues—lower central government spending is unlikely to derail the
recovery and debt stability considerations should weigh more heavily. Laying out the
measures underpinning the medium-term adjustment path will reduce implementation
risks and ensure a sustainable and growth-friendly consolidation. Large public
infrastructure works will support both near term and potential growth, but their
substantial impact on public finances needs better monitoring and disclosure.
External Stability. With external risks on the downside, and a baseline drawdown of
reserves, the balance of payments outlook for 2014 is fragile. In that context, the focus
of monetary policy has appropriately shifted away from providing stimulus toward
preserving reserve adequacy in the context of the exchange rate peg. Over the medium
term, external sustainability hinges on accelerating FDI flows and continuing to
strengthen the tradable sector.
Financial Sector. The financial system remains liquid and relatively healthy, but
inefficient intermediation carries substantial opportunity costs for the economy. Strong
domestic deposit growth has been increasingly channeled into government securities; a
lending culture based on physical collateral results in inefficient allocation of credit and
constrains financing for more dynamic entrepreneurial sectors.
Growth and Jobs. A determined effort to alleviate key business environment constraints
should invigorate the domestic private sector and may have important catalyzing effects
on diaspora investment. Strengthening supply chain linkages between foreign and
domestic firms would create more jobs and facilitate knowledge spillovers.

CONTEXT
1.
The broad policy direction is supportive of near term macroeconomic stability.
Presidential and parliamentary elections in April handed down a broadly unchanged mandate. Fiscal
consolidation—needed to stabilize central government debt—is expected to proceed as planned,
with the authorities reaffirming the targets set in the 2014–2016 medium term fiscal strategy. This is
being complemented by an envisaged strengthening of the fiscal framework, through building
capacity for preparing medium term expenditure frameworks and introducing multi-annual budgets,
and, potentially, through the adoption of a fiscal rule.
2.
The key challenge remains to transition from stability into an acceleration of medium
term growth. While income per capita has almost doubled since 1998, income convergence—first
interrupted by the 2001 conflict and then by the global crisis in 2008—has been slow to come
(Figure 1). In that respect:


Important elements of the structural agenda are being put in place. The need for capital
deepening, human capital accumulation and structural transformation is well understood, and
underpins the authorities’ public infrastructure policy, labor market initiatives, and strategy to
attract FDI.



Uncertainty with respect to EU accession remains. The Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia has been a candidate country since 2005, but a date for the start of accession talks
has not been set. In the absence of a negotiation process, the European Commission continues
to engage in a High Level Accession Dialogue (HLAD), looking for progress along key reform
priorities in the areas of media freedom, judicial independence and electoral legislation, as well
as good neighborly relations1. The 2014 progress report will be released in October.
Relations with the Fund and IMF Past Policy Advice
A two-year Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) was approved on January 19, 2011. In March 2011, the
authorities drew 286 percent of quota (about US$305 million). Following the expiration of the PLL in January
2013, the authorities engaged in post-program monitoring. In January 2014, the Board concluded the
Ex-Post Evaluation (EPE) for exceptional access. Repayments of the PLL are due over three years in equal
quarterly installments, with the first repayment of US$38 million scheduled to take place in June 2014.
Policy implementation has generally been consistent with IMF recommendations, although Fund traction on
public financial management, and in particular on payment arrears, has been limited over the past few years.
In line with recommendations of the 2013 Article IV Consultation, the authorities have anchored fiscal policy
in a medium term fiscal strategy, which envisages a gradual consolidation, starting with the 2014 budget.

complicates the assessment of political inclusiveness, and may introduce near-term political volatility.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth in 2013 appears to have been more job-friendly than in the past, aided by
active labor market policies. The decline in the unemployment rate—down 2 percentage points to
28.6 percent by end-2013—reflects both a
decline in the number of unemployed as well as
an increase in the labor force. The latter is a
positive indication of improving perceptions of
labor market conditions. The pickup in
participation rate is explained mainly by young
and older workers and employment among the
main working age group (25–49 year olds) has
grown more modestly, suggesting that the
labor market improvement is still tentative (text
figure).

Credit growth has been gathering pace. The banking sector has remained healthy, with
capital adequacy ratios hovering around 17 percent, and liquidity ratios around 30 percent.
Monetary conditions remained accommodative throughout 2013, with the main policy rate reduced
twice, in January and July, to 3.25 percent and the successive relaxation of reserve requirements for
long-term deposits and specific categories of liabilities (Box 1).

5.
Foreign exchange reserves continued to
decline through April. Despite a narrowing of the
current account in 2013 and net FX purchases by the
central bank, reserves declined EUR 200 million, or
10 percent from end-2012 levels, mostly due to
negative valuation effects. In the first few months of
2014, a weak financial account has resulted in reserves
declining further; the trade balance has improved
some EUR 8 million through March, on the back of
strong exports.

4.
Inflation has been rapidly trending
downward, driven by lower food and commodity
prices. CPI inflation averaged 2.8 percent in 2013, but
price growth in 2014 has been weak and consumer
prices declined in April, bringing average monthly
inflation to just 0.2 percent for the year to date.
Average trimmed inflation over the first four months
stood at 0.6 percent. Staff projects a pickup in inflation
in the second half of the year, bringing average
inflation to about 1 percent.

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

As a result, overall credit growth started strengthening in the second half of 2013, bouncing back to
7.5 percent year-on-year in March. However, dynamic mortgage lending growth contrasts with still
weak lending growth to the corporate sector.
7.
The nominal cash budget deficit target for 2013 was met, resulting, nonetheless, in a
higher than targeted deficit as a share of GDP. The 2013 deficit reached 4.1 percent of GDP, some
0.2 percentage points above the authorities’ revised target. Revenue underperformance relative to
the budget was about MKD 9 billion—a notable 1.9 percent of GDP, of which roughly half was due
to a one-off clearance of VAT refund arrears. Expenditure adjustment was spread across goods and
services, transfers, and capital expenditure.

performance has also been strong, likely reflecting the effect of legal changes to fight evasion; these
positive developments have not, however, offset weaker VAT revenues.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Baseline outlook
9.
Growth is expected to gather pace—to 3½ percent this year—and to broaden. Private
consumption will be supported by household credit, employment growth, and higher public wages
and pensions, while investment will be bolstered by large public infrastructure projects. The
contribution of net exports will turn negative again as higher investment-related imports offset the
positive impact of increasing exports. In the medium run, the growth in private demand should
moderate while the contribution of external demand should strengthen along with improving export
capacity. Current fundamentals could support growth of 4 percent over the medium term; a
realization of planned investment would raise growth potential.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

10.
Credit conditions are expected to continue improving. Private sector credit growth of
about 7 percent per year seems feasible, particularly as risk aversion in the system abates. Credit
supply appears driven by banks’ expectations on the outlook (Box 2); thus, a perceived improvement
in growth prospects should help sustain credit growth. Increased competition from smaller banks
looking for market share gains and the assumed normalization of the situation of foreign parent
banks NBG (Greece) and NLB (Slovenia) would support that baseline.
11.
Reserve losses are expected to halt and partially reverse in the second half of 2014. The
current account deficit is expected to widen to about 4.5 percent of GDP, driven by a rebound in
imports—partly reflecting stronger investment, partly higher imports of services linked to the
implementation of foreign-financed construction projects—and slightly declining private transfers.
FDI inflows are expected to pick up to about 3.8 percent of GDP, notably reflecting the impact of
several big projects in the free trade zones. The financial account would be buoyed by inflows to the
public sector both from external multilateral (World Bank) and bilateral (Chinese EX-IM Bank) project
loan disbursements. This should allow for a gradual buildup of reserve assets in the second half of
2014, which, however, is not expected to fully offset the losses recorded in the first quarter.
12.
The balance of payments position is expected to gradually improve over the medium
term, preserving reserve adequacy. Export growth is expected to progressively outpace import
growth, reflecting the expansion of export production capacity (notably in the free trade zones) as
well as some import substitution. After peaking at 5.6 percent of GDP, the current account deficit
should progressively improve in line with the trade balance, and despite slowly decreasing private
transfers. Along with continued public sector borrowing, this would allow for an acceleration of GIR
accumulation.
13.
Central government debt is expected to stabilize, but debt of non-financial SOEs is
projected to increase to almost EUR 1.4 billion by 2019. Local governments have limited debt;

Risks
14.
Surges in global financial market volatility in 2014 are not a key near term risk, given
the weak integration of Macedonia in global capital markets. Dependence on cross-border
lending is less pronounced than in peer countries. The scope for portfolio investment outflows is
constrained by the limited availability of equity and debt instruments; CPIS data suggest that
non-resident holdings of portfolio investment liabilities are less than 2½ percent of GDP. Central
government external financing requirements in 2014 (just over 1 percent of GDP) are expected to be
met exclusively by official lending. The rollover of a EUR 150 million eurobond maturing in 2015 will
need to be skillfully managed.
15.
Nonetheless, any further stress in parent banks could lead to renewed tightening of
credit conditions. The standalone strength of the systemic Greek and Slovenian subsidiaries
mitigates some of this risk, as does a largely domestic deposit-based funding strategy. However, as
was most acutely the case in 2012, even in the absence of funding constraints, group-level
restrictions on the growth of credit portfolios in these two banks would jeopardize the recovery in
credit. Implications from the AQR and stress tests of euro area banks in the context of the transition
to the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) are not clear.
16.
In the short run, commodity price shocks from Ukraine-related disruptions could exert
some pressure on the balance of payments. Direct trade exposure to both Russia and Ukraine is
low, except for natural gas. A 15 percent oil price shock, however, would have the potential to widen
the current account by an estimated 1.9 percent of GDP.
17.
The main macroeconomic risk over the medium term pertains to a protracted period
of slower growth in advanced European economies. In a small open economy characterized by
increasing real integration with Europe, notably Germany, a prolonged period of weak growth in
advanced economies would further weaken FDI, depress export growth, and weigh on consumption
as private transfers slow. This could, in turn, put increasing pressure on external reserves under the
pegged exchange rate regime.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s advice on the policy mix, namely that, given the balance of
risks, further monetary policy support to credit and

A. Fiscal Policy
18.
In the short run, fiscal policy should be geared toward meeting the 3.5 percent of GDP
deficit target. Containing the central government fiscal deficit will be important to keep debt on a
sustainable path. Capital revenues will likely fall short by about MKD 1.5 billion2, but this can be
accommodated within normal buffers in the budget. Staff projects a shortfall of VAT revenues of
about MKD 2.5 billion, particularly in the face of weak price developments; should that risk
materialize, and absent a notable overperformance of other revenues, meeting the deficit target
may require further expenditure compression, particularly as some additional space may need to be
created for a yet-to-be finalized debt relief program for socially vulnerable debtors.
19.
The recovery is unlikely to be derailed by a tighter budget spending envelope. The
effect on growth of lower spending at the central government level will be partially mitigated by the
positive impact on employment and investment from large infrastructure works implemented by
SOEs (text chart). Staff’s estimated fiscal impulse associated with spending by the Public Enterprise
for State Roads (PESR) is about 0.7 percentage points in 2014.
20.
Debt stability considerations require that the authorities continue to consolidate,
reducing the central government deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2016. The central government
debt ratio is expected to peak at around 39.4 percent in 2018—some 3½ percent above
end-2013 levels—and stabilize thereafter (see Appendix I). Overall public sector debt is projected to
rise to about 55 percent of GDP in 2019, some 9 percentage points of GDP above staff’s previous
baseline, about half of which is due to the envisaged infrastructure investment program. On
balance, this higher path remains broadly consistent with debt sustainability given the importance of
such investment to potential growth, the long- term nature of debt, and safeguards that limit fiscal
risks from the Public Enterprise for State Roads. Nonetheless, it underscores the need to stabilize
central government debt, as well as to focus sustainability analysis on broader public sector
operations.
21.
Laying out the measures underpinning the medium term adjustment will reduce
implementation risks. The planned consolidation path relies on revenue growth outpacing
expenditure growth. An articulation of measures—in the context of the next medium-term fiscal
strategy—will help the authorities reduce the deficit while achieving their desired growth-friendly
expenditure mix. The strategy could usefully be guided by policy measures to be identified under
the forthcoming World Bank-led Public Finance Review. Key considerations, in staff’s view, are the
following:
On the revenue side, policy commitments to maintain a low-tax business environment have
permanently reduced CIT revenues by about 1.2 percent of GDP since 2008. Trade liberalization
has reduced customs duties by 0.6 percent of GDP over the same time horizon. Absent further
tax policy changes, the revenue envelope is therefore some 1.8 percent of GDP lower than
pre-crisis.



On the expenditure side, crisis measures, which have frozen wages and employment, have
delivered a decline in the wage bill, from 5.1 percent in 2008 to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2013.
Staff sees potential for upward pressure on wage spending over the medium term, as public
administration resources become strained.



To avoid building in new permanent expenditure commitments in pensions and transfers that
could jeopardize the consolidation, fiscal space for new policy initiatives should be assessed on
the basis of prudent macroeconomic assumptions, particularly in the context of the current low
inflation environment.



To strengthen the medium term expenditure framework, building explicit contingency margins
under aggregate expenditure ceilings would allow for adjustments due to changes in
macroeconomic and macro-fiscal forecasting assumptions and to protect against volatility of
budget revenues.

22.
Strengthening public investment policy remains a priority. Large investments in
transport and energy infrastructure are crucial for further regional integration, competitiveness, and
catalyzing further domestic and foreign private investment. The small size of domestic private
sector balance sheets relative to the significant infrastructure investment needs have resulted in a
public sector-led strategy, reliant on long-term financing from IFIs. While higher infrastructure
spending should result in an acceleration of potential growth, the transition period toward that
result is challenging and exposes the country to increased risk associated with carrying a higher
debt stock. In that light, clear procedures to assess, prioritize, and monitor public investment
projects should enable higher long-term economic return.
23.
Public sector financing entails external and fiscal risks that should be articulated and
disclosed in a debt management strategy. Hence, the medium-term fiscal strategy should be
accompanied by a debt management strategy that strikes a balance between achieving an efficient
mix of external and domestic financing and maintaining overall macroeconomic stability. In
particular, the debt issuance and the currency financing mix should integrate the following policy
priorities: preserve adequate foreign exchange reserves, minimize debt-servicing costs subject to
acceptable risks, smooth the amortization profile, and avoid crowding out the private sector3. The
strategy should take a broad perspective and consider contingent liabilities—most of the financing
of SOEs is external, in foreign currency, and carries a government guarantee.
Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the 3.5 percent deficit target, and saw
more substantial upside risk to revenues. They noted that there were significant one-off factors,
including pre-election postponement of durable goods purchases, which compressed VAT revenues

early in 2014. Higher frequency unofficial data suggests that more recently an acceleration of
revenue growth may indeed be underway. Thus, the authorities considered the need for a few more
data points to be able to judge whether the early weakness in revenues requires a reprioritization of
expenditure beyond the use of buffers.
25.
More broadly, the authorities outlined their fiscal agenda for stability and growth.
The authorities concurred that reducing the central government deficit to 2.6 percent is required to
maintain moderate debt levels. They were cognizant of the need to preserve fiscal space for
growth-critical capital expenditure: both in the budget, namely for multiyear railway and gas
infrastructure projects, as well as through SOEs, for road infrastructure. In securing that space,


Tax policy changes are not envisaged. The authorities noted that exemptions in the tax system
are limited. At the margin, and mostly on efficiency grounds, there may be scope to abolish the
zero income tax rate on profits that are retained but not reinvested. Harmonization of excise
taxes over the medium term, up to the EU minimum, may provide a boost. Overall, policies will
focus more on improving revenue administration than increasing rates.



Future scope for wage and pension increases will be carefully considered. The authorities
did not see any significant size distortions in the civil service that would call for a more
comprehensive public administration review. A new law on civil servants, to come into effect in
2015, aims to upgrade the professionalism of public servants, establishing integrity tests and
language requirements; the authorities noted that some decompression in the wage structure—
increasing pay differentials—would be needed. Pressure on current expenditure from subsidies
would be contained by capping the spending envelope for agricultural subsidies at EUR
150 million per year over 2015–18.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
26.
Monetary policy remains the first line of defense to ensure a reserve level consistent
with the sustainability of the peg4. While restrictions on capital movements and limited
integration with global financial markets provide some buffers against the buildup of immediate
pressures on the exchange rate, the evolution of reserve adequacy metrics warrants attention. Were
pressures on reserves to materialize, the NBRM should stand ready to raise its policy rate, and to
abruptly tighten reserve requirements on FX and FX-linked deposits. Given the limited size of
interest sensitive flows, this would mainly induce a reversal of commercial bank foreign asset
accumulation (as in 2009), and, at the margin, attract some non-resident deposits of parent
companies.

4

Formally, the official (de jure) exchange rate classification is “floating”, even though the NBRM buys or sells foreign
exchange to keep the denar trading in a very narrow band around the rate of 61.5 denars per euro. Accordingly, the
de facto exchange rate regime is classified as “stabilized”.

27.
In this context, the authorities should refrain from further relaxation of the monetary
policy stance. With credit gradually picking up, there does not seem to be further scope for
monetary stimulus, especially as the experience of the past two years suggests that the transmission
to banks’ lending rates works at best with considerable lags. In addition, ample liquidity in the
banking sector does not call for any further lowering of reserve requirements.
28.
The authorities should remain closely involved in the design of an institutional
arrangement that would establish effective coordination between the SSM and non-EU
members. The central bank’s intention to preserve a conservative approach to bank supervision in a
changing European framework is appropriate. At the moment, the NBRM holds supervisory colleges
with the Bank of Greece and the Bank of Slovenia twice a year, as well as more ad hoc discussions
with Austrian supervisors. As the ECB assumes its new supervisory role in late 2014, continued good
cross-border cooperation in banking supervision in the context of the SSM will be key, in light of the
systemic importance of euro area subsidiaries to the domestic banking system.
29.
A prompt reinstatement of the NBRM’s powers to address unfit shareholders is
needed to preserve a strong regulatory and supervisory framework. A recent Constitutional
Court ruling invalidated sections of the Banking Law that allow the supervisor to dispose of shares
held by shareholders who have been declared unfit. The invalidated provisions were in line with
international best practices, and their removal weakens the supervisory framework. Staff supports
the NBRM’s chosen course of action—namely sending to the government a revised set of provisions
that clarify both supervisory powers and individual property rights.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities concurred with the need to put priority on preserving the
sustainability of the peg and shifting away from further stimulating credit growth. They
reiterated their commitment to tighten the monetary stance as needed in the face of any further
deterioration. They emphasized that reserves were still adequate on a number of metrics, and that
there were a number of upside risks to the conservative balance of payments baseline.
31.
The authorities stressed the challenges to supervisory cooperation in the context of
the SSM. While they would like to see their current cooperation through supervisory colleges
extended to other supervisors of foreign parent banks, they expressed concerns that such bilateral
arrangements might be discontinued in favor of a centralized European supervision. The authorities
suggested that the EBA devote more resources to the region, in particular to support and assess the
equivalence of supervisory and legal systems with respect to compliance with EU standards.

Nonetheless, the large structural trade deficit suggests that export and
import-competing sectors remain underdeveloped, and remittances may have played a role.
Large-scale migration of labor over the last two decades has resulted in sustained large private
transfers, which undoubtedly bring important economic benefits, including for poverty reduction
and external stability (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). However, the increase in
households’ disposable incomes associated with remittances may also support excessive
consumption and import growth, exerting upward pressure on the relative price of non-tradable
goods and on reservation wages. Over time, these price distortions may induce a reallocation of
resources towards the non-tradable sector, thus weakening the overall competitiveness of the
economy (Box 3). To counteract such dynamics, cross-country experience suggests scope for
(i) setting up financial vehicles aimed at harnessing remittance flows to productive investment (such
as diaspora bonds for financing capital projects), and (ii) improving infrastructure and the business
environment—catalyzing diaspora investment may exact higher standards of their home country in
both areas.

34.
While Macedonia has risen to a notable 25th place in the Doing Business 2014 index,
the private sector continues to face binding constraints. Enforcing payment discipline in both
public and private sector contracts, clarifying the mandate and rights of inspection bodies, and
improving firms’ access to finance are priority areas in that respect.
35.
Inefficient intermediation likely carries a substantial opportunity cost for growth.
Strong domestic deposit growth (as well as retirement savings within the two second pillar pension
funds) has been increasingly channeled into government securities. The lending culture of banks
based on physical collateral likely under-allocates credit to more dynamic entrepreneurial sectors; an
upgrade in credit scoring technologies would likely help. In addition, previous staff research
(SM/13/179) suggests addressing weaknesses in accounting practices in the corporate sector,
encouraging more realistic valuation of collateral by banks and improving the efficiency of legal
procedures.
36.
To lock in the ongoing reduction in unemployment, efforts to alleviate key
employment constraints should continue. Labor market institutional factors (labor market
flexibility, social assistance, and labor taxation) appear in line with those of EU new member states
and are therefore not likely to be the main explanatory factor of the poor labor market outcomes in
FYR Macedonia.


Investment in training and education should
be a priority. Empirical analysis5 shows that
nearly two-thirds of long-term unemployment is
explained by skill mismatches between supply
and demand for labor. Active labor market
policies and education reform have been
successful in reducing the mismatch, but the
effects will likely be felt slowly, as jobseekers
need to acquire the relevant skills before being
able to benefit from newly created jobs.



Strengthening supply chain linkages between newly-established foreign enterprises and
domestic firms would create more job opportunities and facilitate knowledge spillovers.
This would require proactive information sharing and the reduction of any costs associated with
doing business with the free trade zones.

Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities concurred with the view that remittances flows could contribute more
to potential growth, but advised caution in interpreting remittances data. Measurement issues
point to the need to draw only tentative conclusions. The authorities stressed that a non-trivial share
of private transfers likely represents unrecorded exports of services, leading to an underestimation
5

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

of the economy’s competitiveness. Nonetheless, the authorities concurred that there is scope to
better channel these flows to productive investment. This could possibly be done by creating
dedicated savings and investment instruments for the diaspora. In this context, the authorities
suggested that municipal level instruments and projects are more likely to succeed.
38.
The authorities acknowledged the challenges associated with excess liquidity and risk
aversion in the banking sector. The structure of the banking system has certainly posed specific
challenges—systemic euro area subsidiaries have faced externally-imposed portfolio restrictions, a
diluted shareholding structure in a key domestic bank has likely distorted incentives, and the size
distribution of banks in the system does not generate sufficient competition. Policy actions have
aimed at spurring bank lending (Box 1), but also at trying to encourage alternative sources of
financing—notably, the introduction of a zero reserve requirement on corporate bonds. The
authorities noted that the role of the stock exchange is still limited, but they are pushing forward
with a regional joint stock exchange platform which they hope would stimulate more equity
financing.
39.
The authorities highlighted key actions aimed at strengthening the business
environment and facilitating job growth. The Law on Financial Discipline, aimed at improving
liquidity in the private sector, came into effect on May 1. A newly established inspection council will
govern all inspection bodies, previously under the jurisdiction of separate line ministries; the goal of
the reform is to reduce lobbying pressure and upgrade the professionalism of the inspectorates.
Significant efforts have been made in cleaning up unemployment registers to improve the targeting
of active labor market policies. The authorities have also looked to outside experts to help in
developing policy tools for effective development of domestic private sector linkages with FDI firms.

Macedonia’s capacity to repay remains adequate. Risks are broadly balanced:
Upside risks to FDI and public sector inflows. The baseline forecast for foreign direct
investment is conservative. At 3¾ percent of GDP per year over the medium term, projected FDI
flows are about one percentage point of GDP below their historical average. Public sector
borrowing is mainly linked to the implementation of investment projects articulated with already
secured lending commitments, from official and private sources. The baseline reflects staff’s
lower bound estimates for these flows, as well as upper bounds estimates for possible outflows
in the forms of imports of services.

41.
The authorities should continue their efforts to achieve the 2014 central government
deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP, even in the face of weaker revenues. Containing the central
government fiscal deficit will be important to keep debt on a sustainable path. Any effect on growth
from spending cuts at the central government level to safeguard the target should be mitigated by
the positive impact on employment and investment from large infrastructure works implemented
outside the central government budget. In addition, prospects for recovery seem firm: external
demand is still supportive, export growth is strong, and a number of factors—higher pensions,
employment, public sector wages, as well as a healthy pace of credit growth—will provide support
to private consumption.
42.
Over the medium term, the planned course for fiscal policy remains appropriate;
laying out the measures underpinning the adjustment will reduce implementation risks. The
planned reduction of the deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2016 remains appropriate. An articulation
of the measures to contain expenditure—in the context of the next medium-term fiscal strategy—
will help the authorities reduce the deficit while achieving their desired growth-friendly expenditure
mix. Continuing to base annual budgets on prudent macroeconomic assumptions, particularly in the
context of the current low inflation environment, will avoid overstating fiscal space. Strengthening
public investment policy to better assess, prioritize, and monitor public investment projects should
enhance the transparency of the decision-making process and enable higher realization of budgeted
capital spending, a long-term economic return, and a sustainable public debt position. The
associated increase in public sector debt underscores the need to continue reducing the central
government deficit, as well as to focus sustainability analysis on broader public sector operations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

43.
The medium-term fiscal strategy should be accompanied by a debt management
strategy. The public debt management strategy should ensure that the government’s financing
needs are met at the lowest possible cost consistent with a prudent degree of risk, but also reach for
broader objectives, namely, consistency with monetary and fiscal policy goals and the development
of an efficient market for government securities. In line with international best practices for sound
debt management, the objectives and relevant measures of risk and cost should be publicly
disclosed, and the impact of contingent liabilities on the government’s financial position should be
considered.
44.
The focus of monetary policy has appropriately shifted away from providing stimulus
to preserving reserve adequacy in the context of the euro peg. With credit gradually but so far
convincingly picking up, and with ample liquidity in the banking sector, a more accommodative
stance would be counterproductive in the face of a baseline drawdown of reserves and risks to
export growth and investment from lower euro area growth.
45.
The financial system remains liquid and relatively healthy, but structural factors
impede more efficient intermediation. Strong domestic deposit growth has been increasingly
channeled into government securities. The banking sector landscape – dominated by three large
banks facing various shareholder-imposed constraints and a fragmented segment of very small
banks—has likely distorted incentives and limited competition and innovation. A lending culture
based on physical collateral likely results in inefficient allocation of credit and constrains financing
for more dynamic entrepreneurial sectors.
46.
An effective framework for continuing close cooperation with foreign supervisory
authorities will be needed in the context of the SSM. The authorities should remain closely
involved in the design of an institutional arrangement that would establish effective coordination
between the SSM and non-EU members. In light of the systemic importance of euro area
subsidiaries to the domestic banking system, preserving the established level of cooperation
between home and host country authorities will be important.
47.
The jobs and growth agenda should remain a central policy concern. A determined
effort to alleviate key business environment constraints should invigorate the domestic private
sector and may have important catalyzing effects on diaspora investment. Key in that respect would
be proper implementation and monitoring of recent initiatives to enforce payment discipline in both
public and private sector contracts, as well to upgrade the professional status of inspection bodies
and clarify their mandate. Important progress in targeting and designing labor market activation
policies should be sustained. Strengthening supply chain linkages between newly-established
foreign enterprises and domestic firms would create more jobs and facilitate knowledge spillovers.
48.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should remain on a standard 12-month Article
IV cycle.

Credit growth has dropped sharply since
mid-2008. Credit to the private sector grew rapidly
in the mid-2000s, reaching 44 percent year-on-year
in May 2008, funded by an equally rapid growth of
domestic deposits. As the global crisis hit in late
2008 and the first half of 2009, severe current
account pressures elicited a rapid and sharp policy
tightening response. Credit growth fell to under
3½ percent and has averaged 5¾ percent through

Starting in 2012, the monetary policy stance was
gradually eased. Since early 2012, the main policy
rate has been reduced by 75 basis points down to 3.25 percent in three steps (May 2012, January and July
2013). The change in the policy stance was pursued against the backdrop of a weak growth outlook and
contained inflationary pressures, expectations for a moderate current account deficit, and financial inflows
that allowed for a further accumulation of international reserves.

This was complemented by a series of macro-prudential measures:



Starting in January 2012, the reserve requirement on time deposits with contractual maturity above
two years was reduced to zero, to encourage long-term saving and release banks’ assets for
lending. A zero reserve requirement ratio was also applied to liabilities on denar repo transactions
to foster the development of a market for this instrument.



Effective January 2013, with the objective to further stimulate anemic private credit growth while
also strengthening the balance of payments, the central bank lowered reserve requirements by the
amount of new loans to domestic net exporters and electricity producers.



In July, reserve requirements on liabilities in domestic currency were lowered again while those on
short-term FX deposits were tightened, with the dual objectives of stimulating deposit growth in
local currency and encouraging long-term foreign capital funding of domestic banks.

Additional credit support measures were taken in late 2013. The NBRM adopted a decision aiming at
deterring banks from overbidding the central bank’s monthly auctions and requiring banks bidding above
their potential to place the difference in seven-day deposits. It also abolished the remuneration of required
reserves (1 percent on domestic currency and 0.1 percent on foreign currency).

Box 2. Supply- and Demand-Side Drivers of Credit Growth
A decomposition of credit developments in recent years confirms that supply-side factors relating to
bank balance sheets—namely, capital and liquidity—have not played a key role. Using quarterly data
from bank surveys over the period 2006Q2–2013Q4, we replicate for Macedonia the methodology
implemented in the October 2012 GFSR1 to disentangle the influence of supply- and demand-side factors on
credit growth. First, the supply-related tightening of credit standards is regressed on explanatory variables
standing for various balance sheet indicators as well as banks’ expectations on outlook, for various
categories of loans. Setting all but the coefficients on balance sheet-related variables to zero allows for the
construction of a filtered series standing for ‘pure’ supply-side developments, exclusively reflecting
capitalization and liquidity constraints. Second, overall credit growth is regressed on the filtered supply-side
variable and an overall demand variable, controlling for hysteresis effects. The overall decomposition
indicates that mortgage, consumer and corporate lending have all been primarily driven by demand-side
developments, while balance-sheet related constraints have exerted a constant but moderate drag on
growth.

Risk aversion by banks appears to be the most critical supply-side factor. In comparison with other
countries, most balance sheet characteristics are found to be generally insignificant to explain changes in
credit standards. In contrast, however, for each category of loans, banks’ expectations regarding overall
economic activity turns out to be the most significant explanatory factor behind the tightening of credit
standards. These results are fully consistent with the observation that banks are very liquid and well
capitalized, but may be excessively risk averse.

Box 3. The Macroeconomic Impact and Drivers of Remittances in FYR Macedonia
In order to explore the macroeconomic impact of remittance flows in FYR Macedonia, we estimate a
mixed-frequency structural VAR model1, over the 2005–2013 period. The model consists of two
blocks—a home economy and a foreign economy. The foreign economy block includes real EU GDP. The
domestic economy block includes the following six variables: real GDP, real consumption, NT/T prices,
transfers, worker’s remittances, and 3 month interest rate differentials. Note that we decompose private
transfers into “workers’ remittances” and “other transfers” to explore to what extent measurement issues
might affect our findings. We use a zero restrictions identification to impose no spillovers from the domestic
economy to the external block, and compute the impulse response functions (IRF) to different exogenous
innovations2.
Key results are as follows:
1) Remittances appear to be countercyclical with
respect to Macedonian GDP and pro-cyclical
with respect to EU GDP. A countercyclical
response to shocks in the domestic economy is
consistent with a stabilizing role of remittances
and in line with findings in the literature.
Noteworthy is the role of “push” factors—the
elasticity of the response to EU shock is
significantly higher.
2) Remittances are interest-sensitive. An
exogenous increase in the interest rate differential
encourages migrant workers to choose their home
economy for saving.
3) Remittances do put some upward pressure on the
internal real exchange rate. The IRF analysis
presents mild evidence of Dutch disease effects on
the Macedonian economy. Shocks to remittances
push the prices in the non-tradable goods sector
higher than in the tradable goods sector; however,
the elasticities are small.
4) Finally, the results are robust to different
specifications of the “remittances” variable.

Table 8. FYR Macedonia: External Debt Sustainability Framework, 2008-2018

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

Appendix I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt dynamics1—contingent on meeting the outlined medium-term fiscal targets—are stable
under the baseline. However, the short maturity of debt poses a rollover risk, with large financing
needs each year. Another risk factor is the high ratio of foreign currency denominated debt; mitigating
this is the high share of non-market, long-term, project linked financing. Stress tests show that the debt
path is robust to individual shock scenarios, but sensitive to a combined macro-fiscal shock.
1.
The public debt ratio is expected to peak at around 39.4 percent in 2018 and stabilize
thereafter. The trajectory assumes a financing strategy for 2017–19 that targets a level of
government deposits in the central bank equal to 3–4 months of the gross financing needs of the
following year. Should authorities target a zero government deposit balance toward the end of the
financing period, central government debt would peak at around 38.6 percent in 2017 before
stabilizing at around 38.3 percent in 2019.
2.
Primary deficit and real GDP growth are the largest positive and negative debt
creating flows as percentage of GDP, respectively. While the primary balance is projected to
decrease from 2.6 to 1.6 percent over the forecast horizon, it will remain slightly above the
debt-stabilizing primary deficit of 1.1 percent for 2019. In cumulative terms, a slowly closing primary
gap is the main debt creating flow, adding about 11.4 percentage points of GDP to debt over the
same period. However this is offset by the impact of real GDP growth and by a decline in the
government’s cash position.
3.
The debt ratio remains under 60 percent under both symmetric and asymmetric
shocks over the forecast horizon. Fan charts suggest that the 10 to 90 percentile range of debt
ratio under symmetric shocks are between 34 and 58 percent, in 2019. While an asymmetric
distribution of shocks with no upside on primary balance and real exchange rate projections results
in percentile range of 42 and 62 percent of GDP.
4.
Despite the low debt level, gross financing needs are large and pose a risk. The maturity
of public debt has increased from 9 to 38 months in the last two years, notably reducing rollover
risk. Nonetheless, the average maturity of outstanding debt is relatively low which means that gross
financing needs are large, between around 13 to 15 percent of GDP during the forecast horizon
despite the low fiscal deficit.
5.
Another risk to the debt profile is the high ratio of foreign currency denominated
debt. Foreign currency denominated debt declined to 58 percent of total debt in 2013, but it is
expected to rise to 85 percent by 2019 as part of the authorities’ current debt management strategy.
While this will allow the country to maintain a stable reserve path against external shocks, higher

recourse to international debt market instruments could increase market risk or, particularly in the
face of weak growth and foreign direct investment, trigger a reassessment by markets of the
stability of the peg.
6.
The debt path is fairly robust to individual shock scenarios, but a combined
macro-fiscal shock could lead to

7.
The planned cumulative change in primary balance of about 1 percentage points of
GDP over the forecast horizon appears realistic? The maximum cumulative change in cyclically
adjusted primary balance (CAPB) planned by the authorities in any given 3 years over the forecast
2
horizon is well within the range achieved by other countries. Also, the maximum 3-year rolling
average CAPB that the government will maintain over the forecast horizon is lower than reference
countries. Therefore, the planned cumulative change in primary balance of about 1 percentage
points of GDP over the forecast horizon appears realistic.
8.
Forecast error analysis suggests systemic positive bias in historical estimations of
primary balance but no bias for real GDP growth and inflation. Staff’s estimates of the primary
balance projections have been historically on the optimistic side. While this is mainly due to the
surprise deterioration of balances in 2012 and subsequent intra-year revisions of budgetary targets,
it demonstrates the need for caution and the importance of sensitivity analysis when projecting
fiscal adjustment.

6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

volatility (related to
UMP exit)

Expected Impact of Risk
Low
Financial channels for transmission are relatively limited.
Public sector external financing requirements for 2014 are
expected to be fully met with official financing. Cross-border
lending is relatively unimportant. The scope for portfolio
investment flows is constrained by the limited availability of
equity and debt instruments.
Policy response: Careful management of the rollover of the
2015 eurobond; re-establish medium term debt management
strategy.
Medium/High

Protracted period of
slower growth in

High
(Europe)

advanced and
emerging economies

Medium
(elsewhere)

Real exposure to European economies is very high.
 Setbacks in the implementation of FDI plans would
lead to weaker than expected investment, reducing
medium term potential growth. Debt dynamics would
worsen.
 Lower import demand from European markets could
dampen the contribution of exports to growth.
 Lower private transfers would weigh on consumption.
Policy response: Continue with structural reforms to enhance
competitiveness and potential growth. Fiscal impulse from
public sector infrastructure operations is currently supporting
both the recovery and medium term growth.

Medium

Medium
Further stress in euro-area parent banks of two systemic
local subsidiaries could lead to renewed tightening of credit
conditions, with attendant effects on growth. The standalone
strength of these subsidiaries and their limited dependence on
parent bank funding are important mitigating factors.
Policy response: Relieve structural bottlenecks to more
efficient intermediation of savings; seek a suitable framework
to continue cooperation with home country supervisors.

Medium

Low/Medium
Trade exposure is low, except for gas. Russia is the sole
supplier of natural gas, and storage capacity is very limited.
Steel industry was hit during the 2009 gas crisis.
Commodity price shocks in cereals would have a limited
negative effect on the trade balance. An oil price shock would
have a more pronounced impact on the current account.

Financial stress in the
Euro-area re-emerges
triggered by stalled or
incomplete delivery of
national and euro area
policy commitments

Increasing geopolitical
tensions surrounding
Ukraine lead to
disruptions in financial,
trade and commodity
markets

The Risk Assessment Matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report. The

relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more).

Exchange Arrangement:
The currency of the FYR of Macedonia is the denar. The FYR of Macedonia maintains a
managed floating exchange rate system with a de facto stabilized arrangement against
the Euro. Households can transact through commercial banks or through foreign
exchange bureaus that act as agents of banks; enterprises can transact through the
banking system. The reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits is set at 13 percent,
while that on FX-indexed denar deposits are set at 20 percent.
At end-May 2014, the official exchange rate was 45.3 denars per U.S. dollar and 61.65
denars per euro. The FYR of Macedonia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from June 19, 1998.
Article IV Consultations:
The first consultation with the FYR of Macedonia was concluded in August 1993. The last
consultation was concluded on June 26, 2013 (IMF Country Report 13/178). The FYR
Macedonia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, while Post-Program
Monitoring is expected to take place every 6 months.

IMF–WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia maintained
close collaboration, seeking synergies and harmonizing policy recommendations. Close
coordination has resulted in largely shared views of the economic situation in the country,
particularly in the context of the latest Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG), for
which the Fund provided an Assessment Letter in November 2012. The area of public financial
management has been at the center of discussions over the last year, and the measures supported
by the PEPBG on public finance management have benefited from the findings and
recommendations of the recent IMF TA mission.

Key Areas of World Bank Involvement


The World Bank program in FYR Macedonia focuses on three pillars: (i) faster growth by
improving competitiveness; (ii) more inclusive growth by strengthening employability and
social protection, and continued improvement of social programs; and (iii) more sustainable
resource use and an analysis of options for “greener” economic growth. Because FYR
Macedonia’s future growth and development depends fundamentally on the pace of EU
accession, virtually every intervention in the program is designed to help it prepare for the
EU membership.



A series of two budget support operations (Competitiveness DPL) has been made available
to the Government with the aim to improve the competitiveness of the economy to
develop a stronger export-oriented enterprise sector. The first of these has been closed,
while the second one has been approved, and disbursement is expected until the end of
June, 2014.



The World Bank also provided recently two Policy Based Guarantees for two loans the
Government contracted with commercial Banks, together in the amount of €255 million. The
Policy Based Guarantees supported critical reforms needed to strengthened robustness of
public financial management and help mitigate the impact of the euro zone turmoil.



The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (US$26 million) is supporting the
digitalization of cadastral maps and securing land and real estate titles. The Regional and
Local Roads Program Support Project (US$105 million) is helping with the rehabilitation of the
regional and local roads and provides institutional support to improve the management of
roads. The World Bank finances the energy sector through the Electric Power Development
Energy Community of South East Europe Project APL3 (US$44 million) to improve the

transmission grid, including an interconnection with Serbia. Local development is assisted
through the Municipal Services Improvement Project (US$75 million), which is helping to
improve transparency, financial sustainability and delivery of targeted municipal services in
selected municipalities. The World Bank is also active in the human development sector
through the Conditional Cash Transfer Project (US$25 million), and the new Skills
Development and Innovation Support Project (US$24).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 9, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Areas that
would benefit most from further improvement are national accounts and government finance
statistics.

National accounts: Quality of national account measurement need to be improved. In 2013, by
Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, amendments were made to the National
Classification of Activities—NKD Rev.2 and entailed significant changes in the decomposition of
historical data. The primary objective of the Classification of Activities is to provide a basis for
comparing statistical data of the Republic of Macedonia on European and world level, i.e. in its
content and structure is completely harmonized with the European Classification of Activities NACE
Rev.2. Currently the State Statistical Office (SSO) is working on a new revision that will be effective
around the second half of 2014.
Price statistics: Improvements to the CPI have been introduced in accordance with international
standards and EU regulations to align the Classification of Individual Consumption According to
Purpose (COICOP).
Government finance statistics: Debt data on a disaggregated basis for the broader public sector are
not available on a regular basis. Macedonia does not report government finance statistics to the Fund
for publication in either the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSMY) or the International
Financial Statistics (IFS).

Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary statistics, covering the
balance sheet of the central bank, the commercial banks and other depository corporations.

External sector: External sector statistics meet international standards. In additional to monthly
balance of payments data, the authorities compile and disseminate international investment position
(IIP) data, reserve assets and foreign currency liquidity data, and external debt statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
FYR Macedonia participates in the General Data
Data ROSC published on September 29, 2004.
Dissemination System (GDDS), and, since
November 2011, in the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation and Third Post-Program
Monitoring Review with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
On July 1, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2014 Article IV Consultation and Third Post-Program Monitoring with Macedonia.1
Growth accelerated to 3.1 percent in 2013 and has been more job-friendly than in the past.
After a good performance at 3.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, baseline growth is
expected to gather pace—to about 3.5 percent this year—and to broaden further. Domestic
demand will be supported by private consumption and large public infrastructure projects,
while the contribution of exports will be offset by higher investment-related imports.
Inflation is weakening, led by lower food and commodity prices, but a pickup in the second
half of the year is projected, bringing average inflation to about 1 percent in 2014. The
decline in foreign exchange reserves observed since end-2012 has been mostly due to
valuation effects and is expected to halt and partially reverse in the second half of 2014,
preserving reserve adequacy. A pickup in foreign direct investment (FDI) and significant
financial inflows to the public sector from multilateral and bilateral external creditors will
offset a widening current account deficit and slightly declining private transfers.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
The central objective of PPM is to provide for closer monitoring of the policies of members that have
substantial Fund credit outstanding following the expiration of their arrangements. Under PPM, members
undertake more frequent formal consultation with the Fund than is the case under surveillance, with a particular
focus on macroeconomic and structural policies that have a bearing on external viability.

2
The nominal cash budget deficit target for 2013 was met, but resulted in a higher-thantargeted 4.1 percent of GDP deficit. For the first four months of 2014, growth in expenditures
has outpaced that of revenues, resulting in a cumulative budget deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP,
against a targeted deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP for the year. As in 2013, subsidies and other
transfers were frontloaded, with almost 50 percent of the budgeted amount spent in the first
four months.. Central government debt rose to 35.8 percent of GDP at end-2013 and is
expected to rise by about half a percent of GDP in 2014. Debt of state-owned-enterprises is
increasing at a faster pace and is expected to bring public sector debt at about 43.5 percent of
GDP at the end of the year.
The financial sector has been resilient. Banks’ overall capital adequacy ratio stands at around
17 percent and liquidity ratios at around 30 percent; while the share of non-performing loans
to non-financial entities (11.1 percent in March 2014) is gradually declining. Monetary
conditions remain accommodative, with the main policy rate reduced by 75 basis points to
3.25 percent in several steps since mid-2012, the successive relaxation of reserve
requirements for specific categories of liabilities, and additional credit support measures in
July 2013. As a result, credit growth has been gathering pace since the second half of 2013,
bouncing back to 7.5 percent year-on-year in March 2014. However, dynamic household
lending growth contrasts with still weak lending growth to the corporate sector.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the economic recovery underway, the decline in
unemployment, and the broadly favorable economic outlook. Directors noted, however, that
securing a lasting expansion and durable reductions in unemployment requires continued
efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability and promote a dynamic financial sector, as well
as a more supportive business environment.
Directors encouraged the authorities to meet their 2014 deficit target for the central
government, as a first step toward securing the consolidation needed to safeguard a
sustainable trajectory for the public debt. More broadly, they agreed that the overall policy
framework would benefit from greater fiscal transparency and a well-articulated debt
management strategy that takes into consideration both domestic and external sources of
financing while maintaining macroeconomic stability and supporting growth. Directors
advised the authorities to specify the measures underpinning fiscal adjustment to reduce
implementation risks and noted that greater efforts to prioritize and monitor public
investment projects would also strengthen public financial management.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors concurred that monetary policy should continue to refrain from providing
additional accommodation in the period ahead, barring an unforeseen deterioration of the
macroeconomic environment. The primary focus of policy should instead shift to supporting
the adequacy of international reserves and an exchange rate regime that has served the
country well.
Directors agreed that Macedonia’s financial system remains liquid and adequately
capitalized. They noted, nonetheless, that structural weaknesses in the sector, if unaddressed,
would continue to hamper intermediation and the flow of credit. Directors agreed that in light
of the systemic importance of euro-area subsidiaries to the domestic banking system,
preserving cooperation between home and host country authorities will be critical, as the
European Union’s Single Supervisory Mechanism comes into force.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to advance their structural reform agenda. In
particular, they noted important progress in implementing labor market policies to mitigate
skill mismatches. Directors also underscored the importance of further alleviating
long-standing impediments to private sector activity, including by better enforcing payment
discipline in public and private sector contracts. They also welcomed efforts to strengthen
supply chain linkages between foreign enterprises and domestic firms.

Statement by Mr. Menno Snel, Executive Director for Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and Mr. Metodij Hadzi-Vaskov, Advisor to Executive Director
July 1, 2014
The Macedonian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the candid and
constructive exchange of views during the mission. They broadly agree with staff’s
assessment and main policy recommendations. Building on positive experience in the past,
the authorities continue to make use of Fund advice in formulating economic policies. In this
context, they have intensified efforts aimed at strengthening supply chain linkages between
FDIs and domestic companies, while making further progress with the development of the
domestic debt market. The authorities look forward to continued cooperation and Fund
support aimed at strengthening the capacity for medium-term budget planning. The
achievement of higher economic growth, employment, and standard of living constitute a key
strategic priority of the new Government Program for the period 2014-2018.
Economic developments
Following a strong and robust recovery in economic activity in 2013, economic growth has
accelerated faster than expected, to 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, placing
Macedonia among the top growth-performers in Europe. After a slight deceleration in 2013
to 2.8 percent, the average inflation rate in the first four months of 2014 dropped close to
zero, largely reflecting the receding pressures from food prices. Industrial production
continued to increase steadily, recording a growth rate of 3.1 percent over the period
January-April 2014. Over the same time period, expanding activity of existing and new FDIs
contributed to a strong export growth of 15.1 percent, and an increase in the import coverage
by exports from 62.4 percent to 65.2 percent. After subdued performance in the first half of
2013, credit growth started to strengthen in the second half of 2013, reaching 7.6 percent at
end-May 2014.
On the basis of favorable growth prospects, prudent macroeconomic policies, and a stable
financial sector, Fitch has affirmed Macedonia’s credit rating at BB+ with stable outlook in
March, and Standard & Poor’s has affirmed credit rating at BB- with stable outlook in May
2014. Net FDI inflows accelerated to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013 and to over 1 percent of
GDP in the first quarter of 2014, while the pipeline of current and forthcoming FDI projects
has further expanded. Against the backdrop of stronger economic activity, largely reflecting a
dynamic FDI sector, unemployment has continued to decline. The latest figures indicate that
the unemployment rate in Macedonia has dropped to the lowest level over the last twenty
years. The continued reduction of the unemployment rate on a sustainable basis remains the
authorities’ key priority.

2
Fiscal policy
The authorities are committed to meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP in
2014. Going forward, they aim to formulate fiscal policy in line with the medium-term fiscal
strategy, which envisions a decrease in the fiscal deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2016, and
aims at stabilizing central government debt without jeopardizing the path of economic
recovery.
Investment in capital infrastructure projects remains a key priority for the authorities over the
medium term. Beyond their near- to medium-term positive impact on economic activity and
employment, these projects are essential for reducing costs, enhancing competitiveness, and
boosting the economy’s potential growth. The authorities envisage ensuring fiscal space for
capital expenditures by containing current expenditures, continuing to base revenues on
prudent macroeconomic assumptions, and further enhancing the efficiency and the
effectiveness of the revenue administration, including through the implementation of GPRS
on all cash registers that will provide real-time transaction information.
The public debt management policy, which constitutes a part of the medium-term fiscal
strategy, aims at meeting the public sector financing needs at the lowest possible cost
consistent with a prudent level of risk, and at ensuring the long-term sustainability of public
finances. The authorities underline that they retain full control over the indebtedness of all
public enterprises, given the legal obligation of these enterprises to pass the same scrutiny as
all other budget users. Moreover, their borrowing capacity will continue to be assessed
through a rigorous long-term sustainability analysis.
In order to further strengthen budget discipline and enhance predictability of fiscal policy in
the future, the new Government Program stipulates introduction of fiscal rules, which will
place limits on budget deficit and debt level, as well as strengthen the fiscal accountability
mechanisms. The regulatory framework on fiscal rules is expected to be prepared by
September 2014.
Monetary and financial sector policy
The NBRM authorities remain vigilant to possible further pressures on the balance of
payments, and stand ready to adjust monetary policy if needed to ensure the sustainability of
the exchange rate peg. They point out that the deterioration of the balance of payments in the
first quarter of 2014 was in line with the expectations, and mainly reflects the seasonal
pattern of some of the components. The expected private transfers and capital account
inflows in the second half of 2014 are expected to partly mitigate the depletion of reserves in
the first half of the year. Notwithstanding the recent decline in reserves, mainly due to
valuation effects, several key metrics indicate that the level of reserves remains adequate.

3
The NBRM authorities see significant upside risks to the balance of payments baseline
related to the recently-announced FDI projects.
The authorities reiterate their commitment to maintaining their prudent bank supervision
framework in the context of the changing supervisory landscape in Europe. In particular, they
emphasize the importance of further extending the current cross-border cooperation in
banking supervision through supervisory colleges to the supervisors of other foreign parent
banks. At the same time, the NBRM authorities express concern that the ongoing move
toward centralized European supervision may terminate bilateral arrangements with
Macedonia, which may not be replaced by establishing effective supervisory cooperation in
the context of the SSM. In light of recent credit market developments, the NBRM authorities
highlight that their macroprudential measures had a visible effect on accelerating credit
growth.
Business environment and reforms agenda
Recognizing the continued and comprehensive improvement of the business environment,
the latest World Bank Doing Business report ranked Macedonia among the top 10 reformers
in the world for the fourth time in the last seven years. Macedonia has made substantial
progress in several other international rankings, including the Index of Economic Freedom,
the Global Competitiveness Index, and the Forbes list of best countries for business, which
have consistently placed Macedonia on top among regional peers in recent years. The
authorities believe that the decision by several large foreign investors to expand their
production capacity and open new factories a short period after their initial investments in the
country provides key evidence about the tangible improvement of the business climate.
In line with Fund advice, the authorities have intensified their efforts to strengthen the
interconnectedness between FDIs and the domestic private sector. In particular, a special
committee has been established with the task of enhancing linkages between FDIs and local
companies, thereby supporting the steady progress on the value-added ladder and facilitating
knowledge spillovers. Key challenges in this respect include achievement of high quality
standards, further development of entrepreneurial spirit and skills, and comprehensive
improvements in organizational structures.
The law on financial discipline, which came into effect on May 1, is expected to enforce
payment discipline and improve liquidity of the private sector through an effective regulation
of the payment period for the public as well as the private sector. Access to finance for
domestic SMEs is expected to be further improved through the operationalization of the
