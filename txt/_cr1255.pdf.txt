STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 24, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: The high public debt and strong interlinkages between the banks and the
sovereign continue to pose risks. Although the political deadlock was overcome and the
new federal government has begun to address long-standing issues in the economy,
uncertainty about the evolution of the euro area crisis and slow growth across Europe
weigh on the outlook. Growth is projected to stagnate in 2012 and to be weak in 2013, with
risks slanted to the downside. The authorities’ strategy aims to achieve fiscal sustainability
over the medium-term, contain risks in the financial sector, and increase employment and
growth.
Fiscal policy: The vulnerability of Belgium’s sovereign debt to market pressures makes
credible medium-term fiscal consolidation a priority. The 2012 budget includes sizable
consolidation measures and the government is committed to take additional measures as
needed with the aim of reaching structural balance by 2015. In light of the weak growth
prospects, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate freely around the
consolidation path.
Financial sector policy: Important steps were taken to address the financial sector distress
in 2011, but vulnerabilities remain. While most banks have maintained market access
throughout the crisis, they should continue to build up capital to deal with possible adverse
market dynamics. There is a need to further strengthen banking supervision and to
implement the Basel III and Solvency II regulatory frameworks. The Belgian experience has
also underscored the need for an effective approach to crisis management and a
cross-border resolution framework in Europe.
Structural reform: The government has initiated labor market and pension reforms, in
order to raise the employment rate. Boosting growth is important for sound public finances
and requires pushing ahead with reforms in labor and product/services markets, including a
reconsideration of the automatic wage indexation. A job-friendly tax reform could increase
trend growth.

Despite major restructuring, the reliance on short-term

While its reported capital adequacy appeared healthy
compared to peers (with core Tier 1 ratio at

BELGIUM

Box 1. The Resolution of Dexia
The breakup of Dexia Group (SA) was announced
on October 10, 2011. The group was split into three
parts:

 Dexia SA’s Belgian operations were nationalized by
the sale of the group’s share holdings in Dexia
Bank Belgium (DBB) to the Belgian state for an
amount of €4 billion (1.1 percent of Belgian GDP).
Dexia SA retains an earn-out right to benefit from
any gains should DBB be resold within five years.
Service agreements have been put in place with
other units of Dexia to ensure operational
continuity during a transition period while former
intragroup funding exposures will be unwound
gradually.

 In France, an agreement was reached on February
10, 2012 between the Caisse des Dépôts et
Consignations (CDC), the Banque Postale, and the
French state to secure the financing of the public
sector. This agreement has two key elements: a)
setting up a joint venture between CDC and
Banque Postale to commercialize new financing of
local authorities; and b) the creation of a new
credit establishment held by the French State
(31.7 percent), CDC (31.7 percent), Dexia Crédit
Local (DCL, 31.7 percent) and Banque Postale
(4.9 percent). This new credit establishment will be
the parent company of Dexia Municipal Agency
(DMA), a covered bond vehicle dedicated to the
financing of the local public sector. DCL would
continue operating under a banking license.

 Negotiations are currently underway for the sale of
other parts of Dexia SA, including Dexia Banque
Internationale à Luxembourg (DBIL), to be acquired
by a foreign investment group (90 percent of the
stake) and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
(10 percent of the stake), and Denizbank in Turkey.
Other parts of Dexia, including CrediOp in Italy,
Kommunalkreditbank in Germany, and Sabadell in
Spain will be sold later, depending on market
conditions.

 The funding of Dexia SA and of DCL would be
guaranteed by the governments of Belgium
(60.5 percent), France (36.5 percent), and
Luxembourg (3 percent) in a several guarantee of
up to €90 billion over a period of 10 years. So far,
the European Commission has provided a

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

temporary approval for a guarantee of up to
€45 billion of financing with maturities of up to
three years while the restructuring plan is being
finalized. Belgium’s share in this temporary
guarantee amounts to €27 billion (about
7½ percent of GDP). The implementation of the
guarantee will enable Dexia SA to reduce the
amount of its central bank financing and that from
DBB.
In Belgium, the resolution of Dexia has caused
collateral damage with fiscal repercussions. Two
shareholder entities became insolvent as a result of
impairments on their Dexia participation and will be
liquidated in an orderly fashion, while other
shareholders will require recapitalization. Based on
current estimates, the eventual fiscal cost may be up
to ¾ percent of GDP:

 Communal Holding, the municipal financing vehicle
with a 14 percent stake in Dexia SA, has become
insolvent. It will be liquidated at a loss of some
€0.8 billion shared by Belgium’s Regions, the federal
government, and DBB.

 Arco Group, an investment group of a workers’
union with a membership of 11 percent of the
workforce and a 14 percent stake in Dexia SA, has
been issued a government guarantee for its
individual members’ capital of about 1.5 billion (net
of proceeds from asset sales). Arco Group will also
be liquidated.

 Ethias, a mutual insurance company with a balance
sheet of 7 percent of GDP and a 5 percent stake in
Dexia, incurred losses. Funding difficulties resulted
in €180 million in public sector support in a bond
issue in January 2012.
The actual and contingent sovereign liabilities
arising from the resolution of Dexia are substantial
for Belgium, but the immediate impact on the
general government debt is small. Current Eurostat
rules suggest that the immediate fiscal impact of
Dexia’s resolution is an increase in general
government debt by the purchase price of DBB
(1.1 percent of GDP) to the extent that funds need to
be raised in debt markets. The sovereign guarantees
for Dexia SA’s and DCL’s funding remain contingent
liabilities unless guarantees are called and as long as
Dexia SA is recognized as a financial institution.

program includes a state reform, a fiscal
consolidation plan, and an entitlement reform.
The Sixth Reform of the State substantially
increases the degree of fiscal federalism by
devolving additional spending responsibilities
to subnational governments and reforming
their funding (Box 2). In particular, the reform
grants autonomy over personal income tax
revenues amounting to 2.9 percent of GDP to
the Regions and Communities. At the same
time, the reform devolves additional spending
authority of 4.4 percent of GDP to sub-national
governments to cover new responsibilities,
including on labor market and employment
policies, long-term care, and child benefits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Sixth Reform of the State
A Sixth Reform of the State was agreed in
October 2011. The reform is expected to come into
effect in 2014 and contains two main elements:
political reform and enhanced fiscal decentralization.
Some short-term fiscal saving measures were also
included such as a 5 percent ministerial pay cut. In a
political agreement, a Flemish-speaking part is
broken out of the bilingual electoral district of
Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde and voters in this part are
no longer allowed to vote for candidates from
Brussels. From 2014, federal and regional elections
will take place at the same time in a five-year cycle
(instead of the previous four-year cycle). Regions are
given the right to initiate popular consultations on
regional issues.

payer. Regional personal income tax revenues
will accrue to the Regions alone. Assuming
constant existing tax brackets, federal and
regional personal income tax revenues will be
calibrated such that PIT revenues of the Regions
represent €10.7 billion (2.9 percent of GDP, or
about one quarter of current PIT revenues).



Revised system of transfers to Regions: To finance
two specific new competencies (labor market
policy and responsibilities for defining tax
exemptions), Regions will receive a transfer of
90 percent of the budget envelopes for
employment policies and 60 percent of the fiscal
expenditure budget, the remaining 40 percent
being part of the amount transferred as
revenues from greater tax autonomy. In
addition, Regions will receive a ―solidarity
transfer‖ of 80 percent of the difference
between the Region’s share in the population
and in PIT revenues. A transitional transfer
mechanism will ensure that there are no losses
for the Regions from the new system in the
starting year. The transfer amount is fixed in
nominal terms for the first ten years, and then
reduced by 10 percent per year. Finally, the
Brussels-Capital Region will benefit from a
permanent transfer of 0.1 percent of GDP to
cover exceptional financing needs.



Revised funding of Communities: Instead of
being allocated shares of VAT revenues,
Communities will receive a budget transfer
according to the number of pupils (€14 billion)
and according to distribution keys based on
demographics to cover their new spending
responsibilities. In addition, they will receive an
appropriation under the Regional fiscal
allocation (€8 billion). A transitional transfer
mechanism similar to that for Regions is
foreseen.



Contribution of Regions and Communities related
to the pensions of their civil servants. Regions
and Communities will pay a contribution for
their civil servants’ pensions paid by the federal
government. This contribution will increase
gradually to 8.86 percent of wages.

The key elements of enhanced fiscal
decentralization are devolution of responsibilities
to the regional and community levels of
government and increased tax autonomy:





Devolution of responsibilities to Regions and
Communities: Regions will be responsible for a
significant share of labor market policies
(€4 billion) and policies on tax exemptions for
mortgages, energy savings, and service vouchers
(€2 billion). Communities will become
responsible for child allowances (€6 billion), oldage care (€3 billion) and some other health care
expenditures (€1 billion). In total, the new
responsibilities of Regions and Communities
amount to some €16 billion (4.4 percent of
GDP).
Greater tax autonomy for Regions. Since 1989,
the Regions have had the right to add
surcharges or give rebates on the personal
income tax (PIT). Their PIT revenues depended
on a grant financed by and shared according to
regional proceeds from PIT collected at the
national level and these surcharges/rebates.
Following the Sixth Reform of the State, Regions
will be authorized to set their own schedule of
regional PIT rates and brackets in addition to a
federal PIT schedule. Competencies for defining
the tax base and tax collections remain at the
federal level. The deviation in the tax
progressivity of the regional PIT schedule from
the federal one is limited to €1,000 per tax

Growth momentum has slowed since

early 2011. A rebound in investment in 2010
and 2011:Q1 was supported by solid export
growth. As confidence weakened, however,
growth began to falter in 2011:Q2, in tandem
with a marked slowdown in the rest of the
euro area. With activity declining in the second
half of the year, real GDP growth is estimated
at 1.9 percent in 2011, above the euro area
average (1.6 percent).

Box 3. Deleveraging in Financial Markets—the Belgian Experience
Following the 2008 financial crisis, the largest
Belgian financial groups have engaged in major
restructuring programs, aimed at reducing the risk
profile of their activities. The execution of the
restructuring plans has resulted in significant balance
sheet transformation, on both the liabilities and asset
side. The recast of strategic plans included the sale and
run down of non-core activities and, as a result, a
reduction of funding needs.

Note: "Non-credit institutions" covers inter alia loans to financial institutions other
than banks and to local authorities.

The deleveraging process took place mainly abroad,
while exposures to resident counterparties have
increased from €352 billion (end-2007) to about
€420 billion (September 2011). The external exposures
to both Europe and the United States have decreased
sharply during 2008 and 2009. In this period, the
Belgian financial groups deleveraged by disposing of
asset portfolios (legacy assets, debt securities, and non2/
strategic loans) and of some foreign subsidiaries.
In 2010-11, the reduction of foreign exposures has
slowed as asset disposal became more difficult under

worsening market conditions.

The main exposures of Belgian banks to Emerging

deleveraging in individual countries shows a mixed
picture. The exposure to the Czech Republic has
increased, while exposures to Turkey and Russia have
declined markedly and those to Poland and Hungary
decreased to a lesser extent. These differences reflect
the relative importance of different foreign operations

As deleveraging in Emerging Europe is deemed to
continue, the process entails risks for both the
3/
banks and the host markets where they operate.
Under current market circumstances, the sale of foreign
subsidiaries may become challenging and less
profitable, despite leading to a capital relief effect
(through a reduction in risk weighted assets). Moreover,
reducing lending in some host markets, which offer
substantially higher margins and growth opportunities,
may further affect the profitability at the group level
and may require changes in business models.

BELGIUM

Box 3. Deleveraging in Financial Markets—the Belgian Experience (continued)
For the host emerging markets, deleveraging of
foreign subsidiaries may negatively influence the
supply of credit in the future. So far, evidence from
markets where Belgian banks have deleveraged does
not indicate a reduction in the level of financial
intermediation. This could be explained by the
substitution of the credit supply by other banks
operating in these markets. In the longer term, reduced
parent funding to foreign subsidiaries may lead to more
conservative credit underwriting practices and to a
more sustainable business model based on increased
reliance on local savings. In the process of changing
hands, the host countries’ supervisors will need to be
satisfied with the ownership structure, governance, and
financial strength of the potential investors.
1/ In the case of corporates, the decrease of the exposures
may also be explained by a lower credit demand following
the financial crisis.
2/ A substantial part of the reduction of external assets
in 2008 is attributed to Fortis, where the Dutch part of the
financial group (Fortis Bank Netherlands) and an important
part of the legacy portfolio have been carved out.

and the three euro area program countries of
€52.9 billion (94 percent of Tier 1 capital of the

sovereigns were €14 billion (25 percent of

55 percent average impairment booked by the

Box 4. Potential Output Estimates for Belgium
History suggests that financial crises tend to be
followed by lower output potential. This can be
attributed to the effects on growth via several
channels, such as: (i) a decline in labor force
participation; (ii) increases in structural
unemployment; (iii) lower capital to labor ratios; and
(iv) limited access to finance for capital investments
hampering total factor productivity. However,
relocation of resources can also have a beneficial
impact on potential growth, if inefficient activities
are being replaced by more efficient usage of
resources.
Estimating the level of potential output is
especially difficult in the aftermath of a
recession. Estimates of potential output are always
subject to considerable uncertainty, since potential
output is not directly measured. In the immediate
aftermath of a recession, this uncertainty is increased
even further. The frequently employed filtering
techniques are subject to end-point problems and
are therefore less suited for computing output gaps
at the end of the sample period.

Potential GDP growth is likely to recover to close
to 1½ percent by 2016. Potential growth has fallen
from almost 2 to about 1 percent according to all
estimates, although over different horizons.
According to the production function approach, the
drop is largely due to lower capital usage.
Employment losses have also contributed with
¼ percentage points to the reduction in output
potential. Total factor productivity had been on a
declining trend already prior to 2008. The
multivariate approach suggests the fastest recovery
in potential output growth, while the HP filter yields
the lowest estimate with only 1 percent by 2016.
Potential output growth of 1½ percent by 2016 is
consistent with a linear extrapolation of the potential
growth trend from 1996 to 2007. The trend implies a
gradual decline of potential growth from 2 percent
in 2007 to 1½ percent by 2016.
Belgium - Potential Output Growth

Results from three different methods are
employed to assess prospects for potential
output growth. A standard Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter, a production function approach and a
multivariate approach (MV) provide similar
indications about Belgian potential output growth.
While the HP filter is a univariate approach and uses
only the information derived from output, the
production function approach derives the output
potential from capital, labor and TFP trends, which,
in turn, are determined using a HP filter. The
multivariate approach instead models the joint
behavior of output, unemployment, capacity
utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations.
The approach uses Bayesian techniques, to infer the
levels of potential output and the NAIRU that would
be consistent with Belgian data.1/

The output gap has narrowed rapidly from 2009
to 2011, but is estimated to widen again in
2012–13, and to close by 2017. As actual output
growth recovered in 2010 and 2011, the output gap
started narrowing. However, the demand shock
expected for the latter half of 2011 and 2012 is likely
to lower output growth substantially, while potential
output is likely to be less affected. Only when actual
GDP growth is expected to regain strength from
2014 would the output gap start to close again and
potential output start to recover driven by higher
capital accumulation.



On the revenue side, considerable scope
remains to reduce federal and regional tax
exemptions (see below). This could help
offset the fiscal impact of reducing the
labor tax wedge and rebalance the relative
weight of tax revenues towards indirect
taxes.

30.

The consolidation effort should be

set into a strengthened institutional
framework. A rules-based fiscal framework for
the general government would add credibility
to the consolidation effort and the
preservation of fiscal sustainability in the long
term. A structural balance fiscal rule, in line
with the EU Directive on Requirements for
Budgetary Frameworks and the draft Treaty on
Stability, Coordination, and Governance in the
Economic and Monetary Union (Fiscal
Compact), should include a provision that
unforeseen additional revenues be assigned to
public debt reduction. A transition period will
be necessary as Belgium’s consolidation
strategy aims at reducing the structural fiscal
deficit below the general Fiscal Compact
ceiling of 0.5 percent of GDP by 2015. Full
implementation of the government’s medium-

A multi-year perspective, based on

realistic revenue assumptions and an indepth expenditure review, would help
prioritize spending programs. Such a rulesbased, multi-year framework for the general
government would need to be complemented
with a burden-sharing agreement between the
different levels of government, including
spending caps for each level. Close
coordination between the regions and
municipalities should help ensure adherence
to the overall fiscal targets committed to at the
European level. A burden-sharing agreement
will become increasingly important as the state
reform takes effect in 2014 and the degree of
fiscal federalism widens.

commitment to reduce the deficit below

durable measures of sufficient magnitude

an opportunity to monitor progress against
the budget targets and take further measures,
if needed. The authorities also agreed that

Future progress with financial sector

restructuring is subject to heightened
uncertainty. BNP Paribas Fortis and KBC have
advanced with their restructuring, but continue
to be reliant on public support and their ability
to maintain the planned pace of deleveraging
through further asset disposals is challenged
by difficult market conditions. Continued
efforts will be needed to improve their
operational efficiency and reduce operating
expenses, given the revenue pressures
stemming from limited growth prospects of
the Belgian market, continued deleveraging,
high funding costs, and adverse developments
in some foreign subsidiaries. Going forward, it
is important for the authorities to insist on
strong capital buffers when the state capital
would be repaid.12 Absent this recapitalization,
public support may need to be maintained
beyond the dates initially envisaged.
36.

Banks should continue to build up

capital to deal with possible adverse market
dynamics and maintain funding access. The
authorities should take steps to ensure that
banks have strong capital buffers, in line with
forthcoming Basel III capital requirements, that
are achieved as far as possible by increasing
capital rather than slowing down credit.
Reinforced capital buffers, if needed to be
provided by the state, are essential to enhance
confidence in the banks and to cope with risks

According to the restructuring plan approved by the
European Commission in 2009, KBC should reimburse
the state aid by end of 2013 to avoid incurring costly
penalties.

stemming from potentially worsening market
conditions.
37.

The resolution of Dexia again

showed the importance of cross-border
cooperation in the areas of supervision and
resolution. At this juncture, it is important to
strengthen the dialogue with foreign
supervisors, including within the respective
supervisory colleges. Increased supervisory
cooperation should lead to acquiring a more
thorough understanding of international
groups’ activities, risks (including contagion
risks within the groups), and governance, and
enable a more intrusive oversight and timely
corrective action or resolution, if necessary.
Moreover, the authorities might need to
review the resolution framework in light of EUwide developments.
38.

The new supervisory architecture in

place since April 2011 should improve
coordination of micro- and macroprudential policies. The prudential
supervision of financial institutions has been
integrated into the central bank, while the
Financial Services and Markets Authority
(FSMA) is assigned the task of ensuring the
smooth operation of markets and the
protection of consumers of financial services.
All bank and insurance supervision staff were
taken over by the National Bank of Belgium

In June 2011, the Constitutional Court canceled the article
establishing the uniform deposit guarantee contribution by
all banks (Law of December 23, 2009), following the claim of a
mid-sized bank that the fee was disproportionally affecting

institutions funded with retail deposits compared to riskier
institutions relying on wholesale funding. The new legislation
on the deposit guarantee system was passed in December 28,
2011 and entered into force in 2012.
15

New legislation has been passed establishing the
requirement for banks to pay a financial stability contribution
calculated as a percentage of total liabilities net of own
capital and deposits.
16

The former Financial Stability Committee (FSC) was
replaced in July 2010 by the Committee for Systemic Risks
and System-relevant Financial Institutions (CSRSFI), which was
put in charge of the prudential supervision of systemic
financial institutions during the transition to a new
supervisory architecture which entered into force in April
2011. The latter is yet to be replaced by a formalized
framework reflecting the new supervisory layout.

According to the OECD’s Belgium Economic Survey
2011, net replacement rates of unemployment benefits
and pension benefits are broadly in line with OECD
practices. Until the recent reforms, unemployment
benefits declined less over time than in many other
OECD countries but net replacement rates started
lower. Pension benefits for civil servants remain more
generous than for private sector employees. The Sixth
Reform of the State pledges to align civil servants’
pension benefits to the general pension benefit
system. For details, see the Selected Issues Paper,

Box 5. Belgium: The Regional Dimension of Unemployment
The dispersion of unemployment rates is, by EU
standards, exceptionally large in Belgium.
In 2010, unemployment rates in Belgium ranged
from 3.8 percent in West-Flanders to 17.3 percent in
Brussels. Only Spain and France, both about twenty
times Belgium’s size by area, have a greater regional
dispersion of unemployment rates.

High unemployment rates are concentrated in
French-speaking Wallonia and Brussels and in
provinces with formerly large mining sectors and
steel industry. The highest unemployment rates are
in provinces which used to be dominated by mining
industries. Furthermore, reportedly nine out of ten
jobseekers in Wallonia and Brussels do not speak
Dutch, which is a major obstacle to finding a job in
Flanders and in Brussels. Other impediments to
geographical mobility exist as well, including a fairly
high rate of home ownership coupled with large

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

FSAP Participation
FSAP Assessment
IMF Country Report No. 06/75
Summary: The report concluded that Belgium’s
financial system is resilient and benefits from a
number of features that help stability. These
include a traditionally cautious attitude toward risk
by banks, large holdings of government securities,
extremely low holdings of equity by banks, a
stable source of funding benefiting from generous
tax incentives, a high standard of banking
supervision, and a stable macroeconomic policy
framework. Overall, supervision showed a high
degree of compliance with international standards.
Near-term vulnerability appears low, reflecting the
soundness of the dominant banking system, the
generally benign financial environment, the strong
financial condition of the corporate sector, and the
relatively healthy financial position of the
household sector. Financial institutions were found
to withstand an adverse macroeconomic stress
well, helped in part by the beneficial diversification
in the bancassurance model.
The 2005 Mutual Evaluation Report on the
Assessment of Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
measures prepared by the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) indicates that Belgium’s AML/CFT
framework applicable to financial institutions is

comprehensive and broadly compliant with FATF
standards in this area.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the Belgian
financial sector, a number of issues emerged from
the FSAP. The heavy exposure abroad, the open
nature of the economy, and the importance of the
Euroclear Group globally, made the domestic
financial system potentially vulnerable to global
economic developments and financial contagion.
Risks remained and may increase with a downturn
in the business cycle, increased cross-border
operations, and deeper links with the global
money centers. In line with the 2005 FSAP
recommendations, the supervisory framework has
been strengthened. The Banking, Finance, and
Insurance Commission’s (CBFA) management

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

committee has been streamlined and synergies
between the CBFA and the National Bank of
Belgium (NBB) have been further developed.
Regular stress tests have helped promote a
systematic dialogue between supervisory
authorities and market participants, while detailed
procedures for financial crisis management have
been tested. Prudential supervision of the
insurance sector has been upgraded and
regulation of the pension funds sector reinforced.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 20, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On March 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Belgium.1
Background
Growth momentum has slowed since early 2011. As confidence weakened, growth began to
falter in tandem with a marked slowdown in the rest of the euro area. The labor market has so
far remained resilient, partly because of a series of employment support programs. Annual
average inflation remained around 3½ percent in 2011, and will trigger the automatic wage
indexation mechanism for public sector employees in early 2012. Private sector lending
stabilized as bank deleveraging slowed in 2011. The recent tendency of inflation and nominal
unit labor costs to increase more than in Belgium’s main trading partners is a concern for
competitiveness.
As the euro area crisis unfolded, Belgian sovereign and bank spreads have come under
pressure. Drying up of liquidity in euro area financial markets since the summer of 2011
eventually led to the restructuring of Dexia. Dexia’s Belgian retail operations were broken out of
the group and nationalized at a cost of 1 percent of GDP. The remainder of the group was
provided with guarantees by the governments of Belgium, France, and Luxembourg. The
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

contingent liabilities arising from this operation and previous bank support, combined with an
already high stock of public debt, contributed to rising bond yields and CDS spreads on Belgian
sovereign debt during the financial market turmoil of late 2011.
Continued uncertainty about the evolution of the euro area crisis and slow growth in Europe
weigh on the outlook for Belgium. Real GDP growth is expected to stall in 2012 and resume
gradually from 2013. Risks to the outlook are slanted to the downside. They arise from the high
public debt; from the financial sector’s exposure to countries with weak growth prospects, fragile
sovereign debt markets and stressed financial markets; from the strong interplay between the
banking sector and the Belgian sovereign; and from Belgium’s high degree of trade openness.
The economy is thus vulnerable to financial turmoil across the euro area and to cyclical
developments in Europe.
A new federal government was formed in December 2011. The new government program
appropriately aims at achieving fiscal sustainability over the medium-term, containing risks in
the financial sector, and increasing employment and growth. The Sixth Reform of the State
substantially increases the degree of fiscal federalism by devolving additional spending
responsibilities to subnational governments and reforming their funding. The 2012 budget
includes a sizeable fiscal consolidation package of 2½ percent of GDP, in order to reduce the
fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2012. The authorities continue to strengthen banking
supervision and are committed to implement the Basel III and Solvency II regulatory
frameworks. The government program details structural reforms aimed at raising the
employment rate (for 20–64 year olds) by 5 percentage points. Key measures include greater
degressivity in unemployment benefits; stricter enforcement of job search requirements and a
gradual limitation of pre-pension benefits for older workers; and a stepwise increase in the
minimum age for early retirement from 60 to 62 years by 2016.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the new government’s efforts to achieve fiscal sustainability
over the medium term, contain financial sector risks, and increase employment and growth.
Directors cautioned, however, that the euro area turmoil and the strong linkages between
financial institutions and the sovereign continue to pose downside risks to the outlook. In this
context, a steadfast and full implementation of the government’s economic program remains
crucial.
Directors stressed that medium-term fiscal consolidation is key to mitigating pressures in the
sovereign debt market. They welcomed the sizable adjustment in the 2012 budget and the
government’s commitment to take additional measures as needed to achieve structural balance
by 2015. With revenues at almost 50 percent of GDP, Directors agreed that the consolidation
strategy should focus on expenditure containment, particularly in pensions, health care, and
public sector employment. Most Directors noted that a rationalization of wage and benefit
indexation could also generate budgetary savings. More broadly, Directors recommended a

3
rules-based framework and a burden-sharing agreement between all levels of government to
strengthen the credibility of the consolidation effort. In light of weak growth prospects, most
Directors recommended allowing automatic stabilizers to operate freely around the
consolidation path, although a few Directors noted the importance of safeguarding the
achievement of fiscal targets.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to address financial sector distress in 2011. They noted,
however, that the financial system remains vulnerable to market pressures in the euro area and
that the interplay with the Belgian sovereign has intensified. With greater domestic competition
and a deteriorating economic outlook likely to depress profits, Directors argued that pushing
ahead with the bank restructuring under way and strengthening capital buffers remain important
priorities. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to stand ready to provide the necessary
backstop if private capital cannot be tapped. Directors also stressed the need to strengthen
bank supervision and implement the Basel III and Solvency II regulatory frameworks. They
further agreed that Belgium’s experience during the global financial crisis has underscored the
need for more effective crisis management and cross-border resolution in Europe.
Directors welcomed the labor and pension reforms recently launched by the authorities as first
steps toward raising employment and growth. Nevertheless, they noted that additional efforts
are needed, in particular to increase the effective retirement age to its statutory level. Directors
stressed the need to push ahead with reforms in labor and product markets, with most Directors
noting that a reform of the wage indexation scheme would help boost competitiveness.
Directors observed that a job-friendly tax reform could increase trend growth. With severely
limited fiscal space, they considered that any reduction in the high labor taxes would have to be
offset by an increase in indirect taxes revenues.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 9, 2012
1.
This statement provides additional information on economic and financial
developments in Belgium since the issuance of the Article IV consultation staff report.
The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Indicators point to weak domestic demand in the first quarter of 2012, in line
with expectations. Domestic orders as well as business confidence in construction and
domestic trade continued to weaken in January and February. However, overall business
confidence in February improved for the third month in a row, mirroring the recent
improvement in German business confidence. The improvement followed a decline in
September–November that was linked to a sharp drop in exports.
3.
Annual consumer price inflation in February was 3 ¾ percent. The main drivers
of inflation in February continued to be energy prices. The increase in consumer prices thus
far remains below the threshold that triggers an automatic wage and benefit increase in the
public sector. It is expected that the automatic wage indexation will take place in March.
4.
Several large banks have announced their 2011 results and they have been
broadly in line with expectations. Dexia Group announced substantial losses (€12 billion)
for 2011, reflecting losses from asset disposals, including of Dexia Bank Belgium, and
impairment on Greek sovereign debt. In contrast, KBC and ING Belgium announced net
profits in 2011. Despite a doubling in net profits over 2010, ING Belgium decided not to
distribute dividends in order to further strengthen its capital base. In the case of KBC, net
profits were substantially smaller than in 2010, reflecting loan loss provisions on its exposure
to Ireland and Hungary, and the impairment recorded on Greek sovereign debt. The bank
distributed a small technical dividend to remain on track with its restructuring plan. In a
further restructuring step, KBC sold its Polish subsidiary Kredyt Bank to Santander in a
transaction that should raise KBC’s Tier 1 capital by 0.8 percentage point (compared with
12.3 percent at end-December 2011).
5.
The authorities and Dexia SA’s management are finalizing the restructuring
plan that is to be submitted to the European Commission in late March. So far, Dexia
Crédit Locale has issued €41 billion in government guaranteed bonds, within the envelope of
sovereign guarantees of €45 billion. The proceeds have been used to reimburse unsecured
liabilities to Dexia Bank Belgium (recently renamed Belfius) and emergency liquidity
assistance of the Belgian and French central banks, and to satisfy the funding needs of Dexia
SA. As a result, the unsecured exposure of Belfius to Dexia SA has fallen substantially, thus
almost eliminating a significant financial stability risk for Belgium arising from Dexia’s
restructuring.
6.
The government has made good progress towards meeting its funding needs. By
end-February, a quarter of the sovereign medium- and long-term funding needs for 2012
were met.
