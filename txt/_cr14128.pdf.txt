STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 22, 2014

This report is dedicated to all the victims of violence in Afghanistan and to our colleague
K. Wabel Abdallah, the IMF’s Resident Representative, who was killed in an attack in Kabul
on January 17, 2014, along with 20 others. He was committed to improving the lives of the
populations in countries where he worked, especially in Afghanistan.

KEY ISSUES
Context. Over the past decade, Afghanistan has made enormous progress in
reconstruction, development and lifting per capita income. Security and political
uncertainties, and weak institutions have constrained growth and weighed on social
outcomes. With significant reform efforts and donor support, Afghanistan has
maintained macroeconomic stability, implemented important structural reforms, and
built policy buffers, but significant vulnerabilities remain. The IMF has been supporting
Afghanistan through technical assistance and a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement. Reviews under the ECF arrangement have been delayed.
Outlook and risks. 2014 is a crucial year in the political and security transitions and the
run-up to the “transformation decade” (2015–24). Assuming smooth political and
security transitions, continued reform and donor financing, the outlook should be
positive. Large security and development expenditure needs and a limited domestic
revenue capacity mean that Afghanistan will remain dependent on donor financing for
an extended period. Macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, and political and
security stability are needed to ensure inclusive growth. Risks, mostly on the downside,
are related to adverse domestic or regional security developments, political instability,
inadequate implementation of economic policies, and donor fatigue.
Policy recommendations. The authorities’ economic strategy (maintaining
macroeconomic stability, strengthening the financial sector, improving economic
governance, and moving toward fiscal sustainability) remains appropriate and needs
strengthened implementation. Sustained implementation of this strategy will safeguard
growth and build buffers to help manage shocks. Policies should continue to aim at
strengthening revenue collection, managing money growth to control inflation while
preserving exchange rate flexibility, strengthening bank supervision, and quickly
enacting anti-money laundering (AML), countering financing of terrorism (CFT), banking,
central bank, and value-added tax legislation.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

CONTEXT
1.
Over the past decade, Afghanistan has made enormous progress in reconstruction
and development, more than doubling its income per capita levels. Important steps have been
taken to lay the foundation for macroeconomic stability and growth, reduce poverty, and raise living
standards, despite difficult security conditions and the challenges of rebuilding institutions. With
significant reform efforts and donor support, Afghanistan has maintained macroeconomic stability,
implemented important structural reforms, and built policy buffers: a comfortable international
reserves position, low debt and inflation, and balanced budget and external current account
positions, after grants. Progress has also been made toward achieving social and development
objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—Afghanistan is one of 20 fragile
and conflict-affected states that have already met one or more MDG targets.
2.
Despite this progress, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the
world. Security conditions, political uncertainty, and weak institutions have limited growth and
weighed on social outcomes. The national poverty rate was 36 percent in 2008 and the country
ranked at the bottom 7 percent of countries in the 2012 UN Human Development Index. Poor
governance and corruption remain endemic, and a sizable illicit narcotics sector further distorts
incentives.
3.
In 2014, Afghanistan faces challenges related to uncertainties about the security
and political transitions, which are slowing economic activity. The international military
presence is being drawn down and the government is gradually taking over the management of
spending previously managed by donors; these outlays will be financed by donors. The outcomes of
presidential and provincial elections in April are not clear and a source of uncertainty. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled in 2015.
4.
The international community has delivered substantial financial support and
pledged to continue it over the medium term. At the May 2012 NATO summit in Chicago,
Afghanistan’s international partners provided assurances to finance security spending, estimated at
$4 billion annually over the following decade, towards which the government is expected to make
gradually increasing contributions. At the July 2012 conference in Tokyo, donors agreed to continue
their support, pledging $16 billion to finance development through 2015, and to sustain aid at
similar levels through 2017. Donors and the government adopted the Tokyo Mutual Accountability
Framework (TMAF)—a set of principles, objectives, and reform commitments to promote aid
effectiveness, reform, good governance, and inclusive, sustained growth. Donors indicated that their
support would depend on Afghanistan meeting its TMAF commitments. The July 2013 Senior
Officials meetings in Kabul reconfirmed donor support as did the Joint Coordination and Monitoring
Board Meeting held in January 2014.
5.
The IMF has been supporting Afghanistan through technical assistance and a
three-year, SDR 85 million (52.5 percent of quota) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement,
approved in November 2011. The authorities’ economic reform program focuses on:
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

(i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening the financial sector; (iii) improving
economic governance; and (iv) moving toward fiscal sustainability. The authorities’ policies have
broadly maintained macroeconomic stability. However, after the first program review in June 2012,
subsequent reviews were delayed due to missed quantitative targets and slow implementation of
structural reforms. The shortfall in budget revenue and delays in structural reform, as well as the
limited expected term of the government means a review cannot be completed currently. The ECF
arrangement is scheduled to end in November 2014 (Box 1). Staff and the authorities nevertheless
maintained a close dialogue on economic policy and structural reform.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Confronted with the economic consequences of international troops withdrawal
and rising political and security uncertainties, the authorities maintained macroeconomic
stability and continued to implement structural reforms in 2013. While growth slowed
significantly, inflation remained in single digits, the overall budget deficit (including grants) was
close to balance, and reserves remained above 7 months of imports. At the same time, structural
reforms continued, even if the pace was slower than planned. Donor grants continued to finance the
external and budget deficits (Figures 1–4).
7.
The drawdown of international troops continued, but post-2014 security
arrangements have not been finalized. Of about 142,500 foreign troops in mid-2011, about
57,000 remained as of early January 2014. The post-2014 security agreement with the U.S. has not
been finalized. Insurgents continued to launch attacks aimed at the government and foreign
interests, and attempts to hold discussions with the Taliban have not yielded results.
8.
The presidential and provincial elections were held in April 2014. Provincial
elections and the first round of the presidential election took place on April 5. The partial official
results (from 49.7 percent of legible votes counted, released on April 20) indicate that none of the
candidates secured 50 percent of the vote, which is needed to win outright. If the final results of the
first round (scheduled for May 14) confirm that none of the candidates secured 50 percent or more
of the vote, a second round of the presidential election will take place, with a runoff between the
two candidates who secure the most votes in the first round.1 A new government will be formed
after the presidential election is completed. The run-up to the elections has coincided with a slowing
of economic reform.
9.
Political and security uncertainties and the drawdown of international troops are
weighing on economic activity. These uncertainties reduced confidence, discouraged private
investment, and held back economic activity. Growth slowed from 14 percent in 2012 (boosted by a
bumper harvest) to an estimated 3.6 percent in 2013, resulting in lower import and limited budget
revenue growth. Non-agricultural growth in particular, which averaged 11 percent in 2007–11 and

helped generate rising government revenue, slowed to a little over 3 percent in 2013. Uncertainties
also led to intermittent pressure on the exchange rate (especially in late 2012 and early 2013) and
prompted a switch out of local currency-denominated assets. The central bank managed the
exchange rate flexibly (through sales of foreign exchange in the twice-weekly auctions); it
depreciated by 7.5 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2013, while international reserves remained at
a comfortable level of $6.9 billion (7.1 months of imports). Inflation remained in single digits
(5.3 percent year-on-year in February 2014) due to a good harvest and relatively benign
international commodity prices.
Box 1. The Authorities’ Response to Past Fund Advice
Past Fund advice has focused on the overall macroeconomic policy mix, tax policy and tax administration
reform, strengthening the central bank and the financial sector, and economic governance. The authorities
have been responsive to Fund advice, but in some cases with delayed or incomplete implementation.
The authorities have largely sought to follow the recommended macroeconomic policy mix and have
maintained macroeconomic stability, but revenue performance has fallen short of budgetary needs.
The authorities have managed the exchange rate flexibly, broadly maintained disciplined fiscal policies, and
strengthened monetary policy operations. They also sought to build buffers through reserve accumulation.
The authorities initially improved revenue collections but later encountered some setbacks and
delays. Budget revenue increased from 7 to 11 percent of GDP over 2006–11, but fell back to 9.5–10 percent
of GDP in 2012–13 because of the negative impact of the international troops withdrawal and the decline in
confidence linked to uncertainty about the security and political transitions, as well as lower compliance. On
tax reform, the authorities have prepared a VAT law and submitted it to parliament, but implementation has
been delayed relative to initial plans.
The authorities have worked to strengthen the central bank and the financial sector. A new banking
law was submitted to parliament in February 2013 that would strengthen banking supervision, corporate
governance, prudential requirements, enforcement, and bank resolution. Supervision efforts have been
strengthened. The ten weakest commercial banks have been audited and are being monitored by the central
bank. Further, the staffing of the supervision department has been increased and recruitment to fill the new
positions is under way. A five-year strategic plan was adopted to further strengthen financial sector
supervision. The authorities are working to amend the central bank law to strengthen its governance and are
ensuring that it remains adequately capitalized. In contrast, progress in moving the government salary
payments from New Kabul Bank (NKB) to other banks has proceeded more slowly than planned because of
delays in developing a real-time gross settlement system.
Several initiatives have strengthened economic governance. The public inquiry into the Kabul Bank crisis
was published, and the authorities have responded to its recommendations. To support economic
governance efforts, the Economic Crimes Task Force (ECTF) has been established, although it now needs to
be operationalized. Furthermore, criminal cases related to Kabul Bank have been heard and verdicts reached,
although appeals are pending, while recent Kabul Bank asset recoveries have been limited and efforts to
privatize NKB have progressed slower than planned initially. The authorities have moved ahead with drafting
Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-consistent anti-money laundering/combating financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) legislation, but there have been significant delays.

10.
Revenue performance deteriorated significantly despite additional measures,
requiring spending cuts during 2013. Domestic revenue dropped to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2013
from 10.1 percent the previous year, far short of the initial program target of 11.3 percent. Revenue
collection was affected by lower economic activity, slower dutiable import growth, a continued shift
away from high-tariff imports, as well as lower compliance despite the authorities’ efforts.2 The
authorities replaced personnel in the revenue and customs departments and increased effective
tariffs and fees. Nevertheless, the revenue shortfall resulted in a tight cash position for the treasury,
and required limiting non-priority discretionary expenditures. As a result—and also due to capacity
constraints—expenditure as a share of GDP declined by 0.7 percentage points in 2013, despite the
transfer of externally managed security spending to the budget and an increase in development
spending, while wages remained under control. The operating deficit (before grants) was limited
to 7.8 percent of GDP.
11.
Agricultural output, including opium production, was at historically high levels in
2012–13 due to good weather that affected virtually all crops. According to the UN Office on
Drugs and Crime, the opium poppy cultivation area increased raising the total farm-gate value of
opium production from $0.7 billion to $0.95 billion (about 4 percent of GDP) (Box 2).
Box 2. The Drug Industry and its Impact on Economic Stability and Development
Drug production and trafficking are macro-relevant in Afghanistan. Production includes opium, heroin,
morphine, and cannabis. In 2013, the farm-gate value of potential opium production was estimated at
4 percent of GDP. The potential net value of opiates and the value of opiates potentially available for export
were estimated at 15 percent and 14 percent of GDP, respectively.1 The combination of high opium prices
and Afghanistan’s significant involvement in its cultivation exposes the country to risks of economic
instability, as a number of factors could trigger a shock to production and prices which would transmit to
the formal economy, including through farmers’ incomes. These include climate and water supply,
eradication campaigns, external demand,
change in policies (e.g., Taliban’s ban in 2000),
border controls, and conflicts in neighboring
countries.
There could be significant distorting effect of
the drug industry on the formal economy.2

Box 2. The Drug Industry and its Impact on Economic Stability and Development (Concluded)
Strengthening Afghanistan’s statistical and analytical apparatus could enhance the
understanding and forecasting of the economic impact of the drug industry. The ability to analyze
available information on opium production with formal economic indicators at the regional level
(e.g., agriculture, trade, employment, and finance) would assist in better understanding the impact of
the drug industry on the economy, on the one hand, and mitigating potential shocks on the other. For
example, this type of regional level information is available in Peru and Columbia. Detailed information
on opium cultivation and prices is available but information on other economic linkages of the drug
industry (e.g., trade and financial flows) remains scarce, in light of the post-conflict and development
status of Afghanistan. At present, economic statistics do not currently cover regional employment
rates, agricultural production, building permits, or car registrations, in part due to security issues. As a
result, assessing the economic impact and linkages of the drug industry in the Afghan economy
remains a challenge.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The outlook will be determined by the success of managing the economic
transition from aid dependency toward a more self-sustaining economy over the
“transformation decade 2015–24.” At the July 2012 Tokyo conference, Afghanistan and the
international community shared a vision to further consolidate their partnership in the areas of
governance, security, peace process, economic and social development, and regional cooperation to
help Afghanistan move from transition to attain sustainable economic growth and development and
fiscal self-reliance through the transformation decade of 2015–24.3 The TMAF, which is focused on
the priorities of the Afghan Government as contained in its strategy paper Towards Self-Reliance,
was established at that time to underpin the partnership of Afghanistan with its development
partners for the Transformation Decade. Several factors will play a role. Initially, the drawdown of
international troops has and will reduce aggregate demand while raising domestic spending needs
for security. The resulting impact on growth has already been felt over the past two years. Security
and political conditions will be important factors, as will maintaining macroeconomic stability,
progressing structural reform, assuring continued donor support, and realizing improvements in

governance that create a better business and investment environment. These factors will be
important in determining growth and future living standards over the medium and long terms.
Significant improvements in security could even generate a “peace dividend” for economic activity
through higher activity across sectors, foreign direct investment, better regional transportation links,
and the return of expatriates.
13.
The medium-term framework assumes a modest pick-up of growth during the
transformation decade led by increased private sector activity and the development of the
agriculture and natural resource sectors. Although GDP growth is projected to slow to just over
3 percent in 2014 due to the impact of the international troop drawdown and political uncertainty
in the first half of the year, it is expected to pick up thereafter, as activity and investment rebound.
Continued reform efforts under the TMAF and donor support will ensure that fiscal and external
gaps are covered. With stable international prices and prudent monetary policy, inflation should
remain in single digits. In the longer term, an improved business environment and better economic
governance are expected to facilitate private sector-led growth and the development of the natural
resource sector (copper, iron ore, and oil). Accordingly, growth could accelerate to 6 percent as
mining production comes on-stream, and converge thereafter to about 4 percent.
14.
Debt is modest, but large expenditure needs and limited domestic revenue
capacity mean a high dependence on donor financing. Following extensive debt relief starting in
2006, and ending in 2010 Afghanistan’s debt burden was alleviated significantly—external public
and publicly guaranteed debt amounted to $1.3 billion, or 6.1 percent of GDP, at end-2013, most of
which owed to multilateral creditors. Under the baseline scenario and in light of donor pledges, debt
is sustainable. However, there are significant

The accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis also presents the standard shocks generated by the Debt
Sustainability Framework, which result in benign debt dynamics. However, these results using the standard shocks
may not be representative as they are mostly driven by the past ten years, when Afghanistan averaged real GDP
growth of 9.3 percent per year and received official transfers averaging 50.6 percent of GDP to support needed postconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction.

15.
The outlook is subject to a wide range of risks; many on the downside (see Risk
Assessment Matrix). Afghanistan’s links to the rest of the world are mainly linked to donor financing;
private financial flows and licit trade are limited. On the upside, smooth security and political
transitions could result in larger capital inflows and higher confidence, investment, and economic
activity. On the downside in the near term, the principal risks are related to a potential deterioration
in either domestic or regional security conditions, political instability during or following the
elections, and inadequate implementation of economic policies. In the medium term, risks stem
from insufficient progress in economic reforms including those in the TMAF, or donor fatigue, which
would reduce inflows; a weakening of banking supervision that would fail to manage banking sector
risks; or delays in developing natural resources. The large foreign exchange reserves provide a
sizable buffer, at least in the short term.

Potential economic spillovers to and from the rest of the world are limited. The
outlook depends heavily on inflows linked to donor assistance. The sizeable donor commitments
should insulate the Afghan economy from the key sources of global risks, given the limited (nondonor) linkages and exposure to the global economy and financial markets. Regional developments
affecting security and trade may impact the Afghan economy, in particular an economic slowdown
in India or Pakistan, with which trade has intensified. Outward spillovers from Afghanistan depend
on domestic political and security conditions; a deterioration could lead to displaced population,
internally and to neighboring countries, with attendant lower trade and possible costs for countries
receiving Afghan refugees.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: MANAGING THE TRANSITION,
REDUCING VULNERABILITIES, AND PROMOTING
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
17.
Discussions focused on policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, reduce
vulnerabilities, and promote inclusive, private-sector-led growth through the transformation
decade and in the long term. The authorities and staff discussed the short-term macroeconomic
implications of the troop withdrawal, economic risks associated with political and security
uncertainty, policies to navigate successfully through these events, and how the international
community can best support Afghanistan. For the medium term, the discussion revolved around
policies to reduce aid dependence and foster self-sustained, private-sector-led economic growth
that is inclusive and equitable, while ensuring debt sustainability.
18.
There was broad agreement that the authorities’ strategy remains appropriate to
address the economic challenges and reduce vulnerabilities. The main objectives include:


Maintaining macroeconomic stability, which, along with security and an enabling political
environment, is a precondition for growth and poverty reduction;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN



Moving toward fiscal sustainability aimed at achieving self-reliance in the long run and
addressing a potential decline in donor grants, to be achieved by redoubling revenue
mobilization efforts through new taxes and measures to improve tax administration and
improving expenditure management and service delivery;



Pursuing financial sector stability and development, through banking sector reform and
strengthened supervision (including AML/CFT supervision) to prevent banking sector troubles
emerging and evolving into a macroeconomic crisis, while expanding credit for private sector
development; and



Improving economic governance and the business environment to foster private sector-led
growth and investment by reducing corruption, rent-seeking, and skewed economic incentives.

A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
19.
The macroeconomic policy mix remains appropriate, with fiscal policy supporting
demand (financed by grants) and monetary policy focusing on inflation. This is predicated on
donor flows continuing to finance the fiscal and external deficits:


The authorities and staff agreed that fiscal policy should continue to aim at revenue mobilization
and further improving budget implementation capacity. The broadly balanced budget (including
grants) and tight controls on non-priority expenditures ensure the continuation of government
functions and preserve fiscal space for development spending. The operating balance excluding
grants, which supports demand, remains the fiscal anchor.



There was agreement that monetary policy should continue to focus on maintaining low inflation.
The monetary base remains the nominal anchor and the exchange rate should be managed
flexibly. The sizable international reserves (over 7 months of imports) provide the needed buffer
in times of temporary volatility (Box 3).

20.
The authorities recognized that while buffers allowed accommodating
macroeconomic shocks to some extent, policies needed to be proactive and flexible.
International reserves—deemed adequate by all measures used by the Fund—are large enough to
accommodate even sizeable capital outflows. Nevertheless, in the case of more permanent
pressures, the exchange rate would be managed flexibly to accommodate shocks, deliver the
necessary adjustment, and protect reserves and need to be complemented by competitiveness gains
from a strengthened business environment. Further control of non-priority expenditures, while
protecting social and poverty-reduction spending, and greater revenue-raising efforts would be
needed in case of a decline in grants to the budget. Policy implementation capacity, needed to
mitigate risks and respond to shocks, would continue to be improved.
21.
The authorities called on donors to do their part in honoring their aid
commitments. They noted that fiscal space could be increased if donors intensified their efforts to
further align their assistance with Afghan priorities, signed multi-year financing agreements, and
channeled more funds through the budget, so they are spent more efficiently.

Box 3. External Stability and Exchange Rate Assessment
The current account is dominated by imports and official transfers, while licit exports are low. Excluding
grants, the current account deficit was estimated at 41 percent of GDP in 2013. Official transfers more than
financed this deficit, as they are generally spent on imports. Exports (excluding opium and internal sales to
non-residents), after a catch up in the first half of the 2000s, stagnated at around $500 million, or a mere
2.5 percent of GDP. However, external accounts exclude the illicit economy, which is significant.
Afghanistan maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime. Monetary policy is anchored by targets
on reserve money. The main instruments to implement the policy are sales of foreign exchange (previously
purchased from the government, donors or other official entities) and sales of central bank marketable notes.
Subject to meeting these targets, the central bank also seeks to minimize exchange rate volatility. Afghanistan
has no access to international capital markets and relies on donors’ inflows to cover the current account
deficit. A flexible and floating exchange rate regime, combined with a relatively prudent fiscal policy, has been
serving the country well, inter alia by contributing to a stable price environment while at the same time
helping to absorb external and domestic shocks.
The exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals, and foreign
reserves—at 7 months of imports—comfortably exceed all traditional reserve adequacy metrics.
Reserves help maintain exchange rate stability and provide much-needed buffers in case of external shocks.
Several factors make it difficult to assess quantitatively the long-run alignment of the exchange rate, namely
(i) years of civil conflict; (ii) large aid flows (official transfers and grants ranging from 30 to 70 percent of GDP
over the past decade); (iii) high dollarization; and (iv) concerns over the coverage and reliability of balance of
payments data. However, both a simple measure of the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) as well
as the REER calculated by the IMF’s Institute for Capacity Development suggests that the rate is close to its
medium-term average.
Structural impediments are more binding for Afghanistan’s external competitiveness than the level of
the exchange rate. Obstacles to improving competitiveness include deficiencies in the business environment,
lack of investment and capacity in the tradables sectors, political and economic uncertainty, and corruption.

B. Moving Toward Fiscal Sustainability

Afghanistan needs to move toward fiscal sustainability to reduce its dependence
on donor support. This will entail revenue

vulnerabilities.
23.
To generate needed fiscal space, staff pressed for moving decisively to improve
compliance, for pushing ahead with VAT introduction, and considering new tax revenue
sources—excises in particular. Afghanistan has one of the lowest domestic revenue collections in
the world, with an average of about 9 percent of GDP in 2006–13 compared to about 21 percent in
low-income countries. Factors behind this poor performance include a very low starting point, low
compliance, opposition to new taxes, and a limited set of taxes. Afghanistan relies heavily on traderelated taxes, which represented 45 percent of total tax revenues in 2006–13. VAT, which is being
discussed in parliament, and excise taxes in the medium term would broaden the tax base and
rebalance the composition of revenues. The authorities agreed with the need to increase revenue
and noted political and institutional challenges in raising compliance and implementing new taxes.
Staff also cautioned against providing tax exemptions, because of the resulting distortions and fiscal
costs. The authorities explained that consideration of incentives, which had not been enacted in tax
laws, was designed to stimulate investment in 2014–15 to promote a smooth transition.
24.
Staff stressed the importance of establishing a fiscal regime for mining revenues
that maximizes the share of economic rents for the government while preserving investment
incentives. Mining projects have been delayed and the ongoing oil project is unable to export due
to the lack of a transit agreement with a neighboring country. The authorities are working to
progress these projects and remove export hurdles, and noted that a legislative framework has been
prepared for with IMF technical assistance to establish an effective and transparent fiscal regime for
natural resources in full compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. They also
requested follow-up technical assistance.
25.
Large spending needs (both development and security) are projected to continue.
Development outlays are needed to continue reconstruction and improve public services in order to
progress towards MDGs. At the same time, high security spending (about 11 percent of GDP in

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

2013) accounts for just under half of budget expenditure and will rise sharply as off-budget
expenditure managed by donors is transferred on-budget. Consequently, operating budget
expenditures are projected to increase to over 29 percent of GDP by 2018.
26.
Security outlays are major and continued donor financing is critical. The authorities
welcomed the international community’s commitment made in Chicago in 2012 to continue
financing Afghanistan’s security, estimated at $4.1 billion annually. The indicative target of
government contribution to security outlays discussed in Chicago is set at $500 million for 2015—
already $382 million is planned in the 2014 budget. The authorities indicated that if post-2014
international troop presence were to be lower than projected in 2012, it may not be possible to
reduce the size of security forces from 352,000 currently as envisaged earlier. Staff noted this issue
and pointed to the possibility that a higher donor envelope may not be forthcoming and that
greater efficiency of security expenditures may be needed to prevent a crowding out of
development spending.
27.
Non-security and development needs are expected to increase significantly. The
government plans to hire a large number of teachers and health workers to improve public service
delivery—with a view to improving human development indicators in the medium term—and to
continue expanding the currently scarce infrastructure. Moreover, donors plan to gradually transfer
their off-budget recurrent expenditures onto the budget, to the extent that the budget can absorb
them. These expenditures relate to the operation and maintenance costs of the large capital stock
financed and built by donors since 2002 (and still being built), estimated at about $1 billion annually
for the development sector and as high as $2 billion for the security sector—altogether close to
15 percent of GDP. The government noted its plans to improve expenditure management capacity
in line ministries (with World Bank support) to improve expenditure execution and effectiveness.
28.
The key risks to the fiscal outlook are inadequate revenue mobilization,
ineffective expenditure management, and donors’ disengagement. The possible responses to a
shrinking resource envelope include expenditure restraint, additional tax policy and administration
measures, and debt financing (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). All these options are
difficult to implement. While expenditure restraint may be easier to implement, cutting capital
expenditure—in particular infrastructure investment—would negatively affect economic growth.
Increases in tax rates or the broadening of tax bases could affect compliance and may be politically
challenging to implement. Debt financing may jeopardize debt sustainability and may not be
feasible as long as domestic capital markets remain dormant or small or if concessional external
borrowing is not forthcoming.

C. Policies to Strengthen the Banking Sector and Promote Credit Provision
and Access to Finance
29.
Strengthening the banking sector is needed to support growth. A stronger banking
sector is needed to promote credit provision, better access to finance, economic growth and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

development. The legacy of the Kabul Bank crisis and governance framework weigh on the system,
stymie credit provision and access to finance, and affect public confidence in banks.


Vulnerabilities are related to weak governance and institutional challenges—mainly supervision
and the regulatory and legislative framework. The absence of a comprehensive legal
infrastructure, limited institutional capacity in the banking and legal systems, and inadequate
corporate governance constrain financial sector development. It also leaves space for interest
groups to lobby for regulatory forbearance (e.g., delaying examination reports and enforcement
of supervisory actions) with attendant financial stability risks.



The banking system remains barely profitable and some banks show poor or negative capital
ratios.5 In 2013, banks turned an aggregate profit of about $31 million for the first time in years
despite large provision expenses and continued losses in state-owned banks. Despite the
corrective measures the central bank has been taking with respect to weak banks, there were
still seven weak banks (i.e., with a CAMEL rating of 4 or worse) out of the total of 12 banks. The
assets of those weak banks represent around 51 percent of the total banking sector’s assets.
The main issues that these banks face are: (i) low or negative capital;6 (ii) high credit risk; and
(iii) inadequate management. While some of the banks have plans to increase capital and
manage other financial issues, addressing management issues remains an important challenge,
particularly for state-owned banks.



The banking system is highly liquid because of low lending. From a financial stability perspective,
the system’s ample liquidity (liquid assets reached 62 percent of total at end 2013) and small
loan portfolio (about $824 million or 19 percent of the total assets) provides some comfort.
Moreover, international reserves are almost double total deposits.

30.
The authorities’ strategy is to strengthen the banking sector’s contribution to
economic development. This requires developing the financial infrastructure, improving banking
and AML/CFT supervision and its enforcement. In addition, the authorities are planning to develop
the interbank market by preparing for trading of financial products, risk management tools, and
investment vehicles to strengthen financial transmission channels and help attract investment in
financial instruments. The authorities should continue developing financial system infrastructure and
services to allow further financial inclusion over the medium term by adopting policies that:
(i) promote further use of mobile banking services and microfinance lending; (ii) encourage bank
penetration in rural areas; (iii) increase financial literacy among the public; and (iv) assure adequate
financial consumer protection. In addition, addressing the factors that may be restraining bank
lending would enhance financial inclusion, which is discussed below.

5

As of end 2013, the banking system—comprising twelve fully licensed commercial banks and four branches of
foreign banks with about 390 bank branches throughout the country—had assets of $4.3 billion total, deposits
of $3.7 billion and an average loan-to-deposit ratio of 22.6 percent.
6

One state-owned bank has negative capital, which is being addressed.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

31.
The authorities are determined to strengthen the central bank’s financial
supervision department (FSD). The central bank adopted a five-year strategic plan and a new
organizational structure for FSD. FSD has increased its staffing significantly and is now in the process
of filling the remaining vacancies, streamlining internal procedures, enhancing on-site and off-site
supervision (including AML/CFT supervision), and improving information exchange with the financial
intelligence unit, Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Afghanistan (FinTRACA),
to support improved economic governance. The central bank has also prepared policies and
procedures to enhance its staff’s legal protection against liability. Staff welcomed these
developments and stressed the importance of protecting FSD staff performing their duties in good
faith, transparent and merit-based recruitment, training, and implementation of the five-year
strategic plan. Staff also noted that there remained scope to follow up more consistently on
enforcement letters and monitor progress. The authorities concurred, while noting political
pressures on central bank management to hire unqualified staff and stressing the need for
continued technical assistance.
32.
The authorities expressed concern about banks’ reluctance to lend. Although credit
to the private sector increased in 2013 for the first time since the Kabul Bank crisis, part of the
increase reflected valuation changes on foreign exchange denominated loans and credit growth
over the past few years has been low. Staff noted that the low level of private credit—equivalent to
only 4 percent of GDP—reflected the scarcity of profitable lending opportunities, given limited
information available on potential borrowers and the difficulty in realizing collateral or collecting
loans from delinquent borrowers, rather than low supply of funds. Therefore, staff recommended
that policies to promote credit should address structural issues that inhibit lending rather than
forcing banks to lend (see Selected Issues Paper). Moving from traditional relationship-based
lending to larger scale, market-oriented lending would require: (i) strengthening the legal
infrastructure and contract enforcement;7 (ii) enforcing prudential regulations to protect depositors’
funds from excessive risk taking and conflicts of interest by banks; (iii) promoting transparent
financial reporting by banks; (iv) instituting comprehensive and efficient credit information agencies;
and (v) banks establishing sound lending practices that include a robust credit assessment of
borrowers. It will also support improved access to finance, connect more people to the modern
economy, and help spread the benefits of growth.8 The central bank agreed with using marketbased measures to promote efficient credit allocation and improve access to finance.
33.
The authorities wish to implement a deposit insurance program, but staff warned
about risks of moral hazard given current weakness in banks and banking supervision. Staff
noted that deposit insurance would only improve confidence in the banking sector if accompanied

7

Priority areas include registration of titles to immovable property, improving security interests in collateral, securing
priority interests in insolvency, and training the judiciary in banking issues.

8

Bank penetration is low with less than 10 percent of the adult population holding an account at, or taking loans
from, a formal institution. Furthermore, there were only 1.8 bank branches per 100,000 adults in Afghanistan in 2011,
compared to 8.5 in Pakistan and 29.1 in Iran.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by robust banking supervision that ensured consistent adherence to prudential requirements and
stronger corporate governance in the banking sector.
34.
The authorities were concerned about international correspondent banking
relationships. Some Afghan banks were encountering difficulties in establishing or maintaining
international correspondent relationships, especially U.S. dollar accounts. Staff noted that passage
of FATF-compliant AML/CFT legislation and stronger financial sector governance would help Afghan
banks to maintain and establish correspondent relationships.

D. Business Environment
35.
The business environment remains challenging despite recent improvements, due
to deficiencies in economic governance. Afghanistan improved its World Bank Doing Business
2014 ranking to 164 (out of 189 economies), from an adjusted rank of 170 the previous year, by
facilitating business licensing and improving access to credit thanks to a unified collateral registry.
Significant challenges remain, though, across many dimensions such as protecting investors, trading
across borders, registering property, enforcing contracts, and dealing with construction permits.9
Corruption is reportedly high, with a rank of 175 out of 177 countries in Transparency International’s
Corruption Perceptions Index in 2013. Afghanistan scored only 2.7 on the World Bank’s 2012
Country Performance Ratings—a scorecard assessing the policy and institutional development
among IDA-eligible countries—about 1.5 standard deviations below the mean of 3.2. Hence,
strengthening economic governance has been an important pillar of the Fund’s engagement.
36.
Staff and the authorities saw improved governance as critical to raising growth
and creating jobs. A business environment conducive to private sector-led growth, a more efficient
judicial system, and decisive steps to counter economic crimes would facilitate the entry of new
businesses, improve access to finance, bolster investment and construction, help enforce contracts,
and ease international trade. Over time, such an environment would reduce the economy’s
dependence on donor support and promote regional integration.
37.
Measures to improve governance have focused on establishing and enhancing
institutions, legal reform, improving transparency and accountability, and capacity building,
but progress has been slow. The authorities see improved governance as critical to reduce the
economy’s dependence on donor support and to promote regional integration. An economic crimes
road map setting out Afghanistan’s economic governance framework was endorsed by cabinet in
February 2013. Several laws seeking to improve economic governance—such as the banking,
AML/CFT laws, and provisions on governance of state-owned enterprises—are advanced in the
legislative process. Staff emphasized that concerted efforts to ensure effective and swift
implementation of these laws, as well the economic crimes road map and other governance and
transparency recommendations, including those set out in the Independent Monitoring and
9

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

Evaluation Commission’s (IMEC) report on the Kabul Bank crisis, is of paramount importance.
Improved governance, along with macroeconomic stability and a better business environment,
would open opportunities for all to take part in economic growth, leading to higher living standards,
lower poverty, and improved social outcomes.

E. Promoting Inclusive Growth and Protecting the Poor
38.
As a resource-scarce economy, Afghanistan has relied so far on public sector
spending and donor inflows to promote growth and development. The strategy has consisted in
investing in public goods to enable economic activity and in human capital to boost productivity.
Large investments have been made in infrastructure; roads now connect major markets, and access
to electricity, water, and communication has improved dramatically. Access to and use of education
has expanded participation in a modernizing economy. While public infrastructure and social
services have increased physical and human capital, there are limits to this public sector-led growth
model.
39.
Sustained and inclusive growth will require continued progress on a broad
structural reform agenda to foster private sector activity. The authorities were confident that
promising drivers of growth included agriculture and rural development, public infrastructure and
services, extractive industries, and the energy sectors. They were keen to promote private sector
growth and employment outside the security sector and government through further reforms
focused on revenue generation, financial sector development, and the business environment.
40.
Several MDGs were met since 2010 while others are on track for 2015. Along with
increased spending on health, education, and irrigation, noteworthy progress was made to increase
school enrollment for children, raise the ratio of girls to boys in secondary education, reduce infant
and child mortality rates, increase the immunization rate against measles, and lower the rate of
tuberculosis.
41.
Pro-poor spending has been rising, and the authorities remain committed to
protecting such spending even as they weigh priorities within a limited resource envelope.
The ECF arrangement included a floor on pro-poor spending, which currently stands at about
2 percent of GDP. The authorities noted that the definition of pro-poor spending in the budget was
rather narrow, since it comprised only the ministries of education, health, and social affairs (about
40 percent of non-security/non-development outlays), and indicated that in reality, almost all
government spending favored the poor. The new law on martyrs and disabled will further increase
pro-poor spending by 0.7 percent of GDP per year starting in 2014.

F. Statistical Issues
42.
Data provision has shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
quality and timeliness of monetary, fiscal, and price data are broadly adequate, although coverage
could be improved. Fiscal accounts cover only the central government. Limited data on the public
enterprises are available, but qualitative information suggests that some of the largest enterprises
are operating at a loss and represent a potential fiscal risk. Data on national accounts, balance of
payments, and social indicators also suffer from weaknesses in coverage and consistency. Fund
technical assistance, including from the IMF’s Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center, is
being provided to strengthen statistical data systems. Recent improvements include a launch of a
new, updated CPI (Box 4) and publication in the IMF Balance of Payments Statistics yearbook 2013
of Afghanistan’s official balance of payments compiled by the central bank.

POLICIES FOR 2014
43.
In 2014, the authorities intend to continue to maintain macroeconomic stability,
bolster domestic revenues, safeguard the financial system, and enhance economic
governance. On the macroeconomic front, they plan to increase fiscal space, manage reserve
money growth, maintain international reserves, and keep inflation in single digits. Fiscal reforms
will focus on improving revenue administration and preparing for successful VAT implementation.
Financial sector reforms will focus on strengthening bank supervision and promoting financial
development, while governance reform will strengthen the AML/CFT regime and the legislative
and institutional framework to combat economic crime.

A. Macroeconomic Policy Mix
44.
The adopted 2014 budget incorporates a sharp increase in operating expenditure,
as donors transfer spending on budget as part of the security transition. The increase
(4.4 percentage points of GDP) will be largely financed by grants, as well as by higher expected
domestic revenue (by 0.8 percent of GDP) on account of past tax policy measures, better
administration, and revenue measures being introduced in 2014; nonetheless, revenue collection is
expected to continue to be affected by low activity and investment, and a shift away from high tariff
imports and additional revenue measures will likely be needed to achieve the 2014 revenue target,
which are under consideration by the authorities. Pro-poor spending is projected to increase as a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

share of GDP, as the new law on pensions for martyrs and the disabled is implemented.
Management of spending brought on-budget (previously externally managed) will be improved by
implementing IMF technical assistance recommendations on public financial management.

The authorities plan to manage money growth, safeguard international reserves,
and continue with exchange rate flexibility. A modest pick-up in money demand is anticipated
after the April 2014 elections. Reserve money growth of 12.7 percent is projected, above the
projected growth of nominal GDP, with a commensurate increase in NIR as credit growth is
projected to be low. Reserve cover will remain above seven months of imports. The exchange rate
will be allowed to move along with market trends, with interventions limited to avoiding excessive

Box 4. Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s New Consumer Price Index
The introduction of a new Consumer Price Index (CPI) in 2012 was a major achievement. Along with
the exchange rate, the CPI is a highly visible economic indicator. Overcoming many obstacles, the Central
Statistical Organization (CSO) has been compiling and publishing price indices for the Kabul (since 2002),
and five other major cities (since 2004). A national CPI was compiled by aggregating the city level indices.
While broadly adequate for economic surveillance, this CPI suffered from numerous shortcomings. Because
it was the most timely and reliable, the Kabul-city CPI was used to monitor the IMF-supported economic
program.

Over the past few years, the CSO strengthened
price statistics and launched a new CPI in June
2012. With IMF technical assistance, the CSO has
improved the index through a broader geographical
coverage, updated weights, an enlarged consumer
basket, and an updated compilation methodology.

Khost


The weight structure has been updated. The old index was based on a 1992 Kabul
expenditure survey. This expenditure pattern was used in all provinces and the national index was
constructed based on population weights. Taking advantage of detailed household expenditure data from
the 2008 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA), the CSO updated and differentiated the
weights, basing them on provincial-level household expenditure patterns. In compliance with international
good practice, expenditure weights are now used to compile the national CPI.

The consumer basket has been expanded and the Classification of Individual
Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP) consistently applied. 92 additional items were included in
the basket, bringing the total to 290, and effort was made to clarify the specification of individual items and
control for quality variations. The final index is now disseminated in the internationally-used COICOP
classification. Detailed correspondence matrices had to be prepared from NRVA items to real-world basket
item to COICOP categories.

There is no break in the series linking the old and new CPIs. The base of new CPI is March
2011 and April 2012 is the first month based on the new methodology. Between March 2011 and March
2012 the new index is chain-linked and scaled to make it comparable to the old one.
The CSO plans to continue to improve the index. It plans to expand its coverage, upgrade the IT system
and communication channels with remote provinces, strengthen quality control, improve field supervision
over price collectors and regional data validation, and hire and train more staff. In recognition of the quality
of the new CPI, the Afghan government and the IMF started using it for ECF program monitoring.

B. Fiscal Reforms
46.
Fiscal reform in 2014 will be focused on preparing the VAT introduction by
mitigating implementation risks and preparing the private sector. By December 2014, the
authorities plan to have advanced all mitigation activities to address the 20 risks rated “high” or
above in the December 2011 VAT Implementation Risk Management Plan, and conducted all
communication and training activities to publicize the VAT’s introduction and operation, prepare
taxpayers and other stakeholders, and obtain their buy-in in line with the March 2013 VAT
Stakeholder Management Plan. They also plan to execute the pre-implementation compliance
program, as laid out in the May 2013 VAT Compliance Strategy Action Plan. The authorities also will
continue to move ahead in implementing a fiscal regime for the natural resources sector.
47.
The authorities will continue to strengthen customs administration. They plan to
improve the import valuation system and preserve its integrity by: (i) implementing the Tariff and
Valuation Management Tool (TARVAL), including the identified vehicle value approach, with a view
to covering 85 percent of imports; and (ii) linking it to the valuation module of ASYCUDA World to
minimize interference with the valuation parameters. The valuation database has been updated
successfully including the identified vehicle value approach. This has been transferred to TARVAL
and the top 200 commodities that cover almost 85 percent of customs revenue. It is currently being
implemented at Kabul customs and will be rolled out to all customs units in the coming weeks. To
complement these changes, the authorities intend to centralize the jurisdiction over valuation issues
in an appropriately resourced and trained unit. The customs department has recently recruited four
local valuation specialists through a World Bank funded project to further improve the performance
of the valuation unit.
48.
Several reforms are planned in budget management. These include: (i) requiring line
ministries to prepare and submit financial plans to the finance ministry (a process which started in
December 2013 has been completed) and linking budget allotments to these plans; (ii) rolling out,
by March 2014, a Purchasing Module to 11 additional ministries to enhance the capability to
manage contracts and associated budgets, following a pilot in two large ministries in 2013; and
(iii) using electronic transfers for salaries and contractual payments, for which preparations are well
advanced.

C. Financial Sector Reforms
49.
The central bank intends to continue to strengthen the FSD. The FSD’s five-year
strategic plan was approved in June 2013 and FSD management is establishing institutional
arrangements to start the plan implementation. In line with the plan, increasing supervisory
resources will continue with the aim of filling at least 95 percent of the 145 authorized staff positions
in the department in full compliance with its human resources policies. Also, steps will be taken to
strengthen off-site surveillance (including automation of supervisory reporting) and to enhance the
on-site examination process. The Supervisory Enforcement Committee will continue its regular
reviews of banks’ compliance with FSD’s supervisory orders, and performance indicators developed

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

for the central bank’s operations report to parliament will help management monitor progress.
Finally, in line with Afghanistan’s laws, the central bank will strengthen its policies to protect central
bank staff from civil damages and indemnification of legal costs when conducting their duties in
good faith.
50.
The authorities will promote financial market development. The draft sukuk law,
currently reviewed by the ministry of justice, is expected to be submitted to parliament later in 2014.
In the meantime, a sukuk implementation plan is to be developed, including identification of assets
to back sukuks and preparation of the necessary legislation and regulations on capital market and
securities issuance in line with international standards for Islamic finance. The central bank intends
to promote secondary trading with existing instruments, starting with capital notes; in this regard, it
plans to work with the Afghan Bankers Association to guide discussions with dealers on the protocol
for agreeing and executing trades—a “code of conduct”—to be adopted by end-2014.
51.
Central bank operations will be strengthened. With the recent revaluation gains, the
central bank is no longer undercapitalized and the new capitalization framework (part of the
amendments to the central bank law) is being reviewed and will be submitted to parliament to
ensure it remains so, thereby preventing monetary policy from being affected by capital or income
considerations. Proposed amendments to the central bank law will also enhance legal underpinnings
of central bank operations. Separately, consistent with its by-laws, the Financial Disputes Resolution
Commission is planning to publish the findings of financial disputes on its website to increase
financial sector transparency. The central bank is developing its operations report to parliament (to
become part of its annual report), which will enable legislators to evaluate and monitor progress,
inter alia, in hiring, promoting, training, and remunerating staff in accordance with its human
resources policies and deploying them efficiently.
52.
The authorities will continue efforts to resolve Kabul Bank cases and recover
related assets. Appeals against sentences against the two main persons indicted in the bank’s
collapse, as well as applications for additional and longer sentences and related confiscation orders,
are being pursued. The appeals, if successful, will assist in asset recovery efforts. The authorities will
also pursue resolution of the existing and new mutual legal assistance requests. After the authorities
approve the successful bidder for NKB, the central bank will undertake fit and proper checks on the
successful bidder and proceed with the privatization. Staff urged the authorities to step up Kabul
Bank asset recovery efforts and privatize New Kabul Bank expeditiously or, if it cannot be sold, it
should be liquidated, providing that government salary payments remain unaffected.

D. Economic Governance
53.
The authorities plan to take several economic governance measures. The ECTF will
coordinate and implement economic governance measures set out in the economic crimes
roadmap. The authorities intend to enact FATF-consistent AML/CFT legislation and adopt a national
strategy that will include money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments; measures to
investigate and confiscate the proceeds of crime; measures to enhance the transparency of legal
persons and non-profit organizations; and implementation of a risk-based AML/CFT supervisory

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

regime. The authorities also plan to implement a regime for the declaration of cross-border
transportation of currency, negotiable bearer instruments, and gold with the necessary enforcement
mechanisms.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE ECF-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM
10

54.
This section discusses program developments since the first review of the ECF
arrangement was completed in June 2012. Performance was not in line with the targets set at the
first review, due to unanticipated shocks that hit the economy, an inadequate policy response, and
delays in structural reform implementation caused by opposition to some reforms and capacity
constraints. This delayed completion of program reviews. Discussions on the second review of the
program were not concluded because key quantitative targets were missed, implementation of
some structural benchmarks was delayed, and revenue targets for 2013 were not agreed. A January
2013 mission reached agreement on a path to complete the second and third ECF arrangement
reviews. However, performance in early 2013 was significantly weaker than planned and not all prior
actions were implemented, so completion of the reviews could not be recommended.
55.
Weaker economic conditions necessitated a revision of the policy framework in
May 2013. The revised informal framework recognized the larger economic shock resulting from the
withdrawal of international troops and greater transition uncertainties. Accordingly, it envisaged a
more gradual adjustment with lower revenue, expenditure, net international reserves (NIR), and
money growth targets to help preserve macro-stability, while providing a framework to build a track
record toward a possible review.
56.
Despite corrective measures taken by the authorities in the second half of the
year, important targets under the revised informal framework were missed in 2013. This
performance, especially the shortfall in budget revenue and delays in structural reform, as well as
the limited expected term of the government means a review cannot be completed currently and
the ECF arrangement is scheduled to end in November 2014. Budget revenue was Af 5.1 billion
(0.4 percent of GDP) below the target set in May. The end-year reserve money target was missed by
3 percent, although the excess corresponded to larger-than-programmed accumulation of NIR
($885 million above the adjusted target) and did not result in higher inflation.
57.
Progress was made in structural reform efforts, but implementation was slower
than planned. In particular, capacity constraints and opposition from groups that believed the
reforms would hurt their interests continued to be an obstacle. Nevertheless, 20 of 25 structural

10

The IMF Executive Board was informed about developments under the program in an Informal Country Matters
meeting held on July 26, 2013 and through assessment letters circulated in June 2013 and January 2014.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

benchmarks planned between June 2012 and December 2013 were completed, some with delays.11
Noteworthy accomplishments included: publishing the inquiry into the Kabul Bank crisis; submitting
the new banking, VAT, and tax administration laws to parliament; advancing preparations for
implementation of the VAT; strengthening border control management; submitting a new sukuk
debt instruments law to the ministry of justice for review; and adopting a strategic plan for financial
supervision. The five outstanding benchmarks are: (i) submitting to parliament the laws on AML/CFT;
(ii) submitting to parliament amendments to central bank legislation aligning provisions on the
calculation and allocation of net income with international good practice; (iii) completing the
transfer of taxpayers from the medium and small taxpayer offices to the large taxpayer office;
(iv) strengthening the policies to inform central bank supervisory staff about their duties, functions,
and protections from liability available; and (v) amending the Economic Crimes Task Force’s advice
to the Criminal Law Review Working Group on categories of economic offences to be included in
the new consolidated penal code to include additional offenses.
58.
Preparations for the VAT are progressing more slowly than planned. The draft law
on the VAT, consistent with Fund advice, was submitted to parliament with a delay (in May 2013) but
passage has been delayed and parliament is discussing possible changes to the draft law. These
delays reflect opposition from within the government and parliament. As a result, the timing of
introduction of the new tax remains uncertain and one year will be needed to prepare the VAT’s
introduction after parliament’s approval of the law. In the meantime, the VAT implementation plan
has been started, and the draft law on tax administration, which is necessary to administer the VAT,
has been submitted to parliament.12 Prospective taxpayers have been identified and moved to the
large taxpayer office.
59.
In the financial sector, the authorities worked on privatization of New Kabul Bank
(NKB), the new banking law, and strengthening financial supervision. The new banking law was
submitted to parliament in February 2013, but needs some amendments which it is hoped will be
incorporated while the law is discussed by parliament. The law will help enhance supervisory
oversight over the financial sector by strengthening corporate governance, prudential requirements,
enforcement measures, and bank resolution. The higher minimum paid-in capital requirement for
banks has been enforced. The DAB approved a five-year strategic plan to strengthen banking
supervision in June 2013 and a new organizational structure is being implemented. The first attempt
to privatize NKB was not successful and the one bid received did not meet the tender requirements.
A second tender was conducted in late-2013 and two bids that met the tender requirements were
received, and a recommendation for sale to the winning bid (which expires in mid-April) was
11

In two cases, the authorities have indicated that the benchmark has been met and staff has requested information
to confirm their implementation (completing the transfer of taxpayers from the medium and small taxpayer offices to
the large taxpayer office and the Economic Crimes Task Force’s advice to the Criminal Law Review Working Group on
categories of economic offences to be included in the new consolidated penal code).

12

The plan includes key tasks and milestone dates for system, procedural and personnel development, a governance
structure, a change management strategy, a stakeholder management strategy, including taxpayer preparation, and
an initial compliance strategy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

submitted to the cabinet. However, so far the sale has not been approved, because cabinet regarded
the price offered as low and the political circumstances (elections) were not viewed as conducive to
privatization.
60.
The program of asset recovery and resolution of Kabul Bank continued, but at a
13
slow pace. The government reported that between June 30, 2013 and February 28, 2014, cash
recoveries amounted to $6.6 million, which together with other and earlier recoveries increased total
recoveries to $175 million—leaving $738.7 million in outstanding claims. Difficulties in finding
buyers for domestic assets, ascertaining legal documentation of property ownership, appeals of the
verdicts in criminal cases, and slow progress in recovering assets held overseas continued to impede
asset recovery. Requests for mutual legal assistance were sent to six countries, with four more
requests being planned (Box 5). In March 2013, the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court
established by the president convicted all 21 indicted individuals, including for misuse of property,
abuse of authority, or failure to report irregularities. The government appealed to seek longer
sentences and additional convictions and related confiscation orders to assist with the recovery
of assets overseas. The Special Tribunal identified 29 additional suspects, not yet indicted, for
investigation.
61.
Several measures were taken to improve economic governance. The authorities
prepared amendments to the company law to strengthen oversight by the finance ministry over
state-owned corporations. The inquiry report of the IMEC into the Kabul Bank crisis was published.
Revised AML/CFT legislation, designed to comply with the FATF standard, is being discussed by the
cabinet, but has been delayed by the need for detailed discussion of the content of the laws. The
authorities are considering approaching the international community to request time for this
discussion to be completed. The capacity of FinTRACA was strengthened; registration and reporting
by money service providers is being enforced; and inter-agency coordination through memoranda
of understanding on information sharing between AML/CFT stakeholders was improved. An
economic crimes roadmap setting out a comprehensive economic governance framework was
endorsed by the cabinet in February 2013, and an ECTF under the chairmanship of the economy
minister was established to oversee its implementation. The ECTF has advised on economic crimes
to be included in the draft consolidated penal code, consistent with the FATF standard and the
roadmap.
62.
Despite delays in program reviews, staff and the authorities agreed on a set of
informal quantitative targets and policy actions for 2014 to facilitate close engagement and
provide a policy framework during the election period. Staff noted that adherence to the agreed
framework would send a positive signal to domestic and international stakeholders and build a track
record of implementing economic policies.

13

Following the request made by Executive Directors at the time of the first ECF review, quarterly reports on Kabul
Bank recovery have been prepared and published by the authorities and have been circulated to the IMF Board for its
information. The most recent update was part of the assessment letter circulated to the Board in January 2014.

Box 5. Kabul Bank Asset Recovery and Resolution
This box reviews developments since June 2012 in asset recovery and resolution of Kabul Bank.
A public inquiry into the Kabul Bank crisis was published by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption
Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (IMEC) on November 15, 2012, see www.mec.af/files/knpir-final.pdf.
The IMEC report made 48 recommendations to improve governance, the regulatory environment,
supervision and enforcement, investigation and law enforcement, judicial proceedings, recoveries, the sale of
New Kabul Bank, and on the monitoring and reporting requirements relating to the recommendations made
by IMEC.
The government and the central bank have responded to the inquiry’s recommendations.
Recommendations directed to the central bank are almost fully reflected in the central bank FSD’s Strategic
Plan. Of the 18 recommendations that apply specifically to central bank, 14 have been implemented or
largely implemented, 3 have been partially implement and fuller implementation is underway, and one was
rejected as inappropriate (limiting shareholdings of a bank to no more than 10 percent). The preparation of
new laws on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (currently being considered
by Cabinet) were designed to overcome some of the reporting and compliance issued identified by the
report. The government’s response included the creation of the Economic Crimes Task Force to implement
the national strategy to combat economic crime, plans to sell New Kabul Bank and to consider other
recommendations, where possible although some recommendations could not be commented on because
there were pending or possible court cases.
Asset recovery has proceeded. Cash recoveries amounted to $46.7 million between June 4, 2012 and
February 28, 2014. The bulk of these recoveries were the proceeds from the sale of villas in Dubai that were
taken over by the Kabul Bank receivership. The Kabul Bank receivership had $1,011 million in potentially
recoverable assets on August 31, 2010, of which $175 million had been recovered in cash or equivalent as of
February 28, 2014.1 In addition, assets with a book value of $59.6 million had been recovered and were
available for sale and approved reduction amounted to $97.4 million. Starting in September 2012, the
ministry of finance and central bank have published quarterly updates on asset recoveries and Kabul Bank
resolution issues (see www.centralbank.gov.af and www.mof.gov.af).
The criminal trials related to Kabul Bank began in November 2012 and verdicts were issued in March
2013, which are being appealed. The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court, established by President Karzai,
began its deliberations at public hearings and issued verdicts in March 2013 convicting all 21 people
charged with criminal offences. Two of the convicted received jail sentences of five years each and fines of
about $800 million. The Government, unsatisfied with the sentences, is seeking lengthier sentences for two
of those convicted and stronger confiscation orders to assist with the recovery of overseas assets and has
filed an appeal. The other defendants charged with criminal offences were also convicted and received jail
sentences of six months to four years. Further, the Special Tribunal noted there are 29 individuals identified
(but not yet indicted) for investigation for suspected involvement in Kabul Bank crimes. Requests for mutual
legal assistance were sent to six countries (France, India, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom,
and the United States), with four more requests planned.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

Box 5. Kabul Bank Asset Recovery and Resolution (Concluded)
Efforts have been made to privatize New Kabul Bank (NKB), but progress has been limited. Kabul Bank
and its successor NKB make the bulk of government salary payments and it has been essential to preserve
this capacity until other banks are able to take them over, which is linked to strengthening the payments
system. The first effort to sell NKB in early 2013 was not successful because the only bid received did not
meet the technical requirements of the tender. A second tender was held in the autumn of 2013 and two
bidders submitted bids that met the tender’s technical requirements. So far cabinet has not approved the
sale to the winning bid, which expires in mid-April. The sale of NKB to a fit and proper buyer would make an
important contribution to strengthening Afghanistan’s banking sector.
The experience with Kabul Bank resolution has been mixed. The Kabul Bank crisis underscored the need
to reform financial sector governance and for the public to be convinced that the rule of law prevails in the
financial sector to rebuild public confidence in the sector. Since 2011, the authorities’ IMF-supported
program has contained a wide set of measures to strengthen the financial sector, and institutional capacity
to deal with economic crime, including improved or new legislation, strengthening the central bank’s
supervision capacity, and measures to increase transparency, reform institutions and improve accountability.
The results have been mixed. There have been positive milestones, including strengthened supervision, a
commitment to transparently communicating with the public, and an improvement in the institutional
infrastructure to deal with economic crime. However, asset recovery, the sale of New Kabul Bank, and new
legislation (banking, AML/CFT laws) have progressed more slowly than hoped earlier and some of the
verdicts in the criminal cases were viewed by the government as inadequate.

STAFF APPRAISAL
63.
Over the past decade, Afghanistan has made enormous progress in reconstruction
and development, but remains one of the poorest countries in the world. War, security
concerns, political uncertainty, and weak institutions have limited growth and weighed on social
outcomes. 2014 is a critical year in the political and security transitions, with presidential elections
and completion of the drawdown of international troops.
64.
The authorities maintained macroeconomic stability and continued to implement
structural reforms in 2013 despite the economic shock caused by security and political
uncertainties. Inflation remained in single digits, the overall budget deficit (including grants) was
close to balance, reserves remained above 7 months of imports, and debt at a modest level. At the
same time, structural reforms continued, even if the pace was slower than planned. Donor grants
continued to finance the external and budget deficits.
65.
The economic outlook for 2014 and the transformation decade will depend on
political and security stability, continued economic reform, and donor support. The authorities
need to continue efforts to deliver on their reform commitments both to promote inclusive and

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

sustained growth and assure continued donor flows. Continued substantial support from the
international community will be needed to help maintain macroeconomic stability, support
economic reforms, and finance security and development needs. While existing international
reserves are sufficient to manage short-term pressures, in the long run, only continued prudent
macroeconomic policies, sustained reform efforts, and political and security stability will ensure
inclusive development.
66.
Despite the achievements made, vulnerabilities are high and the outlook is subject
to significant risks, mostly on the downside. Dependence on donor financing, large expenditure
needs, and a limited domestic revenue capacity, and a fragile banking system are important
vulnerabilities. Downside risks are related to adverse domestic or regional security developments,
political instability, inadequate implementation of economic policies, and donor fatigue. On the
upside, if uncertainties recede more swiftly than anticipated, growth would be higher and
development more rapid.
67.
The authorities’ economic strategy remains broadly appropriate and needs
strengthened implementation. Prudent macroeconomic policies and wide-ranging structural
reforms are needed to realize Afghanistan’s economic potential and to support successful political
and security transitions, as well as assure continued donor support. Further they will support
inclusive growth and mitigate risks by building buffers. The authorities’ economic strategy would
benefit from strengthened implementation.
68.
Sustained and inclusive growth is needed to provide job opportunities and reduce
poverty. Growth prospects hinge on implementing a prudent policy mix, enhancing service delivery,
building infrastructure—particularly roads and power—and strengthening the business
environment. This will require a radical and sustained improvement in governance. Boosting private
sector activity is key, as the public sector-based employment model will soon reach its limits given
fiscal constraints and dependence on donor financing.
69.
The macroeconomic policy mix remains appropriate, with fiscal policy (financed
by grants) supporting demand and monetary policy focused on inflation. The fiscal balance
including grants should continue to remain broadly balanced to ensure sustainability while efforts
should be stepped up to mobilize domestic revenue and further improve budget management to
ensure pro-poor and development expenditure are increased to help achieve the MDGs. To
maintain low inflation, monetary policy should continue to limit money supply growth and limit
foreign exchange interventions to mitigating temporary volatility, while continuing to maintain the
international reserves buffer.
70.
Raising domestic revenue is a priority for fiscal sustainability. In addition to
continued efforts to strengthen revenue and customs administration and increase compliance, swift
passage of the VAT and tax administration laws is required to pave the way for the introduction of
the VAT. Moreover, a fiscal regime for the natural resources sector should be promptly finalized to
ensure the government’s share of future economic rents and to attract investors into this sector. The
authorities should refrain from granting investment incentives and tax exemptions. Higher revenue

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

is essential to finance needed development and security outlays and reduce reliance on donor funding.
71.
The banking system should be strengthened to ensure its soundness and enhance its
contribution to economic development, and NKB should be sold as planned. The banking system
is vulnerable to adverse shocks, and bank credit remains low. The central bank should monitor the
banking system closely and enforce robustly prudential standards and enforcement actions, especially
for banks that are loss-making or have weak financial positions. While the regulatory framework and
the central bank’s supervision capacity have been strengthened, determined efforts continue to be
needed to assure effective banking supervision (including AML/CFT supervision). In this regard,
vigorous efforts are needed to pass and implement the new banking law and to ensure adequate
protection of central bank supervisory staff performing their duties in good faith. Further, efforts to
recover Kabul Bank assets continue to be needed to reduce the cost of the crisis to the population, to
signal determination to improve governance, and to assure continued donor financing. Selling NKB to
the highest bidder—after due diligence is completed—remains the best solution to ensure the bank’s
healthy future and to strengthen this sector.
72.
Economic governance reforms should continue to focus on improving the
business environment and strengthening the AML/CFT regime. These reforms will be critical to
supporting private sector-led growth. In particular, the AML/CFT legislation should promptly be
submitted to parliament and enacted to help combat economic crime and ensure that the banking
sector maintains its international correspondent relationships.
73.
Staff agreed with the authorities on an informal short-term policy framework for
2014. The policy framework provides for continued macroeconomic stability, with monetary policy
aimed at maintaining low inflation; fiscal policy focused on revenue mobilization; a flexible exchange
rate policy; and measures to safeguard the financial sector and strengthen economic governance.
Reaching the 2014 domestic revenue target, however, will be a challenge and will require renewed
efforts and additional revenue measures. Adherence to the agreed framework would send a positive
signal to all stakeholders.
74.
Staff intends to continue its close engagement through policy advice and
technical assistance, including within the framework provided by the ECF arrangement. The
IMF has been supporting Afghanistan through technical assistance and a three-year ECF
arrangement approved in November 2011. Although reviews were not completed since June 2012
because of an inadequate policy response and delays in structural reform, staff has maintained—and
intends to maintain—a close dialogue with the authorities on economic policy and institution
building.
75.
Afghanistan needs continued support from the international community to
maintain macroeconomic stability and support its economic reforms. The authorities need to
continue their efforts to deliver on their reform commitments under the TMAF to maintain economic
stability, lift growth, and facilitate donor flows to finance fiscal and external current account needs.
76.
It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation in accordance with the
relevant decision on the consultation cycle for members with a Fund arrangement.

ABP will continue to fulfill immigration and security responsibilities, with ACD
fulfilling all other commercial and trade-related duties; and (ii) the pilot border
management model at Hairatan will be applied fully to the Hairatan railway
border crossing. The ABP and the ACD will take full control of all railway border
crossings and the ministry of commerce and industry will only provide logistical
services at their facilities (Bandarwali).

Exchange Arrangement
Afghanistan is an Article XIV member country, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on payments and transfers for current international transactions, discriminatory currency
arrangements or multiple currency practices. Staff is currently undertaking a review of government
policies in the context of Afghanistan’s future accession to Article VIII status. The authorities
informed staff that no exchange restrictions imposed for security reasons were in place.
To conduct monetary policy, the authorities rely on foreign exchange auctions since May 2002, and
capital note auctions since September 2004. The foreign exchange auctions were initially open only
to licensed money changers, but since June 2005 they are also open to commercial banks. The
capital note auctions are open to commercial banks. Auctions are linked to the overall monetary
program and are held on a regular basis.

Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation with Afghanistan was discussed by the Executive Board on
November 14, 2011. Article IV consultations with Afghanistan are held in accordance with Decision
No. 14747-(10/96) on consultation cycles adopted on September 28, 2010, as amended.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) was subject to a
safeguards assessment with respect to the ECF arrangement approved on November 13, 2011. An
initial safeguards assessment of the DAB was completed on June 12, 2006, updated on
March 18, 2008, and then in December 2011. The latest update for the safeguards assessment found
that while most of the previous safeguards recommendations had been implemented, an effective
internal audit mechanism had still not been established and governance oversight was weak. The
assessment also made recommendations to address new risks emerging as a result of the Kabul
Bank crisis including with respect to central bank autonomy. Since the assessment, some
recommendations have been implemented, albeit with delay. In particular, a Memorandum of
Understanding on central bank capitalization has been signed and an external auditor has been
appointed. The DAB is committed to implementing the remaining safeguards recommendations,
with priority assigned to development of the internal audit function (with external support) and
strengthening of Audit Committee oversight.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 17, 2014)
IDA has committed a total of over $2.72 billion to Afghanistan since 2002. To date,
25 development and emergency reconstruction projects including 4 development policy grants have
been implemented. IDA's active portfolio comprises 19 investment projects with combined net
commitment of over $787 million, of which almost 40 percent has been disbursed.

1.

The Bank’s involvement in Afghanistan extends to its role as administrator of the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The ARTF has developed into the primary multidonor funding mechanism, financing part of the essential running costs of government as well as
key investments, including national programs in health, education, rural access, irrigation
rehabilitation, microfinance, and the National Solidarity Program. Since early 2002, 33 donors have
contributed over $6.96 billion to this fund, making it the largest contributor to the Afghan budget
for both operating costs and development programs.

2.

3.
In January 2010, the World Bank's IDA and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
agreed to support debt relief for Afghanistan. The Boards of both institutions agreed that
Afghanistan had taken the necessary steps to reach the completion point under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This will generate total debt service savings of $1.6
billion, which include $1.3 billion from the HIPC Initiative, $260 million from Paris Club creditors
beyond HIPC, and $38.4 million from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
4.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group’s private sector
development arm, continues to work with its investment partners in Afghanistan. It is following an
integrated advisory and investment strategy focused on the enabling environment for private sector
activity and supporting selective investments in sectors with high development impact and job
creation. On the investment side, IFC now has a portfolio totaling more than $131 million in five
companies. This includes commitments in the financial, telecom, and hospitality sectors. The
advisory services program, consisting of 8 active projects with a budget of $5.7 million, focuses on
access to finance, investment climate, SME capacity development, agribusiness and Public–Private
Partnerships (PPPs).
5.
Next to investment in health, education, rural development and infrastructure, one of
the primary focuses of the Bank's assistance has been to help the Afghan government with legal and
regulatory reform, establishing fiscal authority (incl. customs), and developing systems and human
resources for public financial management and the civil service as a whole. The performance of the
Ministry of Finance regarding alignment of budgetary allocations with the country's priority needs,
fiscal discipline, cash control, and aggregate transparency has contributed to macroeconomic
stability and sustained external donor assistance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

6.
ARTF and IDA projects are managed with the same attention. All projects are eligible for
processing under the Bank’s Special Considerations for fragile states and emergencies. In practice
this has proved most useful to improve flexibility post-approval as all projects are processed under
regular review procedures in order to ensure quality at entry. All Bank (IDA and ARTF) funds are
channeled through the government’s budget and project accounting and reporting occurs at the
central level.
7.
In fiscal year 2014, the World Bank Board has so far approved two IDA-financed projects
totaling $100 million. The new projects included $50 million for the Development Policy Grant and
$50 million for Access to Finance.
8.
In addition, the ARTF approved $74.8 million in recurrent-cost financing and $325 million for
Investment Window financing, including the Second Education Quality Improvement Program
($125 million) and Third Emergency National Solidarity Project ($200 million).
9.
For fiscal year 2014, planned commitments are $200 million from IDA, ensuring that the full
IDA-16 is fully utilized. The first project, Development Policy Grant for Promotion Economic Growth
and Fiscal Sustainability, was approved on August 8, 2013 for $50 million. In addition, $1 billion are
planned for operations under the ARTF including both the Investment and Recurrent Cost Windows.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JOINT MANAGEMENT
ACTION PLAN ON BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
(March 17, 2014)
1.
Joint Management Action Plan (JMAP). The Afghanistan country teams of the World Bank
(led by Mr. Saum, country director) and the IMF (led by Mr. Ross, mission chief) held consultations in
January, May, and September 2013 and in March 2014. The teams exchanged views on the recent
economic developments and their outlook, identified the macroeconomic priorities and challenges
facing Afghanistan and discussed ways to coordinate their respective work programs.
2.
2014 will be a challenging year for economic management. The uncertain security
transition and the upcoming election could affect confidence, weigh on growth and slow or distract
the reform agenda. The following areas are critical from the macroeconomic perspective in the short
and medium terms:


Sustaining macroeconomic stability. Policies should focus on revenue mobilization, improving
the effectiveness of public expenditures, containing non-priority spending and controlling the
money growth to manage inflation. A flexible exchange rate and international reserves should
help accommodate shocks. The success of this strategy is predicated to a large extent on the
continued donor flows, as pledged at the 2012 conferences in Chicago and Tokyo. The
government’s delivery on its commitments under the IMF-supported program as well as the
ARTF Incentive Program and the IDA-financed Development Policy Grant will be critical towards
sustaining donors’ confidence.



Advancing fiscal sustainability and strengthening efforts to mobilize domestic revenues.
The revenue effort faltered in 2013 and the momentum should be restored. Teams therefore
agree on the need to emphasize the introduction of the VAT and more far-reaching customs
reforms in their dialogue with authorities as measures to reverse the current trend. In the
medium term, harnessing Afghanistan’s mineral resources for development would be very
important as the big mines come on stream—a robust fiscal framework for mineral revenues
must already be in place.



Safeguarding the financial sector. Macroeconomic policies must be complemented by
prudential measures to safeguard financial stability. The banking sector is weak and should be
strengthened to be able to meaningfully contribute to economic development. Improving
banking supervision at the central bank is critical to this effort.



Strengthening economic governance. The high level of corruption and deficiencies in the rule
of law are serious constraints on growth and—in the case of Afghanistan—have the potential to
destabilize the economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN



Improving absorption capacity and government effectiveness. Budget execution rates linger
around 50 percent. Increasing on-budget aid, especially through the transfer on-budget of
security expenditures previously managed by donors, is challenging absorption capacity. More
efforts need to be undertaken in advancing public financial management (PFM) reforms,
improving the capabilities of the civil service and lifting constraints to service delivery and the
implementation of public infrastructure projects.

3.
Prioritizing reforms. Teams agreed that given the election year and the political
uncertainties of transition, 2014 will be challenging for economic reform. Hence, reforms need to be
consolidated and prioritized, along the lines discussed above.
4.
The Bank’s work program is guided by the Interim Strategy Note (ISN). The ISN,
approved by the Bank’s Board in March 2012 and spanning 2012–14, envisages that the Bank will
continue to expand its support to institutions and processes associated with transparent economic
and financial management and community-level governance, especially through the National
Solidarity Program. Regarding economic management, in 2013 and continuing into 2014, the Bank
has supported the government with technical assistance in the areas of customs reforms, mineral
resource management, and economic statistics. Under the ARTF, the Incentive Program (IP) will
provide funds ($175 million) for achievements in revenue mobilization, strengthening of PFM
systems, investment climate improvements, and custom reforms. Since January 2013, the IP has also
supported the government's operation and maintenance expenditures. This support will continue
during 2014 with financing amounting to $80 million. A Development Policy Grant Series
($100 million, half of which was disbursed in August 2013) focusing on strengthening sources of
economic growth and fiscal revenues is currently under implementation (Table 1).
5.
The Fund’s work program focuses on close engagement in the context of the ECFsupported economic program. Discussions on the second review of the program were not
concluded because key program targets were missed and implementation of some structural
benchmarks was delays. In addition, performance in early 2013 was significantly weaker than
planned and not all prior actions were implemented, so completion of the reviews could not be
recommended.
6.
In 2013, the Fund focused its efforts on helping the authorities privatize New Kabul Bank,
and advance important pieces of legislation, including the new banking law, the central bank law,
the VAT law, AML and CFT laws, law on sukuk marketable securities, and companies’ law. The Fund
has also provided advice on the monetary policy, liquidity forecasting, VAT implementation, and
customs reform. Extensive technical assistance has been provided to the central bank’s supervision
department, including to implement their new organizational structure and revise regulations. In
2014, the Fund plans to help the authorities build on these achievements, including through
strengthening economic governance, central bank capitalization framework, developing a fiscal
regime for natural resources, preparing for VAT implementation, further strengthening banking
supervision, and improving macroeconomic statistics. The Fund will continue its close engagement
with Afghanistan to ensure the stability of macroeconomic framework.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 16, 2014)
1.
Afghanistan is a founding member of Asian Development Bank (ADB), established in
1966. After a hiatus from 1980 to 2001, ADB resumed partnership with the Government of
Afghanistan in 2001. In the London and Kabul conferences in January and July 2010, respectively,
and in the Chicago (May 2012) and Tokyo (July 2012) conferences, ADB reaffirmed its long-term
development partnership with Afghanistan in the transition period (2012–14) and in the
transformation period (2015–2025) based on the government’s development strategies, which along
with national priority programs (NPPs) will remain the agreed basis for partnership in the next
decade.
2.
Current ADB operations in Afghanistan are based on the Country Operational Business
Plan (COBP), 2014–15. The COBP is fully aligned with NPPs and the government’s priorities in the
infrastructure sector—the backbone of economic and social development—with ADB’s investments
contributing to Afghanistan’s socio-economic development in the transition and transformation
period. The COBP continues ADB's focus on Afghanistan's energy, transport, and agriculture and
irrigation sectors, including economic management, sector governance, and further institutional and
human capacity development. From 2009 to 2013, ADB’s operations were underpinned by the
Country Partnership Strategy, aligned with the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (2009–
2013).
3.
By end-December 2013, ADB’s total assistance comprising grants and loans reached
$3.90 billion, of which $3.7 billion for the public sector, and $198.1 million for the private
sector. As of December 31, 2013, total cumulative lending stood at $1.02 billion consisting of
sovereign ($817.28 million) and non-sovereign ($198.10) loans. ADB is the sixth largest donor
according to the government’s 2012 Donor Cooperation Report. Since 2007, ADB has provided
assistance for the public sector on a 100 percent grants basis. Grants make more than 70 percent of
ADB’s overall assistance to Afghanistan. In the July 2012 Tokyo Conference, ADB committed another
$1.2 billion to support Afghanistan through 2016.
4.
ADB supports co-financing of its projects to increase synergies by combining the
strengths of development partners, governments, and ADB itself. As of December 31, 2013, the
cumulative direct value-added official co-financing since 2002 amounted to $76.7 million for
six investment projects and $10.5 million for 11 TA projects. The ADB managed the Afghanistan
Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF)—a co-financing modality that allows development partners to meet
the pledge of 50 percent on-budget and 80 percent alignment with NPPs as agreed in the
2010 Kabul Conference. As of December 31, 2013, the total amount received was $271.2 million
from Japan (Embassy of Japan, $110.0 million), United States (USAID, $105.0 million out of a total
commitment of $180.3 million), and United Kingdom (DFID, $56.2 million).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

5.
ADB is one of the largest donors in the transport sector. As of December 31, 2013, it has
provided $1.9 billion to construct or upgrade over 1,500 km of regional and national roads and
$31 million to rehabilitate four regional airports. All four are fully operational, with usage more than
doubled. Travel time decreased by more than half as a result of ADB-assisted projects completed in
2013. The ADB funded the first ever railway line between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, which became
fully operational in 2012. To date, over four million tons of goods have been transported through it.
ADB supported the establishment of the Afghanistan Railway Authority to regulate and ensure the
sustainability of the railway sector.
6.
ADB is the largest on-budget donor in the energy sector. To date, ADB has invested
around $883 million in Afghanistan’s energy sector, and committed an additional $950 million to
strengthen the country’s energy supply chain. ADB-assisted projects have added 590 km of
transmission lines, providing electricity to more than five million people. Ongoing projects will
generate an additional 6.8 megawatts of power, add 470 km of transmission lines, and provide
99,320 new power connections. ADB is also financing the power and gas sector master plans of the
government. ADB also supports the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (TAPI) gas project
as well as the Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan (TUTAP) electricity
project.
7.
The natural resources sector is another government priority sector assisted by ADB. In
2013, total investment reached $543 million to rehabilitate and establish new irrigation and
agricultural infrastructures, and strengthen the institutional environment to facilitate economic
growth and improve water resources management. Around 140,000 hectares of irrigated land have
been rehabilitated and upgraded. The investments have led to a more efficient use of water
resources and a rise in agricultural productivity.
8.
In economic management, ADB’s assistance has improved fiscal management through
policy, institutional and capacity-building reforms covering expenditure and revenue
management, civil service management, provincial administration, and transparency and
accountability in the public sector.
9.
ADB’s private sector operations in Afghanistan began in 2004. As of end 2013,
cumulative approvals in 6 projects amounted to $198.1 million. Total outstanding balances and
undisbursed commitments to private sector projects amounted to $9.3 million, representing
0.1 percent of ADB’s total non-sovereign portfolio as of December 31, 2013. One of the major
private sector projects is the Roshan Cellular Telecommunications Project. ADB provided financial
assistance in the form of direct loans totaling $70 million for Phase 1 and 2 of the project, as well as
B loans and a political risk guarantee. In 2008, ADB approved a direct loan of $60 million to finance
Roshan's Phase 3 expansion. In 2012, this project received an award for Excellence in Fragile States
Engagement from the U.S. Treasury. In the financial sector, ADB has invested $2.6 million in
Afghanistan International Bank (AIB), thus establishing the first private commercial bank in the postTaliban regime.

10.
ADB is an active member of the Joint Coordination Management Board (JCMB) and
the Afghanistan’s Reconstruction Trust Fund Management Committee. ADB plays an active part
in other donor coordination activities, including the JCMB Social and Economic Development
Standing Committee, the Ministry of Finance's High Level Committee on Aid Effectiveness, and the
Inter-Ministerial Committee on Energy. ADB strongly supports all international policy dialogues on
Afghanistan. Furthermore, it takes the lead in the infrastructure sector and regional corporationrelated policy dialogues. ADB is a member of the core donor group (5+3) to ensure coordination
and harmonization among donors and the government over policy reforms and development
programs. ADB consults continuously with civil society and non-governmental organizations with
regard to project design and implementation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 19, 2014)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The key
data shortcomings are in national accounts and in the external sector mainly due to
organizational weaknesses and difficult security situation.

National Accounts. The compilation broadly follows the System of National Accounts 1993
(1993 SNA). GDP is compiled by the production and expenditure approaches. Key expenditure
aggregates (household consumption, gross fixed capital formation, imports and exports) are
available, while changes in inventories are derived residually. Coverage of economic activities is
limited due to data gaps. Foreign trade data should be improved in terms of coverage, concepts,
and timeliness. The 2002–2003 base year is more than 10 years old and needs to be updated.
Price Statistics. The CSO compiles and publishes monthly consumer price indices for the
nation, the capital city Kabul, and nine other major cities. Overcoming severe security and
resource constraints, CSO has recently undertaken a major overhaul of the CPI, including
(i) implementation of full, five-digit Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP); (ii) update of consumer basket weights using data from a recent household survey
(previous weights dated back to 1987); and (iii) expansion of coverage from six to ten
cities/provinces (out of 34). While procedures generally follow good practices and compilation
methods adhere to internationally accepted standards, there is a scope for additional
improvement including further expanding coverage, upgrading the IT system and
communication channels with remote provinces, strengthening quality control and field
supervision of price collectors, as well as hiring and training more staff.

Government Finance statistics. Fiscal data are compiled for the central and general
government on cash basis based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001).
The timeliness and quality of the central and general government core budget data have been
improving, particularly after completion of the roll out and connectivity of the Afghanistan
Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to all central government line ministries and
agencies in Kabul and all provincial offices. With IMF support, the Ministry of Finance is
implementing GFSM 2001, with annual data for both above and below the line transactions being
reported. The authorities are reporting monthly GFS data to the IMF for the central government
core budget and the ministry is also working on expanding the coverage of monthly and
quarterly GFS data to general government.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN

Monetary and Financial Statistics. The scope and quality of data reporting by the central
bank have improved, and Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) produces its balance sheet on a monthly
basis. Since 2007, commercial banks have been reporting data to DAB regularly using templates
developed for the purpose of supervision and monetary statistics compilation. The IMF is
assisting DAB in bringing the reporting in compliance with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual. DAB is reporting the Standardized Report Forms for Monetary and Financial
Statistics to the IMF for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) database on a
monthly basis. A country page for Afghanistan was reintroduced in IFS in March 2008.

External sector statistics. Balance of payments statistics are compiled according to the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The quality of data has improved and was accepted
in 2013 for publication and dissemination in the IMF’s Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
and International Financial Statistics. Still, the compilation process suffers from a paucity of
source data, low organizational capacity, and limited resources. Customs coverage of overland
foreign trade could be improved and there are no reliable estimates of unrecorded border trade,
which is significant. A substantial part of donor aid is excluded from the coverage of capital
transfers. Source data to estimate services, income, transfers, foreign direct investment, and other
statistics are weak. Surveys of enterprises suffer from poor response. With support from METAC,
DAB has also started compiling international investment position (IIP) statistics, but these are not
yet provided in the TCIRS due to lack of capacity.
Regarding external debt, the reconciliation of records was completed in the context of Paris Club
rescheduling, the completion of the HIPC initiative in 2010, and subsequent debt relief. Debt
management and reporting systems are in place and functional at the Ministry of Finance.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Afghanistan has been a GDDS participant since June
2006, but its metadata has not been updated since then.

No data ROSC has been published

III. Reporting to STA

The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics, Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Adnan Mazarei and
Dhaneshwar Ghura
(IMF), Ernesto May
and Jeffrey Lewis
(IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Development
Association and the International Monetary Fund1

Afghanistan continues to be at high risk of debt distress. Although debt is modest currently,
after extensive debt relief, Afghanistan relies heavily on donor grants (43 percent of GDP in
2013, including both on and off-budget grants). Under the baseline scenario, with continued
reform and donor support, and smooth political and security transitions, debt is sustainable.
However, there are significant vulnerabilities; should growth slow, reform stall, security
deteriorate, or grant financing fall short of the projected levels, there will be a need to
implement significant compensatory measures or its debt burden would quickly become
unsustainable and Afghanistan would be at a high risk of debt distress. Accordingly, the
authorities should redouble their efforts to mobilize revenue, press ahead with their reform
efforts and raise the efficiency of public spending through careful prioritization and expenditure
rationalization where feasible. Donors should provide financing in the form of grants.

1

This DSA was prepared by IMF staff with input from World Bank, using the standard debt sustainability framework
for low-income countries (LIC-DSA); see “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries” https://www.imf.org/external/nppp/eng/2013/110513.pdf. The
updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) contains a few changes relative to the one used in 2012 when the previous
DSA was prepared. In particular, the updated DSF uses a higher discount rate (increased from 3 to 5 percent) and
includes new benchmarks for total public debt, which did not exist previously. This DSA assumes a similar
composition of external and domestic loan financing in the two alternative illustrative scenarios. The LIC-DSA
compares the evolution over the projection period of debt-burden indicators against policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, using the three-year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).
With an average 2010–12 CPIA of 2.7, Afghanistan is classified as “weak performance” under the LIC-DSF.

MACROECOOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
The outlook underlying the DSA is based on smooth security and political transitions, as
well as continued reform and donor support. This outlook is similar to the one presented in the
previous DSA of June 2012 (Box 1). The baseline assumes that the 2014 elections, as well as
subsequent ones, result in governments that pursue economic reforms and implement Afghanistan’s
development agenda, that Afghanistan’s business environment and economic governance improve
enabling private-sector-led growth, and that the security situation stabilizes. In 2012, donors
announced substantial medium-term pledges. The NATO summit in Chicago resulted in pledges to
finance Afghanistan’s security spending, estimated at around $4 billion annually over the following
decade. At the same time, donors expect that Afghanistan will make gradually increasing and
substantial contributions toward security. A second conference in Tokyo mobilized pledges for
development aid of $16 billion through 2015 and to sustain aid at similar levels through 2017.
Development aid is linked to the progress in reforms under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability
Framework. The baseline scenario assumes that the mining sector is developed, with some delays
relative to the 2012 projections, and that business environment and economic governance improve.

Growth is projected to continue and the external current account (before grants) to improve
gradually. Under this scenario, GDP growth is projected to average about 4.7 percent in the medium term
(2014–18), rise to around 6 percent in 2021 as mining production comes on-stream, and to converge to
about 4 percent in the long run (Table 1 and 2a). The main change relative to the previous DSA relates to
less buoyant foreign trade developments, due predominantly to lower projected mining activity, which
drives import and export dynamics in the outer years. The risks related to developments of extractive
industries have increased since the previous DSA because investors have signaled delays. The external

current account deficit before grants, while still large, is expected to improve gradually over the projection
period. Export capacity should increase progressively—albeit from very low levels—and some import
substitution is projected to take place. Development of the extractive industry should also contribute to
exports. At the same time, donor-financed imports are projected to grow more slowly than in the past.
Accordingly, the current account deficit should narrow gradually from about 40 percent of GDP in
2013 to about 12 percent of GDP at the end of the projection horizon (Figure 1).

3.
Given large spending needs and limited domestic revenue mobilization, total fiscal
financing needs are expected to remain large but to decline as a share of GDP. Afghanistan received
substantial grants totaling 43 percent of GDP in 2013. In the medium term, the financing gap is projected
to reach about $7.7 billion (33 percent of GDP) annually on average through 2018,2 as expenditure
pressures continue and domestic revenue mobilization remains limited. While donors have pledged
financial support for the medium term at the 2012 Chicago and Tokyo conferences, the longer-term
prospects of donor flows are less certain. In the long run, both spending needs (moderated by some
expenditure rationalization) and revenue capacity rise along with economic growth, so that on balance,
the financing gap is projected to remain at similar levels (about $7–8 billion at constant prices), but to fall
relative to the size of the economy (from about 42 percent of GDP currently to about 19 percent in 2025,
and to about 15 percent at the end of the projection horizon). Similarly, fiscal sustainability—defined as
domestic revenues covering operating spending—is likely to remain low, because of the large grantfinanced amounts being transferred on-budget (that were previously managed externally) as part of the
security transition.

2

The financing gap includes both on-budget and off-budget spending needs and is presented after residual
domestic financing and a small amount of concessional loans from multilaterals.

4.
The reduction in the size of security forces is expected to take longer than projected in the
2012 DSA.3 The baseline assumes a delay in the reduction of army and police personnel relative to the
previous DSA, but cost savings are expected to contain the overall level of security spending. As security
accounts for more than 60 percent of recurrent spending, these outlays are projected to remain
substantial, with security-related outlays projected to decline to 16.5 percent of GDP by 2018, to 13.7
percent by 2025, and stabilize at about 12 percent in the long term. Furthermore, with the on-budget
transfer of previously donor-managed spending, as well as operations and maintenance costs related to
the vast number of donor-funded projects implemented over the past decade, the growth in operating
spending is projected to exceed the growth of domestic revenue capacity.4 Finally, public spending will
also rise on account of increases in the size of the civil service needed to provide public services at levels
compatible with government ambitions to make meaningful progress towards the Millennium
3

Relative to 2012, a lower (but not yet determined) number of international troops are expected to be stationed in
Afghanistan after end-2014 and some delay in the reduction in the number of Afghan security forces.

4

The recurrent operation and maintenance costs for all assets built in Afghanistan since 2002, excluding the security
sector, are estimated at about $1 billion annually or more—and growing as new assets are being built. Sustainment
costs in the security sector are harder to estimate, but could be as high as $2 billion per year.

Development Goals.5 Given Afghanistan’s large development needs, development spending is projected
to be about 10 percent of GDP.
5.
Revenue is expected to increase, but less rapidly than in the previous DSA in the
medium term but thereafter to improve. Lower revenue during 2012–13 was caused by lower
compliance, enforcement, lower confidence, and lower import growth and economic activity due to
political and security uncertainties. Furthermore, because of delays in the parliamentary submission
and passage of the draft VAT law, the introduction of the VAT has been delayed relative to the
March 2014 date envisaged in the previous DSA. As a result, by 2018 the ratio of domestic revenues
to GDP may only reach 13.8 percent. Finally, delays in mining projects will negatively affect the
medium-term revenue outlook. The revenue impact of these delays is expected to be made up in
the long run as the delays are overcome and revenue efforts are bolstered; domestic revenues will
reach the level envisaged in the previous DSA by 2025. Additional measures and/or improved
compliance will be needed to catch up with the normative projection for domestic revenues of
17 percent of GDP by 2025, and of 20 percent of GDP by mid 2030s that would bring Afghanistan’s
revenue-to-GDP ratio to that of a typical low income country. Accordingly, the baseline scenario
assumes that (i) there will be delays in VAT introduction with an initial yield of 1½-2 percent of GDP;
(ii) excise taxes will be introduced in 2018 and yield 1 percent of GDP in additional revenues; (iii) tax
and customs administration reforms will be adequately implemented; and (iv) a fiscal regime for
natural resources will be implemented ensuring that the government receives a reasonable share of
economic rents.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
Following extensive debt relief in 2006, Afghanistan’s debt is modest currently.
Afghanistan’s external public and publicly guaranteed debt is estimated to have amounted to
$1.3 billion, or 6.1 percent of GDP, at the end of 2013 (Table 1), almost all owed to multilateral
creditors.6 It is equivalent to 3.1 percent of GDP in present value (PV) terms, and to about 20 percent
of exports and 33 percent of government revenues (Table 2). Under the baseline scenario—in which
Afghanistan’s financing needs, net of residual domestic financing, are entirely met by grants—the
present value of public external debt would be about 3.8 percent of GDP by the end of the projection
period, while the total public debt would be 17 percent, both below the indicative debt-burden
threshold applicable to a country like Afghanistan.7

5

Wage restraint is also assumed, with the wage growth rate limited to 1 percentage point over inflation.

6

This debt stock is after delivery of the already-pledged debt relief commitments and excluding some minimal
amounts of non-yet-reconciled or disputed debt. Afghanistan is still following up with one Paris Club creditor on its
debt relief commitments, as well as with several non-Paris Club creditors on debt relief on comparable terms. In
terms of debt structure and composition: apart from a small amount of legacy debt (less than 1 percent of total),
most of the external debt is owed to multilateral institutions, mainly regional and international financial institutions.

7

Under the DSA framework, the debt thresholds for countries with similar economic performance and income level
as Afghanistan are: for the PV of debt—30 percent of GDP, 100 percent of exports, and 200 percent of revenues; for
debt service, 15 percent of exports and 18 percent of revenues.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7.
However, Afghanistan remains at high risk of external debt distress because of
risks to grant financing or because growth may be lower than projected. As illustrated by the
two customized illustrative scenarios below, Afghanistan faces significant risks and debt thresholds
could be breached.8 These two scenarios focus on the debt dynamics generated by one shock—a
downward shift in either the growth or the grant path—to highlight the effects of these shocks. They
do not take into account second round effects on trade, security, interest rates, and (in the lower
grant scenario) growth. Consequently, the resulting debt dynamics as well as the overall assessment
of Afghanistan’s macroeconomic conditions and aid dependency lead to a rating of a high risk of
debt.9 However, if the political transition proceeds smoothly and macroeconomic conditions
continue to improve, the external risk rating may be lowered in future DSAs.
8.
Customized illustrative scenarios are necessary to take into account Afghanistan’s
unique circumstances. The two customized illustrative scenarios discussed in paragraphs 7, 9, and
10 are tailored to the specific circumstances of Afghanistan (see Table 2 for key scenario
assumptions). In contrast, the standard shocks generated by the Debt Sustainability Framework are
mostly driven by the past ten years. While for many countries the recent past might be a useful
guide for projections, Afghanistan’s recent history—with average real GDP growth of 9.3 percent
and official transfers of 50.6 percent of GDP over the past ten years—may have less utility as a guide
for the future. The high GDP growth represented a catch-up from a low post-conflict base, and while
large grant financing has been committed for the medium term, its projected magnitude is less (as a
share of GDP) than grants received over the past decade, which were exceptionally large and
frontloaded to finance post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction. Due to recent history, the
standard shocks only result in one breach of the debt thresholds (the PV of debt to exports during
this decade).10 Hence, to examine debt sustainability with plausible downside risks, two customized
illustrative scenarios and related frameworks were developed. While the standard DSF shocks are
included in the accompanying figures and tables, they lead to benign debt dynamics. In this light,
the external and overall risk ratings are guided by risks identified and laid out in the customized
illustrative scenarios.

8

This DSA assumes that, following introduction of domestic debt instruments (sukuks) expected in 2014–15,
Afghanistan will have some (limited) domestic borrowing capacity. While under the baseline, sukuks are intended
to be mainly for liquidity management and market development purposes, under the alternative scenarios, the
government is assumed to borrow domestically up to the maximum level of 40 percent of GDP in the low grant
scenario, after which government borrowing rates would increase exponentially while the exchange rate would start
slipping as a result of current account imbalances and market pressures induced by the domestically financed fiscal
deficit.

9

This treatment is line with paragraph 73 of the LIC-DSF Guidance Note (footnote 1).

10

The PV of debt to exports threshold is breached when net official transfers and net FDI are one standard deviation
below their historical average (Figure 3). The shock is applied to two years (2015–2016) and thereafter the PV of debt
to exports declines.

1/ It is assumed donors' off-budget spending is moved on budget by 2020, except for residual development spending,
assumed to amount to 2 percent of GDP.
2/ Includes for treasury liquidity buffer, residual domestic debt issuance and sale of non-financial assets.
3/ Includes both on- and off-budget grants as well as projects managed directly by donors.
4/ Difference to baseline mostly due to higher interest payments.
5/ Lower growth in 2014-2033 results in nominal GDP in 2033 being about one third lower than in the baseline
scenario. Differences with the baseline scenario are principally due to the limited compression of government
expenditure despite lower GDP growth, reflecting an effort to maintain public services, and to higher interest
payments.

The “lower grants” customized illustrative scenario assumes a substantial drop in
grants starting in 2017. While donors are expected to follow through with their current pledges,
this illustrative scenario assumes that lack of progress in reforms, subsequent donor fatigue, and/or
a shift in donors’ priorities lead to a gradual reduction in aid beginning in 2017 and reaching
50 percent by 2021 and beyond, compared to the baseline. At the same time, it is assumed that the
level of public services envisaged in the baseline scenario is preserved11, and additional revenue is
not mobilized. In this illustrative scenario, nominal GDP levels are similar to the baseline scenario,
imports are slightly lower because there is a shift in government expenditure away from imported
goods resulting in a small decline in the domestic revenue to GDP ratio, and expenditure is higher
because of additional interest payments. The resulting financing gap is covered with nonconcessional external loans and domestic borrowing; the latter is capped at 40 percent of GDP.12
Under this scenario, debt burden indicators deteriorate rapidly, breaching virtually every threshold.
The PV of external debt would reach 94 percent of GDP, or over 340 percent of exports, by the end
of the projection period. The PV of total public debt would reach 131 percent of GDP, around
525 percent of revenues, and the debt-service-to-revenue ratio more than 50 percent (Figure 4).
10.
The “low growth” customized illustrative scenario assumes a lower GDP output
path. This illustrative scenario assumes that economic governance and business environment
reforms stall, while the political and security conditions remain uncertain, reducing confidence,
discouraging investment, and resulting in lower growth. As a result, annual GDP growth is projected
to be 2.5 percentage points lower than in the baseline during 2015–33—negatively affecting
domestic revenues. Afghanistan’s history over the past few decades suggests a risk of long-term
political instability, which could durably impact growth, investment, capital inflows, and the
development of the extractive resource sector. In this illustrative scenario, lower growth in 2014–
2033 results in nominal GDP in 2033 being about two thirds lower than in the baseline scenario.
Domestic revenue is projected to grow slightly faster than nominal GDP, while limited compression
of government expenditure results in expenditure growing much faster than GDP, because it is
assumed that the level of public services is broadly preserved, in particular the wage bill, and also
higher interest payments add to expenditure. Borrowing (non-concessional external loans and
domestic borrowing) is used to fill the financing gap. Domestic debt is assumed to increase by
1 percentage point of GDP each year, reaching 20 percent of GDP in 2033. While this scenario is less
adverse than the outright cut in grants—the PV of external debt would reach about 41 percent of
GDP in 2033—it would again lead to a breach of all but one threshold (Figure 3). Furthermore, the
PV of total public debt-to-GDP would also be breached around the end of the next decade.

11

It is also anticipated that government shifts expenditure away from imported goods to minimize the impact on the
external sector of lower grants and because there would be more spending flexibility grants are often earmarked by
donors.

12

For domestic borrowing, an increase of about 2 percentage points of GDP per year starts in 2017, and the cap is
reached in 2034.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
11.
The authorities agreed with the conclusions of the DSA. They recognized the risks
and are committed to doing their part in ensuring debt sustainability, while looking to donors to
continue their assistance at the pledged levels. They noted that Afghanistan’s large expenditure
needs and donor countries’ domestic fiscal and political realities combined could create pressures
and, at times, called for a need to experiment with more debt financing. In this respect, they
welcomed continued support from donors so that they have access to grant financing. They also
acknowledged Fund advice that sukuks (domestic borrowing) be used predominantly as a liquidity
management instrument, rather than to finance projects or recurrent fiscal deficits. They added that
expenditure savings could potentially be made if donors intensified their efforts to further align their
aid with Afghan priorities and channeled more funds through the budget.

CONCLUSIONS
12.
Afghanistan will likely remain dependent on donor grant financing for years to
come. Security and development expenditure needs are large and the recently faltering domestic
revenue effort is not matching the growth of spending. After extensive debt relief and substantial
medium term pledges from donors, Afghanistan’s debt outlook, under the baseline scenario, is
benign. However, this is predicated on continued economic growth, progress in reforms,
improvements in security as well as all donor assistance being provided in the form of grants. If
growth and reform falter, and security deteriorates; or if grant financing falls short of the projected
levels or is provided in the form of loans, even if concessional, Afghanistan would need to
implement compensatory measures or its debt burden would quickly become unsustainable and
threaten, in the extreme case, the continuity of government functions. This analysis underscores the
need to redouble efforts to mobilize domestic revenue—with new policy measures as well as
through administrative reform to improve compliance—prioritize spending carefully, pursue
expenditure rationalization, and raise the efficiency of public spending. In addition, maintaining
macroeconomic stability and vigorous economic reform efforts will continue to be needed to
improve economic governance, strengthen the financial sector, and spur future growth.

Statement by the Staff Representative on
the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
May 16, 2014
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the
issuance of the staff report on April 23. The new information does not change the
thrust of the staff appraisal, but does underscore the need to maintain the rate of
10 percent in the VAT law.
2.
The preliminary results from the April 5 presidential elections indicate a
second round in late-May or June. The April 26 preliminary results indicate that none
of the candidates won an outright majority. Complaints will be adjudicated before the
final results are announced, expected in May. The second round will be a runoff
between the top two candidates from the first round and held within 15 days of final
first round results.
3.
Money and international reserves were close to projected levels at the end
of first quarter of 2014. Inflation was 5.6 percent year-on-year in March. The Afghani
depreciated by 2.2 percent since the beginning of 2014 and was Af 57.3 per U.S. dollar
on May 7.
4.
The treasury’s cash position is very constrained. The cash position has
deteriorated significantly recently, as lower revenue and higher expenditures around the
election ran down cash balances. On May 5, the cash balance was Af 4.5 billion
compared to Af 54.5 billion at end-April 2013 and Af 21 billion at the beginning of the
fiscal year. Thus far, the treasury has remained current on wages and salaries. However,
risks remain that arrears could be incurred. Moreover, President Karzai reportedly
signed a decree providing bonus payments to security personnel amounting to
Af 1.5 billion, which, if implemented, could pressure further the cash position.
5.
VAT legislation experienced a setback. The VAT law has been approved by
the lower house of parliament, but the VAT rate was reduced from 10 to 8 percent. This
law will be discussed by the upper house. The tax administration law (needed to
implement the VAT) is awaiting parliamentary approval.
6.

Further progress has been made in structural reform. The anti-money

2

laundering and countering financing of terrorism laws were approved by the cabinet on
May 5. The Economic Crimes Task Force (ECTF) has submitted its advice on categories of
economic offences to be included in the penal code to the Criminal Law Review Working
Group and the transfer of taxpayers from the small and medium taxpayer offices to the
large taxpayer office has been completed. With the implementation of these two
benchmarks, 21 of 24 structural benchmarks planned between June 2012 and December
2013 have now been completed. Efforts continue to implement other reforms. The mining
law has also been approved by the lower house.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan

On May 16, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
Over the past decade, Afghanistan has made enormous progress in reconstruction, development,
and lifting per capita income. Important steps have been taken to lay the foundation for
macroeconomic stability and growth, to reduce poverty, and to achieve social and development
objectives. However, security conditions, political uncertainty, and weak institutions continue to
constrain growth and weigh on social outcomes. The international community has delivered
substantial financial support and pledged to continue doing so over the medium term.
With significant domestic efforts and donor support, Afghanistan has maintained
macroeconomic stability, implemented important structural reforms, and built policy buffers—
namely a comfortable international reserves position, low debt and inflation, and balanced
budget and external current account positions. Nonetheless, significant vulnerabilities remain and
several reforms have been delayed. After the first review of Afghanistan’s IMF-supported
program in June 2012 (Press Release No. 12/245), subsequent reviews were delayed due to
missed quantitative targets and slower than planned implementation of structural reforms.
Over the past two years, economic activity has been affected by political and security
uncertainties and the drawdown of international troops. These uncertainties reduced confidence,
discouraged private investment, and held back economic activity. Growth slowed from
14 percent in 2012 (boosted by a bumper harvest) to an estimated 3.6 percent in 2013. Inflation
remained in single digits (5.6 percent year-on-year in March 2014). International reserves also
remained at a comfortable level equivalent to over seven months of imports.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Partly reflecting weaker economic activity, budget revenue performance deteriorated
significantly in 2012–13, despite additional measures, and was short of the targets established in
June 2012. The revenue shortfall resulted in a tight cash position for the treasury and required
limiting expenditure. As a result, expenditure as a share of GDP declined in 2013. Progress was
made in structural reform efforts, but implementation was slower than planned. Noteworthy
accomplishments included: publishing the inquiry into the Kabul Bank crisis; submitting the new
banking, value added tax (VAT), and tax administration laws to parliament; strengthening border
control management; preparing a new sukuk law; and adopting a strategic plan for financial
supervision. However, delays have been encountered in introducing the value added tax and
submitting to parliament the laws on anti-money laundering and countering of financing of
terrorism, and amendments to the central bank law.
This year, 2014, is crucial in the political and security transitions and the run-up to the
“transformation decade,” which starts in 2015. Assuming smooth political and security
transitions, continued reform and donor financing, the outlook should be positive. Large security
and development expenditure needs and a limited domestic revenue capacity mean that
Afghanistan will remain dependent on donor financing for an extended period. In addition to
donor support, macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, and political and security stability
are needed to ensure durable and inclusive growth. Risks to the outlook are mostly on the
downside.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors commended the authorities for the significant progress made over the
past decade in reducing poverty and raising living standards, rebuilding infrastructure and
institutions, maintaining macro stability, building up economic buffers, and continuing structural
reform in a challenging security environment and in the context of weak administrative capacity.
Strong support from the international community contributed to these achievements.
Nonetheless, Directors agreed that much more needs to be done to sustain high and inclusive
growth, further alleviate poverty, and reduce outstanding vulnerabilities, including dependence
on donor financing, limited domestic revenue capacity in the face of large public expenditure
needs, and a fragile banking system. They noted that the growth outlook remains clouded by
considerable downside risks, mainly related to possible adverse domestic or regional security
developments, political instability, inadequate implementation of economic policies, and donor
fatigue.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors supported the authorities’ economic strategy, focused on maintaining macroeconomic
stability, increasing domestic revenue mobilization, reinforcing the banking system, and
strengthening economic governance. They underscored, however, the importance of strengthened
implementation.
Directors stressed that raising domestic revenue is a priority for fiscal sustainability and meeting
development and security needs. In this regard, they emphasized the importance of reaching the
domestic revenue targets and looked forward to the swift enactment of the VAT law, with a rate
consistent with the need to increase revenue mobilization over the medium term, and the tax
administration law. Directors encouraged the authorities to promptly finalize a fiscal regime for
the natural resources sector and refrain from granting investment incentives and tax exemptions.
Directors concurred that continued efforts are needed to strengthen the banking system and
promote financial deepening. They encouraged the central bank to monitor the banking system
closely and enforce prudential regulations decisively. They looked forward to the rapid
implementation of the strategic plan for strengthening financial sector supervision and
recommended the prompt passage and implementation of the new banking law, amendments to
the central bank law, and provisions to assure adequate legal protection of central bank
supervisory staff. They encouraged stronger efforts to recover Kabul Bank assets and finalize the
privatization of New Kabul Bank.
Directors recommended that economic governance reforms continue to focus on improving
institutional capacity and the business environment and strengthening the regime against money
laundering and the financing of terrorism, for which legislation in line with international
standards should be submitted promptly to parliament for approval.
Directors stated that the Fund should continue its close engagement with the authorities,
including within the agreed informal short term framework for 2014, to ensure continued
macroeconomic stability and reform. Continued support from donors will also be crucial.

Statement by Mr. Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan and Mr. Monajemi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 16, 2014
On behalf of our authorities, we thank the Executive Directors and Management for
their continued support to Afghanistan. We also thank staff for the high quality report
and the constructive engagement with the authorities.
Overview
Afghanistan is undergoing important political and security transitions. The first round of
presidential election was held in April 2014, and a run-off between the two leading candidates
is scheduled for mid-June, 2014. A new government will be formed after completion of the
presidential election, and parliamentary elections are scheduled in 2015. Transitional security
arrangements are underway in connection with the drawdown of international troops in 2014.
These important changes usher a new era for Afghanistan, even though related uncertainty has
affected short-term economic performance.
Afghanistan has achieved major strides in improving per capita incomes, reducing poverty and
reaching other MDGs, while stabilizing the economy, implementing important structural
reforms, and rebuilding infrastructure. These achievements, which are well rendered in the
report, have been made in a challenging political and security environment and in the context
of weak administrative and institutional capacity, but also with strong support from donors and
international institutions, including the Fund, for which the authorities are grateful. Yet, much
remains to be done to sustain high and inclusive growth, further reduce poverty, strengthen the
financial sector, improve governance, and reduce dependence on donor financing over the
medium term. The authorities are determined to continue to address these challenges with
support from the international community, along the lines of the principles, objectives, and
reform commitments agreed in 2012 under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework
(TMAF).
Program implementation
Despite the difficult political and security environment, the authorities continued to show strong
determination to implement their ECF-supported program. However, after successfully
completing the first program review in June 2012, subsequent reviews were delayed due to
unanticipated shocks that hit the economy, and non-implementation of some prior actions
resulting from the authorities’ efforts to reach consensus over some complex reforms and from
capacity constraints, mainly in the preparation of draft legislation and the related review process.

2

As highlighted in the staff report, despite corrective actions taken by the authorities in the
second half of 2013, the policy framework, which was revised in May 2013, could not be
implemented due to much weaker than projected economic conditions, resulting from the
withdrawal of international troops and greater transition uncertainties. Nonetheless,
macroeconomic stability was preserved, and significant progress was made in the ambitious
structural reform agenda, with 22 out of the 25 structural benchmarks planned between June
2012 and December 2013 implemented. As indicated in the staff supplement, staff was able to
confirm that the benchmarks on categories of offences to be included in the new consolidated
penal code, and on the transfer of some taxpayers to the large tax payer office, were met. The
benchmark on the action plan for AML/CFT was partly met, with three out of the four
requirements in place and the fourth, submission to parliament of amendments to the AML/CFT
law, virtually met after the adoption of the new AML and CFT laws by the Cabinet. The
policies, guidelines and procedures regarding the duties, functions, and protections of
supervisory staff (also a benchmark) were adopted in December 2013, as required, but need
some strengthening and also to be made consistent with Afghan laws. The revised policy will be
submitted to the DAB Supreme Council in June 2014. Finally, the submission to parliament of
amendments to the central bank legislation which was expected at end-December 2013 has been
delayed, as the draft is being reviewed by the Ministry of Justice. Moreover, the authorities have
maintained close dialogue with staff, as evidenced by the agreement reached on an informal
short-term policy framework for 2014 aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability and
strengthening the financial sector.
Recent developments and outlook
Following an impressive growth performance of 14 percent in 2012, boosted by a bumper crop,
economic activity is estimated to have decelerated to 3.6 percent in 2013. Growth was
dampened by the uncertainty over the political and security transition leading to a decrease in
private investment. As a result of their prudent policies, the authorities have successfully
managed to contain inflation in comfort zone throughout 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.
Inflation decelerated to 5.6 percent year-on-year in March 2014, and is expected to remain in
single digits for the year as a whole. Despite the revenue shortfall from much weaker economic
activity, the operating fiscal deficit, before grants, was limited to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2013,
due to government’s efforts in curbing expenditures. The current account deficit, excluding
official transfers, is estimated at 41 percent of GDP in 2013, or 2 percentage points lower than
envisaged under the program.

3

The growth outlook for 2014 is also affected by lingering uncertainty and the adverse impact of
the international troop withdrawal, with real GDP projected to grow by about 3 percent in 2014
before picking up to about 5 percent on average over the period 2015–18. The growth
momentum could be strengthened by dissipation of political and security uncertainty, sustained
reforms, and higher donor financing under the TMAF, as well as by the envisaged development
of natural resources, as indicated in the report. Possible downside risks could emanate from
significant shortcomings in these areas, as well as from adverse global or regional
developments.
The short-term macroeconomic objectives and policies agreed with staff aim at increasing fiscal
space through revenue mobilization and tight expenditure control, keeping inflation in single
digits, maintaining international reserves buffer, and safeguarding the financial system while
strengthening the AML/CFT regime.
Fiscal policies and reforms
The operating deficit, before grants, projected for 2014 increases by 3.8 percent of GDP,
compared to the 2013 outcome. This results from an increase in operating expenditure to the
tune of 4.4 percent of GDP, reflecting the cost of the security transition, a large part of which
will be financed by donors, and a small part (0.8 percent of GDP) will be covered from higher
domestic revenue. In this connection, although weak economic activity is likely to weigh down
on revenue, the authorities will redouble efforts at revenue mobilization through new taxes and
efforts to strengthen tax and customs administrations.
Major reforms are underway to strengthen revenue mobilization and expenditure control over
the medium term. The draft VAT law was recently passed by the lower house of parliament and
has been submitted to the senate for approval. Preparatory work is underway to implement the
VAT upon its final adoption, including through provision of information to taxpayers and other
stakeholders on the associated procedures. The tax administration law needed to implement the
VAT has also been submitted to parliament. To strengthen customs administration, the import
valuation system will be improved and the jurisdiction over valuation issues will be centralized
in an appropriately resourced and trained unit. The customs department has recently recruited
four local valuation specialists through a World Bank funded project to further improve the
performance of the valuation unit. Furthermore, the authorities have prepared, with IMF
technical assistance, a framework for an effective and transparent fiscal regime for mineral
resources, which is compliant with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The draft

4

mining law has been submitted to parliament and has been adopted by the lower house. Reforms
in budget management are also underway, including enhancing line ministries’ capacity to
prepare financial plans and manage contracts and associated budgets. Moreover, electronic
transfers for salaries and contractual payments will be used, for which preparations are well
advanced.
Debt sustainability
Afghanistan’s debt is currently very modest (6.1 percent of GDP at end-2013), and is
sustainable under the baseline scenario of continued reform and donor support, as well as a
smooth political and security transition. Vulnerabilities stemming from downside risks to the
baseline assumptions, however, namely weaker growth, shortfalls in donor financing, faltering
reform, and deterioration in the security situation could put Afghanistan at high risk of debt
distress. This underscores the importance of continued reforms, including mobilization of
domestic revenue, and adequate donor financing in the form of grants. While the authorities are
committed to doing their part in ensuring debt sustainability and recognize the critical
importance of revenue mobilization, continued donor assistance at pledged levels is crucial. The
authorities are hopeful that donors will also intensify their efforts to further align their assistance
with Afghan priorities, sign multi-year financing agreements, and channel more funds through
the budget.
Financial sector reforms
The report and SIP usefully review the factors behind the difficulties faced by the financial
system in Afghanistan. Against this background, reforms in the financial sector will be focused
on strengthening bank supervision, enhancing the banking sector’s contribution to growth, and
developing financial markets. The central bank is taking steps to strengthen supervision and
better enforce existing banking laws and regulations, while also reviewing and improving the
regulatory framework, as needed. The new banking law, which was submitted to parliament in
February 2013, will help enhance supervisory oversight over the financial sector by
strengthening corporate governance, prudential requirements, enforcement measures, and bank
resolution. The role of the financial supervision department (FSD) will be further reinforced
with additional staff, off-site surveillance, including automation of supervisory reporting, and
with enhanced on-site examination process. The Supervisory Enforcement Committee will
continue its regular reviews of banks’ compliance with FSD’s orders, while the central bank’s
report to parliament will allow legislators to evaluate and monitor progress in this area.

5

The authorities remain committed to continuing their asset recovery efforts and completing the
resolution of Kabul Bank, including the sale of New Kabul Bank (NKB) after due diligence is
completed. They are aware that successful privatization of NKB will be important to strengthen
the financial sector, mobilize donor support, restore investor confidence, and support growth.
The central bank has reported that by end-February 2014, it had recovered a total of $175
million in assets, with additional assets of a book value of about $60 million also recovered and
available for sale. The recovery process is complicated by several factors, including difficulties
in finding buyers for domestic assets, ascertaining legal documentation of property ownership,
appeals of the verdicts in criminal cases, and slow progress in recovering assets held abroad.
Governance
Governance reform has continued, including steps to strengthen the finance ministry’s oversight
over public enterprises, the publication of the inquiry report on the Kabul Bank crisis, and the
endorsement by the cabinet of an economic crimes road map in February 2013. An Economic
Crimes Task Force has been set up under the chairmanship of the economy minister to oversee
and coordinate the implementation of the road map. In addition, the authorities intend to enact
FATF-consistent AML/CFT legislation and adopt a national strategy that will include money
laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments. Significant efforts are underway to
strengthen capacity in the area of AML/CFT. The Cabinet passed the draft AML/CFT
legislation on May 5, 2014; its submission to parliament should follow shortly.
Conclusion
The Afghan authorities highly value the Fund’s continued support and policy advice over the
past years, and are very appreciative of the valuable technical assistance they have received.
They remain committed to economic and financial reforms needed to sustain high inclusive
growth, reduce poverty, and achieve the MDGs. As they face important challenges during and
after the political and security transition underway, they look forward to continued strong
support from and close collaboration with their development partners.
