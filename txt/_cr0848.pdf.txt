INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO
Staff Report for 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Michael Hadjimichael
December 14, 2007
Executive Summary
The IMF’s most recent member has high economic potential. The economy is taking off, with strong
investor interest in tourism. Driven by strong FDI and accelerating credit, GDP growth is projected to
exceed 7 percent in 2007 and remain strong in 2008, unemployment has fallen sharply, and public debt
and inflation remain low.
But strong growth is masking rising vulnerabilities. The economy is showing clear signs of
overheating; the current account deficit at 37 percent of GDP has reached levels that demand vigilance;
bank credit has accelerated with an aggressive push for market share, straining the ability of banks to
adequately assess loan quality; inflationary pressures are on the rise despite euroization; wages have
accelerated as the labor market tightens; and real estate and equity prices have soared.
Policy options are limited. Euro adoption precludes an exchange rate adjustment, but rapidly rising
private debt raises the possibility of solvency problems related to real estate and asset market exposures,
especially if declining competitiveness stunts Montenegro’s tourism potential. With few other available
policy levers, the procyclical 2008 budget is a concern. Staff stressed the need for a strong fiscal stance,
and strengthened banking supervisory powers. The signing of the pre-accession agreement with the EU
provides an opportunity to boost structural reforms to remove restrictive labor practices, ease energy
bottlenecks, and improve the business climate.
The authorities are more sanguine about the risks. They view the widening imbalances as private
sector driven, and point to large nation building needs that limit the scope for fiscal policy to contain
demand pressures. The Central Bank is taking measures to strengthen supervision and dampen credit
growth, but noted that its powers are limited given delays in passing key banking legislation through
parliament.
Montenegro has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and the Fund staff have not,
as yet, undertaken a thorough analysis of Montenegro’s exchange system.

I. TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?
1.
Independence and huge tourism potential has
generated strong investor interest in Montenegro. The last
five years have seen price stability restored through the
adoption of the euro as sole legal tender; notable progress in
fiscal consolidation; restructuring of the banking sector;
progress in privatization; and a favorable resolution of the
state liabilities of the former union that left Montenegro with
low debt (Figure 1). The authorities’ vision is to create a
business friendly, open economy with low taxes and minimal
state interference.

2.
But strong growth, and the exuberance it has generated, has brought its own
problems. Foreign direct investment has snowballed, targeting mainly real estate and the
tourism sector. Furthermore, aggressive competition for market share has led to an explosion
of bank lending. In response, asset prices have been rising sharply, with the stock index
shooting up, and real estate prices rapidly reaching those in wealthier neighboring countries.
The resulting wealth effect has fueled pent-up consumer demand, widening external
imbalances.
3.
Euroization limits policy options to manage the boom. Strong import-related
revenue growth has generated fiscal surpluses, but the authorities have been reluctant to let
the fiscal stabilizers work. Income taxes have been cut sharply, and the 2008 budget is
expansionary. With monetary policy discretion curtailed by use of the euro, the Central Bank
has moved to tighten prudential regulations, but lacks effective enforcement powers.
Structural bottlenecks have also been quick to emerge. Restrictive labor regulations, a
decapitalized electricity sector, and a difficult business environment threaten to put a brake
on growth if unaddressed. The unofficial economy is large at an estimated 30 percent of
GDP.
II. BACKGROUND
4.
The economic expansion is proceeding at full strength. Real growth is expected to
be 7½ percent in 2007, up from 6½ percent in 2006. The tourism sector is picking up, with
large inflows of FDI generating strong construction activity. However, the manufacturing
sector is stalling, partly due to disruption in electricity supply. Domestic credit has
progressively replaced FDI as the main driver of demand.

…and vulnerabilities have been building up:

•

External imbalances have widened. The brunt of the strong demand pressures has
been borne by the current account deficit, and Montenegro’s competitive edge is
eroding fast.

•

Credit growth has accelerated. Exceptionally rapid credit growth could mask
nonperforming loan (NPL) problems, test the capacity of the young banking system
to prudently assess and manage credit risks, and weaken private sector balance sheets.

•

Fiscal risks have increased. Large restitution claims amounting to well over
10 percent of GDP threaten to reverse the impact of the Paris Club debt write-offs at
end-2006. Boom-related fiscal surpluses and large privatization receipts have raised
the appetite for spending.

•

The asset price boom raises the specter of a correction. The FSAP raised concerns
regarding low disclosure requirements, infrequent reporting, and financial safeguards.
A correction of stock market and real estate prices, partly fueled by the rapid credit
expansion and possibly amplified by the shallowness of the market, could generate
strong balance sheet effects.

The widening current account deficit is increasingly debt financed.
7.
The financing of the current account deficit is shifting. The current account is
estimated to widen to 37 percent of GDP in 2007, from 31 percent in 2006 (Figure 2). Large
current account deficits are not uncommon in small states experiencing booms, and the euro
peg shelters the economy from currency crises. From a savings-investment perspective, the

Box 1: Montenegro: A Tourism Enclave? 1/
Tourism has fast become the main pillar of Montenegro’s economy. The contribution of
travel and tourism economy in overall GDP rose from 15 percent in 2004 to 21 percent in
just three years. According to World Travel and Tourism Council (2007), Montenegro is a
leading emerging tourist destination.
Despite rapid growth, the tourism sector is becoming an enclave in Montenegro. Hotels
catering to international visitors rely on imported inputs, including a significant portion of
labor. As a result, the tourism sector is characterized by high leakage. Meanwhile,
developments in non-tourism related industries have been sluggish, and productivity has not
shown any notable improvement, indicating weak linkage of tourism with the rest of the
economy.
Available data on tourism suggest some inconsistencies between tourism goals and policies.
Montenegro is targeting high-end customers. However, these tend to stay in resort hotels,
resulting in high leakage-low retention of tourism earnings.
To achieve its target of tripling the travel and tourism sector by 2017, Montenegro must not
only focus on increasing the number of beds and extending the season, but also improving
infrastructure, especially roads, electricity and water supply.

Impact of tourism on the rest of the economy appears
limited.

10
Credit growth has soared
8.
Monetary developments have been dominated by large capital inflows and
aggressive bank competition. Unlike in many other countries in the region, credit expansion
was initially financed from domestic sources, especially the proceeds of asset sales (real
estate) to nonresidents. Recently, however, foreign credit lines and banks’ own funds have
had an increasingly large contribution to credit expansion. Declining interest rates due to
intensifying competition and expectations of improving economic prospects have also
stimulated demand for credit. Aggressive competition among banks for market share has
fueled credit supply, with two banks managing to multiply their loan portfolio by tenfold
within a year, one partly financed by a shift in public sector deposits to the bank.
At 190 percent (y-o-y in September 2007), credit has been expanded notably faster than
suggested by historical convergence dynamics (Box 2). Higher effective reserve
requirements and stricter prudential requirements have only dented credit expansion at best.

1/ Adapted and updated from Hilbers et al. (2005)

Is credit growing too rapidly? Out-of-sample estimation, drawing on historical convergence dynamics, suggests
that credit-to-GDP exceeds its equilibrium level for the current stage of development, and the banking sector’s
distance to default, measured by the Z-score, has declined slightly.

sector, despite improvements in central budget implementation. The 2008 organic budget
law will, for the first time, include the social funds, which will fall under the spending
authorization of the central government. However, spending by municipal governments is
unconstrained due to substantial privatization revenues; and the state-owned enterprise sector
is loss making after taking into account the quasi-fiscal operations of the electricity company,
amounting to an estimated 2 percent of GDP in 2006.

Structural barriers to growth are pervasive:

13.
Electricity shortages pose a serious threat to growth. Electricity demand is
growing fast while production is hampered by dilapidated production and distribution
facilities, and chronic operating losses in the state-owned electricity company (EPCG) that
have precluded investment in the sector. The situation is complicated by a distorted tariff
structure that overcharges commercial consumers (to offset implicit subsidies worth
2 percent of GDP to the private aluminum complex (KAP), governed by a long-term
contract). Household charges are not particularly low by regional standards, but are well
below costs, contributing to EPCG losses. The increase of electricity tariffs in July 2007 has
not been sufficient to bring EPCG to profit.
Electricity tariffs are high in Montenegro, especially for commercial users

Restrictive labor legislation, too, is a drag on the local economy. Excessive
14.
employment protection, a fairly high tax wedge, and low wage flexibility are major
deterrents to labor market participation, especially in the formal economy, and encourage the
employment of temporary foreign workers, especially in tourism and construction.
The business climate remains weak. The reduction of corporate taxation, the
15.
speeding up of licensing and the adoption of a laissez fare attitude have bolstered the
attractiveness of Montenegro as a business location. However, interference by municipalities
remains pervasive, incomplete zoning regulations raise the effective cost of investment, and

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

16.
Against this background, the discussions focused on policies to manage the
upswing and prevent a hard landing, complete the transition to a market economy, and
reduce vulnerabilities.
•

The potential growth outlook is strong, but staff expressed concerns about the
impact of overheating and eroding competitiveness on external sustainability.
Staff and the authorities concurred that near-term prospects are positive, with strong
tourism potential, but differed on the assessment of risks.

•

The CBM shared staff concerns regarding the extremely fast credit growth.
There was agreement that the enforcement powers of the CBM need to be
strengthened, and prudential supervision tightened further.

•

There was less agreement on the use of fiscal policy to counter the boom. Staff
emphasized the importance of a countercyclical fiscal stance, but the authorities
pointed to high nation-building needs. Staff stressed the importance of a
comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework to create space for public
investments.1

•

Discussions on policies to promote growth were mixed. There was agreement on
the need to strengthen labor and business legislation to increase the flexibility of the
economy and reduce grey market activity, but less agreement on energy policies and
privatization.

•

The authorities were more sanguine about the need for measures to offset
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, progress has been made on limiting restitution
compensation, which is the main source of contingent fiscal liabilities, and
strengthening financial markets

projections are close to those of the authorities with growth of about 7 percent in 2008, as
tourism picks up, and demand continues to be buoyed by strong FDI and credit growth
(although less than in 2007). Both expected inflation to inch up in the face of wage pressures.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 33 percent of GDP in 2008, due to a
pick-up in tourism earnings, and less strong demand due to weakening wealth effects and
policies to rein on credit growth.
The boom is expected to slow over the medium term (Figure 4). Medium-term
19.
growth prospects are where the authorities and staff differ. The staff see competitiveness
erosion and the slow pace of structural reforms moderating potentially higher growth rates
from strong tourism expansion (Box 3) to levels lower than expected for the current stage of
transition. Both agree that the current account would narrow as the demand shock peters out,
as credit markets are quickly saturated given the already high credit-to-GDP ratio (Box 2),
and narrowing investment opportunities lead to the unwinding of FDI inflows. But staff
stressed that labor costs have been rising very rapidly compared with the experience of other
transition countries; and that wage moderation and reforms facilitating broader-based growth
were indispensable for a soft landing.1 The current account would become increasingly debt
financed, with private external indebtedness doubling from 30 percent of GDP at end 2007 to
59 percent by 2012 (Appendix II).

The slow reform scenario is driven by lower FDI, weaker private investment, and
smaller gains in labor force participation and unemployment reduction.

Box 3. Montenegro’s Competitiveness and External Sustainability

Montenegro’s high current account deficit largely reflects transitory demand pressures, as
confirmed by macroeconomic balance analysis, which implies a correction as the demand shocks
unwind. Competitiveness indicators do not provide clear evidence of overvaluation but rapidly
rising labor costs point to the need for productivity enhancing structural reforms to preserve
competitiveness.
I. Price and cost competitiveness
Competitiveness indicators give mixed signals. The RPI-based REER shows little movement
compared to other countries in the region, but the statistics are distorted by price repression. The
average net wage is currently at middle range compared to other neighboring countries; however, it
has been rising rapidly, and the wage-based REER suggests erosion of competitiveness. The
internal terms of trade rose in 2004 but have stabilized since.
II. Tourism prospects: do costs matter?
Surveys have shown that tourism is not particularly sensitive to local costs, especially the type of
enclave tourism resorts being established in Montenegro, which depend heavily on imported inputs
and labor. Tourism receipts more than doubled

III. Macro-balance approach
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that
the large current account deficit will decline as FDI
moderates, which is not unusual for transition
economies. The underlying balance, which adjusts
for transitory factors, is roughly equal to its
equilibrium level but a gap is expected to emerge
reflecting eroding cost competitiveness due to rapid
wage increases and slow productivity growth. The equilibrium current account balance is based on
economic fundamentals such as fiscal balance, old-age dependency ratio, population growth,
relative income, and ratio of NFA to GDP.
IV. Institutional indicators
Various indicators of the business climate rank Montenegro consistently at the middle of the group.
Montenegro ranked 84 out of 179 in the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index,
and 81 out of 177 in World Bank’s Doing Business Index. The 2007 Freedom House report shows
deterioration, in large part due to the lack of transparency in privatization.

Staff cautioned that a harsher landing is clearly possible. Disillusion with current
20.
policies or diminished expectations could trigger a more abrupt private sector adjustment
choking off private investment and discouraging FDI. Euroization rules out a currency crisis,
but reliance on wage correction would be painful, especially if rigidities in labor markets are
not addressed. The authorities acknowledged that overheating could result in a “hard
landing,” but remained relatively sanguine about the risks of a disorderly adjustment and
expected that after the adoption of the constitution the reform effort would regain
momentum. Staff emphasized the downside risks including excessive restitution claims,
potential volatility of the large FDI inflows, wage increases in excess of productivity growth,
and an abrupt weakening of private sector balance sheets due to a shift in expectations.
Public debt is not a source of vulnerability as confirmed by sustainability analysis
(Appendix I).

20
Box 4. FSAP Recommendations and Follow-up
The Central Bank of Montenegro is in the process of implementing an action plan to follow-up the
FSAP, as described in the FSSA. The main findings of the FSAP were:
•
Rapid credit growth has strained banks’ capacity to underwrite loans prudently, and eroded
capital adequacy and profitability.
•
Banking supervision is robust, but the legal framework needs to be strengthened through
adoption of the banking law, and enhanced enforcement powers.
•

The buoyant stock market is poorly supervised and may pose a reputational risk.

While the CBM has moved quickly to restructure supervisory practices and address specific
vulnerabilities by tightening capital requirements, approval of the banking law has dragged.

1/ As of October 31, 2007.

B. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability

21.
The central bank has moved to tighten credit, but lacks sufficient enforcement
powers. The absence of a lender of last resort arrangement in Montenegro suggests the need
for higher liquidity ratios. The authorities noted that they recently had raised effective reserve
requirements to 14 percent (on average), which is high by international standards. They had
also instructed some banks to strengthen their capital, and the average capital adequacy ratio
at 18.7 percent appears to be at a comfortable level. CBM representatives noted that the
turmoil in international financial markets had not been felt in Montenegro. The CBM has
been following up on FSAP recommendations (Box 4), has been monitoring banks very
closely, and has prepared regulations refining (effectively tightening) loan classification
rules, but lacks effective enforcement powers. Staff agreed that the banking system is
reasonably well supervised but noted that its resilience has not been tested in a downturn and

21
the rapid credit growth has been taking its toll on banks’ financial indicators, especially
regarding liquidity (Table 5).
Staff noted that euroization still leaves some limited room for maneuver in
22.
controlling credit growth. Staff noted that expanding the base of calculation of reserve
requirements to include all non-capital liabilities would discourage banks’ recourse to foreign
financing and reduce moral hazard. Moreover, relatively high concentration of risks, and the
inexperience of some banks, argued for above average solvency rates. The CBM argued that
the pending refinements in loan classification obviated at this stage the need for higher
minimum solvency ratios. Direct credit controls were also discussed but rejected by the CBM
on efficiency and enforceability grounds.
There was agreement on a number of structural measures to check credit
23.
growth and strengthen the financial system. These included acceleration of the approval of
the laws on the central bank and banks to provide, among other things, CBM supervisors
with effective enforcement powers and immunity in the discharge of their duties; and to
facilitate strengthened supervision, a tightening of loan-to-income and loan-to-value ratios,
and the development of early warning systems for systemic macro risks, particularly for bank
exposure to the stock market and real estate sector. Improved access to the Credit Registry
would also enhance risk management practices at banks.
Loan concentration is high.

Bank capitalization remains at comfortable levels...

Exuberance on the stock market is a concern. The authorities have requested Fund
technical assistance to help strengthen governance.
C. Fiscal Framework: Balancing Growth and Stability
Medium-term fiscal framework.

25.
Staff and authorities agreed that implementation of two key elements of the
medium-term fiscal framework would bolster policy credibility:
•

Fiscal policy should be anchored on a medium-term target. The target to reduce
gross debt to below 30 percent of GDP by 2012 can be achieved with, on average, a
small primary surplus over the medium-term (Appendix I).

•

Downsizing of the public sector. The authorities plan to reduce current spending to
make room for further tax cuts, and higher public investments. They have yet,
however, to formulate concrete public sector reforms that would lend credibility to
these plans. Staff recommended the development of a medium-term fiscal framework
to reconcile spending needs.

Fiscal policy in 2007–08: leaning against the wind

26.
Staff argued for a countercyclical fiscal stance. Notwithstanding their mediumterm objective of downsizing the public sector, the authorities’ immediate plans were
predicated by nation building expenditure and prior commitments to reduce tax rates. As a
result, the revised budget for 2007 and preliminary 2008 budget would add additional fiscal
stimuli to the domestic economy. Reductions of

changes.
Staff suggested that strong fiscal performance should be used to implement
27.
difficult but essential public sector reforms. Staff noted that tax reductions and wage
increases will be difficult to claw back when the economy slows, and fiscal space will be
needed when large infrastructure projects are ready to be executed. Staff proposed the
following:

23
•

Public administration reforms should accompany the announced wage increases.
Montenegro is not alone in the region in facing the challenge of keeping qualified
staff in the public sector as private sector wages increase. The answer is a reform of
pay scales and streamlining of the public sector to allow pay to better match skills.
The public expenditure review conducted by the World Bank provides useful
recommendations for public sector reform.

•

Reassessing tax reforms. With tax rates already low by international standards,
further reform should be undertaken with care and aim at strengthening the revenue
base, and preventing distortions by eliminating exemptions and preferences.

•

Increased control of the broader public sector. Staff recommended that the
government more actively exercise its ownership rights in public enterprises and
strengthen control of local government spending decisions. In addition, staff proposed
to transfer public sector deposits to the central bank to avoid fueling bank credit.

The authorities concurred with the importance of enhancing the monitoring and
28.
reduction of fiscal risks. The government is currently considering the possibility of
financing large infrastructure projects through Private-Public Partnerships (PPP), in
particular, regional highways. Staff pointed out that while PPPs could be an attractive means
of financing they could also generate substantial fiscal risks; and stressed the need to
introduce a sound legal and institutional framework, as suggested in earlier technical
assistance. The government is contemplating prepayment of restitution claims, and while the
discount could be sizeable, staff strongly advised against this due to the potentially sizeable
negative impact on domestic demand and risk of unequal treatment of claimants.
D. Boosting Structural Reforms

29.
The authorities stressed their commitment to structural reform but indicated
that forging the necessary consensus is not easy. They noted that they had made
considerable progress in privatization and establishing the legal basis for a business friendly
environment.
Staff emphasized the importance of energy reforms to prevent shortages. Staff
30.
stressed that adjustment of electricity tariffs toward market levels was critical for reducing
quasi-fiscal losses of about 2½ percent of GDP, and attracting much needed private
investment into the sector. The authorities were less convinced of the importance of tariff
reform and privatization. However, World Bank staff consulted were concerned that the
electricity company had neither the resources nor the know-how to undertake the large
investments needed. In addition, the tariff increase of July 2007 was barely sufficient to
cover operating costs and regulators explained that it included no allowance for return on
capital. More positively, the authorities have completed the financial unbundling of EPCG’s

24
operations into generation, transmission and distribution and were expecting to open up the
market in early 2008.
31.
The authorities were in the process of a comprehensive reform of labor
legislation. They explained that the new draft law incorporated key provisions from
international conventions. Staff stressed the need for flexibility in collective bargaining
(especially allowing separate agreements for individual sectors and opt out clauses),
facilitating job mobility, and reducing non-wage costs, which were among the highest in the
region.

32.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to improving the business
environment. Staff acknowledged that significant progress had been achieved in improving
the business environment but stressed the need for further progress, especially in improving
predictability and limiting discretion, setting timely limits in processing applications,
upgrading the judiciary, and completing zoning regulations at the municipal level. Staff
emphasized the importance of strengthening corporate governance, especially regarding the
timely release of financial statements for listed companies, and noted that failure to do so
could risk the reputation of the young stock exchange.
The authorities were committed to combating money laundering and the financing
33.
of terrorism. They explained that the framework for AML/CFT was being upgraded and a new
law would be submitted to parliament in early 2008.

Economic policy was hampered by deficiencies in macroeconomic statistics. The
34.
weakest area was the real sector, where the implementation of statistical standards has barely
kept pace with the increasing data demand. The authorities noted that progress was being
made in developing data sources, implementing international standards in statistics
methodology, and developing expertise.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

35.
Much is going well. The economy is booming. Euro adoption has delivered low
inflation and anchored expectation, and the discovery of Montenegro as an international
tourist destination has drawn massive FDI inflows.
36.
But strong growth is hiding growing vulnerabilities. The economy is overheating.
Rapid credit growth is overstretching banks, and has contributed to ballooning asset prices.
Eroding competitiveness is a concern. Euro adoption precludes an exchange rate
37.
adjustment, but rapidly rising private debt raises the possibility of solvency problems related
to asset markets, especially if competitiveness problems stunt Montenegro’s tourism
potential.

25
Policy levers are few, but need to be used. The authorities need to make more
38.
active use of those policy instruments available to address demand pressures, reduce
vulnerabilities, and ensure a soft landing.
Management of the boom falls on fiscal policy. However, the preliminary 2008
39.
budget would be expansionary unless revised. The 30 percent public sector wage increase
and tax cuts would provide an unhelpful boost to an already overheated economy.
Tax cuts have been procyclical and potentially destabilizing. Corporate tax cuts,
40.
combined with absence of capital gains taxation, only provide investors with a windfall in a
country with the enormous potential of Montenegro. Strong import-driven VAT growth
should not be seen as providing scope for further tax cuts, as these revenues will eventually
fall as import growth slows. The authorities should review ongoing tax reforms to strengthen
the tax base and fiscal stabilizers.
Fiscal risks need to be contained. Paris Club debt reductions have lowered public
41.
debt, but the central government should resist assuming large restitution liabilities. Recent
efforts to tighten criteria and ensure that property is returned to owners rather than
compensated through government bonds are welcome. The authorities also need to guard
against the assumption of guarantees and contingent liabilities, including PPPs, to solve their
large infrastructure needs.

42.
Better budgetary control is crucial. Control over local government should be
strengthened, and state enterprise quasi-fiscal operations brought on budget.
Absent monetary policy, the main focus of credit policy should be to strengthen
43.
banking sector supervision. Passage of the banking law is the single most important
measure to allow for enhanced supervisory practices to be enforced. Attention needs to be
given to the monitoring of systemic risks, including real estate prices, and private external
debt. Urgent attention is needed to limit risks associated with the highly capitalized stock
market.

44.
Completing the transition to market economy should be kept at the top of the
policy agenda. Progress has been made, but energy and labor reforms, two areas critical for
ensuring sustained growth, have been patchy at best. Privatization momentum, especially in
the electricity sector, needs to be reinvigorated, and more weight given to market-based
policies. Labor flexibility is crucial to ensure competitiveness given euroization. The
authorities’ plans to reform the labor legislation are welcome, but need to address restrictive
practices and ensure sufficient weight is given to both private sector and social partners in the
planned consultative process.
45.
The authorities need to address the poor state of the statistics. Important
deficiencies and gaps in the national accounts, fiscal, price, and balance of payments

26
statistics undermine informed policy decisions. Reorganization of the statistical agency is
essential if further technical assistance is to be effective.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Montenegro be held on
46.
the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I: Montenegro—General Government Debt Sustainability Analysis

1.
The monitoring of general government debt has improved significantly, with the debt
management department of the Ministry of Finance taking a leading role in clarifying and
making public the debt situation.
This debt sustainability analysis includes gross public debt that is recognized by the
2.
authorities and covers the general government.1 Estimates of the liabilities from the restitution
process are included. Parliament has limited the overall liabilities stemming from restitution to a
maximum of 10 percent of GDP through amendments to the restitution law. For 2007, ca.
€150 million is added to government liabilities. Debt of municipal governments has been revised
upwards on account of recognition of domestic payment arrears (ca. €20 million). The
discussions between Serbia and Montenegro on the division of external debt are not yet final, and
under the current scenario, debt equivalent to €20 million is added in 2007 on account of
assumed debt from the former State Union.2 The government has also decided to compensate
confiscated foreign savings of Montenegrin citizens in banks outside Montenegro3 and, possibly,
for losses incurred in the pyramid-schemes (additional €18 and €10 million are included in the
current scenario). There is still uncertainty regarding debt of public enterprises from before the
reconstitution of the Union between Serbia and Montenegro that ultimately could become a
liability of the government. Montenegro has also decided to pre-pay World Bank debt. In
September, a payment of €19 million was made, and the current scenario assumes that an
additional early re-payment of €38 million will be effected before the end of 2007.
Under the baseline scenario, Montenegro’s debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to below
3.
30 percent of GDP in 2012 (Table 1). The primary balance is projected to improve with the
current upswing in the economy. However, a weakening of the automatic stabilizers through tax
rate reductions and expansion of the public sector will slow the pace of debt reduction. Nominal
interest rates, while low due to the high share of relatively cheap domestic and foreign debt, are
projected to reach 3½ percent on account of the government taking on a higher proportion of
debt on non-IDA terms, and robust real economic growth will strengthen the automatic debt
dynamics. Privatization revenues are expected to decrease following the windfall in 2005–08.
The standard stress tests were performed using the methodology adopted in July 2005

modifications due to data constraints. Relevant economic information for Montenegro prior
to 2002 does not exist, and estimates for 2002–06 are used for historical averages and standard
deviations.
The standard stress tests result in a slower reduction of debt in the medium-term, but not

a reversal (Figure 1), and the debt path is robust to most adverse scenarios. Montenegro,
however, is facing large risks due to external concentration in trade and uncertainties in real debt
levels; and euroization limits the economy’s flexibility to respond to a shock. To test the limits of
the debt dynamics the standard shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate and primary
balance was doubled, and 20 percent of GDP was added to the debt stock in 2008, reflecting
possible hidden debt or addition of new liabilities (Figure 2). In this scenario, debt sustainability
is particularly sensitive to growth and fiscal shocks, while less sensitive to interest and exchange
rate shocks (due to the relatively low interest rates on existing debt stock and a small share of
debt denominated in non-euro currencies). Thus, the relatively high sensitivity to changes in
growth and fiscal policy reinforces the importance of continued structural reforms and a prudent
fiscal stance.

Appendix II. Montenegro—External Debt Sustainability

1.
Montenegro’s external public debt is low. Since the debt restructuring by Paris Club and
bilateral donors in 2003, which almost halved external public debt to around 33 percent of GDP,
the public external debt has continued to decline. Montenegro also benefited from another debt
write-off by Paris Club creditors in 2006, which contributed to total external public debt falling
to about 26 percent of GDP.
The data on private external debt is weak; however, staff and the authorities’ estimates
2.
indicate that external private debt has been increasing rapidly since 2006 which warrants
cautious monitoring. Based on available data so far, private external debt is expected to jump
from 19 percent of GDP in 2006 to 30 percent in 2007. Commercial bank debt accounted for just
under half of the increase, with financial institutions taking advantage of improved access to
international capital markets and foreign bank branches in Montenegro borrowing from
headquarters abroad. The remainder of the increase may partly reflect hidden FDI, with the debt
later converted to equity. The mission has stressed the need to maintain record of private debt
stock.
The macroeconomic framework projects real growth to slow down gradually, while the
3.
current account situation improves with a fall in FDI related imports, and strong tourism
earnings. Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio increases from about 53 percent
in 2007 to 59 percent in 2008 and continues to grow to reach 74 percent by 2012. During this
period, the external public debt declines from 22 percent to 16 percent. Meanwhile, the private
sector is expected to replace the role of FDI and pushing up the private external debt to
38 percent by 2008 and continue upwards to reach 58 percent by 2012. An alternative scenario
with key variables at their historical average shows an improvement in external debt because of
exceptionally high FDI. Scenarios with higher interest and a worsening current account indicate
less favorable debt path, especially for the latter shock. A large real depreciation would boost
exports, and lead to a significant improvement in the debt position.

ANNEX II. MONTENEGRO: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Montenegro’s Development Goals

1.
Montenegro declared independence in mid-2006, joining the World Bank and IMF
about half a year later in January 2007. Even under the umbrella of the State Union of Serbia
and Montenegro, the Bank had effectively established a functional relationship with
Montenegro.
World Bank support complements Montenegro’s developments goals, especially its
2.
objectives spelt out in the Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the European
Union (EU).1 Montenegro is in the process of developing and/or updating its development
and sectoral strategies and integrating those into the overarching national integration
program. These are to update Montenegro’s medium-term development strategy, as
contained in the 2004 Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (DPRS)2 and the
Economic Reform Agenda.
Following independence, and against the background of accelerating growth rates,
3.
largely fueled by a very significant inflow of foreign-direct investments, Montenegro has
made substantial progress in advancing its development goals. Euroization has contributed to
anchoring macroeconomic stability as a central pillar of economic policymaking,
complemented by programs to advance privatization, liberalization, and structural reforms—
with the aim of ensuring fiscal consolidation and promoting stronger private sector-led
growth. The prolonged debate on the Constitution, the lack of institutional capacity, and the
reorientation of policy priorities has delayed the implementation structural reforms in several
areas and led to some relaxation of fiscal policies during late 2007. Having completed the
immediate state-building tasks and the SAp, the government should overcome quickly the
delays in implementing the structural reform agenda.
World Bank Group Strategy

4.
A Joint World Bank-IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Montenegro,
covering FY07–10 and endorsed by the Bank’s Board on June 12, 2007, will support the
government’s key priorities, viz., to (i) enhance sustainable economic growth, through
increasing economic freedoms and strengthening the role of the private sector; (ii) build

Reduction Strategy.

44
institutions and the rule of law; and (iii) improve the standard of living of citizens, through
efficient education, health and social protection systems.
Coordination with the IMF has been strong, with cooperation having focused on
5.
macroeconomic issues and sectoral ones with a potentially strong macroeconomic impact—
more important still after the government’s decision not to request a Fund-supported program
and in light of the increased risks to macroeconomic stability. The Bank, through its ongoing
and planned operations, as well its complementary economic and sector work, will continue
to provide input on issues such as (i) labor market reforms; (ii) energy sector reforms;
(iii) public expenditure, pension and health reforms, with a view to streamlining service
delivery, and (iv) an appropriate framework to regulate concession arrangements and
potential public/private partnerships, with a view to encouraging investment in a way that
would ensure that the government does not accumulate significant contingent liabilities.
6.
Total outstanding debt of Montenegro towards the various part of the Bank was about
US$401.5 million on November 7, 2007 (US$56.9 million for IDA and US$344.6 for IBRD),
at the current exchange rate about €290 million. In September 2007, the government prepaid
€20 million, with further prepayments foreseen during the fourth quarter of 2007. With these
payments, Montenegro has considerably reduced per-capita exposure ratios, which had
previously been among the highest for any Bank borrower.
World Bank Activities

7.
The 2007 CPS envisages a total lending envelope of US$70–90 million. Following
the successful completion, in 2006, of the Second

The Healthcare System Improvement Project seeks to put in place first steps toward a
9.
reformed healthcare system to increase the capacity for policy, planning, and regulation,
stabilize healthcare financing, and improve primary healthcare service delivery. The
implementation is proceeding well, and government ownership is strong. The Health
Ministry has succeeded in securing CIDA grant funds to co-finance the project.
10.
The Energy Community of South East Europe-APL3 Montenegro Project is awaiting
effectiveness. Procurement activities for the projects have started. The General Procurement
Notice is prepared and about to be published, while EPCG is finalizing the technical
specifications for the projects and is planning to issue tender documents of some of these
projects by end-December 2007. In addition, Bank teams have discussed an Energy
Efficiency Project, planned for FY09, to support financing related projects in the public
sector, especially in the education and health sectors. The Bank team has agreed with
government representatives on next steps for further assessment of prospects and scope of
energy efficiency investments in public sector buildings.
11.
The Montenegro Sustainable Tourism Development Project is to help Montenegro to
better design and implement an integrated coastal zone management approach. With this,
coastal degradation is to be reduced and environmentally sound tourism development
fostered by supporting activities aimed at (i) enhancing spatial development, the use of
natural resources, regulatory policy, institutional capacity and governance of the coastal
zone, and (ii) initiating priority investments to improve environmental conditions and foster
development of high-quality tourism. These objectives will be achieved through
(i) improvements in land-use planning and protection to guard against uncontrolled
construction and development; and (ii) investments for the Continental and Southern part of
the Regional Water Supply Scheme with the capacity to provide water from Lake
Skadar/Shkodër to the municipalities of Bar and Ulcinj/Ulqin and the tourist areas of
Valdanos and Velika Plaža. This phase of the MSTDP will only finance the investments from
Lake Skadar/Shkodër to Bar.

12.
The Montenegro Environmentally Sensitive Tourist Areas Project is to create
ecological and commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in
Montenegro coastal municipalities, needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive
coastal area. This is to be achieved through the (i) development of the sector’s institutional,
policy and regulatory framework; (ii) rehabilitation of municipal disposal sites to function as
properly designed regional sanitary landfills; (iii) closing existing disposal sites in an
environmentally acceptable manner; (iv) provision of modern collection equipment;
(v) initiating a pilot recycling campaign; and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint
companies (MJC) that will be created to operate the two regional solid waste disposal
systems.
Current Bank involvement is restricted to policy dialogue and an application to the
13.
Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility trust fund, which is currently awaiting
approval. The government wishes to improve competitiveness and has major development

46
plans for two main road corridors (Bar to the Serbian Border, and Adriatic – Ionian
Corridor). The government has commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility, and
implementation schedule, of constructing motorways on both these axis, and political
pressure is high and increasing. The estimated costs are significant, exceeding current GDP
and, consequently, available resources. The government has therefore sought the support of
PPIAF and the Bank to investigate this option.
Over the last year, the performance of projects in Montenegro has increased
14.
considerably. As of October 5, 2007, the portfolio consisted of six projects under
implementation, with a total commitment of US$43 million, of which US$17 million have
been disbursed during the FY 2007. The disbursement rate, for the same period, has been
33 percent. Performance rating is Satisfactory (S) for 2 projects (education and sustainable
tourism development), Moderately Satisfactory (MS) for 2 (health and pension), and
Unsatisfactory for one (MESTAP); one project has not been rated yet (energy). The average
age of the portfolio is 2.2 years. Two new projects—in sustainable tourism and energy sector
development over a total amount of US$19 million—have been approved during the third
quarter of 2007. With respect to non-lending operations, a public expenditure and
institutional review (PEIR) is planned for the FY08.
In support of the implementation of the project portfolio, the Bank is also
15.
administering 2 Trust Funds financed by single and/or multi donors. Two projects financed
by Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the Tara and Lim River Basins Watershed
Management Project and the Lake Skadar/Shkodër Integrated Ecosystem Management
Project, both under preparation, should help boost tourism in the poorer northern part of the
country and around Lake Skadar/Shkodër.
The Bank’s assistance has been supported by a standard package of analytical and
16.
advisory activities. A CPAR and a CFAA were delivered in 2002, followed by a PEIR and a
Poverty Assessment in 2003. A Montenegro Economic Memorandum was completed in 2005
and focused on macroeconomic issues (particularly public expenditure), labor market reform,
the business climate and also synthesized findings of supporting studies of energy. A PEIR
update and Debt Sustainability Analysis were recently completed, while a Poverty
Assessment Update and an FSAP and ROSC are ongoing.
FIAS assisted the self-assessment of administrative procedures for doing business
17.
which identified several major areas of concern: complex procedures for registration of
enterprises, along with the lack of funds as well as shortcomings in the legal framework for
competition and management of public and private enterprises.
MIGA, with EAR support, is implementing a capacity building project in support of
18.
the new Montenegrin Investment Promotion Agency. MIGA’s TA activities are feeding into
a new, regional FDI outreach and marketing initiative for the Western Balkans launched in
summer 2004 (the European Investor Outreach Program for the Western Balkans).

47
IFC has also provided $5.2 million through Opportunity Bank Montenegro to expand
19.
micro- and small-business enterprise loan portfolio. In addition, IFC has provided support
through its Southeast European Enterprise Development (SEED) facility, later transformed
into Private Enterprise Partnership of Southeast Europe (PEPSE) and assisted in introduction
of Financial Leasing Law through its Leasing Project.

ANNEX III.

MONTENEGRO: STATISTICAL ISSUES

1.
While data are broadly adequate for surveillance, weaknesses hamper economic
analysis and policy making. Following the creation of the State Union between Serbia and
Montenegro in 2003, statistical institutions were split and Montenegro, being the smaller
partner and with a capital located far from Yugoslav institutions, lacked sufficient resources
and qualified personnel, and lost institutional memory and know-how. The quality and
timeliness of reporting vary across sectors. For monetary and balance of payments statistics,
international reporting standards have been adopted, while the adaptation of national account
data has been slower. Reporting of fiscal data has recently improved but coverage is limited.
A page for Montenegro in International Financial Statistics (IFS) was introduced with the
March 2007 issue.
The authorities have created a statistical council to coordinate efforts to improve data
2.
quality and requested technical assistance from foreign partners. In response, the Fund has
provided a series of technical assistance missions to improve the quality of macroeconomic
statistics and support policy formulation, often jointly with TA provided to Serbia. Over the
period 2001–04, STA conducted six missions to the State Union, including a mission on
monetary and financial statistics, separate balance of payments statistics missions to Serbia
and to Montenegro, and a multi-topic mission covering national accounts statistics. The
status of the statistical base, as reflected in these missions, can be summarized as follows:
(i) there is a critical need to improve the quality of existing macroeconomic statistics by
developing comprehensive data sources and improving statistical methodologies;
(ii) informal activities are inadequately recorded in the national accounts, especially in the
expanding service sector; and (iii) the principles for compiling monetary statistics are broadly
consistent with MFSM 2000. A 2006 monetary statistics mission and a 2007 real sector
statistics mission were undertaken to assist the authorities in improving the quality of the
compiled data.
A. Real Sector

3.
Real sector data are compiled by the Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT).
MONSTAT has started to adopt the 1993 System of National Accounts as a framework for
compiling national accounts estimates. However, the scope of the accounts is limited to
compiling annual production account in current prices, and only aggregate GDP in previous
year prices. The accuracy of the data sources needs to be improved. The business statistics
are still following the material system product concepts, collecting data mainly on quantities
produced. The national accounts estimates depend solely on bookkeeping data. There is no
business register to be used for statistical surveying, although work has started with Statistics
Sweden. On the expenditure side, there are no data on changes in inventories, and the quality
of investment and merchandise trade data is unsatisfactory. The exhaustiveness of the
national accounts data is seriously undermined by the lack of sound techniques to incorporate
unobserved activities. Some work has been done on ad-hoc basis, but the estimates produced

49
are not included in the regular compilation practice. The techniques for deriving volume
measures of GDP are constrained by the lack of suitable price and volume indices.
MONSTAT compiles and disseminates retail price indices (RPI), and cost of living
4.
indices, and producer price indices. A proper consumer price index is planned to be
introduced in 2008. In all price indices, the “carry-forward” technique for treatment of
seasonal goods, new goods, and missing items are not following international standards. The
quality of the labor and wage indicators is good.
B. Balance of Payments

5.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by MONSTAT (trade statistics) and the
Central Bank of Montenegro (other current account elements, capital and financial accounts).
Significant improvement is needed in data compilation, in particular in external trade, where
MONSTAT uses the special trade system for imports but general trade system for exports.
This inconsistency may have resulted in the overestimation of imports. In addition, the
classification used by MONSTAT is the Harmonized System (HS), but data are disseminated
according to the Nomenclature générale des Activités économiques dans les Communautés
Européennes (NACE), on highly aggregated groups, and with a significant time lag. Some
components are likely under-recorded, since a significant proportion of foreign exchange
transactions occur through informal channels.
Data on private external debt are weak. While the Central Bank of Montenegro
6.
(CBM) has continuously maintained a record of flows of private external debt in recent
years, there is no data on stock of external debt. The authorities’ program includes
strengthening the monitoring of private external debt by CBM and MONSTAT.
A June/July 2004 mission to the CBM assisted with adoption of compilation
7.
methodologies consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5)
and provided recommendations to improve international trade and external debt statistics, as
well as Montenegro’s international transactions reporting system (ITRS). The authorities
have implemented many of the recommendations of the 2004 mission. Following the
authorities’ request for further assistance, a mission visited Montenegro in September –
October 2007. Although it noted substantial progress, inadequate data sources continue to
constrain progress in improving balance of payments data.
C. Government Finance

8.
Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) based on a new GFS
institutional classification, and since early 2006, include data for the social security funds and
local governments. The chart of accounts introduced in 2001 has been implemented at the
local level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent re-classifications,
especially, at the level of local governments and social funds. The MOF has recently created
a unit responsible for data collection for state-owned enterprises (SOE), but a satisfactory

50
compilation of the public sector fiscal balance requires significant further efforts. Data on
stock of local government arrears need to be strengthened.
D. Monetary Accounts

9.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the CBM, broadly following the
institutional coverage, classification, and valuation methodology set forth in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000. Dissemination practices meet GDDS
recommendations with respect to the periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data.
Beginning in early 2006, the CBM publishes detailed monetary statistics in its monthly
Statistical Bulletin, which includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and surveys
for the CBM and the commercial banks.
Significant progress notwithstanding, there is need for further improvement. The
10.
2006 monetary and financial statistics mission made recommendations to the CBM on
methodological issues concerning: (i) the exclusion of two banks in bankruptcy from
financial reporting (the mission proposed that if these institutions are excluded from the
coverage of the monetary survey, a separate table on their monetary accounts could be
included in the CBM’s Statistical Bulletin); and (ii) treatment of interest accrued but not yet
due (which is maintained in aggregate on separate accounts rather than incorporated in the
outstanding amount of the financial asset or liability).
The CBM does not yet report monetary data in the format of Standardized Report
11.
Forms (SRFs). To avoid duplication of effort, the CBM will need to decide whether to adopt
the European Central Bank’s framework for collecting, compiling and reporting monetary
data or the STA-developed SRFs, either of which will provide monetary data that accord
with international standard.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Montenegro
On January 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Montenegro.1
Background
Independence and significant tourism potential have generated impressive investor interest in
Montenegro and started a recovery with growth expected to reach 7½ percent in 2007. But
strong growth, and the exuberance it has generated, has brought its own problems. There are
signs of overheating, with inflation and wages picking up, and the current account deficit
soaring. Vulnerabilities are also building up with rapid credit growth weakening private sector
balance sheets, an expansive fiscal stance, and an asset price boom.
The current account deficit is expected to widen further in 2007 to 37 percent of GDP driven by
high investment (spurred by foreign direct investment, which has hovered around 24 percent of
GDP in the past few years) and low savings associated with wealth effects and galloping credit
expansion. The share of foreign credits in the financing of the current account deficit has risen.
Rising labor costs have been eroding competitiveness.
Rapid credit growth is testing the capacity of the young banking system to prudently assess and
manage credit risks. Capital injections have kept the capital adequacy ratio at 18.7 percent of
risk weighted assets, which is high by international standards. Banking regulation and

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
supervision is relatively strong, but very fast credit expansion tests the capacity of the banks
and has been taking its toll on banks’ financial indicators.
Fiscal policy is adding to demand pressures. Strong revenue performance has boosted the
fiscal surplus, but tax cuts have weakened the impact of automatic stabilizers. A general public
sector wage increase of 30 percent, which is implemented in steps starting from October 2007,
has added to demand pressures providing an unhelpful fiscal stimulus.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the bright prospects for the Montenegrin economy, and praised
the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management and bold structural reforms over the
past few years. These efforts have helped Montenegro attract substantial foreign direct
investment. At the same time, the increased confidence related to independence and the fast
growth of tourism and real estate-related investments is generating strong demand pressures,
and raising vulnerabilities.
Directors considered that the economy may now be operating above capacity, with inflation
picking up and large wage increases weakening competitiveness. Rapid credit growth is
overstretching banks’ risk assessment capabilities, and has contributed to ballooning asset
prices. The quickly increasing level of private debt could lead to solvency problems, especially
if eroding competitiveness dampens the potential for the further development of tourism.
Against this background, Directors observed that the key policy challenge will be to prevent
overheating and ensure that the current boom unwinds smoothly. Given the limits on using
monetary policy with the adoption of the euro, fiscal policy will need to play a prominent role in
this regard. Directors recommended a combination of measures aimed at withdrawing fiscal
stimulus, reining in credit growth, and bolstering structural reforms to boost competitiveness and
improve the economy’s resilience to shocks.
While recognizing the need to allocate resources to strengthen infrastructure and the
institutional foundations of a new state, Directors counseled that, at a minimum, fiscal policy
should avoid adding to private sector demand pressures at the current juncture. The temporary
surge in tax revenues should not be seen as providing scope for tax cuts and higher current
spending. Directors underscored the need to contain fiscal risks from large restitution claims
and the assumption of contingent liabilities, including from private-public partnerships. They
recommended the development of a strong medium-term fiscal framework.
Directors commended the Central Bank of Montenegro for recent steps to stem the very rapid
growth of credit, including the broadening of reserve requirements and tightening of prudential
regulations. They encouraged early passage of the Banking Law to provide for stronger
supervisory powers for the banking sector regulatory authorities. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and their
intention to upgrade the current AML/CFT framework.

3
Directors encouraged the authorities to persist in implementing key structural reforms. They
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to reform labor legislation to improve economic flexibility and
facilitate job mobility. At the same time, wage discipline should be strengthened, and a better
link established between job performance and compensation. Directors called for further efforts
to improve the business environment, especially by limiting the scope for discretion on the part
of officials and regulators, completing zoning regulations, and strengthening corporate
governance. They noted the importance of reforms in the energy sector, in particular to ensure
adequate electricity supplies for the growing economy. They looked forward to the opening up
of the electricity sector to private investment and the phasing out of subsidies.
Directors noted that economic statistics need to be improved considerably in order to lay a
sound basis for economic analysis. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen the
organization of the statistical agency.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Republic of Montenegro
and Svetlana Cerovic, Advisor to Executive Director
January 16, 2008
The Montenegrin authorities greatly appreciate this opportunity to benefit from the Article IV
consultation discussions in the Board, two days before the first anniversary of Montenegro’s
membership of the Fund. The authorities highly appreciate the staff’s analysis and
contribution to the domestic economic debate, and the resulting comprehensive set of papers.
They attach great value to the close relationship with the Fund in meeting the challenges
ahead.
Recent developments
Modest economic growth in the beginning of the decade has accelerated since mid 2006
when Montenegro proclaimed its independence. Ambitious structural reforms, prudent fiscal
policy and a substantial capital inflow helped the country to shift from the phase of
establishing stability to the phase of accelerated growth. In the last two years real output
increased by 16 percent, mainly driven by capital inflows and a construction boom. In fact,
Montenegro is one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. Inflation was
subdued in 2006, but picked up in 2007, reflecting drought and an increase in food prices,
further liberalization of electricity and telecommunication prices and an increase in global oil
prices. Employment has been on an upward trend, with the unemployment rate approaching
single digit. Fiscal deficits turned into surpluses, public debt declined, and structural and
state-building reforms were launched. Furthermore, the financial sector displayed a
remarkably dynamic development.
Montenegro’s success has been recognized by international institutions. Becoming a member
of the IMF and World Bank in early 2007 had a positive impact on the sovereign credit
ratings. Committed to trade liberalization, Montenegro became a member of the Central
European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), and is now in the process of acceding to the
World Trade Organization (WTO). Following an intensive political process, the new
Constitution was adopted in October 2007, the same month in which the Stabilization and
Association Agreement with the EU was signed, a milestone in the EU integration process.
Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledge that much remains to be done and there are many
risks up the road. The current account deficit is large, the private sector is still weak and the
business climate needs to be enhanced. The challenge for fiscal policy is to strike the right
balance between counter-cyclical measures to contain strong demand pressures, and the need
to strengthen institutions and infrastructure in support of nation building.
Fiscal Policy
Growing economic activity accompanied by improved collection of fiscal revenue and
rationalization of public expenditure, led to an overall budget surplus in 2006, for the first

2
time in a long period. The favorable trends continued in 2007. The revenue windfall from the
economy being confronted with unprecedented FDI inflows resulted in a significantly higher
than budgeted surplus. As explained by staff in the Selected Issues papers, tightened fiscal
policy in the last two years created fiscal space by withdrawing stimulus, and there was not
much more that could have been done to sterilize the shocks. The authorities, as well as the
private sector consider high indirect labor costs to be one of the obstacles for business
development, employment growth and reducing the gray economy. Thus, the authorities have
been gradually cutting tax and social contribution rates. The approach has been giving
positive results over the last four years as the economy has been accelerating and overall
collection of tax revenues has increased.
One of the issues highlighted in the staff report and extensively discussed during the mission
is the approach of the fiscal authorities to public wage increases and investment expenditure.
Public sector wages in Montenegro are based on a minimum wage. The public sector wage
policy in the period 2002-2007 was very restrictive, and kept wages below subsistence level.
At the same time, robust economic growth and an increase in productivity, led to a
substantial increase in wages in the private sector, widening the gap between public and
private sector wages. The comfortable fiscal position enabled a gradual increase of public
wages in 2007 and in the beginning of 2008. The authorities see these measures as
instrumental to at least partly restoring purchasing power of public sector employees and to
achieve some catching up with the private sector. They argue that the need for a highly
qualified public administration, as a pillar for the EU integration process, asks for a revised
wage policy in order to strengthen administrative capacities. After the increase planned for
2008, the authorities intend to conduct a restrictive wage policy in 2009 and 2010.
During the 1990s the investment in infrastructure in Montenegro was neglected. The recent
dynamism of the economy and future growth prospects reinforce the importance of an
appropriate public investment policy. To this end, the authorities view increasing public
investment as imperative for achieving sustained growth. Accordingly, capital expenditures
more than doubled in 2007.
Marked improvements in revenue collection and a stronger than expected budgetary
performance were used for the regular servicing of all liabilities towards domestic and
international financial institutions. In addition, the authorities made a prepayment of the debt
to the World Bank, which, with other prepayments, decreased the public debt to GDP ratio to
32.4 percent at the end of 2007.
The Government of Montenegro has recently approved an Economic and Fiscal Program
(EFP) for 2007-2010. The EFP envisages the balancing of the consolidated public spending
(overall surplus around 1 percent of GDP). The Program is frontloaded in 2008 on account of
the catching-up process, nation building and the public wage structure pressures, but it is
envisaged to be restrictive in 2009 and 2010. Capital expenditures will rise steadily to about
9 percent of GDP by 2010, while current spending will decline from 41 percent of GDP in

3
2007 to 37 percent by 2010. The authorities’ mid-term fiscal revenue projection is
conservative (as confirmed by the achievement of a higher than budgeted surplus in 2007),
and they are committed to accumulating additional surpluses in case of revenue windfalls and
to refraining from higher spending.
Financial Sector
The Montenegrin authorities broadly agree with the Financial System Stability Assessment,
and they have already implemented several recommendations.
The financial sector has grown rapidly and its health has improved significantly in recent
years. In only six years since the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBM) was established, the
banking sector was completely transformed from being underdeveloped, ruined and stateowned, to a reputable system with high credibility. With dominant foreign players, the
banking sector has seen a strong increase of the deposit base.
Like in many other countries in the region, a rapid credit expansion has been observed over
the past years, which in recent months has been supported by foreign borrowing. Although
the credit growth originates from a very low initial base, the authorities are fully aware of the
macroeconomic and financial stability risks associated with such rapid growth. They have
undertaken a set of measures in that respect recently. The CBM has passed a new Decision
on the classification of bank assets and loan loss provisions that became effective as of
October 2007. The implementation of this decision will allow a better quality of credit risk
assessment based on international standards and improve the insurance of depositors in the
banking system. In addition, the CBM imposed the following measures effective as of the
beginning of 2008: an increase in the solvency ratio (to 10 percent and 12 percent for banks
with credit growth faster than 60 percent and 100 percent respectively), ceilings on credit
growth, and broadening of the reserve requirement base while decreasing the reserve
requirement rate on long-term deposits. Besides, the Credit Registry that will enable banks
and micro-credit financial institutions to gain insight into indebtedness of legal entities and
private individuals, shall be operable as of January 15, 2008.
The authorities also agree with staff that passing key banking legislation through Parliament
is crucial for further strengthening risk-based supervision. The Draft law on banks, prepared
in accordance with international standards, was adopted by the Government in November
2007. The law is expected to be discussed in the Parliament early this year, under an
accelerated procedure.
The Insurance Supervisory Agency, as an independent institution that will be in charge of
supervision and control of insurance companies, was formally established in December 2007,
and will start to perform its activities prescribed by law in January 2008. In line with the
strategic interest of Montenegro of joining the EU, as well as becoming a member of the
WTO, the Agency has successfully contacted various donors for the provision of assistance
and technical support.

External Sector and Structural Reforms
Montenegro has been experiencing a significant inflow of various foreign direct investments
in recent years, including privatization, green field investments, and in 2007 through real
estate purchases. According to the preliminary data for 2007, FDI inflow amounted to a
record-high level ranking Montenegro on the top among transition countries with regard to
the share of net FDI in GDP (22%). However, similar to other small, open, service-oriented
countries, Montenegro faces a large current account deficit. The existing level of the current
account deficit does not represent a problem for the time being, since it is mostly covered by
FDI inflows and other investments and it is self-correcting. Yet, the authorities concur with
staff that the large current account deficit and increasing spending needs warrant attention
and require sound policies to support its reduction.
Having said this, the authorities are aware that preserving competitiveness, while stimulating
capital inflows and accelerating the privatization process, is necessary to contain external
vulnerabilities. They remain committed to improving the business environment and
supporting the development of small and medium enterprises. Envisaged measures, among
others, include further facilitation of business start-ups, simplification of licensing
procedures, introduction of on-line registration and regular updates of the Central Register.
Furthermore, the Draft labor law, which incorporates EU directives and International Labor
Organization (ILO) conventions, and provides more flexibility in the labor market, was
adopted by the Government. The law will be discussed in Parliament in the first half of 2008.
Montenegro currently imports around a third of its electricity and the authorities attach great
importance to comprehensive energy sector reforms. They adopted the Energy Development
Strategy striving to considerably increase investments in the sector. The Action Plan for the
implementation of the Strategy will be completed in the first quarter of 2008. Moreover, a
tender for research and preparation of feasibility studies for the construction of small
hydropower plants was launched in November 2007. In cooperation with the World Bank
they will continue activities to improve efficiency in the energy sector.
Finally, on behalf of the authorities, we would like to thank staff and management for their
highly-valued policy advice. The authorities look forward to continue their very fruitful
relations with the Fund.
