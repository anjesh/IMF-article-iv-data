STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 21, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Algeria’s macroeconomic performance has remained strong, but vulnerabilities are
surfacing. Nonhydrocarbon sector growth is buoyant, supported by public spending,
and hydrocarbon revenues provide substantial external and fiscal buffers. However, the
recent surge in current spending has weakened the fiscal stance and spurred inflation
while risks are tilted to the downside. Against this backdrop, discussions focused on
policies to curtail inflation, ensure fiscal sustainability and the efficiency of public
spending, and foster strong nonhydrocarbon growth, with a view to increasing
employment.
Fighting inflation will require coordinated monetary and fiscal policies. Current
public spending—notably the wage bill—should be contained. Monetary policy was
tightened in May 2012, but more needs to be done, by raising interest rates and
mopping up excess bank liquidity, and by increasing government securities issuances to
finance the deficit.
Fiscal policy needs to be put on a sustainable path. The fiscal stance remains heavily
reliant on hydrocarbon revenues and is vulnerable to a long-lasting drop in hydrocarbon
prices. The nonhydrocarbon deficit is not consistent with preserving real wealth per
capita over the long term. Nonhydrocarbon revenues need to be bolstered, current
expenditures rationalized, and public financial management improved to enhance the
quality of public spending.
Structural reforms need to be stepped up to achieve faster and more inclusive
growth. These include improving the business climate, opening the FDI regime, and
deepening the financial sector. Improving the job/skills match and labor market
flexibility is also required to spur employment.
Exchange rate regime. The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as “other
managed arrangement.” Algeria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a),
3, and 4.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Following a decade of economic growth marked by the buildup of substantial buffers,
Algeria weathered both the global financial crisis and regional uncertainties well. Prudent
macroeconomic policies over the past decade, and the cautious management of large hydrocarbon
revenues, led to a strong financial position, with comfortable reserves, very low external debt, and
sizeable budgetary savings in the oil stabilization fund (Fonds de Regulation des Recettes, FRR). This
allowed the country to undertake countercyclical measures to withstand the global financial crisis,
and, more recently, to scale up current spending and support to employment and housing in order
to meet pressing social demands and contain social unrest.
2.
However, new challenges are surfacing along with longer-standing structural issues. In
the short term, the major concern is inflation, which is expected to reach a 15-year high in 2012. The
recent fiscal expansion has worsened fiscal sustainability and increased vulnerability vis-à-vis the oil
price. More broadly, Algeria’s economy is insufficiently diversified and is growing below its potential;
it remains heavily reliant on the hydrocarbon sector and public spending, while private-sector
growth is lackluster. Although there has been progress in curbing unemployment, it remains high
among youth and women; further progress hinges on accelerating private sector-led growth.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth and inflation. In 2011, growth reached 2.4 percent, held back by the continued
decline in hydrocarbon output and the slowdown in the construction sector. In the first months of
2012, the increase in public-sector absorption, good agricultural yields, and a smaller decrease in
hydrocarbon production, suggest that growth could be slightly better than in 2011. Inflation rose
from 4.5 percent in 2011 to 8.9 percent on average over the first nine months of 2012 (compared
with the first nine months of 2011), mostly on account of food (+19.6 percent for fresh food) and
manufactured goods prices. Higher prices were spurred by the excess liquidity resulting from the
surge in current public spending, and possibly also by inefficiencies in the distribution chain.

External position. The current account balance improved in 2011, to reach 9.9 percent of
GDP. The sharp increase in export revenues (27 percent), driven by the rise in the oil price, exceeded
import growth (15 percent), while the volume of hydrocarbon exports continued to fall, reflecting a
drop in production as well as an increase in domestic consumption. Algeria’s nonhydrocarbon
exports declined by about 11 percent in the first half of 2012, reflecting weak external demand.
Capital inflows remained limited, with FDI reaching US$2.6 billion (1.3 percent of GDP). Official
reserves increased by US$20 billion to reach US$182.2 billion at the end of 2011 (38 months of
imports of goods and services) while external debt fell to 2.2 percent of GDP. Over the first nine
months of 2012, hydrocarbon export revenues remained stable, with price increases offsetting the
impact of a 4 percent (year-on-year) reduction in volumes. Imports declined by 2.8 percent over the
same period, as the fall in food products and consumer durables imports surpassed the increase in
consumer goods imports. At end-June 2012, the current account surplus reached US$10.8 billion
(5.4 percent of GDP), but FDI inflows remained relatively low, at US$1 billion. Official reserves rose to
US$188.3 billion at end-September 2012.
5.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) remains close to its equilibrium level. Following
a slight depreciation (0.6 percent) in 2011, the REER appreciated by 5.8 percent (on a year-to-year
basis) over the first nine months of 2012. This appreciation was mainly due to a large inflation
differential between Algeria and its main trading partners, offset only in part by a 2 percent nominal
effective exchange rate depreciation. Nevertheless, the REER remains in line with its equilibrium
level, which appreciated following higher terms of trade and public spending (Appendix I); the latter
could entail Dutch disease effects. Despite the convertibility of the dinar for current transactions, the
parallel foreign exchange market has shown a substantial premium—about 32 percent at end-2012.
6.
Public finances. The fiscal deficit in 2011 stood at 1.3 percent of GDP, compared to
1.8 percent in 2010, as a result of higher hydrocarbon revenues. However, the nonhydrocarbon
deficit worsened, rising from 39.8 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP (NHGDP) in 2010 to 45.1 percent
in 2011, reflecting the larger increase in

Monetary survey. As a result of public spending and credit to the economy, money supply
(excluding deposits of the national hydrocarbon company SONATRACH) increased by 22.3 percent
in 2011, and by 21.7 percent in July 2012 (year-to-year basis). Structural bank liquidity (bank reserves

and the improvement in the net government position. The discount, seven-day and three-month
repurchase facility rates of the Central Bank remained stable at 4 percent, 0.75 percent, and
1.25 percent respectively.
8.
Financial sector. The banking sector remained sound in 2011. The overall solvency rate was
24 percent, the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) declined to 14 percent (of which 72 percent are
provisioned), liquidity was comfortable, and profitability high (Table 6). However, private-sector
credit has remained low (22 percent of NHGDP), reflecting the difficult access to financing for both
businesses and households. Notably, credit to households was low and accounted for only 8 percent
of credit to the economy, hindered by the ban on consumer credit decided in 2009. Notably, credit
to households was low and accounted for only 8 percent of credit to the economy, hindered by the
ban on consumer credit decided in 2009. The equity market is underdeveloped, with only three
listed companies and a capitalization of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2011. There were no issuances on the
private bond market in 2011 and 2012, and the volume of outstanding paper in circulation fell by
69.8 percent to 32.4 billion dinars between 2010 and 2011.
9.
Employment. The unemployment rate has
been steadily decreasing over the past decade; it
remained stable at 10 percent in 2011, as the fall in
employment was offset by a decline in the labor
force. Youth and female unemployment remained
high at 21.5 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively.

Outlook



Growth and inflation. Growth in 2012 is projected at 2.5 percent, supported by domestic
absorption, and could reach 3.4 percent in 2013, spurred by sustained private domestic
demand and a recovery in the hydrocarbon sector that is expected to last over the medium
term on the back of the national oil company’s large investment program. From 2013
onward, however, fiscal consolidation is expected to weigh on growth; absent structural
reforms to support private investment and net exports, nonhydrocarbon growth is projected
to stay below 5 percent. Inflation is expected to ebb to 5 percent in 2013, as public-sector
wage back payments are completed and monetary policy remains prudent.



External position. Algeria’s external position is expected to remain solid over the short and
medium term, with a current surplus of 8.1 percent of GDP in 2012 and 7 percent in 2013.
Hydrocarbon revenues are expected to decline slightly in 2012, as decreasing export
volumes (-3.2 percent) are not offset by higher international prices; imports will remain
stable in 2012 compared to 2011. Nonhydrocarbon exports are expected to gradually
strengthen, supported by an anticipated gain in external competitiveness and a stronger
external environment. FDI flows are expected to remain low, at US$1.7 billion (0.9 percent of
GDP). Official reserves are projected to reach US$194 billion (40 months of imports of goods
and services) while foreign debt will fall further to 1.9 percent of GDP. The current account is
projected to remain in surplus in the medium term, despite a slowdown in export revenues
(a gradual improvement in export volumes would not offset a lower hydrocarbon prices).
The current account is expected to remain close to its norm over the short and medium term
(Appendix I).



Fiscal. In 2012, the nonhydrocarbon deficit is expected to deteriorate further to 45.6 percent
of NHGDP, as a result of the full effect of wage increases and back payments. Wages and
current transfers should reach 26.6 percent of GDP in 2012, compared with 24.5 in 2011. In
2013, wage stability and the phasing out of back payments should contribute to fiscal
consolidation, even though the volume of civil service employment will increase by
2.7 percent. High hydrocarbon prices will support the fiscal balance, which should reach
3.6 percent of GDP deficit in 2012 before falling to below 2 percent of GDP in the medium
term. Fiscal savings for the stabilization fund are expected to decrease, to 35.8 percent and
34.7 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The fiscal breakeven oil price should rise
to US$121 a barrel in 2012 before falling back to US$110.6 in 2013.



Monetary. Monetary policy tightening and fiscal consolidation should support the slowdown
in broad money growth in 2012 (10.6 percent) and in 2013 (9.9 percent), while credit to the
economy is expected to grow at 14.9 percent in 2012 and 9 percent in 2013.

exports (90 percent of which are
directed towards the euro area). Slower European demand—as well as the increase in domestic
consumption—have contributed to a 4 percent decline in hydrocarbon exports volumes in the first nine
months of 2012, with natural gas exports falling by about 14 percent in the third quarter (year-on-year). This
is consistent with simulations based on a multinational GVAR analysis that suggest a strong impact of
European growth on Algeria.1/



A prolonged fall in oil prices. Rising expenditure was the main cause of the increase in the
fiscal breakeven oil price in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, the breakeven price is expected to
remain high and close to projected prices, despite the expected cutback in current spending.
A long-lasting decline in hydrocarbon prices would set the country on an unsustainable
fiscal trajectory.



Rising food prices in international markets (notably wheat). A rise in food prices would
negatively affect the current account balance and weigh on the fiscal balance (given the
relatively high level of subsidies), and could fuel inflation.



Worsening of the global economy. A new slowdown in growth (particularly in the euro zone)
would worsen the balance of payments, mainly as a result of the ensuing decline in
hydrocarbon prices and, to a lesser degree, the reduction of export volumes. Lower
hydrocarbon revenues would also worsen the fiscal balance. On the other hand, risks to the
financial sector are limited, given Algeria’s very limited exposure to international financial
markets (e.g., banks are domestically financed, and short-term debt is covered 159 times by
reserves).



Increasing pressure to use hydrocarbon revenues. This pressure could intensify as inflation
erodes real income, giving rise to a wage-price loop in the public sector that would
complicate fiscal consolidation and weigh on the economy’s competitiveness.

12.
Outward spillovers from Algeria are expected to be limited. Notwithstanding nonmeasurable informal trade and possible capital flows, Algeria has limited trade and financial
integration with its immediate neighbors. Spillover effects from a shock in Algeria would therefore
be very limited. This is confirmed by a global vector auto-regression (GVAR) analysis run on MCD
countries, which shows that a shock to Algeria’s growth would have barely any effect on its
neighbors.1
13.
Against this backdrop, discussions focused on the three main economic policy
challenges Algeria will be facing in the years ahead. In the short term, macroeconomic stability
will have to be preserved. In the medium term, fiscal sustainability and improved public financial
management are needed. Finally, a policy of promoting sustained and diversified growth must be
pursued to spur employment.

election is looming (2014).

Box 2. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities have broadly followed staff advice, though the pace and breadth of structural reforms have
been less than recommended by staff.
Monetary policy. The Banque d’Algérie (BA) increased liquidity absorption in May and raised the reserve
requirement rate, but refrained from raising interest rates.
Fiscal policy and public financial management. The large fiscal stimulus decided in 2010 is phasing out,
and the budget law for 2013 provides for a sizeable fiscal consolidation as salary back payments are coming
to an end. It has, however, proven difficult to contain the nonhydrocarbon deficit, and fiscal sustainability
continues to rely on the hydrocarbon resource. Tax administration and public financial management (PFM)
reforms are only slowly making headway, and work to improve the targeting of transfers, while high on the
authorities’ agenda, has not started.
Structural reforms. There has been some progress in improving the business environment, but the agenda
remains large, notably, improving the investment climate, encouraging foreign direct investment, deepening
and developing the financial sector, and continuing to support employment.

THEME 1. PRESERVING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
14.
The fiscal consolidation in the 2013 budget law is welcome, and any further wage bill
increase should be resisted. Fiscal policy has a key role in fighting inflation; the large increase in
the public wage bill in 2011 and 2012 was the main contributing factor to liquidity expansion, which
is the principal determinant of underlying inflation (Box 3). The 2013 budget is marked by the end of
public service wage back payments, which should facilitate disinflation. It will be vital to avoid any
further wage increases, as these would bring the risk of triggering a wage-price spiral and fueling
new inflationary pressures. In the medium term, wage increases should be linked to productivity
gains.
Box 3. Determinants of Inflation
An analysis of the determinants of inflation over 2003–11 shows that money supply, non-oil real GDP, and
prices of imported consumer goods are the three factors driving inflation in the long run. The analysis looks at

These findings notably underscore the importance of containing liquidity growth and unlocking supply-side
constraints to control inflation in the long term.

15.
Further monetary policy tightening is needed to rein in inflation. The commendable
decision by the BA, in May 2012, to raise the required reserves rate from 9 percent to 11 percent and
to increase liquidity absorption by 250 billion dinar (23 percent) reduced free liquidity and
contributed to slowing inflation. These measures were not, however, sufficient to bring average
inflation down to the level targeted by the monetary authorities (4–4.5 percent). Staff recommended

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ALGERIA

tightening monetary policy. With scarce room left to further increase the reserve requirement rate,
mopping up excess bank liquidity should be pursued and supplemented by raising the discount and
repurchase facility rates to nudge up savings returns. Delaying action would bear risks, particularly in
the event of second-round effects from public wage increases, and should be avoided. Excess
liquidity is also fed by the lack of savings instruments and investment opportunities; measures to
encourage savings, notably in the housing sector (complemented by policies to address housing
shortages), and to deepen financial markets would contribute to reducing consumption and, hence,
to easing inflationary pressures.
16.
Staff suggested resorting to bond financing of the government deficit to contain
liquidity injections. Fiscal financing requirements are currently met by drawings on the FRR, which
increases liquidity. Greater resort to the domestic capital market would help liquidity management,
with limited risks of crowding out private investment, given the high liquidity and very low interest
rates (nominal interest rates on three-month treasury bills and two-year bonds stood at 0.54 percent
and 1.27 percent respectively, on June 2012). A more active government securities market would
also have the advantage of supporting the necessary development of the financial markets. The
authorities argued that a greater reliance on market financing might increase the interest bill for the
budget; they expressed a preference for relying on the central bank to absorb liquidity. The
authorities felt that monetary and fiscal policy coordination was good; nevertheless, there is room
for improvement. In particular, it is important that updated cash-flow plans be shared to support an
accurate forecasting of the net government position and appropriate liquidity absorption decisions.
17.
Tensions on the supply side that feed inflation need to be addressed. The authorities
see inefficiencies in the distribution chain (notably for fresh food) and lack of competition as
disrupting price formation. Some of the distribution issues are being addressed by developing
market infrastructure, such as storage capacity and regional markets. Staff recommended that the
competition authority, provided for in a 2003 ordinance but yet to be established, be set up. Easing
FDI restrictions on the retail sector would also help.
18.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the exchange rate policy must continue to aim at
maintaining the REER in line with its equilibrium level. The foreign exchange regime is a
managed float: the rate is determined by the foreign exchange market, with the BA as the main
supplier. The exchange rate policy appropriately targets a REER in line with fundamentals. The
nominal and real appreciation in the first half of 2012 reflect the improvement in the terms of trade
and increase in public spending, and helped to moderate inflation. Stability of the nominal effective
exchange rate through end-2012 would support efforts made elsewhere to fight inflation, without
the real exchange rate deviating much from its fundamental value. In 2013, fiscal consolidation and
a prudent monetary policy would support disinflation, and would bring about some depreciation in
the equilibrium real exchange rate. The REER should therefore depreciate to remain in line with its
equilibrium value, thereby improving external competitiveness. The reserve adequacy level is high
across all measures (Box 4).
19.
There was broad agreement between staff and the authorities that the persistent
parallel market premium needs to be addressed. The official exchange market provides full
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. However, the high premium on the
parallel exchange market points to a demand not satisfied on the official market, and its persistence
could be detrimental to stability and growth. Staff recommended unifying the exchange rate market,
particularly by implementing the authorities’ plan to increase forex ceilings for travelers, as they are
very low—by far the lowest in the region (see Table below)—and ensuring that these are set to
realistic levels. Easing the obligation that exporters surrender a part of their nonhydrocarbon export
revenues to commercial banks and reducing significantly the “de facto” 100 percent reserve
requirement on FX deposits, would contribute to developing the forex market and encouraging
export diversification. In the longer term, a gradual lifting of capital account restrictions should be
envisaged.

Box 4. Reserve Adequacy Analysis
Algeria’s level of reserves at end-2011 remains more than adequate, based on traditional metrics.
Reserves increased rapidly last year, reaching US$182 billion at end-2011, on the back of a strong current
account surplus. Traditional metrics

of reserve adequacy indicate that
Algeria’s reserves at end-2011 are

This conclusion is confirmed by using a new and broader-based measure of reserve adequacy. A
composite reserve adequacy (RA) metric that combines risks based on short-term debt, other portfolio
liabilities, broad money, and export earnings points out that Algeria’s current level of reserves is above the
range considered safe from a precautionary perspective. A recent IMF study suggests that a level of reserves
covering between 100 and 150 percent of the RA ratio provides adequate buffers for crisis prevention or for
mitigating the effects of a crisis.1 Algeria’s coverage was at about 800 percent at end-2011, reflecting the
high level of reserves as well as limited external liabilities, a relatively closed capital account, and strong
export earnings.

take into account the downside risks
that weigh on Algeria's public finances: the fiscal deficit is sensitive to a lasting drop in hydrocarbon
prices (Box 1); the increasing domestic demand for hydrocarbons could reduce the country’s
exports; large implicit subsidies on the domestic price of hydrocarbon products add risk to the
budget; and the social pressure to share the hydrocarbon rent by raising expenditure is high.
21.
There was broad agreement on the need to bring the fiscal deficit to a sustainable
level, as well as on the measures to achieve this objective.


On the spending side, the consolidation in current spending provided for in the 2013 budget
law should continue. Staff recommended limiting net hiring, especially as the large public
sector is already in Algeria (Appendix III); aligning wage increases with productivity gains;
and containing the real growth of current transfers. The authorities, however, felt that
spending restraints needed to be balanced by the need to share the hydrocarbon revenues
with the population.



On the revenue side, tax revenues should be diversified to limit the reliance on hydrocarbon
revenues. Tax exemptions should be reviewed and rationalized. Steps taken in 2012 to speed
up the pace of VAT credit reimbursements would be expected to support progress in
phasing out VAT exemptions. A systematic assessment of the cost of tax spending would
also support efforts towards rationalization. Finally, improvements in tax administration
would also help to expand the tax base and increase the tax yield. While the authorities
broadly agreed, they continued to see a need for granting exemptions in order to spur
investment and growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

22.
Staff suggested that the rules governing the accumulation of resources in the FRR
could be reviewed. Although the FRR still provides a comfortable buffer in the event of a
temporary shock, its size as a percent of GDP has diminished with the surge in spending since 2011;
under current hydrocarbon price assumptions, this declining trend is expected to continue. The fiscal
rule, that involves saving hydrocarbon revenues whenever prices, are above the US$37/barrel
reference price, is incomplete, as the annual drawdowns on the FRR are not capped. As a result, the
actual oil price at which hydrocarbon revenues are saved is, in effect, closer to US$89 per barrel in
2011. Staff suggested considering an annual cap on drawdowns; this could be set in the budget law,
and would be consistent with fiscal sustainability. Additional financing requirements would be met
by issuing debt, which would have the advantage of supporting the development of capital markets.
While the authorities expressed interest in exploring options for debt issuance, they indicated their
determination to keep the flexibility in managing their cash flow that is afforded by drawdowns from
the FRR.
23.
Algeria’s subsidies are large and represent a significant fiscal effort in favor of its
population. Budgeted transfers in Algeria are high (13.6 percent of GDP in 2012), and include food,
employment, housing and interest subsidies. The authorities are committed to improving the quality
and the targeting of these subsidies, and have requested technical assistance from the IMF in this
area. In addition to these explicit transfers, the prices of a number of essential products, such as
petroleum and gas products or electricity, are set at a level well below international prices, which
gives rise to a system of implicit subsidies. Staff estimates suggest that implicit subsidies on
hydrocarbon products amounted to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010 for households’ final consumption;
the implicit subsidy to the productive sector through subsidized gas prices amounted to an
additional 6 percent of 2010 GDP (Appendix II).2 These implicit subsidies have several adverse
consequences. First, they give rise to episodic and costly bailouts of the public companies that
supply services at below-market prices; this in turn disrupts the activities of these companies,
increases costs, and creates fiscal risks. Second, the actual level of public expenditure and foregone
revenues from the national oil company are more difficult to assess. Staff recommended quantifying
and disclosing in the budget the actual cost of the implicit subsidies and providing for proper and
transparent financing public spending. This approach would strengthen fiscal management, improve
the financial situation of public companies, and raise awareness of the support provided by the
government to households and businesses. The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s
assessment and suggestions, and while they felt it was difficult to fully incorporate implicit subsidy
costs into the budget in the short term, they saw a possibility for disclosing them as an appendix to
the next budget law.

2

Electricity is largely produced using low-priced hydrocarbon products. In addition to this implicit subsidy,
infrequent repurchases of the national electricity company’s debt by the Treasury constitute an additional support to
investment and other operating costs.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

24.
Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to improve their budget toolkit as a means of
enhancing fiscal sustainability and the efficiency of expenditure.


The authorities’ long-standing objective of introducing a consistent medium-term budget
framework (MTBF) and multi-annual sector programs linking resources to expected
performance is commendable. However, repeated delays are depriving fiscal policy of
a crucial tool. Staff recommended interim steps that would support the longer-term
objective of setting up a consistent MTBF while making technical headway. In the context of
the 2014 budget law, sector-level budget envelopes could be set at the time of the budget
memorandum. Sector-level budgeting could be carried out in two or three pilot ministries,
for which a programming system is already in place. Such an approach would provide the
Ministry of Finance with helpful experience in the implementation of comprehensive and
more complex tools. Moreover, the roll-out of the five-year investment plan should be
seized as an opportunity to develop the full budgeting kit (MTBF and multi-year sector-level
performance-based budgeting).



The authorities were in broad agreement on a number of areas, identified by a recent FAD
TA mission, where progress would increase the efficiency of public financial management.
These include (i) rolling out of an integrated financial management IT system; (ii) further
improving the monitoring of public capital spending, especially program authorizations;
(iii) developing sector-level budget execution plans; (iv) gradually reducing the length of the
3-month-long supplementary budget period; and (v) modernizing the public accounting
framework.

for the participation of foreign contractors, simplifying procedures, and reducing payment



The authorities are well aware that competitiveness indicators point to weaknesses in
Algeria’s business environment; for instance in starting a business, trading, and paying taxes.
The authorities have taken steps to address some issues, but wide-ranging reforms are
needed. Staff notably recommended simplifying procedures for starting a business;
improving the efficiency of one-stop shops for new businesses; facilitating tax formalities, for
example by introducing online filing and payment of taxes for companies; and modernizing
taxation by reforming the TAP business tax, while ensuring revenue neutrality.3 The
authorities were in broad agreement with the recommendations; they expressed interest in
reviewing the TAP, provided an alternative revenue source could be found.



Algeria’s FDI regime is restrictive and should be opened. A comparative analysis of
88 countries (Table 3) shows that Algeria’s general requirement that foreign ownership
should not exceed 49 percent of assets stands as an exception: none of the surveyed
countries imposes a uniform minority rule on FDI across all sectors. Staff recommended
lifting this restriction on FDI or limiting it to a few strategic sectors. The construction sector
could, for instance, benefit from a relaxation of the minority rule; this would help the
government reach its ambitious housing construction goals, accelerate growth, and ease
supply-side tensions to fight inflation. The authorities, however, felt that their regulation did
not constitute a severe hindrance to FDI, as evidenced by recently launched or negotiated
partnerships. Finally, there is still a significant potential for attracting more FDI in the
hydrocarbon sector; passing the new hydrocarbon law approved by the Cabinet and
streamlining investment procedures would support larger FDI inflows in this sector.



An analysis of growth over the two decades shows that it has mostly been driven by factors
accumulation and that it could increase by 0.8 percent per year if total factor productivity

infrastructure development, improving education and training, and spurring innovation, in
partnership with the private sector.

Box 5. Promoting Economic Growth in Algeria
Algeria’s growth performance has been modest. Average real GDP growth during the 1990s, a decade
marked by internal conflict, barely reached 1.5 percent. Although real growth increased to 3.5 percent in
the 2000s, it remained below the average for oil exporters and emerging markets.
Real growth in Algeria has mostly been driven by the accumulation of factors of production, while overall
total factor productivity (TFP) growth was negligible. A standard growth accounting approach points out
that labor accumulation, mostly reflecting rapid growth in the labor force, was consistently the most
important source of growth, while physical capital accumulation only contributed significantly in the
2000s. Meanwhile, TFP growth was, on average, negligible. Significant differences arise across sectors,
with TFP growth contributing positively to growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector. Real GDP growth in
the hydrocarbon sector was mainly driven by the accumulation of human capital, with a declining
contribution of TFP growth. TFP growth contributed positively to the nonhydrocarbon sector during the
2000s.

Box 5. Promoting Economic Growth in Algeria (concluded)
A standard growth equation is also estimated to assess the contribution of various determinants to growth,
and to compare Algeria’s performance in a cross-country setting. A stable macroeconomic environment
and a relatively high investment ratio were the main strengths of the country compared to the average
of the 106-country sample. Conversely, a somewhat higher level of current spending, less openness, less
R&D, some underperformance in government effectiveness, and slightly more appreciated real
exchange rate than the sample average all contributed to slowing growth.
Simulations using both approaches suggest that Algeria’s long-term growth potential could be as high
as 6 percent per year, which would support higher employment as well as improved fiscal and external
positions.
Based on the findings of the analysis, policies to achieve higher growth should


Target higher investment. Public capital spending should be directed toward projects that generate
high economic returns; efforts to improve the quality of spending should be maintained, while
private sector participation could be better leveraged. The environment for private investment
needs to be improved, in particular by lowering the cost of doing business, improving tax
administration, facilitating trade, and improving access to finance, notably for privately-owned
SMEs.



Support an efficient and knowledge-driven economy. A faster accumulation of knowledge would
notably require a larger openness to both trade and foreign direct investment. Policies to enable
innovation and increase technological absorptive capacity are also needed to increase R&D
investment, support the absorption of existing technologies, and nurture innovative enterprises.
Similarly, investment in education, training, and health is needed to support knowledge absorption.
Institutions are also essential to the optimal allocation and efficiency of factors; in particular,
government effectiveness, a business climate supportive of private-sector development, and a
sound competitive environment should be encouraged.



Preserve Algeria’s strengths, notably the contribution of labor to growth. This implies increasing
employment, notably by enhancing labor quality; improving the jobs/skills match; and improving
labor market flexibility.

The financial sector needs to be modernized.



The commendable improvements in financial stability should be consolidated; banks should
particularly be encouraged to set up a mechanism to clear old and fully-provisioned
nonperforming loans. Staff welcomed the introduction of a bank rating system based on the
CAMELS method,4 and encouraged the authorities to complete the process on the basis of
their own ambitious targets set for end-2013. Staff also supported tightening prudential
regulation, in compliance with international standards. With respect to financial stability,
staff recommended conducting stress-test exercises with a wider range of shocks on a
regular basis, and incorporating them in the upcoming financial stability report, which
should be published. The BA’s intention to establish a macro-prudential policy framework
that draws on international best practices is welcome. BA should also develop a formal early
warning system for the financial system.



Special attention should be paid to improving bank intermediation. Staff recommended
stepping up the modernization of the credit bureau. Staff also underscored that the ban on
consumer credit should be eliminated and real estate mortgages developed, especially as
credit bureau coverage has been extended to households. Currency in circulation is high in
Algeria, reflecting the sizeable informal sector and the uneven access to banking services
across the country (Appendix III). To reduce currency in circulation, staff recommended that
large transactions with the public sector be systematically carried through checks or wire
transfers. Moreover, to enhance access to banking services, procedures for branch opening
could be simplified. Finally, finance could become more inclusive with the introduction of
measures to encourage micro-finance.



Staff welcomed the authorities’ program to reform the financial markets, which focused on
increasing stocks listing and securities issuance; developing market infrastructure and
investment services; and improving market functioning, including by upgrading the trading
platform. To develop the stock market, well-performing public companies should be listed.
Current programs to strengthen public companies and offer subsidized interest rates to the
private sector reduce the incentive for tapping the bond market. In that context, it would be
important to review the framework for supporting companies and expanding government
bond issues. In the medium term, opening sovereign debt issuance to the international
market would contribute to setting a benchmark.

27.
The authorities have implemented some of the recommendations as part of the action
plan agreed on with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In early 2012, the authorities
established regulations providing definitions of “acts of terrorism” and specifying the notion of
“politically exposed person (PEP)”, although the latter term is limited to persons of foreign
nationality. The BA conducts regular inspections of banks to ensure their compliance with the
4

CAMELs—a credit worthiness assessment system—stands for Capital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings,
Liquidity, and Sensitivity to market risk.

existing regulations governing money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and shares its
findings with the AML/CFT unit. However, deficiencies remain, in particular regarding how terrorist
acts are defined, the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1373,
broadening of the definition of PEPs to include nationals, and enlarging the scope of customer due
diligence (CDD) obligations in line with the recently revised FATF standard. The authorities are
encouraged to tackle these deficiencies and to fully implement the action plan agreed with the
FATF.
28.
Reforms of the employment market will be necessary to support job creation.
Employment is dominated by the public sector, which accounts for 30 percent of total employment
and 76.1 percent of those wage earners who have a permanent job. There is also a large informal
sector (Appendix III). The mismatch between education and employment results in high
unemployment rates among university graduates, and insufficient numbers of skilled workers in
professional sectors, such as the construction sector and agriculture. The authorities would do well
to introduce an “education for employment” plan. Additionally, labor market rigidities and high
payroll taxes may reduce the incentive for companies to create jobs. Finally, active labor market
policy measures—such as subsidized hires in the private sector and support for starting individual
businesses—have helped to bring down unemployment among university graduates. An
independent assessment should be carried out on the efficiency of these measures.
Box 6. Actionable Policy Recommendations for 2013
The following macroeconomic and structural measures could be introduced relatively quickly, and could
make a significant difference in both stabilization and growth.
To strengthen macroeconomic stability


Tighten monetary policy.



Enhance coordination between the Ministry of Finance and Banque d’Algerie. Updated Treasury
cash flows could be discussed at regular intervals.



Set higher and realistic FX ceilings for travelers.

To support fiscal sustainability


Cost and disclose the main implicit subsidies—such as energy subsidies—in an appendix to the
2014 budget law.



Review and rationalize VAT exemptions.



Set medium-term sector envelopes early in the process for the 2014 budget.

To improve the business environment and spur growth


Further simplify the procedures for creating and operating a business.



Revise the FDI ownership rules to lift existing restrictions or limit them to strategic sectors.



Lift the ban on consumer credit.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Algeria’s macroeconomic performance has remained strong, but vulnerabilities are
surfacing. Nonhydrocarbon sector growth is buoyant, supported by large public spending, and
sizeable hydrocarbon revenues provide external and fiscal buffers. However, the recent surge in
current spending has worsened the fiscal stance and spurred inflation, which is expected to reach a
15-year high, while nonhydrocarbon growth shows signs of slowing. Policies will have to be geared
toward curtailing inflation, ensuring fiscal sustainability and the efficiency of public spending, and
fostering strong nonhydrocarbon growth.
30.
Fighting inflation will require a coordinated use of monetary, fiscal, and structural
policies. The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the 2013 budget law is welcome, and any additional
increase in current spending—particularly in the wage bill—should be resisted. The authorities
appropriately bolstered liquidity management in May 2012, but the monetary stance will need to be
further tightened to bring down inflation to the 4–4.5 percent target. The reliance of the
government on drawdowns from the FRR to cover its cash flow needs should be reduced to contain
liquidity injections, and market financing should be sought more actively. Finally, structural
measures would also help contain demand pressures. The authorities’ efforts to reduce tensions on
the supply side that distort prices are welcome, but there is room for further action, notably putting
in place the long-awaited competition authority.
31.
The exchange rate policy appropriately targets a real effective exchange rate in line
with fundamentals. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with its equilibrium value, and
the reserves position is very comfortable. In that context, the parallel market premium on the
exchange rate should be addressed, given the importance of a unified exchange rate market,
especially for private sector development. Forex ceilings for travelers should be raised significantly
to realistic levels, and forex surrender requirements on exporters, as well as the regulation on
reserve requirement on forex deposit, should be eased.
32.
Fiscal policy needs to be set on a sustainable trajectory. The fiscal stance is vulnerable to
a lasting drop in hydrocarbon prices, and large current spending in the recent past has led to an
increase in the fiscal breakeven oil price to levels slightly above actual prices. The nonhydrocarbon
fiscal deficit is not consistent with maintaining real wealth per capita, and is largely financed by
drawdowns from the oil fund. Current spending—notably on the wage bill and subsidies—should be
contained, and nonhydrocarbon tax revenues bolstered, notably by discontinuing tax exemptions.
The budget law could usefully include an explicit cap on FRR drawings consistent with medium-term
sustainability. Moreover, the actual cost of large implicit subsidies, related particularly to the low
domestic energy prices, should be disclosed, and financing provided within the budget to
strengthen fiscal management, improve the financial management of the public companies that are
part of this subsidy framework, and raise awareness of the support provided by the government to
households and businesses.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

33.
The authorities’ efforts to enhance their budget toolkit are welcome. Sector-level multiyear budget envelopes could be set for the next exercise, and pilot experiences of sector-level
performance-based budgeting carried out. Better monitoring of capital spending authorizations, the
development of sector-level budget execution plans, the setting up of an integrated PFM IT system,
and a gradual shortening of the supplementary budget period, are all measures that would improve
the efficiency of public financial management.
34.
Algeria needs a faster and more inclusive growth. Public investment should be
safeguarded while improving its quality and the public sector’s absorptive capacity. To encourage
private investment, wide-ranging reforms to the business climate are needed. The restrictive FDI
regime should be reviewed, and ownership restrictions lifted or limited to a few strategic sectors.
Finally, to enhance job opportunities for the still-high number of young and female unemployed,
policies to improve the jobs/skills match and to increase labor market flexibility are needed.
35.
A modernized financial sector is needed to foster growth. Improvements in financial
stability are welcome and should be consolidated, by enhancing supervision and assessing systemic
risk, and by establishing a write-off mechanism for fully provisioned old NPLs. Bank intermediation
will need to be strengthened, and the ban on consumer credit lifted. Finally, the authorities’ plan to
reform the financial market is welcome, and should be supported by the listing of public companies;
however, the extended use of subsidized interest rates reduces incentives to rely on financial
markets and should be phased out.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate and External Stability Assessment
The analysis, based on the three methods of the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER),
shows that the Algerian dinar remains in line with fundamentals.
A CGER-based assessment and an alternative estimate based on the macroeconomic balance
approach (MBA) suggest that the current account surplus is close to the norm. Standard CGER
approaches and the alternative MBA estimate indicate that Algeria’s projected medium-term current
account balance (4.5 percent of GDP in 2017) is close to the norm. The MBA method implies a
current account norm at 6 percent of GDP, while the alternative MBA estimate points to a slightly
higher current account norm at 8.5 percent of GDP. The sustainability method (ES) implies a current
account norm at 4.9 percent.

offset the slight narrowing of gap in Algeria’s productivity with respect to its trading partners. The
EREER analysis suggests an overvaluation of the REER of about 3.3 percent in 2017.
However, the results of the analysis should be treated with caution, given the existence of a more
depreciated parallel market exchange rate.

Appendix II. An Estimation of Implicit Subsidies from Low
Domestic Hydrocarbon Prices
The domestic price of hydrocarbon products sold in Algeria have been kept stable as part of a
policy of sharing the hydrocarbon resource, which involves setting prices that are lower than the
international market price. As a result, energy prices are lower than the average European and
American prices, and lower than the average price in Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries.
Gasoline prices—which are generally below market in oil-exporting countries—are lower in Algeria
than in oil-exporting countries such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, or Kazakhstan. Algerian diesel
oil prices are also among the lowest in the region. These prices expose Algeria to leakages,
especially in view of the higher prices in neighboring oil-importing countries in the Maghreb.1

A price policy of this nature represents a considerable effort on the part of Algeria in favor of
its consumers. This effort has increased over time, as domestic prices were kept stable in the
context of rising world oil prices. Staff estimates for the final consumption of diesel oil, gasoline, and
LPG alone suggest that in 2010, the effort, measured on the basis of the difference between the
world price and the Algerian price, amounted to 4.1 percent of GDP. Similarly, the policy of lowpriced gas represented an effort in favor of final consumption amounting to about 1.6 percent of
GDP. This figure is substantially higher when implicit subsidies to intermediate consumption of gas
are taken into account, and rises by about 6 percent of GDP, assuming identical pricing of
intermediate and final natural gas consumption.

1

These large price disparities with Algeria’s neighbours create a risk of subsidized products being acquired by
foreign consumers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

The implicit subsidies on final and intermediate consumption amounted to about
11.8 percent of 2010 GDP, corresponding to US$19 billion, 125 percent of current transfers, or
109 percent of tax revenues in 2010.

Under current consumption growth assumptions, the cost of implicit subsidies would remain
high even in the event of a lasting drop in hydrocarbon prices. Total implicit subsidies (including
on intermediate gas consumption) would remain at about 10 percent of GDP by the end of the
projection period, and would still reach 7.7 percent of GDP in the event of a lasting decline in
international hydrocarbon prices.

The potential cost of these implicit subsidies could increase. Low oil prices continue to foster the
rapid growth in the energy intensity of the country (measured in kg of oil equivalent per capita),
which was 3.5 percent on average over 2004–09, compared with 2.3 percent in the Middle East and
North Africa region, and 3 percent in all middle-income countries.2 The subsidies thus directly
contribute to increasing the pressure of domestic demand on Algeria’s export capacity.
Household consumption survey data will be useful for furthering the analysis of the impact of
implicit subsidies on poor households, and for designing a strategy for targeting subsidies.

Appendix III. The Informal Sector in Algeria
The informal sector is a source of concern for the authorities, who see it as a major obstacle to
the development of economic activity in Algeria.
Despite the lack of statistical monitoring, there are indications that informality is a
widespread, and possibly growing, phenomenon.
The employment survey carried out by the Algerian statistics office (ONS) suggests that the
informal sector, proxied by the share of nonInformal Employment

suggest that the informal sector represents a
large part of the economy, and increased over the decade starting in 2000. In 2011, the ratio of
currency in circulation (relative to M2) in Algeria was higher than in 75 percent of countries in the
world, an indicator that not only underlines the insufficient development of the financial sector, but
also indicates that a substantial share of transactions are conducted outside formal payment
systems. Additionally, while the share of currency in circulation in proportion to the money supply
fell for a sample of 101 countries between 2002 and 2011, figures show that this ratio remained
stable in Algeria and increased slightly at the end of the period.

The factors encouraging the development of the informal sector are generally well-identified
and include excessive regulation of the goods and labor markets, and high taxes.1 Specifically,
experience in countries in the Middle East and Central Asia suggests that obstacles to the
development of the formal sector include


high taxes;



long, expensive, and complex procedures for setting up and managing companies; and



high employment costs, especially through minimum wages that are higher than employment
productivity, or high severance costs.

The quality of institutions also plays a role, notably when it leads to below-standard public services
or the failure to implement legislation properly.

Appendix IV. Public Sector Employment in Algeria. An InterSector and International Comparison
The recent increase in civil servants’ wages resulted in a major increase in their purchasing
power, which exceeded the growth of real wages in other sectors. The pay rises in the public
sector (excluding civil service) and in the private sector were in line with inflation; consequently, real
wages remained constant over 2000–12. On the other hand, the increase in civil service wages
resulted in an increase in compensation of 5.5 percent in real terms (annualized rate of payment,
excluding the back payment) over 2008–12. The average civil service wage appears to be relatively
high—about 40 percent higher than the average public-sector wage (excluding civil service) and
twice as high as the average private-sector wage (which includes the informal sector).1

Civil service wage increases in 2010 accelerated the already swift progression of the wage bill
in the late 2000s. Following the completion of civil service wage back payments, the wage bill is
expected to fall in 2013. This movement should be supported by stabilizing employment volumes, in
order to avoid an unsustainable increase in the wage bill.

Appendix V. Growth and Employment in Algeria
A simulation based on an analysis of the employment content of growth in Algeria suggests that large
reforms to the labor market, or significantly faster growth, would be needed to curb unemployment.
Employment growth can be expected to be relatively slow under current nonhydrocarbon
growth assumptions.10 Given the relatively low elasticity of employment to growth, at about 0.5,
and slowing nonhydrocarbon growth, employment is expected to increase by only about
2¼ percent a year, compared to 4 percent on average over 2001–10. The elasticity of employment
to growth would need to be doubled for employment to grow above its past trend, and would need
to be supported by wide-ranging reforms to the labor market.
In the baseline scenario, growth would barely stabilize unemployment at its 2011 level.
Reforms to the labor market would increase the elasticity of employment to growth and support
some decline in unemployment. However, the most powerful driver of a drop in unemployment
would be higher growth. Should growth reach its potential level of 5.7 percent, unemployment
would decline rapidly.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

1.
From January 21, 1974 to October 1, 1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was determined
on the basis of a fixed relationship with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time to time. On
October 1, 1994, the Bank of Algeria introduced a managed float for the dinar through daily fixing
sessions that included six commercial banks. This system has been replaced by an interbank foreign
exchange market as of January 2, 1996. On December 12, 2012, the average of the buying and
selling rates for the U.S. dollar was US$ 1 = DZD 78.21, equivalent to SDR 1 = DZD 120.15. No
margin limits are imposed on the buying and selling exchange rates in the interbank foreign
exchange market, except for a margin of DA 0.015 between the buying and selling rates of the Bank
of Algeria for the dinar against the U.S. dollar.
2.
The de facto exchange regime is classified as other managed arrangement with no
preannounced path for the exchange rate. Full surrender requirements are in effect on hydrocarbon
export proceeds. Limits on the making of payments for invisible transactions and current transfers,
which have remained in place since Algeria accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3,
and 4, in 1997, are indicative according to the authorities. Inward direct investment is generally free
of restrictions but a 49 percent foreign ownership limit has been introduced in December 2009;
controls are maintained on other capital account payments and transfers.

ANNEX III. ALGERIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Following STA recommendations, the NSO is now compiling annual national
accounts (ANA) at prior year prices. The ANA broadly follow the 1993 SNA recommendations, but
nonprofit institutions serving households are not taken into account. Work is ongoing to compile
QNA.
Price Statistics: Data are published with a delay of less than one month.

Government finance statistics: Key shortcomings include insufficient institutional coverage
(coverage is limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts), classification problems, long lags for
production of statistics, and lack of reconciliation of financing with the monetary accounts. Key
factors behind these weaknesses include the lack of financial resources allocated to the compilation
of statistics, insufficient interagency coordination, and concern about accuracy that give rise to
reluctance to publish provisional data.

Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics compiled by the authorities are largely in line with the
methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000 and its companion
Compilation Guide, 2008. Timeliness of reporting by state-owned commercial banks has
significantly improved over the last two years; consequently, data on depository corporations—
as well as finance companies—are usually available within a period of two to three months.
Reporting formats (balance sheet and appendices) applied to commercial banks and finance
companies were updated in 2009 and the updated version was enforced in 2010. All
respondents now provide all requested data, thus making the monetary statistics more
meaningful than before. Data on insurance corporations are not yet collected, but the Banque
d'Algérie, with the continuing support of the IMF Statistics Department, launched in 2009 a
project to this end.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are generally of good quality. International
investment position data are not available
II. Data Standards and Quality
Algeria began participation in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) on April 21, 2009.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Algeria
On January 16, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2012 Article IV consultation with Algeria.1
Background
Algeria’s economic performance in 2012 is expected to remain solid. Growth is projected at
2.5 percent in 2012, supported by a buoyant nonhydrocarbon sector bolstered by public
spending. It is forecast at 3.4 percent in 2013, underpinned by domestic demand and a recovery
in the hydrocarbon sector. The current account surplus is expected to reach 8.1 percent of GDP
in 2012, as higher hydrocarbon prices offset lower export volumes, and 7.0 percent of GDP in
2013. In 2012 and 2013, foreign exchange reserves will remain comfortable, at about three
years of imports, and external debt levels will remain low. The oil stabilization fund, net of public
debt, will be hovering at 26 percent of GDP. Risks to the economy are mainly tilted to the
downside, as Algeria is vulnerable to a prolonged fall in oil prices, rising food prices on
international markets (notably wheat), a worsening of the global economy, particularly in the
euro zone, and increasing domestic pressure to use hydrocarbon rents. Outward spillovers from
Algeria are expected to be limited.
Inflation surged to 8.4 percent in 2012, reaching a 15-year high, from 4.5 percent in 2011. Price
increases were mainly seen in food and manufactured goods, spurred by excess liquidity
resulting from the surge in current public spending that was financed by draw-downs from the oil
fund, and possibly also by inefficiencies in the distribution chain. In May 2012, Banque d’Algérie

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

ALGERIA

raised the required reserves rate from 9 to 11 percent and increased liquidity absorption by
250 billion dinar (23 percent), thereby reducing free liquidity, but this was not sufficient to
contain inflation.
Fiscal vulnerability increased as a result of the fiscal expansion of recent years. The fiscal
balance is expected to deteriorate to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012, from 1.3 percent in 2011, as a
result of the full effect of increases in civil service wages and current transfers decided in 2011.
As a consequence, the breakeven oil price is projected at $121 per barrel in 2012, up from $109
in 2011, reflecting an increased vulnerability to hydrocarbon prices. The new budget law for
2013 phases out the wage back payments, and allows for fiscal consolidation; the fiscal deficit
is consequently expected to improve to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2013. Although the
nonhydrocarbon deficit is projected to decrease to 40 percent in 2013 from 45.6 percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2012, the real wealth per capita will continue to decline in the long run.
Growth is insufficient to dent unemployment. It is highly dependent on the public sector, funded
by the hydrocarbon windfall, and it lacks diversification. Negative growth in the hydrocarbon
sector over the past few years dragged down overall growth. Public investment has been
growing at a slower pace since 2009, contributing to the slowdown in nonhydrocarbon growth.
The real effective exchange rate appreciated in 2012, weighing on the external competitiveness
that is needed to foster the contribution of net exports to growth. Despite recent efforts, the
business environment remains cumbersome and hampers private investment, both domestic
and foreign. Foreign direct investment, in particular, faces severe constraints on ownership. The
banking sector is sound, but access to financing remains limited. Financial markets are
underdeveloped. Unemployment has declined from a high of almost 30 percent in 2000 to
10 percent in 2011, but youth and female unemployment rates remain high, at 21.5 percent and
17 percent, respectively.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Algeria’s continued strong economic performance despite the
difficult external environment. Directors noted, however, that rising inflation, continued heavy
reliance on the hydrocarbon sector and public spending, and vulnerability to a prolonged decline
in the oil price, as well as high unemployment pose significant challenges. Against this
background, they encouraged the authorities to take measures to preserve macroeconomic
stability, ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, and promote strong nonhydrocarbon growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to curb inflation, notably through increased liquidity
absorption and higher required reserves by the Banque d’Algérie, and the fiscal consolidation
embedded in the 2013 budget. However, to bring average inflation down to the targeted level,
they recommended further tightening of monetary policy by mopping up excess liquidity and
raising the discount and repurchase facility rates. Avoiding any further increase in public sector
wages, and issuing government bonds to cover cash-flow needs, instead of reliance on the oil

fund, will also play an important role. In addition, Directors saw scope for structural measures to
help contain price pressures stemming from the supply side.
Directors noted staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to address the high parallel market
premium. Directors considered that increasing foreign exchange ceilings for travelers will be a
step in the right direction. They encouraged the authorities to further develop the interbank
foreign exchange market.
Directors emphasized that further fiscal consolidation will be key to ensuring fiscal sustainability.
In this context, policy efforts should gear towards containing current spending, especially the
wage bill, better targeting subsidies, reviewing tax exemptions, and bolstering nonhydrocarbon
tax revenues. Directors noted that explicitly considering an annual cap on drawdowns from the
oil fund, set in the budget law, would strengthen the existing oil price fiscal rule. They stressed
the need to enhance public financial management and to implement a full-fledged medium-term
budget framework.
Directors welcomed the improvements in financial stability and called for steps to consolidate
these gains. They encouraged efforts to strengthen bank intermediation by lifting the ban on
consumer credit and supported the authorities’ plans to deepen the financial markets. Directors
called for measures to address the remaining shortcomings in the AML/CFT (Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism) framework and fully implement the
action plan agreed with the FATF.
Directors emphasized the need for wide-ranging reforms to diversify the economy, improve the
business climate and competitiveness, increase productivity, and boost growth, especially
nonhydrocarbon growth. Efforts should also focus on promoting private investment, further
liberalizing trade, and supporting a more efficient and knowledge-driven economy. Directors
recommended safeguarding public investment and improving its quality and enhancing the
public sector’s absorptive capacity. They encouraged the authorities to review and amend the
restrictive FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) regime. Directors agreed that policies aimed at
improving the jobs/skills match and enhancing labor market flexibility, along with effective active
labor market interventions, will help increase employment, especially for the young and women.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Algeria
and Said Maherzi, Advisor to Executive Director for Algeria
January 16, 2013
Our Algerian authorities thank staff for a candid report and a useful Selected Issues paper
(SIP), and are in broad agreement with the staff’s appraisal. They are appreciative of the
constructive dialogue with the Fund and highly value its advice, technical assistance, and
support to their policies and reforms.
Algeria’s economic performance remained strong in 2012. Sustained implementation of
the public investment program (PIP) continued to underpin growth in the
nonhydrocarbon sector, which remained buoyant. At the same time, despite continued
decline in the hydrocarbon sector, overall GDP growth stood at an estimated 2.5 percent.
Unemployment rate stabilized at around 10 percent, down from a peak of 30 percent in
2000, although it remains high among the youth. Fueled by excess liquidity and
distortions in the distribution chain, inflation surged to 8.4 percent, but is expected to
recede to 5 percent in 2013. The external position remained strong, with a current account
surplus estimated at more than 8 percent of GDP, international reserves representing
more than 3 years of imports, gross external debt further declining to less than 2 percent
of GDP, and the stabilization fund (FRR) resources standing at 36 percent of GDP.
Growth is projected to strengthen in 2013 onward on account of continued good
performance of the nonhydrocarbon sector, supported by the PIP, and a gradual recovery
of the hydrocarbon sector, underpinned by the national oil company’s ambitious
investment program.
Preserving macroeconomic stability is central to the authorities’ strategy. The surge in
current spending during the past three years, following civil service reform-related wage
increases and back payments spread over the 2010-12 period, has impacted the fiscal
position. With capital spending under the PIP remaining high, the 2012 overall deficit is
expected to increase to 3.6 percent of GDP, even though the nonhydrocarbon balance
should remain broadly unchanged at around 44 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP.
Building on the phasing-out of the wage back payments, the 2013 budget initiates a
consolidation process, which should bring the fiscal accounts back to sustainable levels,
with the deficit declining to 1.3 percent of GDP this year. A review of the subsidy
system, soon to be undertaken with Fund assistance, should help identify steps to
rationalize and better target spending in this area, thereby further containing current
spending, while strengthening the social safety net. Particular attention will also be
directed to further improving tax administration and the quality of investment spending,
including by strengthening the agency in charge of evaluating and monitoring investment
projects.
Significant investment has been made over the past several years, particularly in
infrastructure, which remains important to supporting growth. Looking ahead, the
authorities will continue to ensure that capital spending is adjusted to available resources
to preserve fiscal sustainability while supporting macroeconomic objectives. Stepped-up
efforts will be devoted to modernizing the budget framework, including by accelerating

ALGERIA

the establishment of an integrated public financial management IT system and developing
sector-level budgeting, as a step towards introducing a medium-term budget framework.
Monetary policy continues to be geared toward containing inflation. Faced with a surge
in excess liquidity, the Bank of Algeria (BA) has substantially increased liquidity
absorption and raised the reserves requirement rate. However, these measures were not
sufficient to contain inflation, which averaged 8.4 percent in 2012, although it trended
downward over the last months of the year. Looking forward, inflation pressures are
expected to recede with the phasing-out of the wage back payments, fiscal consolidation
efforts, and ongoing measures to address distortions in the distribution chain. This said,
BA will continue to closely monitor developments and will take additional actions, as
needed, to bring inflation down to the targeted 4-4.5 percent range, including by
increasing excess liquidity absorption and raising interest rates. The authorities take
positive note of staff suggestion to finance part of the budget deficit through government
bonds instead of drawing down on the stabilization fund in order to provide additional
instruments for liquidity management. Such direction will be considered in light of
inflation developments with due regard to the objective of maintaining public debt at
manageable levels.
Staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is in line with fundamentals
is consistent with BA’s flexible exchange rate policy aimed at maintaining the REER
close to its equilibrium rate. The authorities intend to effectively address the issue of the
parallel exchange rate premium, including in the broader context of gradually reducing
the scope of the informal sector.
The banking sector remains well capitalized, liquid, profitable, and adequately
provisioned. While the nonperforming loans (NPLs) ratio appears high at 14.4 percent in
2011, although substantially declining over the past several years reflecting much lower
NPLs for public banks, the bulk of the NPLs is related to fully provisioned old debts. Net
of provisions, the NPL ratio in 2011 stood at 4.0 percent, as shown in table 6 of the staff
report. The authorities will give due consideration to staff suggestion to write off fully
provisioned NPLs in cases where the scope for recovery is very slim. A credit registry
will soon be established, which will help revisit the issue of the ban on consumer lending
(mortgages are not subject to the ban). Banking supervision continues to be strengthened,
including with Fund assistance, and financial stability reports are now prepared on a
regular basis. BA has established a new bank rating system, which will be generalized to
all banks, following successful pilot operations. The authorities express interest in an
FSAP update to help identify measures aimed at further strengthening the financial
system.
The authorities are well aware that promoting economic diversification and private sector
development is key to anchor sustainable high growth and promote job creation.
Macroeconomic stability and the large-scale infrastructure investment implemented over
the past several years should serve this objective well. Progress has also been made in
improving the business environment, including facilitating investors’ access to land,
establishment of one-stop shops, substantial reduction of the tax burden on business,

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALGERIA

improvement in tax administration and governance of public institutions, modernization
of the judiciary system, and introduction of specific measures to facilitate SMEs’
establishment and access to credit. However, the authorities are cognizant of the
remaining challenges and broadly agree with staff recommendations in this area. They
have initiated close and periodic dialogue with the private sector at the Prime Minister
level to discuss the needed measures to substantially improve the business environment
and take steps towards their implementation. They will review in due course the FDI
regulations and act as needed to further encourage effective partnership with foreign
investors. To foster employment, particularly among the youth, a number of key steps
have been taken over the past several years, including substantial facilitations granted
through the national agency for youth employment support (ANSEJ) for small businesses
and a program for subsidies for hiring university graduates in the private sector.
