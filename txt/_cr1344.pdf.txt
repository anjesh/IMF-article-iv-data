STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
REQUEST FOR DISBURSEMENT UNDER THE RAPID CREDIT
FACILITY, AND CANCELLATION OF THE EXTENDED CREDIT
FACILITY ARRANGEMENT
Context: Hit by a drought in 2011, terrorist attacks, and a military coup, Mali’s economy is
traversing a very difficult period. The economy is in recession. Donors suspended budgetary
support and reduced project support. The government responded with fiscal austerity,
including the cutting of almost all capital spending. In spite of these steps, it accumulated
arrears to external creditors in an amount of 0.5 percent of GDP. The economy should
rebound as gold and agricultural production increases and project support resumes but
political and security risks weigh on the recovery.
Request for disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility: The authorities request a
disbursement of SDR 12 million to help them cope with these shocks and re-engage
with donors during the transition towards a newly elected government. They commit to
a 12-month program of economic and financial policies and structural reforms in public
financial management that are crucial to maintain macroeconomic stability.
Article IV discussions: Harnessing the potential for increasing growth and reducing poverty
requires steadfast implementation of policies to increase fiscal space for priority spending
and deepen the financial system.
Exchange regime and restrictions: Mali, a member of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU), accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and
4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement as of June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The WAEMU’s exchange rate regime is a conventional peg to the euro.
Main policy recommendations:


Implementing a tight fiscal policy in 2013. Freeze spending in an amount of 1 percent
of GDP in 2013 until potential donor aid materializes, in order to avoid building up
arrears that would spread fiscal problems to the rest of the economy.



Focus public financial management reforms on tax administration and cash flow
management, in order to mobilize domestic revenue and prevent arrears.



In the medium term, foster inclusive growth by creating fiscal space for priority
spending, deepening the financial system, and improving the business environment.

BACKGROUND, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, AND
OUTLOOK
1.
Last March, Mali suffered a military coup and a period of violence and confusion
ensued. Triggered by defeats of the army against heavily armed Tuareg separatists returning from
Libya, the coup fed on frustration about an ineffective political process and pervasive corruption.
In the wake of the coup, a coalition of secular Tuareg separatists and Islamic fundamentalist terrorist
groups took control of Mali’s north.
2.
International pressure—led by the regional Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS)—resulted in a gradual return to constitutional order. In April, former
President Toure officially resigned, and the President of the National Assembly, Traore, took over,
with a mandate until the next presidential elections. A Prime Minister was appointed, a cabinet
formed, and the National Assembly reconvened. On August 20, the President reshuffled and
expanded the cabinet to turn it into a Transitional Government of National Unity with reintegrating
the north and holding democratic elections as priorities. On December 11, the army ousted the
Prime Minister and the President appointed a new Prime Minister. On December 15, the Prime
Minister changed the composition of the government to make it more inclusive. The Minister of
Economy, Finance, and the Budget, who has been in charge since April, was reappointed. The
Transitional Government of National Unity has asked the United Nations, the African Union and
ECOWAS for help to regain control of the north.
3.
In January 2013, the government requested and received the military intervention of
France to stop the rebel advance. In reaction to an advance by rebel groups beyond the front line
between the north and the south of the country, the authorities have received military support from
France to respond to the situation. Reports from Mali suggest that the military intervention has been
successful in stopping the rebel advance. The government has also requested military support from
other countries in the region, which is forthcoming. In this very challenging environment, the
authorities remain committed to the stability-oriented fiscal policy and public financial management
reforms described in their letter of intent (Annex V).
4.
As a consequence of the military coup and its aftermath, Mali’s economy is in
recession and, as a consequence of the poor harvest in 2011, inflation is rising (Figure 1 and
Tables 1 and 2). Real GDP is expected to contract by 1.5 percent in 2012. The March 2012 coup
d’état and its aftermath hurt the economy and added to the stress from the poor 2011 harvest. This
put close to 4 million people (or 27 percent of the population) in situation of food insecurity. The
donors’ decision to suspend all budget support and slow down much of their project support led to
a contraction of the construction and public works sector. The deteriorating security situation
prompted a sharp reduction of travel to Mali. This hit hard the commerce, hotel and restaurant
sectors. But strong performance in gold mining, cotton and a recovery in agriculture softened the
decline in overall GDP. Higher food prices have led to an increase in average annual inflation to
5.3 percent in December 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

5.
A balance of payments deficit is emerging in 2012 owing to the need to import food
to compensate for the poor harvest in 2011 and the reduction of donor support (Table 7). The
current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated at 7.3 percent of GDP. This deficit
reflects high food imports needed to alleviate the food crisis. Current official transfers and the
capital and financial account surplus, which have been affected by the reduction in donor support,
will only partly finance that deficit, necessitating a large drawdown of the foreign exchange reserves
($260 million) of the regional central bank (BCAEO).
6.
The government responded with fiscal austerity, including the cutting of almost all
capital spending but could not prevent the accumulation of arrears to external creditors in an
amount 0.5 percent of GDP (Tables 3–6; MEFP, ¶13, 24 and 31). The government managed its
budget prudently by offsetting the loss of revenue by expenditures cuts, especially public
investment and implicit subsidies on petroleum products and cooking gas. As a result, the basic
budget balance (revenue and budget grants minus domestically financed expenditure) was in
equilibrium at the end of September 2012. These efforts notwithstanding, the government could not
prevent the emergence of external debt service arrears towards mostly official bilateral and
multilateral creditors ($58 million by mid-November 2012).1 It has alerted all affected creditors of its
inability to serve its external debt in full in 2012, reiterated its commitment to clear these arrears as
soon as possible, and committed to service its external debt in full in 2013. In October, the
government adopted a revised 2012 budget recognizing the need for fiscal austerity. The revised
budget cuts overall spending by one quarter (6.3 percent of GDP, mostly capital spending)
compared to 2011 (MEFP, ¶20).
7.
During the first nine months of 2012, money growth was driven by the government’s
use of its deposits in the banking sector to finance the budget deficit (Table 8). At endSeptember 2012, money supply increased by 11 percent year-on-year, mainly because of the
drawdown of government’s bank deposits. The government has reached agreement with banks
so far on rolling over its maturing treasury bills and bonds (CFAF 138 billion, $276 million or
2.6 percent of GDP) in 2012 at the same financial conditions as the maturing instruments.
8.
The crisis is hurting the financial soundness of the banking sector (Table 10). Following
the take-over of the north, banks suffered losses estimated at CFAF 18 billion ($36 million or
0.3 percent of GDP) through the theft of banknotes, the looting of buildings, and an increase in nonperforming loans. In the south, the recession has not yet translated into a deterioration of the
financial soundness of the banking sector. At end-June 2012, the banking system remained well
capitalized (with a capital-to-risk-weighted-asset close to 15 percent) but burdened by a high share
of non-performing loans (NPLs, 20 percent of total loans before provisions, 7.5 percent of total loans

1

According to the latest information, the creditors towards which the government of Mali has accumulated external
arrears are official bilateral creditors (Belgium, France, India, Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia), multilateral official
creditors (Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, International Fund for Agricultural Development,
Investment and Development Bank of ECOWAS, Islamic Corporation for Private Sector Development, Islamic
Development Bank and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and one commercial bank (from the
Netherlands).

after provisions). However both the levels of capital and NPLs are expected to worsen at
year-end.
9.
The arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) approved in December 2011,
which was off to a good start, is off-track (MEFP, ¶¶15–16 and Tables 1–2).2 At end-December
2011, all but one performance criteria and all but one indicative targets were met. Since March 2012,
the impact of the crisis on fiscal performance has sent the program off-track. Gross tax revenue fell
short of the targets, pushing government bank and market financing over the ceiling. Arrears on
external debt service emerged.
10.
In 2013, the economy is projected to rebound (Text Table 1 and Tables 1-8). Real GDP
growth should get back to trend (4.8 percent growth) in 2013 on account of the increase in
agricultural and gold production (owing to the opening of a new mine in the south of the country),
the recovery of service activity helped by the establishment of a third mobile phone operator, and
the rise in project aid. Average inflation should decrease to 3 percent, assuming favorable rainfall.
External financing requirements will remain high: the current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) of the balance of payments should increase (to 8.8 percent of GDP), as the economy picks
up and the authorities reconstitute their emergency food stock (at a cost of CFAF 13 billion or
$26 million) depleted to cope with the bad harvest in 2011. This deficit should only be partially
financed by foreign direct investment and the resumption of project aid. Therefore Mali should
continue to use the foreign exchange reserves of BCEAO to the tune of about $160 million
(1.5 percent of GDP) to finance the overall balance of payments deficit in 2013. The fiscal position
should remain very tight but be helped by one-off revenue from the sale of the third mobile phone
license ($110 million or about 1.0 percent of GDP spread over 2012–13).

Because of the fluidity of the political and security situation, the authorities and staff
agree that this outlook is subject to more downside risks than usual. A weakening of the fragile
political consensus, social tensions flowing from the economic recession, or setbacks of the
transition government in its attempts to recoup the north of the country could weaken consumer,
investor and donor confidence and slow down growth (Table 11). A sharp reversal of the terms of
trade improvement observed since 2008 could cause fiscal slippages. In WAEMU, Mali would be one
of the least exposed countries to negative tail risks in the euro area because its exports (mostly gold)
are inelastic toward traditional trade partners’ growth. The main transmission channel would be
lower remittances. The banking sector is mostly financed by local deposits and should not be
affected by the ongoing deleveraging of European banks.
12.
In the medium term, the authorities and staff agreed that the continuation of prudent
fiscal policies would foster macroeconomic stability and growth. The authorities’ commitment
to keep the basic fiscal balance in equilibrium or surplus, as required under the WAEMU
convergence criteria, will avoid crowding out the private sector. Such prudent fiscal policy will also
allow the authorities to build up some buffer to use in times of crises as the drought that hit Mali in
2011. Their commitment to keep the overall fiscal balance in line with debt sustainability will also
nurture growth provided that borrowed resources are well spent.

SHORT-TERM CHALLENGE: MAINTAINING
MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY
DURING VERY DIFFICULT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
TIMES
13.
The authorities face a drastic budget constraint in a tense political and social situation.
Tax revenue is hit hard by the economic recession in 2012. Budget aid is uncertain until a clear road
map towards democratic elections emerges. The humanitarian crisis caused by the displacement of
about 400,000 people to the south of the country and neighboring countries puts upwards pressure
on social spending. A military intervention to regain control of the north of the country would
necessitate an increase in military spending.
14.
The 2013 budget sent to Parliament in early October is designed to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability (Text Table 2, Tables 3–6, and MEFP, ¶25). The fiscal policy
priority is to avoid accumulation of arrears and prevent contagion from the financing difficulties of
the state to its suppliers and the banking sector. The budget assumes no resumption of aid. It aims
for a very low deficit (less than 1 percent of GDP) by keeping spending almost in line with tax and
non-tax revenue. It aims for an ambitious increase of tax revenue (by 0.5 percent of GDP, compared
to the revised 2012 budget, to 15.5 percent of GDP) through a 25 percent increase in oil taxation
and the continued implementation of ambitious administrative reforms at the customs, tax, and real
estate administrations (¶17).

In their program backing their request for a disbursement under the Rapid Credit
Facility (RCF), the authorities commit to implement a more conservative fiscal program than
the 2013 budget. When reviewing the 2013 budget in November, the authorities and staff
identified a financing gap of 1 percent of GDP (MEFP, ¶26). Revenue projections, notably VAT
revenue, were overly optimistic, and some spending, notably external debt service and transfers to
the state electricity company, was understated. To address this financing gap, staff suggested
amending the budget by reducing spending by CFAF 55 billion. The authorities proposed instead,
and staff agreed, to leave the 2013 budget as is, but to identify capital expenditure in an equivalent
amount to be frozen until budget support resumes.3 The authorities were hopeful that budget
support to close the financing gap would be forthcoming following the disbursement under the
RCF. They wanted to have spending ready for execution when that would happen. The authorities
informed the Assembly about the credit lines that would be frozen before it passed the budget.

3

The joint budget review also revealed that project aid will be higher than shown in the 2013 budget (MEFP, ¶28).
These are projects already approved by Parliament and executed by donors.

Under the present exceptional circumstances that call for an increase in military
spending, the authorities will nonetheless protect social spending as much as possible, while
subjecting military expenditure to a public expenditure review (MEFP, ¶¶29-30). Defense
spending in the 2013 budget are 37 percent above 2011 levels, while almost all other spending
categories are seriously below 2011 levels (Text Table 3). Social spending, too, has been hit hard, but
the authorities still attach priority to spending on education, health, and social development in line
with their growth and poverty reduction strategy. This is attested by the above average cumulative
growth of this spending in the budgets 2012–13 and the floors that the authorities have committed
to respect as part of their program for 2012–13 (indicative target, MEFP, Table 3). They are keen to
ensure the quality of rising military spending and will subject this spending to a public expenditure
review, in collaboration with the World Bank.

17.
To increase tax revenue, the authorities will continue to implement far-reaching tax
policy and tax administration reforms started under their ECF arrangement (MEFP, ¶¶33–36).
Transparency is being used to build political support for a reduction of tax exemptions and energy
subsidies. The 2013 budget contains an inventory of all exemptions included in the tax, customs,
mining, and investment codes and other legislation, and the associated fiscal costs (structural
benchmark; MEFP, Table 2).4 It also contains an estimate of the budgetary costs of not adjusting
domestic energy prices to international prices (structural benchmark; MEFP, Table 2).5 As a result of
this fiscal cost, and given the tight financing constraints, the authorities have started to raise oil
prices6 and plan to increase electricity prices. They will design targeted cash transfers in close
collaboration with the World Bank in order to reduce the risk of social tensions in the urban areas
associated with oil or food price increases. They will also study the feasibility of introducing more
progressivity in the tax regime of mining companies to capture excess profits when prices are very
high.7 Finally, they will continue to implement ambitious reforms in tax and customs administration
including: the completion of reforms to strengthen the VAT administration; investigations by an
interdepartmental tax intelligence unit to identify under-reporting tax payers; and the overhaul of
the large-and medium-tax payers’ offices (structural benchmark; MEFP, Tables 2 and 4).8
18.
The authorities will continue ongoing reforms in the area of public financial
management (PFM) (MEFP, ¶¶ 37–42). The authorities will continue to implement their rolling
action plan updated in close collaboration with donors, with a view to enhancing budget
preparation, monitoring, execution, and audit, and improving cash management. Under their
program, the Treasury will continue to take the necessary steps to establish a single treasury account
at the BCEAO9 and strengthen its control of the bank accounts of the ministries and government
agencies in banks (structural benchmark; MEFP, Table 4).10 The authorities will also implement
WAEMU PFM directives into Malian law, including by stopping the validation of payment orders of
4

In 2011, tax exemptions amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP (out of which 2.4 percent of GDP on taxes collected by the
tax directorate and 2.2 percent of GDP on taxes collected by the customs directorate), or about one third of the tax
revenue, which amounted to 14.6 percent of GDP.
5

In view of the small pass-through of international oil prices in domestic oil prices during 2009–11, oil tax revenue
shrank from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 1 percent of GDP in 2011. In the absence of adjustment of electricity
prices, the authorities transferred about 0.6 percent of GDP to the state-electricity company to keep it afloat in 2012.

6

The authorities increased oil prices by 1.5 percent in May and June 2012.

7

The authorities will request technical assistance from the Fund’s Topical Trust Fund on Managing Natural Resource
Wealth to strengthen their capacity to collect revenue due by the gold companies (MEFP, ¶36).
8

The authorities will request technical assistance from the Fund’s Topical Trust Fund on Tax Policy and Tax
Administration to implement a multi-year results-based program of technical assistance in this area (MEFP, ¶36).
9

The Treasury transferred money deposited in its accounts in seven commercial banks to the BCEAO in December
2011. It reversed that operation after the military coup in March 2012 because it lost access to its account at the
BCEAO during a short time in end-March/early-April when ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Mali (MEFP, ¶39, first
bullet point).
10

At the end of September 2012, the monetary survey compiled by the BCEAO reported state deposits in banks in an
amount of CFAF 260 billion ($520 million or 5 percent of GDP), of which about CFAF 100 billion were well identified
by the Treasury.

any budget year by end-January of the following year. They will use the new budget accounting
software to track payments, with a view to avoiding the buildup of domestic arrears (structural
benchmark; MEFP, Table 4). Finally, they will also strengthen their oversight mechanism and
accelerate the production of government audited accounts.
19.
In the present circumstances, the authorities plan to meet their external financing
needs by grants and concessional loans (MEFP, ¶¶43–44). The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) concludes that the risk of debt distress remains moderate.11 Debt sustainability remains
sensitive to the price of gold (whose production will decline over the medium term), the cost of
borrowing, and the implementation of sustainable fiscal policies. In the present circumstances, the
authorities and staff agreed that it was cautious not to use the scope for borrowing of about
CFAF 51 billion ($100 million or 1 percent of GDP) on non-concessional terms agreed in the threeyear arrangement under the ECF approved in December 2011.12
20.
The government will not accumulate fresh external arrears (MEFP, ¶31). Regarding the
arrears outstanding at the end of 2012, the government commits to clear these as soon as its
financial situation permits. In the interim, it will not accumulate fresh external arrears in 2013
(indicative targets, MEFP, Table 3).

SHORT TERM CHALLENGE: RE-ENGAGING WITH
DONORS
21.
Donors maintained only humanitarian assistance following the coup, but several have
now begun to re-engage more actively. Several donors have provided humanitarian assistance via
non-governmental organizations or resumed project support. In early July, World Bank management
authorized the resumption of disbursement of already approved project loans and, on a case-bycase basis, the approval of new project loans. Most donors look to the Fund to play an active role in
assisting the transition government implement policies that promote macroeconomic stability and
growth. Since the foreign military intervention (¶3), key donors have indicated that they are
continuing their re-engagement in Mali.
22.
Given its short time horizon and narrow mandate, the government has decided to
cancel the three-year ECF arrangement and request a disbursement under the RCF. (LOI, ¶3).
The requested access under the RCF is SDR 12 million (13 percent of quota), well below Mali’s
balance of payment deficit caused by the food crisis (about $130 million during 2012–13, ¶¶5 and
10), with a view to encouraging donor’s financial support. It would bring Mali’s outstanding loans to
80 percent of quota, well below the cumulative access limit of the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Trust (Table 12). In its request for an RCF disbursement, the government commits to implement

MALI

stability-oriented fiscal policies during the next twelve months, including the fiscal program and
PFM reforms agreed with staff for 2013 (¶¶15-20). This program sets quarterly indicative targets
starting in December 2012 (MEFP, Table 3) and structural benchmarks in the areas of tax and
customs administration and public financial management critical to the maintenance of
macroeconomic and financial stability (MEFP, Table 4). Together with a clear road map towards
democratic elections, the disbursement under the RCF and the program will help catalyze donor
support.
23.
Mali’s capacity to repay the Fund is adequate but the military intervention poses risks
to program implementation. Debt service to the Fund will absorb a minimal fraction of
government revenue and exports (Table 12) and Mali’s risk of debt distress is moderate (¶19). The
military intervention is not without risks for program implementation. On the one hand, the
intensification of military operations may delay the economic recovery. On the other hand, the
deployment of foreign military forces should reduce the threat of disruption from rebel advance
towards the south.
24.
The authorities envisage a repeated use of the RCF in around six months, conditional
on the presence of an urgent balance of payments need and a satisfactory performance
relative to their policy commitments accompanying the first disbursement under the RCF (LOI,
¶6). Such a strategy would provide a clear road map for a return to an ECF arrangement when a new
democratically elected government with a broader mandate and a longer time horizon comes to
power and relations with donors are fully normalized. In the meantime, this engagement with the
Fund would provide the authorities with the opportunity to send a clear signal to donors about their
performance in implementing stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and thereby contribute to
donors’ gradual re-engagement in Mali.

MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGE: BUILDING THE
FOUNDATION FOR STABLE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
25.
Discussions focused on the policies required to build the foundation for stable and
inclusive growth, and were grouped in four main themes: (i) make growth more inclusive; (ii) create
fiscal space for priority spending; (iii) deepen the financial sector; and (iv) improve the business
environment to facilitate the diversification of the economy. There was broad agreement between
the authorities and staff on the issues facing Mali and the policies to address them.

A.

Making Growth More Inclusive

26.
Economic growth was inclusive during the past decade in Mali (Annex I). After a decade
of relatively low growth, real GDP per capita growth picked up and averaged 3.2 percent during
2001–10. Mali’s share of poor households has decreased substantially from 56 percent in 2001 to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALI

44 percent in 2010 taking into account the national poverty line.13 Mali’s poverty reduction was also
significantly stronger than in Sub-Saharan Africa during 2001–10. Growth in economic activity was
also largely inclusive, meaning that it was associated with a larger increase in consumption for the
poorest.
27.
However poverty reduction decelerated after 2006 as growth became more uneven
among sectors. During 2001–06, the economy grew at a similar pace in all sectors, while
manufacturing contracted and agricultural production boomed during 2006–10. Since the very
poor are mostly farmers, their consumption basket expanded during this part of the decade. But
as most farmers produce on a subsistence level, these gains in agricultural production could not be
translated into an overall increase in production and employment elsewhere. Hence, the impressive
growth in agriculture during 2006–10 allowed the very poor to improve their lives relative to the rest
of the population, but the balanced growth during 2001–06 helped more households to
escape poverty.
28.
The authorities and staff agreed that there remains a large room for further reducing
poverty in Mali. First, a vast area of agricultural land remains to be cultivated thanks to the
potential for irrigation provided by the Niger River. Second, there is a huge scope for modernizing
agricultural techniques and move agriculture beyond subsistence levels. Third, further investments in
road and power infrastructure would open new markets for agriculture inside and outside Mali.
Fourth, continued investment in education and health is needed to equip the young and fast
growing population with the required skills to help the economy grow. Finally, stepped-up effort is
needed to improve the business environment and foster domestic and foreign direct investment to
diversify the economy (¶¶34–35).

B.

Creating Fiscal Space for Priority Spending

29.
There is significant room to increase fiscal space for priority spending in Mali. First,
there is scope to increase the tax pressure, which has remained below 15 percent of GDP since
the mid-2000, less than the WAEMU convergence target of 17 percent, the ECOWAS objective of
20 percent of GDP, and the tax performance in Senegal (19 percent of GDP in 2011). Second,
adjusting more fully domestic petroleum products to international oil prices would put an end to
the erosion of oil tax revenue, which decreased by 1.3 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2011 as
a result of the policy to absorb part of the increase in international oil prices by cuts in petroleum
taxation (Annex II). Third, the increase of electricity prices would also free up fiscal resources as the
current sale of electricity at a price below cost14 necessitates budgetary transfers to the state
electricity company of at least 0.5 of GDP annually. Fourth, there is scope to reduce spending by
taking measures to eliminate the deficits of the civil servants’ and private sector employees’ pension
funds, which could reach 2 percent of GDP in 2015 in the absence of reforms, according to recent
13

The national poverty line lies at CFAF 453 (about $1) per day of household consumption.

14

In 2012, the average sales price of electricity was 24 percent below the production cost (MEFP, ¶21, footnote 5).

14

actuarial studies. The loss-making state housing and development banks also pose contingent
liabilities that could be eliminated by selling or liquidating those banks. Finally, there are resources
to be gained by centralizing the cash flow management of ministries and government agencies,
which currently hold about 3,400 separate bank accounts, in a single treasury account at the central
bank (¶18).
30.
In the present circumstances, the authorities and staff agreed that the focus of
government’s action should be to improve tax administration and cash management, while
the authorities were also considering eliminating energy subsidies. While the authorities noted
that the relatively low tax pressure in Mali may reflect the larger share of the informal economy that
is not subject to taxation, they agreed that there was scope to increase the tax pressure by
implementing all the reforms committed under their program backing their request for a
disbursement under the RCF (¶17). They insisted in particular on the need for a more cautious
allocation of tax exemptions and stricter control of their use for their intended purposes.
The authorities emphasized that they had started to increase the price of petroleum products with
a view to eliminating energy subsidies and planned to do the same with electricity prices. While staff
welcomed such a policy move, which had been long overdue, it recommended to design
compensatory measures to alleviate the consequences on the poorest and to engage into a
comprehensive public communication campaign beforehand to explain the motivation of the policy
move and its benefits for the population, in light of experiences in other low income countries that
have reduced energy subsidies (Annex II). The authorities agreed with the benefits of moving most
of government accounts to a single treasury account at the BCEAO after the transition to an elected
government. In the mean time, in light of the freezing of the government accounts at the BCEAO in
the wake of the sanctions imposed by ECOWAS after the coup (¶18), they prefer to keep accounts
in commercial banks. The Treasury will sort out the identity of all government accounts registered in
the monetary survey shortly.

C.

Deepening the Financial Sector

31.
Financial intermediation has been increasing, but remains low (Annex III). The financial
sector is dominated by banks. As of end-2012, there were 13 banks, of which eleven were foreign
owed, holding over 80 percent of the sector’s assets. The banking sector is relatively concentrated,
with five banks accounting for two-thirds of assets and over 70 percent of deposits. Microfinance
institutions (MFIs) are growing (1.2 million members in 2011, compared with 0.8 million in 2005), but
are not systemically important (as their credit amounted to 1.6 percent of GDP at the end of 2011).
The ratio of bank credit-to-GDP increased from 15 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2011. Interest
rates do not appear to have adversely affected bank intermediation, as banks’ spreads (4.5 percent
on average at end 2011) seem to reflect cost of doing business. Nonetheless, intermediation
remains low, compared with some other sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Togo, Kenya). Only about
10 percent of the population has banks accounts, and rural populations remain particularly
underserved by commercial banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MALI

32.
The main vulnerabilities of the financial sector are the concentration of bank loans on
a few large borrowers and the large share of NPLs. Banks have been well-capitalized since the
doubling of the minimum capital requirement to CFAF 5 billion ($10 million) at the end of 2010
(Table 10), and appear profitable, but are being hurt by the deterioration of the economic situation
since March, which will show up in a deterioration of their financial soundness indicators at end2012 (¶8). Stress tests indicate that the banks are most exposed to a deterioration of the quality of
credits of their largest borrowers (including the state owned cotton and electricity company), which
is symptomatic of the concentration of risks in the banking sector. With an average gross NPLs ratio
of 20 percent at end-June 2012, the quality of bank portfolio varies with NPLs ratios diverging from
low to more than half the portfolio in the case of the housing bank (BHM). The provisioning rate, at
67 percent, remains insufficient and below the WAEMU average. The stagnation of the NPLs at high
levels is a reflection of the unfavorable business environment, and in particular the many difficulties
encountered in recovery procedures. Weak governance in about one third of the MFIs representing
about 40 percent of deposits is getting increasing attention, with the recent involvement of the
BCEAO in their supervision as a consequence of the implementation of a new WAEMU-wide
microfinance law.
33.
The authorities and staff agreed on the priority measures to strengthen the stability
and enhance the development of the financial sector. To strengthen the stability of the financial
sector, it is important to: complete the sale of the loss-making state housing bank BHM and
development bank BRS; devise a strategy for another six banks, whose liquidity will fall below the
minimum norm once the government closes its accounts and transfers its deposits to a single
treasury account at the central bank; reform the courts to speed up the activation of guarantees
backing NPLs; and strengthen the MFIs by closing the weakest ones and improving the
management, monitoring and supervision of the others. To enhance the development of the
financial sector, it is imperative to: review the land code, and improve the land tenure and land
registration regime, with a view to establishing land titles that could be used for obtaining bank
loans; enact legislation to promote leasing, venture capital, and investment capital; and improve the
scope of the credit information at the BCEAO to cover a greater range of information and potential
borrowers, particularly the largest small and medium-sized enterprises.

D. Strengthening the Business Environment to Facilitate the
Diversification of the Economy
34.
Staff external stability assessment concludes that Mali’s business environment needs
to be improved in order to enhance competitiveness (Annex IV). During the past decade, Mali’s
balance of payments was characterized by a relatively stable current account deficit (excluding
official grants) of about 10 percent of GDP, financed by a steady flow of aid and foreign direct
investment, mostly in the gold and telecom sectors. Export performance was stable, but overly
reliant on gold, and export diversification decreased. The exchange rate assessment suggests that
the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The burden of enhancing
competitiveness rests on removing structural and institutional bottlenecks. Mali needs to better
diversify its exports across products and markets by improving the business environment: expand

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

electricity coverage, enhance access to finance, strengthen investor protection, make it easier for
businesses to pay taxes, and improve health and education standards.
35.
The authorities agreed and emphasized that improving the quality of human resources
is key to diversify the economy and reduce aid dependence. The authorities underlined that
there is a large potential to develop agricultural exports. The key to develop this potential is
improving the quality of human resources through further investment in health and education.
Better human resources will be critical to address many of the weaknesses in the business
environment and design home-grown policies.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Hit by a drought in 2011, terrorist attacks, and a military coup, Mali’s economy is
traversing a very difficult period. As a consequence of the poor harvest in 2011, inflation is
rising and about 3.6 million people have faced food insecurity. As a consequence of the terrorist
attacks, the military coup and its aftermath, Mali’s economy is in recession. A large balance of
payments deficit is emerging in 2012–13 owing to the need to import food to compensate for the
bad harvest in 2011 and the reduction of donor support. The crisis is hurting the financial soundness
of the banking sector. These shocks sent the arrangement under the ECF off-track. The government
responded with fiscal austerity, including the cutting of almost all capital spending. The tight
liquidity situation has led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors in an amount
0.5 percent of GDP.
37.
The economic outlook is subject to high risks. The economy should rebound as
agriculture should be strong under normal weather conditions, a new gold mine comes into
operation, a third mobile phone operator invests in the country, and donors resume aid. But a
weakening of the fragile political consensus in the south of the country, social tensions in a fluid
political and security environment, or setbacks of the transition government in its attempts to
organize elections and recoup the north of the country could weaken consumer, investor and donor
confidence and slow down growth.
38.
Tight fiscal policy is essential to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. While
the 2013 budget is a step in the right direction, the implementation of a more conservative fiscal
program is needed. Spending in an amount of 1 percent of GDP will need to be frozen until
potential donor aid materializes.
39.
The accumulation of external arrears is unfortunate and the accumulation of new
arrears needs to be avoided. The accumulation of arrears on the external debt is regrettable, as it
put into jeopardy one of the most important balance of payment flows on which Mali’s external
stability relies. While the full payment of accumulated arrears will be difficult in the short run, the
authorities need to do their best efforts to clear these arrears as soon as possible and avoid any
accumulation of new arrears, which would complicate even more the resumption of aid that is
needed to rebound from the crisis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MALI

40.
Steadfast implementation of tax policy, tax administration, cash flow management,
and energy policy reforms will be essential to maintain macroeconomic stability. The ambitious
tax revenue targets in 2013 will need to come from a continued increase in taxes on oil products
and progress in tax administration through systematic cross-checking of information by the tax,
customs, and procurement administrations. Prudent expenditure execution and tight cash
management will be needed to meet the deficit target and avoid the accumulation of arrears to
suppliers and creditors. While electricity tariff adjustments are needed to bring the sector back to a
sustainable path, a clear reform and public communication strategy is essential to gain the
population’s acceptance.
41.
In the medium term, harnessing the potential for increasing growth and reducing
poverty requires steadfast implementation of policies to increase fiscal space and deepen the
financial sector. The full development of the vast agricultural land that can be irrigated would make
growth more inclusive. This requires more investment in priority spending like road, power,
irrigation infrastructure, modernized agricultural production techniques, education and health. To
create fiscal space for such spending, tax revenue needs to be increased (through the reduction of
tax exonerations, the elimination of energy subsidies, and the overhaul of the tax and customs
administrations), non-priority spending needs to be reduced (through the elimination of transfers to
the loss making state-owned energy company, housing and development banks, and pension
funds), and cash flow management needs to be tightened (by implementing the single treasury
account). To foster private sector investment, access to financing needs to be expanded by speeding
up the resolution of banks’ non-performing loans, reforming the land code, with a view to creating
securities for bank credit, and strengthening the microfinance sector.
42.
Based on the severity of the external shocks that hit Mali’s economy and the
authorities’ policy intentions, the staff recommends approval of the authorities’ request for a
disbursement under the RCF.

Table 11. Mali: Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) 1
Likelihood

Shock

Potential Impact

Medium

Weakening of the political consensus
in the south

Could lead to social tensions and further
undermine investment confidence, growth, tax
revenue, and slow down the resumption of aid.

Medium

Setbacks of the transition
government in its attempts to
recoup the north of the country

Would lead to social tensions and further
undermine investment confidence, growth, and
tax revenue.

Medium

Faster resumption of international
aid

Would boost growth and tax revenue.

Medium

Protracted period of slow European
growth

In WAEMU, Mali would be one of the least
exposed countries to negative tail risks in the
euro area because its exports (mostly gold) are
inelastic toward traditional trade partners’
growth.
The main transmission channel would be lower
remittances.
The financial sector is mostly financed by local
deposits and should not be affected by the
ongoing deleveraging of European banks.

Low

Sharp reversal of the terms of trade
improvement observed since 2008

Fall in gold prices would reduce tax and non tax
revenue (royalties) paid by the gold companies
that together account for 20 percent of the
government’s revenue.
Increase in international oil prices in the absence
of full pass through in retail oil prices and
electricity prices would reduce tax revenue and
increase transfers to the state electricity
company.

1

The RAM shows probability events that could materially alter the baseline path, which is the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of the staff. Staff’s subjective assessment of the relative likelihood among those low
probability events is noted in the matrix (ranging from “low” to “high”).

ANNEX I—INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN MALI1
This note studies Mali’s performance in poverty reduction by analyzing household data from surveys in
2001, 2006 and 2009–10. Mali’s share of poor households has decreased substantially during the past
decade. While the reduction in headcount poverty was more pronounced from 2001–06 when all
sectors of Mali’s economy grew at a similar pace, economic growth was mainly beneficial to the very
poor during 2006–10 when agricultural production boomed.

A.

Economic Growth Was Inclusive During the Past Decade

1.
Fairly high growth led to substantial poverty reduction. After a decade of relatively low
per capita growth, real GDP per capita picked up and averaged 3.2 percent during 2001–10.
Although real GDP growth has been volatile, Mali’s share of poor households has decreased
substantially from 55.6 percent in 2001 to 43.6 in 2010 taking into account the national poverty line2.
Also in comparison with other countries, Mali’s poverty reduction was remarkable. While per capita
growth was comparable in Mali and Sub-Saharan Africa during 2001–10, poverty reduction was
significantly stronger in the former. This is also shown by higher elasticity of poverty reduction
relative to GDP growth in Mali than in comparable countries (Figure 1).
2.
Growth in economic activity has been largely inclusive, meaning that it has not been
associated with an increase in inequality (Rauniyar and Kanbur (2010)) or with a reduction in the
share of the bottom quintile of the income distribution (IMF 2010). During 2001–10, the growth
incidence curve – depicting the changes in household consumption according to consumption
percentiles – features a clear downward slope implying an increase in consumption of poorer
households relative to richer households. Real consumption for households below the poverty line
increased by 25 percent (‘pro-poor growth’), while average consumption grew by 7.5 percent.
3.
Poverty in Mali is mainly rural and concentrated amongst farmers. The results from a
regression analysis pooling data of three household surveys (2001, 2006 and 2010) suggest that
being a farmer implies a lower consumption by 33 percent (Table 1); in 2010 this effect was less
pronounced, at 24 percent, reflecting an overall improvement of farmers’ consumption relative to
the rest. Subsequently, urban poverty has increased in the second part of the decade mainly due to
migration to Bamako (Figure 2). Further, a higher number of household members and an older age
of the household head affect consumption negatively while civil servants are clearly better off than
others. The results of Table 1 are broadly similar to regression analyses performed on comparable
Sub-Saharan countries (IMF 2011). However, the rural-urban divide seems more pronounced in Mali
and household size and age have a positive influence in other countries studied in IMF 2011 as
opposed to a negative effect in Mali. The latter might be partially explained by Mali’s higher
population growth and children per household than in comparator countries.

B. Agricultural Growth Helped the Very Poor While Balanced Growth in
All Sectors Reduced Overall Poverty
4.
Poverty reduction was higher in the first part of the decade (2001–06) than during the
second part (2006–10). While the magnitude of real GDP growth was broadly comparable
throughout the decade, the number of households below the poverty line decreased more strongly
during the first part. This is also reflected in a higher elasticity of poverty reduction to economic
growth (Table 2). Moreover, in the first part of the decade Mali made more substantial progress
towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals than in the second part of the decade.
5.
Consumption of the poorest rose and inequality decreased more strongly during
2006–10. As depicted in the growth incidence curves in Figure 2, the slope of the 2006–10 curve
features a pronounced downward slope with steepening tails. Hence, the poorest quintile of the
population benefitted most while the richest quintile lost relative to the rest of the population. The
growth incidence curve of 2001–06 still implies higher consumption growth for the bottom half of
households, but it is flatter and the poorest households are not better off than the average.
6.
During 2001–06, the economy grew at equal pace in all three sectors while
manufacturing contracted and agricultural production boomed during 2006–10. Particularly
good weather conditions helped agricultural output in 2006–10 to increase by 8 percent on average
per year. Since the very poor are mostly farmers, their consumption basket expanded during this
part of the decade. But as most farmers produce on a subsistence level, these gains in agricultural
production could not be translated into an overall increase in production and employment
elsewhere. Hence, the impressive growth in agriculture during 2006-10 allowed the very poor to
improve their lives relative to the rest of the population, but the balanced growth during 2001–06
helped more households to escape poverty.

Policy Implications

7.
Improving agricultural production is key to helping the poorest of the poor. Given the
current opportunities – high commodity prices, urbanization with increasing demand for food and
away from subsistence, climate change and Mali’s potential of irrigated land —investments in
agriculture can diminish the poverty gap and promote poverty reduction. Possible measures include
(IMF et al. 2011):





building and maintaining irrigation infrastructure (less than 15 percent of potentially
irrigated land is actually irrigated);
modernizing family farming and subsistence agriculture to agri-businesses and food
processing;
making public sector support to agriculture more efficient; and
improving access to finance.

8.
Balanced and diversified growth, however, is key to sustained inclusive growth and
overall poverty reduction. To achieve sustained growth, Mali’s infrastructure bottlenecks need to
be removed and urban employment and labor mobility enhanced. As productivity in urban areas is
usually higher than in rural areas, some studies suggest building geographical clusters and focusing
on a few urban centers with pilot policies (Otsuka et al. 2011). Further, an important challenge
remains the two-dimensional diversification of exports: the export base – from mainly gold and
cotton to mangos, cereals and cattle – as well as export directions expanding from local to urban
and regional markets.

ANNEX II—REFORMING THE MECHANISM OF
DOMESTIC PETROLEUM PRICE SETTING1
Fuel tax revenues in Mali have been shrinking since 2009 following the government’s policy of not
adjusting retail prices to changes in international oil prices. This note discusses the available options to
align domestic fuel price changes with international oil price variations, while striking a balance
between preserving fiscal revenues and avoiding large changes in domestic fuel prices. It also provides
a roadmap of supporting measures and effective public campaigns, with examples implemented in
middle and low-income countries, to build public consensus for adjusting domestic oil prices.

A.

Background

1.
Mali’s current domestic oil pricing policy weighs negatively on the budget while
benefiting mainly the well-off (Figure 1). Taxes on oil have been used in Mali as a buffer to limit
the extent of international fuel price pass-through, even more so than in other WAEMU countries. As
international import prices increased rapidly in 2008, and subsequently in early 2010, domestic retail
prices were held fixed for extended periods through a reduction of fuel taxes2. As a result, the net
fiscal contribution of fuel taxes has decreased from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2006 to a low of 1 percent
of GDP in 2011, depriving the budget of sizeable resources that could have been used for growth
enhancing or poverty reducing policies. Fuel tax revenue is set to increase again in 2012 because the
authorities have raised prices by 5.6% since March. In addition, the current domestic oil pricing
policy does not benefit the poor, since oil products carry a very small weight in the consumption
basket of low-income groups; 43.5 percent of these lost fiscal revenues accrue to the top quintile,
nearly four times the amount accruing to the lowest quintile. The bottom two quintile’s share of the
tax expenditure was 22.7 percent, or about FCFA 11 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) of the implicit
subsidy over the past 2 years.

B.

Options for Price Adjustment

2.
The price band and moving averages are two available automatic mechanisms for
smoothing the variability of international oil prices. The price band mechanism (PB) sets the
maximum limit on the magnitude of retail price changes as a proportion of the current retail price or
in absolute amounts. For example, at the start of each month, the retail price according to the full
pass-through mechanism is determined based on last month’s average import cost. If the required
retail price hike is above the maximum allowed increase (i.e., the cap), then the maximum allowed

As the rates of fuel taxes are set at the WAEMU level, the Malian authorities reduce fuel prices by lowering the fuel
excise tax at customs and at times by decreasing the tax base for petroleum products.

increase is implemented. If the implied price increase is below this threshold, then the full
adjustment is allowed. On the other hand, the moving average mechanism (MA) bases retail price
adjustments on changes in the average of past import prices. For example, at the start of the month,
the retail price under the formula is calculated using an average of past import prices (say, the
average of import prices for the last three months). Retail prices are then allowed to fully adjust to
the smoothed import price.
3.
A large number of countries have found it useful to use such mechanisms to adjust
domestic oil prices. Given that the full pass-through involved in a liberalized regime of pricing can
lead to wide fluctuations in domestic oil prices, many countries have favored the use of automatic
oil price mechanisms3. Such mechanisms, when understood and accepted by the population, offer
the advantage of removing a politically charged decision from the government’s agenda. 1
4.
Alternative specifications of the two automatic pricing mechanisms in Mali over the
past 5 years would have resulted in lower volatility of taxes compared to the current pricing
policy and in lower retail fuel price variability compared to full-pass through. Six smoothing
mechanisms are considered: (i) 2-month, 4-month, and 6-month moving averages; and (ii) 3 percent,
5 percent, and 10 percent price bands. These mechanisms are compared to historical (actual) retail
prices and to a full pass-through of international oil prices into retail fuel prices.4 By definition,
all2smoothing mechanisms considered would have reduced the volatility of oil prices compared to
full pass through (Figure 2 and Table 1). They also would have reduced the volatility of tax revenue
compared to the historical retail prices (Figure 3 and Table 1).

Recent examples include Jordan in 2008, Gabon in 2009 and Niger in 2011.

The simulations assume constant margins equal to the average level between January 2006 and December 2009
(i.e., FCFA 78 per liter). Initial net taxes are also set at a level consistent with the average level between January 2006
and December 2009 (i.e., FCFA 151 per liter).

Key Steps to Put in Place a Pricing Mechanism
5.
To begin the transition to an automatic adjustment mechanism, the following steps could be
taken:



42

Decide on the desired level of fuel taxes and the distributors’ components of the price formula.
The tax level on fuels could reflect medium-term fiscal objectives or environmental
considerations which would underscore more generally the total revenue requirements of
the government and the importance of indirect taxes in total revenues. The higher the
revenue requirements from indirect taxes, the higher should be the tax rate on all goods and
services, including fuels. On the other hand, import and distribution costs as well as margins
should be based on efficient operations by suppliers and set in coordination with these
stakeholders.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

C.



Following a decision on the price components’ levels, specify a price structure (i.e., formula) by
product. This structure establishes a clear link between retail prices and international prices
based on import costs, distribution margins, and tax levels. As discussed in the previous
section, this decision is based on the desired trade-off between price volatility and fuel
revenues volatility.



Decide on the timeline for adopting the mechanism and for phasing in the price adjustment. If
the existing tax level is below the desired level over the medium term, then current prices
need to be adjusted to achieve the desired level before adopting the mechanism. A gradual
adjustment of domestic prices to international price levels, backed by an explicit timeline, is
usually warranted if the fiscal needs are not urgent and if the differential between domestic
and international oil price levels is very high.5 1



Specify a timeline for updating the components of the price structure. The different
components of the price structure should be updated according to an explicit and agreed
timeline and requires specification of the frequency with which the price structure is
reassessed. For example, the import cost could be updated on a monthly basis. Distribution
costs could be updated semi-annually based on a simple rule linked to validated changes in
costs such as wages, transport costs, and financing costs. More rigorous updates could be
done on a 3–5 year cycle based on a detailed market study. Of course, less frequent
adjustments would imply larger price fluctuations.

Impact on Inflation

6.
The potential inflationary impact of implementing a partial pass-through mechanism
is estimated to be small as long as the authorities act to prevent secondary round effects. The
first round effect is likely to have a small impact on inflation given the small weight of oil products in
household budgets, about 3 percent (Table 2), and the fact that the indirect impact of a rise in oil
prices is estimated to be double the share of oil products (Kpodar and Djiofack, 2009).6 Since the
total direct and indirect share of oil in household budgets is 9 percent and given that domestic oil
prices are 11 percent lower than what would have prevailed under a full pass-through (Figure 2),
inflation would increase by about 1 percentage point if domestic oil prices were increased to pass
through the increase of international prices in full since 2009. The authorities should however closely
monitor potentially larger secondary round effects by refraining from a generalized wage increase in
the public sector that would exacerbate the wage-price spiral. At the same time, the authorities
should cushion the impact of this price increase on the most vulnerable groups of the population
(see Sections V and VI).

Addressing Social Tensions

7.
Although fuel subsidies are an inefficient and a fiscally expensive approach to
protecting the poor from rising international fuel prices, eliminating them often causes social
tensions. Arze del Granado et al. (2010) find that, in the case of Mali, a FCFA 100 per liter increase in
domestic fuel prices would decrease household real incomes by 2.3 percent, on average. Therefore,
it is important that reform strategies include measures to mitigate this adverse impact on the poor
households.
8.
Countries have implemented a range of mitigating measures when adjusting oil prices.
Compensating the poor for adjusting domestic fuel prices requires a system to deliver
compensation to the needy. Because it may not be feasible to quickly put in place efficient safety
nets based on targeted cash transfers, a gradual reform strategy may initially be sought. This could
include the following steps (see Box 1 for country specific examples):


Temporarily maintaining the implicit subsidies on commodities that are more important in the
budgets of the poor. For example, the Nigerian authorities left kerosene prices unchanged when
they recently raised oil prices. Coady et al. (2004) show that kerosene subsidies are relatively
better targeted although in Africa, more than 45 percent of kerosene subsidies accrue to the top
two income quintiles (Coady et al. (2010)).61 As shown in Table 2, because the share of kerosene
in Malian household budgets is spread equally across quintiles, this policy would still be
relatively inefficient at targeting exclusively the lowest quintiles. In addition, there is a limit to
how much can be achieved through lower kerosene prices without severe disruption of
petroleum product markets (for example, redirection of kerosene from the household sector to
the transport sector for mixing with diesel, or cross-border trade).



Introducing a package of short-term measures to mitigate the adverse impact of price
increases on the poor while preventing social tensions. For instance:
o

Increase the budget of government programs that benefit mainly the poor, the
elderly and the children. These programs manifest themselves through national
funds (health care programs in poorest areas, etc.) or social sector programs (social
housing, micro-credit programs, etc.). Examples of countries that have used these
schemes include Ghana, Jordan and Nigeria.

o

Provide a one-time bonus to low-income government employees and pensioners, as
was done for instance in Jordan.

6

For example, Gabon excluded kerosene products from the automatic price adjustment mechanism that it adopted in January
2009.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

44

MALI



o

Subsidize consumption of alternative energies such as water and electricity below a
specified threshold. This policy was also pursued in Jordan.

o

Subsidize mass urban transport and increase the provision of mass urban transport.
Temporary support for public transport either via subsidizing fares or increasing the
size of mass urban transport might provide a cushion for urban low income
consumers and ease social tensions, as it was done in Ghana and Niger

o

Lower prices of school meals, education and health user fees. This policy was
implemented in the education sector in Ghana.

Increasing high-priority public expenditures that benefit the poor. These include education
and health expenditures as well as infrastructure expenditures such as irrigation, drinking
water supplies and rural electrification schemes, which provide alternative energy
consumption means and are energy-saving investments. These policies were implemented in
Ghana, Indonesia, Niger, and Nigeria.

9.
Over time, the government should improve the design of safety net programs that
could be intensified in times of surges in fuel prices. The authorities should aim to improve
targeting methods which include: (1) targeting by using socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics, such as the elderly, children, or the unemployed (categorical targeting), or those
living in specific areas (geographic targeting); and (2) linking subsidies or cash benefits to a selftargeting work or schooling requirement.

Box 1. Country Reform Experiences
Niger’s explicit subsidy was projected to reach 1.3 percent of GDP in 2010. The government was
committed to eliminate these subsidies and implement an automatic price adjustment
mechanism by mid-2011. To mitigate the adverse effect of price increases on the poor, the
authorities have used the budgetary resources freed by the elimination of these subsidies to
increase funding to the health, education, and rural development sectors. It has also provided
direct transfers to public transportations in the capital, which amounted to less than 0.1 percent
of GDP, to cushion the impact of the rise in oil prices on fares. In addition, public information
campaigns pointed out to the drawbacks of the ad hoc pricing policy and linked the savings
from petroleum price increases to priority social spending, which helped overcoming vested
interests and gaining support from civil society. As part of raising awareness over the cost of the
subsidy, the government initiated the systematic reporting in the budget of the oil tax subsidies.
Ghana’s oil subsidy amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2004. As international prices began to
increase, an automatic price mechanism was used beginning in February 2005 along with a
50 percent average increase in domestic fuel prices. This was accompanied by a communication
campaign explaining the need for price reforms, which emphasized the fact that the richest
households gain most from fuel subsidies (Laan, Beaton, and Presta, 2010). In addition, several
mitigating measures were implemented including: (i) eliminating fees for attending primary and
junior-secondary school, (ii) increasing funds for primary health care programs concentrated in
the poorest areas through the existing Community Health Compound Scheme, (iii) increasing
investment in the provision of mass urban transport, and (iv) increasing funds allocated to
expand a rural electrification scheme. These expenditures were partly financed by an explicit
earmarked social mitigation tax incorporated into the pricing formula. Responsibility for
implementing the pricing mechanism was given to a new National Petroleum Authority (NPA)
in an attempt to separate the pricing decisions from the government.
Indonesia’s fuel subsidy bill amounted to 3 percent in 2004. In 2005, the government
announced price increases and embarked before that in a public information campaign that
included newspapers, TV talk shows, village notice boards, and the distribution of pamphlets
and brochures (Bacon and Kojima, 2006). In May 2008, the government announced another
round of price increases. Some of the budgetary savings from reducing subsidies were
reallocated to existing education, health and infrastructure programs that benefit low-income
and middle-income households. The central government also introduced a temporary targeted
nation-wide cash transfer program covering more than 19 million poor families who received a
transfer of approximately US$120 per household per year. These measures were seen as key to
minimizing social unrest and political opposition (Beaton and Lontoh, 2010).
Jordan’s fuel price subsidies amounted to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2004 and were gradually
eliminated in 2005. The government used some of the budgetary savings to finance increases
in spending on social safety nets and implemented a series of measures to mitigate the impact
of price increases which included: (i) cash transfers to low-income households whose head is
a non-government worker or pensioner, (ii) a one-time bonus to low-income government
employees and pensioners, (iii) an increase in monthly wages of government employees,
and (iv) an increase in the budget of the National Aid Fund to finance expanded coverage
of transfers to low-income households. In addition, the government maintained an electricity
lifeline tariff to households who consumed less than 160 kilowatt per month and exempted
13 essential commodities, energy saving products, and agricultural production inputs from
custom duties (IMF, 2010).
46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

Box 1. Country Reform Experiences (continued)
Nigeria’s fuel subsidy costs reached 4.1 percent of GDP in 2011. On January 1, 2012, the
government more than doubled the price of gasoline, while retaining the subsidy for kerosene.
Some of the ensuing savings were expected to be used for targeted social safety net programs and
key infrastructure projects. The authorities mounted a significant public information campaign.
However, the fuel price increase set off widespread criticism and protests across the country, led
mainly by labor unions, which was driven mostly by a fundamental lack of public trust in the
government and by the sharp price hike. As a result, the authorities lowered by half the original
price increase, adopting de facto a more gradual approach, and begun to address issues raised by
the stakeholders such as launching an investigation into possible irregular practices in the
petroleum importing sector. In addition, to address government’s credibility gap, the authorities
appointed a board made up of government officials and representatives from a wide cross-section
of civil society to oversee the calculation of the subsidy saving amounts, monitor the allocation of
those funds, and evaluate the execution of the funded projects.

E.

Effective Public Information Campaign

10.
Increasing retail prices to reduce fuel subsidies is often a politically sensitive issue that
requires an effective public information campaign to gain public support. Informing the
potential beneficiaries (consumers and taxpayers) about the drawbacks of existing subsidies and the
benefits of reform would help increase public support for the automatic mechanism. Indeed, the
recent elimination of oil price subsidies in Nigeria and the ensuing protests highlights the
importance of building wide support among the main stakeholders (political parties, unions, etc.)
Successful public campaigns have highlighted the following elements (see Box 1 for specific country
examples):


Price increases reflect fluctuations in international prices, which are out of the control of the
government, and help the economy adjust to shocks. All importing countries face price
fluctuations and need to adjust to this reality. Passing through higher international prices to
domestic prices provides the appropriate incentive to consumers to reduce fuel consumption
and thus mitigate the adverse terms-of-trade impact on the economy as a whole.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

MALI



Higher income groups capture most of the benefits from fuel subsidies. As discussed in the
introduction section, this is due to the low share of fuel products in households at the bottom
of the income distribution. As shown in Figure 1, the weights of gasoline and diesel
consumption, which represents about 95 percent of domestic oil consumption, in the basket
of the bottom quintiles are very small. In addition, the indirect effect of rising fuel prices is
estimated to be about double the direct effect (see Kpodar and Djiofack, 2009), leading to an
overall small impact of a change in fuel prices on the lower quintiles. The emphasis on the fact
that the richest households gain most from fuel subsidies was followed by Ghana.



Holding domestic oil prices low results in fiscal leaks to neighboring countries. Citizens in
neighboring countries where fuel is more expensive, such as Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, have
an incentive to purchase fuel in Mali (Figure 1). As a result, the current implicit fuel subsidy
policy benefits citizens in neighboring countries.



Fuel subsidies promote the over-utilization of oil which damages the environment. The artificially
depressed price of fuel stimulates road traffic and the emission of green house gases which
results in excessive pollution and lasting damages to the environment.

ANNEX III.—A NOTE ON FINANCIAL SECTOR
STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT1
The financial system in Mali plays an increasing but limited role in supporting economic development.
Financial intermediation remains low, compared to other countries in the region. At the same time,
while the banking sector is well capitalized, the system continues to be burdened with large non
performing loans (NPLs), and stress tests indicate that credit concentration is an important source of
vulnerability. Concerted efforts will be needed to remove both economy-wide and banking sector’s
specific characteristics that hamper financial deepening and maintain stability. A new program
Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS) is needed that would build on the authorities’
achievements thus far. The authorities should also work with the regional oversight entities to align
regulations with the best international practices and improve supervision of both bank and non-bank
financial intermediaries.

A.

Background

1.
The financial sector in Mali plays an increasing, but limited role in supporting
economic development and intermediating resources. The 2008 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) identified a number of weaknesses, including limited access to financial services,
government’s substantial involvement in the banking sector, large NPLs, inadequate prudential
regulations, and vulnerabilities to sectoral shocks (Box 1).
2.
In 2008, the authorities developed a three-year FSDS to address shortcoming
identified by the FSAP. The FSDS aimed at: (i) enhancing performance and quality of banks and the
non-banking institutions; (ii) broadening access to the financial institutions and products, in
particular in rural areas and for small and middle sized enterprises (SMEs); (iii) restructuring and
privatizing state-owned banks; and (iv) strengthening the legislative framework (including the land
code, civil code and commercial code) in line with FSAP recommendations.
3.
Building on the achievements made thus far and the lessons learned from the March
2011 conference on Mali’s challenges and opportunities, the authorities will need to develop
a new FSDS in order to complete the implementation of the 2008 FSAP recommendations. In
anticipation of the new efforts, the following sections provide an overview of the state of the
banking sector and microfinance in Mali as of end-2011, and make recommendations for further
reforms going forward.

Financial Sector Structure and Performance

Structure and Intermediation
4.
The financial sector is dominated by banks. As of end- 2012, there were 13 banks, of
which eleven were foreign owed, holding over 80 percent of total sector’s assets. The banking sector
is relatively concentrated, with five banks accounting for two-thirds of assets and over 70 percent of
deposits. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are growing (1.15 million members in 2011, compared
with 0.8 million in 2005), but are not systemically important. Other financial institutions include
9 insurance companies, 2 financial establishments, 2 life insurance companies, and a pension
system comprised of social security and pension fund for private sector employees and another for
civil servants.
5.
Banks’ resources have been growing, but remain insufficiently diversified. While
deposits have grown by about 40 percent since 2008, over 60 percent of which are in short-term
demand deposits, which are highly seasonal. Banks hold considerable excess liquidity (Figure 1) in
part due to the lack of loanable projects and problems with loan recovery.

* At the end of October.

6.
Banks’ portfolios are composed mainly of loans to large private and public
enterprises specializing in cash crops (cotton), trade financing, and energy sector. Lending is
mostly limited to short-term financing, and is geared towards a few large borrowers. Over time, the
energy sector, construction, and trade have replaced the agricultural sector as the main destination
of lending (Table 2). Crop loans are mainly extended to the state-owned cotton ginning company

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

(CMDT), which has led to frequent breaching of large exposure limits, and loans are highly
seasonal in nature.
7.
While the public sector’s share in banks’ capital has declined since 2008, the
government continues to play a significant role in the sector. Of the 5 domestic banks, the
government has minority holdings in four, and is a major shareholder in the housing bank BHM
and the development bank BMS. As of January 2011, the government and public entities held
about 30 percent of total deposits of the banking sector, and accounted for 10 percent of total
loans granted by banks. The Treasury and the administrative public entities (EPAs) held over
3,400 accounts in the banking system.
8.
Bank intermediation has been increasing, but remains low (Figure 2). The ratio of
credit-to-GDP increased from 15 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2011. Also, currency-to-deposit
ratio declined from 57 percent to 33 percent during the same period, reflecting financial
deepening. Interest rates do not appear to have adversely affected bank intermediation, as they
seem to reflect cost of doing business. At end-2011, the average spread between deposit and
lending rate was about 4.5 percent (Table 2). Nonetheless, intermediation remains low, compared
with some other sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, Kenya). Only about 10 percent of the population
has banks accounts, and rural populations remain particularly underserved by commercial banks.

Constraints to Increased Financial Intermediation
9.
Economy-wide constraints help explain the slow progress in financial deepening and
financial sector outreach. These include weaknesses in the legal framework and judicial system
that result in a slowdown in loan recovery, shortcomings in the financial reporting of SMEs, and
lack of collateral for bank loans due to problems in land tenure and land registry. Also, poor
physical access and infrastructure, including limited electricity supply, poor road conditions, and
distance from central bank offices, which deter rural branch expansion, along with difficulty finding
skilled human resources increase the costs of extending credit or offering financial services.
10.
Specific structural characteristics of the financial system also hamper financial
deepening. These include: (i) limited coverage of small and medium-enterprises of the credit
registry system at the regional central bank (BCEAO) 2; (ii) the underdevelopment of leasing,
venture capital, and investment capital, which can provide alternatives to bank financing; and
(iii) the continuous availability of large government deposits, which reduces banks’ incentives to
compete for private sector resources. The latter also does not allow for the development of the
interbank market, given that banks are awash in government resources.

Banking Sector Soundness and Stability

Legal Framework and Banking Supervision
11.
Mali is subject to the unified regional prudential system for credit institutions and a
single supervisor (Banking Commission-WAEMU) with substantial support from the BCEAO. In
practice, banking supervision is governed by provisions at the community and national levels, and
the implementation is shared among four oversight authorities:


The Council of Ministers of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
which establishes the general regulatory and legal framework applicable to credit activity;



Mali’s Finance ministry (MOF), who has powers to issue and withdraw licenses for banks and
financial institutions and to address their problems;



The BCEAO, whose main powers are to prepare and technically transpose accounting and
prudential regulations applicable to banks and financial institutions, and to contribute,
through its national directorates, to the supervision of the banking system;



The Banking Commission-WAEMU, chaired by the Governor of the BCEAO, which is
responsible for organizing and supervising banks and financial institutions established in the
eight states of the union and that has the authority to issue administrative and disciplinary
penalties for that purpose.

12.
Reforms in banking supervision are needed. According to the 2008 FSAP findings,
supervision is broadly based on compliance with the regulations. Accordingly, it lags behind
developments in the international prudential approach based on risks and market discipline. The
BC-WAEMU does not have complete control in addressing banks’ problems, particularly in light of
the supranational nature of banking supervision, which means shared authority with the MOF.
There is no strong bank crisis resolution mechanism in place. Prudential information submitted
periodically by banks is insufficiently automated, and analysis of this information is a source of
excessive processing delays. The financial statements produced and published by banks are based
on the required chart of accounts implemented in 1996, which has not been updated to reflect
recent changes in the international accounting standards. While the regulation provides that
banking groups must prepare consolidated accounts, they are not subject to specific supervision,
and compliance with prudential ratios is not on a consolidated basis. Finally, forbearance regarding
the regulatory and governance environments appears to be high.

Financial Soundness Indicators
13.
Some of the prudential regulations are not in accordance with the international
standards (Table 1). Overall, the prudential system is incomplete, as it does not cover market risks,
country risk, or interest rate risk. The regulation establishing a ceiling on maximum lending to a
given counterpart (75 percent of capital and reserves) is much higher than the limit prescribed by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

MALI

best practices (25 percent), and is a source of excessive risk concentration. Similarly, the regulation
on medium and long-term transformation (ratio of financing medium or long-term assets with the
same type of resources) is not in line with the best international practices, and can hold back the
granting of medium- and long-term loans. The portfolio structure ratio is also overly restrictive and
may deter bank lending if the BC-WAEMU were to enforce it.3 Also, according to the 2008 FSAP
findings, risk management in banks remains inadequate.

14.
The level of NPLs is likely underestimated (Table 2). According to the WAEMU
regulations, loans are classified as non-performing when they are past due 6 months, and not
3 months, which is the international practice. With an average gross NPLs ratio of 18.7 percent at
end-2011 and increasing to 19.7 percent at end-June 2012, the quality of bank portfolio varies with
NPLs ratios diverging from low to more than half the portfolio in the case of the housing bank
(BHM). The provisioning rate, at 67.3 percent at end-June, remains insufficient and below the
WAEMU average. The high level of the NPLs is a reflection of the unfavorable business
environment, and, in particular, of the many difficulties encountered in recovery procedures.

Banks are well-capitalized and appear profitable, but relatively low provisioning
remains a problem. With the increase in the minimum statutory capital requirement to
CFAF 5 billion at end-2010, sector’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) remained comfortable at
13 percent at end-2011 and has continued to increase to 14.8 percent at end-June 2012, indicating
all foreign, domestic private, government-owned bank groups at healthy capital position, except
for two banks that do not meet the minimum requirement. As of end-2011, the average return on
assets and equity was 1.3 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively, yet with significant disparity
between banks, since the housing bank’s negative results weigh heavily on the sector’s average.
However, low provisioning inflates profits, and is likely to overestimate bank capitalization.
16.
With the establishment of a single Treasury account and the transfer of Treasury
deposits to the BCEAO, six banks would be in breach of the liquidity ratio norm. Of these six
banks, two are already in breach of this prudential norm prior to the transfer of Treasury deposits.
None of the other prudential regulations would be breached with the removal of these deposits.

Stress Test
17.
The stress tests were conducted to apply shocks to end-2010 data of individual banks.
The preliminary results are in line with the 2008 FSAP findings:


Loan concentration continues to be a major source of vulnerability due to the economy’s
lack of diversification. Banks are highly vulnerable to sectoral shocks, especially in the cotton
sector. Loans to CMDT represent 8 percent of total loans, and default of this single borrower
would cause a significant damage to the banking system. The banking sector would be
severely affected by an increase in the bad debts of its five largest borrowers (among which
CMDT and the state utility company EDM) who represent more than 30 percent of total
loans. This is symptomatic of the very heavy concentration of risks in the banking sector.



A 50 percent increase in NPLs would have a significant impact on Malian banks, given the
already high level of such debt. The system-wide CAR would decline to below the minimum
8 percent requirement.



Banks are liquid and are resilient to simulated deposit runs.

D.

Microfinance Sector

18.
As of end-2012, there were 125 licensed institutions. These were classified as the
Mutuals or Cooperatives, the Associations, and the Anonym Societies (single ownership). As of end2011, the Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) extended credit equivalent to CFAF 73 billion
(1.5 percent of GDP), compared to CFAF 45 Billion (1.5 percent of GDP) in 2005 (Table 3). Recent
political developments and deterioration in economic activity have significantly affected the MFIs,
lowering extended loans to CFAF 68 billion at end-June 2012.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

19.
Despite an improvement in 2011, the quality of MFI portfolio appears to have
deteriorated over time. At end-2011, their NPLs decreased from 7.6 percent in 2010 to 5 percent of
total loans. Since March 2012, however, the percentage of NPLs has continued to increase and
reached at end-June 5.3 percent at end-June. The supervisors in the MOF appear to be
inexperienced and capacity seems low. Thus far, 15 MIFs have been identified as having significant
financial difficulties and 11 were declared bankrupt. The government reimbursed CFAF 1.5 billion in
2010–11.

A new WAEMU wide microfinance law came into effect in July 2010. All MIFs will have
to abide by the provisions of the new law by July 2012. Below are some of the important points of
the law:
1. All MFIs are under the licensing agreement of the BCEAO.
2. According to Article 44: any MFI with deposits or assets over CFAF 2 billion in
consecutive years will have to be supervised by the BCEAO. There are about 20 such
institutions. All other institutions will have to be supervised by the MOF.
3. In response to an application for the establishment of a new microfinance, MOF has
3 months to verify the application and the BCEAO also needs to verify within 3 months.
If no verification is made, the institution cannot be created.
4. Prudential regulations were improved under the law.
5. All institutions with above CFAF 2 billion will have to provide monthly reports to the
BCEAO. Others will have to provide annual reports to the MOF.
6. On sight supervision of the MIFs will need to be done once every 3 years.
7. A new accounting framework, modeled after that of the banks will need to be adopted
by the MIFs. At this time, the accounting framework used by MIFs does not meet the
International Accounting Standards.
21.
Recent developments have delayed the introduction of the MFI restructuring
program. The Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the MFIs, the BCEAO and development
partners initiated a one-year restructuring program in March 2012. The purpose of the program has
been to assess the MFI situation, define restructuring measures and elaborate a re-financing
scheme for the sector.

Reform Strategy Going Forward

22.
Improving financial intermediation and maintaining stability will require concerted
and coordinated efforts from both regional and Malian authorities. While changes in the
supervision and regulatory framework, including the updating of the prudential norms will require
agreement on the WAEMU level, Malian authorities can take actions to remove impediments to
financial intermediation and maintain stability of the system in a number of areas that fall within
their purview.
23.
A new FSDS is needed to build on the achievements of the last FSDS and complete
the implementation the remaining agenda, including the 2008 FSAP recommendations,
taking lessons learned from the March 2011 conference on Mali’s challenges and opportunities.
Some of the reforms that can be implemented by the Malian authorities in the near future include:


On the legal front: (i) reviewing the land code, and improving the land tenure and land
registration regime, with a view to establishing land titles that could be used for obtaining
bank loans; (ii) adopting a financing reporting legislation, covering all regulatory aspects of
accounting and auditing; (iii) enacting legislation to promote leasing, venture capital, and
investment capital, which can provide alternatives to direct bank lending; (iv) adopting
regulations that requires banks to implement international accounting standards; and
(v) enhancing the capacity of courts.



On the institutional infrastructure and provision of better information: (i) improving the
scope of the credit information at the BCEAO to cover a greater range of information and
potential borrowers, particularly the largest SMEs; and (ii) creating a registry for bank
guarantees, that can be accessed by all, and can serve as a tool to facilitate the speedy
realization of guarantees in case of nonpayment of bank loans.



On deepening financial intermediation: (i) strengthening and developing the microfinance
by improving their monitoring and supervision, requiring improved managerial capacity and
governance; (ii) removing government deposits, which reduces banks’ incentives to compete
for private sector resources; and (iii) increasing access to payment services through
facilitating the development of banking services via mobile phones similar to Kenya (see
Box 2).

24.

The authorities will need to devise a strategy to address shortcomings in banks in the

aftermath of transfer of public resources to the BCEAO. One option will be to give banks a
grace period to improve their product line and increase their deposit taking to capture private
resources to replace the public funds. Banks that will be in the breach of the prudential norms after
the passage of the deadline would have to come under close supervision of the Banking
Commission, and administrative decisions will need to be taken to address the breach of prudential
norms.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

25.
Finally, completing the privatization of the loss making housing bank BHM and
development bank BRS as soon as possible will allow the authorities to focus on the
remaining large agenda of developing the financial sector. In addition to reforms noted above,
such an agenda should also entail working with the regional oversight authorities on aligning
prudential regulations with the best international practices.

Box 2. Kenya : Mobile Money and Financial Sector Deepening¹
The mobile-banking revolution has accelerated financial deepening in Kenya, and can be
replicated in the WAEMU countries, including Mali:



M-Pesa is a mobile-phone based electronic retail payment system introduced in Kenya in March
2007 by Safaricom, the largest mobile phone operator
Cellular phone density
in the country. The M-Pesa system allows users to

electronic value through its network of retail stores,
52.7
50
transfer funds electronically to other users and make
51.2
40
payments. In some cases users can also repay loans
made by microfinance institutions, and make deposits
30
in their bank accounts. While the M-Pesa system
20
records and stores all transactions electronically,
10
Safaricom deposits the full value of its customers’
0
balances in the system in pooled accounts in two
regulated banks. These deposits do not produce yields
for users.



Since its inception, it has grown to nearly 15 million clients representing more than 30 percent of
the country’s population and has a network of close to 32,000 agents, making it the most widely
used mobile-phone based money service in the world. Similar schemes have emerged in other
countries of the East African Community, including Uganda and Tanzania.



The WAEMU member countries, including Mali, have the necessary basic infrastructure to replicate
such a mobile payment system. They have on average penetration of cellular phone subscribers,
which is similar to that registered in Kenya and the average for SSA. In 2010 the WAEMU region
had a cellular phone density of 51 subscriptions for every 100 people, while Kenya had 62 and the
average for SSA was 53.



The expansion of mobile banking can be consistent
with continued financial stability. The authorities will
need to ensure that an adequate regulatory and
supervisory safeguards, and a conducive
environment for business (avoiding in particular the
dominance of early entrants) are in place. Also, the
authorities will need to maintain a close dialogue
with the private sector to ensure its active
involvement in policy formulation and enforcement.

Mobile banking offers the possibility of greatly
increasing access to a range of payment services at moderate costs, since financial institutions do
not need to incur the high costs of building and operating branches. Therefore, it also has the
potential to become a convenient savings instrument for low-income households.

ANNEX IV. EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT1
This note undertakes an assessment of the external stability of the Malian economy through
focusing on price and non-price indicators. The real exchange rate appears broadly in line with
fundamentals, while export performance has been stable, but export diversification has decreased
due to overreliance on gold, and qualitative competitiveness indicators point at significant
structural bottlenecks. Mali needs to improve its business environment in order to enhance
competitiveness.

A.

Composition of the Balance of Payments

1.

Mali is a low income country with a significant current account deficit (excluding official
grants) that over the last decade averaged at about 10 percent of GDP (Table 1), and was financed
by aid and foreign direct investment inflows, mainly in the gold and telecommunications sectors,
resulting in a modest net positive contribution to the foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank
of West African States (BCEAO).

Export Performance

2.

Mali’s exports are heavily concentrated on gold, and have thus benefitted from the rapid
gold price increase in recent years (Figure 1). However, in spite of favorable terms of trade change,
Mali’s share of world exports has remained virtually stagnant over the past decade. (Figure 2).

Given the limited gold reserves, Mali’s future export performance will depend crucially on
export diversification, which is also an important competitiveness indicator. This note calculates a
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index2 (HHI) of concentration across sectors and countries of destination for
select Sub-Saharan countries (Figures 3 and 4), which shows that Mali has a relatively high HHI of
export concentration across sectors as well as destination countries, as most of the gold is exported
to South Africa. The increase in export concentration, combined with the stagnant export share,
points to a loss of competitiveness, the effect of which will be felt more once the gold reserves start
to dwindle down. Mali needs to intensify export diversification through exporting new products,
increasing the share of currently minor export sectors, and exporting to new markets.

Structural Competitiveness Criteria

4.

The challenging business environment is a major impediment to private sector development,
which is crucial for product and export diversification away from the gold sector. Survey data
collected by the World Bank3 (WB) and the World Economic Forum4 (WEF) indicate that, while the
macroeconomic environment is deemed favorable, Mali’s overall structural competitiveness appears
relatively low (Tables 2 and 3). Mali’s business environment is notably hampered by inadequate
investor protection, low financial market development, insufficient access to electricity, difficulties
in paying taxes, and low health and education standards. The present political and security crisis, if
protracted, is also likely to have a negative impact on the business environment.

Alignment of Real Exchange Rate with Macroeconomic Fundamentals

5.

After a sharp depreciation during the first half of 2010, the real effective exchange rate
(REER) has been on a slight appreciation trend, which continued into 2011 (Figure 5). While during
the second half of the last decade REER appreciation has been caused primarily by the appreciation
of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), relative price increases have had a stronger effect
over the last year. The periods when relative price movements have been the driving force behind
REER fluctuations have been characterized by sharp changes in food prices due to local and global
dynamics, suggesting no evidence of Dutch-disease induced by aid inflows or gold exports receipts.

The equilibrium real exchange approach estimates the equilibrium REER as a function of
economic variables that cause persistent deviations from long-run purchasing power parity. The
coefficients in equation (2) below are obtained using a panel regression on a dataset that includes
22 non-oil-exporting Sub-Saharan countries over the 1990–2010 period. 6

Comparing the actual REER with the EREER estimated in equation (2) above suggests that
Mali’s REER has fluctuated around its equilibrium value since the mid 1990’s, and at the end of 2011
was modestly undervalued by about 5.8 percent (Figure 7).

The Macroeconomic Balance Approach

9.

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach uses the projected value of economic
fundamentals to generate a norm of the current account-to-GDP ratio (current account norm) for
the 2012–16 period based on coefficient estimates from Vitek (2012), where aid inflows are included
for emerging and developing countries in addition to the explanatory variables used by Lee et al
(2008). The coefficients used to project the current account norm are obtained using a panel
regression on a dataset that includes 116 countries over the 1990–2010 period (Table 5). Mali’s
current account norm is estimated at a deficit of 4.1 percent, whereas the projected underlying
current account deficit is 6.3 percent, suggesting a slight overvaluation of the REER. Based on
estimates of Mali’s trade elasticities from Tokarick (2010), a real depreciation of about 9.6 percent
would be necessary to close the gap between the underlying current account and the norm.

The External Sustainability Approach

10.

Under the external sustainability (ES) approach the current account norm is equated to the
ratio that stabilizes the medium-run ratio of net foreign assets (NFA) to GDP. This paper uses the
NFA-to-GDP ratio estimated for Mali estimated by Vitek (2012)71 as the equilibrium NFA ratio. The
steady state relationship between the current account and the NFA ratio is described as: 8 2

7

Vitek (2012) estimates the equilibrium NFA ratio as a function of per capita GDP differential from trade partners and
public debt-to-GDP ratio through a panel regression on a dataset that includes 69 countries over a 31 year period.

denotes the steady state equilibrium NFA-to-GDP ratio, and
denotes the steady state
growth rate of nominal output, which is estimated at 8 percent for Mali.
The current account norm obtained from the equilibrium relationship above is 3.3 percent, which
means that the REER would need to depreciate by about 11 percent to stabilize the NFA-to-GDP
ratio.

E.

Conclusion

11.

This note seeks to evaluate the external stability of the Malian economy by focusing both on
price and non-price criteria. The exchange rate assessment suggests that the real exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals. Export performance has been stable, but overly reliant on gold,
and export diversification has decreased. Competitiveness indicators developed by the World Bank
and the World Economic Forum suggest that the Malian economy faces significant structural and
institutional bottlenecks.

12.

In a context of low inflation and a fixed exchange rate, the burden of enhancing
competitiveness rests on Mali’s improving non-price competitiveness indicators. Mali needs to
better diversify its exports across products and markets, expand electricity coverage, and improve
the business environment by enhancing access to finance, protecting investors, making it easier for
businesses to pay taxes, and improve health and education standards.

APPENDIX V—LETTER OF INTENT
Bamako, Mali
January 10, 2013

Mrs. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C, 20431
USA
Dear Madame Managing Director:

1.
On December 27, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
approved a new three-year arrangement amounting to SDR 30 million under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) in favor of Mali in support of the country’s poverty reduction and growth strategy.
2.
Since then, the Malian economy has undergone a variety of shocks. First, the poor harvest in
2011 resulted in a food crisis, with 3.6 million people at risk from malnutrition. Next, the attacks
perpetrated in the north of Mali by rebels claiming independence for the zone comprising the three
regions in the North, as well as terrorist activities by organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda, triggered
a humanitarian crisis for 420,000 people who fled the North of the country, with approximately half
seeking refuge in neighboring countries. Finally, beginning in March 2012, Mali underwent a period
of violence and upheaval that lasted for several months, until the formation of a transition
government of national union that could concentrate on regaining control of the northern region
with assistance from the international community and with the organization of presidential and
legislative elections.
3.
Unfortunately, as a result of these shocks, the ECF-supported program has gone off track
and the cumulative overall balance of payments deficit for 2012–13 has worsened to US$380 million.
The government has thus decided to cancel the three-year arrangement under the ECF with
immediate effect and request a SDR 12 million disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF)
with a view to covering part of the anticipated balance of payments deficit.

4.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes recent
developments in the Malian economy and the progress made in implementing our program in 2011
and 2012. This memorandum also sets out the economic and financial policies that the Malian
government intends to pursue over the next 12 months. For 2013, the government has designed a
program of economic and financial policies for implementing a budget policy aimed at safeguarding
macroeconomic stability and further improving public financial management.
5.
The government believes that the measures and policies described in the attached MEFP are
adequate for attaining the objectives of its program for the next 12 months. It will take additional
measures as appropriate. Mali will consult with the IMF on the adoption of such measures and
before any revision of the policies described in the attached MEFP. The government will provide
Fund staff with any required information referred to in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU) concerning progress made under the program. During the program, the
government will not introduce or strengthen any exchange controls, multiple exchange rate
practices, or import restrictions for balance of payments purposes, or conclude any bilateral
payment agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
6.
In the case of a protracted balance-of-payments deficit, and with a satisfactory performance
with respect to the objectives under the program as outlined in the MEFP, the government
envisages requesting additional disbursements under the RCF supported by new commitments in
the areas of macroeconomic policy and public finance management. This way, the government
intends to continue to demonstrate to its development partners its commitment to sound policies,
until the circumstances are ripe for requesting a new three-year arrangement under the ECF.
7.
The government intends to make public the contents of the IMF staff report, including this
letter, the attached MEFP, the TMU, as well as the informational annex and the debt sustainability
analysis. It therefore authorizes the IMF to publish these documents on its website once the IMF
Executive Board approves the disbursement under the RCF.
Very truly yours,

ATTACHMENT I—MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES
1.
This memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) presents recent developments
and performance with respect to the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in
2011 and 2012 and Mali's economic and financial policies in 2013 in the context of the request for a

RESPECT TO PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY THE EXTENDED CREDIT
FACILITY
A.

Recent Economic Developments

Economic Developments in 2011
2.
In 2011, real GDP growth slowed to 2.7 percent. Agricultural production contracted by
4.5 percent, reflecting a 10 percent decline in cereal production due to uneven distribution of
rainfall in the Sahel region. Solid performance in manufacturing increased the sector’s value
added by 20.8 percent, attenuating the slowdown of GDP growth. Inflation was contained at an
annual average of 3.1 percent, as the cereal crisis did not begin to impact food prices until the end
of the year.
3.
The current account deficit (including grants) was reduced to 10.4 percent of GDP in 2011
due to the favorable impact of increased gold and cotton prices. The deficit was more than offset by
net inflows of capital, primarily in the form of external assistance and foreign direct investment (FDI).
As a result, the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of CFAF 29 billion (US$60 million),
which contributed to the accumulation of international reserves of the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO).
4.
The money supply expanded by 15 percent in 2011, driven by credit to the economy.
Nearly half of bank credits were absorbed by the wholesale and retail trade and restaurant and hotel
sectors, well ahead of the energy sector, whose relative share increased due to loans contracted by
the Malian energy concern EDM.
5.
The public finance deficit (cash basis) stood at 3.8 percent of GDP, a decrease of 0.6 percent
of GDP compared to 2010. Gross tax revenue totaled 15.3 percent of GDP, representing an increase
of 0.6 percent of GDP relative to the previous year. Net tax revenue was maintained at 14.6 percent
of GDP due to the government's decision to value refunds of VAT credits—payable mostly to gold
exporters—at fair cost and to accelerate the refund of those credits. Total expenditure and net
lending increased by 2 percent of GDP, to 24.8 percent of GDP. The deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP was
74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

financed through foreign-currency-denominated loans made under concessional terms equivalent
to 2.7 percent of GDP and by domestic financing equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP, including
utilization of SOTELMA privatization receipts equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP.

Economic Developments in 2012
6.
In 2012, the Malian economy suffered a multitude of shocks. The poor harvest in 2011 (¶2)
provoked a food crisis. The February 2012 final assessment report of the early warning system (SAP)
estimated that 196 communities and their estimated 3.6 million inhabitants should be considered at
risk for malnutrition. Those communities are located on the Mauritanian border, along the Niger
River, and in the north (Kayes, Koulikouro, Nara, Mopti, and Timbuktu regions). As soon as the
results of the initial SAP assessment were announced in November 2011, the government prepared
an emergency plan to respond to the food crisis. The plan provides for the free distribution of food,
grain sales at subsidized prices, activities associated with social transfers, the reconstitution of grain
inventories, and support in the areas of agriculture, stock farming, and nutrition. The total cost of
the emergency food security plan is CFAF 131 billion (US$260 million, or 2.5 percent of GDP), of
which approximately CFAF 66 billion (US$130 million) was covered, until now, by different donors,
including several NGOs, and CFAF 19 billion (US$37 million) by the government, according to the
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
7.
In addition to the cereal crisis, Mali faces a humanitarian crisis provoked by attacks in the
north by rebels claiming independence for an area comprising the three northern regions, and
terrorist activities of organizations affiliated with Al Qaeda. These attacks and the humanitarian crisis
have displaced approximately 420,000 persons, of whom roughly 210,000 have fled to neighboring
countries (109,000 in Mauritania, 65,000 in Niger, and 36,000 in Burkina Faso).
8.
In March, the country suffered a period of violence and confusion. In April, the president
resigned and was succeeded by the president of the National Assembly, whose term will run until
the next presidential elections. A prime minister was appointed, a government was formed, and the
National Assembly resumed its work. On August 20, the president expanded the composition of the
government to establish a national unity government whose priority objective is to reclaim northern
Mali and organize presidential and legislative elections. On December 15, 2012, a new prime
minister was appointed and the government was reshuffled to make it more inclusive. The national
unity government has requested assistance from the United Nations, the African Union, and the
Economic Community of West African States to recapture northern Mali. Preparations are under way
to deploy an intervention force of several thousand soldiers to support the Malian army in this
operation.
9.
These shocks weakened the foundations of the economy. While real GDP growth in 2012
had been estimated at 5.6 percent at the time the 2012 budget law was being prepared, all signs
now point to real GDP contracting by 1.5 percent. This contraction of GDP is explained by a general
decline of activities in the secondary and tertiary sectors. With the exception of gold production,
cotton ginning, and textiles, which have continued to hold up, all other sub sectors have suffered

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

MALI

from the crisis. The building and public works sector and hotel and restaurant sector were severely
affected by the suspension of budget support from Mali's technical and financial partners (TFPs)
following the March events, the sharp reduction of project assistance, and plummeting business
tourism. Abundant, well-distributed rainfall is expected to produce strong growth in the primary
sector (8 percent), which should limit the contraction of total GDP to a moderate level. The poor
harvest in 2011 drove up food prices, which in turn pushed inflation to an annual average of 5.6
percent at end-October 2012, or close to twice the objective established in the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
10.
The data on the monetary situation at end-September indicate that the overall balance of
payments deficit will be high in 2012. The BCEAO international reserves imputed to Mali have
declined by CFAF 110 billion (US$220 million) since the start of the year, pointing to an overall
balance of payments deficit of at least that amount at year-end. For the 12 months of 2012, the
current account deficit (including grants) is expected to fall to 5.8 percent of GDP due to the sharp
increase in gold and cotton exports. However, the improved current account may not suffice to
offset the deterioration of the capital and financial operations account in light of the sharp reduction
of external aid. As a result, Mali may need to use roughly CFAF 130 billion (US$260 million) of
BCEAO international reserves to finance its balance of payments deficit in 2012.
11.
At end-September 2012, the money supply increased by 11 percent on an annual basis,
driven by the government’s use of deposits to finance the budget deficit. Credit to the economy and
deposits declined slightly with respect to the beginning of the year, while currency in circulation
increased sharply.
12.
Following the invasion by terrorist groups in northern Mali, banks were forced to close
offices in that region and withstood damage estimated at CFAF 18 billion (US$ 36 million, or
0.3 percent of GDP), including CFAF 2.8 billion in stolen cash, CFAF 11.9 billion in impaired loan
receivables, and CFAF 2.1 billion in property damage. The impact of the crisis had only begun to be
seen in the most recent data available on banking sector stability (end-June 2012). In fact, the riskweighted capital ratio increased during the first half, to 14.8 percent. All but one bank met the new
minimum 8 percent capital adequacy ratio. Nonperforming loans (after deducting provisions)
increased slightly to 7.5 percent of total credits (after deducting provisions), but a larger increase is
expected by year-end, when a good number of outstanding receivables will not have been paid in
over 6 months due to the crisis, increasing the proportion of nonperforming loans as defined by
prudential regulations.
13.
In the fiscal area, the government quickly reduced expenditures to maintain spending levels
compatible with revenue and available bank deposits. In doing so, the government sought to give
priority to payment of salaries, pensions, scholarships, the army and security forces, and, to the
extent possible, priority spending on education, health, and social protection. Accordingly, despite a
shortfall of CFAF 67 billion in tax revenue (1.3 percent of GDP) at end-September 2012 and the
suspension of budget support from the TFPs since the events of March, the government managed
to contain the budget deficit at CFAF 40 billion (0.7 percent of GDP), at the cost of drastic cuts in
76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

domestically financed investment spending and the accumulation of CFAF 29 billion (US$58 million,
or 0.5 percent of GDP) in external debt payment arrears at mid-November 2012. The government
contacted all external creditors towards which it accumulated arrears to reaffirm its commitment to
honor all of its payment obligations as soon as its cash flow situation permits. The government also
contacted banks in the WAEMU area to secure refinancing of its treasury bills and bonds maturing in
2012 in order to renew them under the same terms, which has been agreed at this point.
14.
After a period of uncertainty following the March events, the revenue administrations
redoubled their efforts to collect tax revenue to enable the government to continue functioning.
To support this effort, the government implemented three tax increases on petroleum products in
order to end the erosion of tax revenue on petroleum products observed since 2009.13 The increases
in petroleum taxes will increase revenues by CFAF 7.8 billion in 2012. In the same vein, the
government decided to reduce the butane gas subsidy, which generated savings of CFAF 2.9 billion
in 2012.

The ECF-supported program approved in December 2011 began well but has lost ground
since March 2012 due to the multiple shocks that have affected Mali since the start of the year
(Table 1). In December 2011, all but one of the performance criteria were met as a result of solid tax
revenue performance and control of spending. Only the zero ceiling on accumulation of arrears on
external debt was not met due to the difficulty in identifying interlocutors for the purpose of
servicing one debt, to Libya (in the amount of CFAF 3.4 billion, or US$6.8 million) since the change
of regime in that country. Beginning in March 2012, public financial performance no longer met the
program objectives, as tax receipts fell short of targets due to the contraction of economic activity
and destruction of IT equipment at the Directorate General of Customs (DGD) during the events of
March, and the use of bank and market financing exceeded targets due to shortfalls in tax receipts
and the suspension of budget support (¶13).
16.
The crisis also affected the implementation of structural measures for which structural
benchmarks were established (Table 2). During the first half year, three out of four measures were
implemented (the preparation of petroleum product and electricity price adjustment formulas, the
startup of a multidisciplinary unit to expand the tax base by identifying taxpayers who may have
underreported their income, and the analysis of strengths and weaknesses in the process of
selecting and monitoring investment expenditures). During the second half, only one out of four
measures was implemented on time (the commitment and payment appropriation authorizations
procedure used in accounting for investment projects in the proposed 2013 budget law), but all
were implemented by year-end.

Oil tax revenue shrank from CFAF 97 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) in 2009 to CFAF 50 billion (1 percent of GDP) in
2011.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR END-2012
AND 2013
A.

Formulate Policies on the Basis of a Realistic Macroeconomic

Framework
17.
After a 1.5 percent contraction of economic activity in 2012 (¶9), real GDP is expected to
increase by 4.8 percent in 2013, reflecting increased gold production and recovered activity in the
other sectors following a return to normalcy in southern Mali and the gradual resumption of
projects financed by the TFPs. Inflation is expected to decline to 3 percent in 2013 if rainfall is
favorable. The current account deficit (including grants) is expected to widen to 8 percent of GDP in
2013 as economic activity recovers. Only a portion of the deficit could be financed by direct
investment and anticipated disbursements of project loans financed by the TFPs. The use of BCEAO
international reserves, in the amount of CFAF 83 billion (US$160 million) may again prove necessary.
18.
Although these prospects are favorable, the Malian economy remains exposed to vagaries of
the climate and the volatility of gold and cotton prices, which represent most of Mali's exports.
Moreover, renewed political tension in the south during the transition toward democratic elections
and the re-conquest of the north could once again weigh on consumer and investor confidence.
Finally, the prospects do not take account of the effects of the forthcoming military intervention in
northern Mali, the impacts of which will be integrated in the government's macroeconomic
framework as information becomes available.

B.
Implement a Fiscal Policy Focused on Maintaining Macroeconomic
and Financial Stability
19.
In the fiscal area, while awaiting the resumption of budget support from the TFPs, the
government will continue to conduct a prudent policy aimed at maintaining expenditures under
its control in balance with the resources on which it may reasonably rely. From that perspective, in
October 2012 the government introduced a 2012 supplementary budget proposal (LFR) and
proposed 2013 budget law, which are both based on ambitious efforts to mobilize domestic
resources but do not assume resumption of assistance from the TFPs in 2012 and 2013.

The Fiscal Program in 2012
20.
The proposed 2012 LFR assumes revenue and grants representing 18.0 percent of GDP
(20.5 percent of GDP in the initial budget law), net tax revenue of 15.0 percent of GDP (15.1 percent
of GDP in the initial law), total expenditure and net lending of 18.5 percent of GDP (23.4 percent of
GDP in the initial law), a total deficit (cash basis, including grants) of 0.8 percent of GDP (3.1 percent

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

of GDP in the initial law), and a basic fiscal deficit24 of 1.0 percent of GDP (1.2 percent of GDP in
the initial law).
21.
During a November budget review conducted with IMF staff, several risks were identified
with respect to the amounts shown in several 2012 LFR line items:






a CFAF 10 billion shortfall in domestic VAT revenue (with respect to the CFAF 130 billion
provided in the LFR);
a likely CFAF 10 billion underestimation of VAT credits to be refunded (with respect to the
CFAF 25 billion provided);
the need to increase the transfer to EDM by CFAF 10 billion (above the CFAF 20 billion
provided); EDM suffers from a structural imbalance between the selling price of electricity and
the production cost, and is in urgent need of cash to settle its arrears vis-à-vis petroleum
suppliers; 35and
the need to increase external debt service by CFAF 5 billion (with respect to the CFAF 49.8 billion
provided).

22.
Accordingly, the government decided to increase transfers to EDM by CFAF 10 billion, audit
the company to identify potential approaches to improving the company’s management, and
gradually increase electricity prices to eliminate the subsidy on electricity consumption, following
the example of the gradual elimination of cooking gas subsidies and increased petroleum taxes
undertaken in 2012 (¶14). It also identified CFAF 25 billion in expenditure (CFAF 20 billion in current
expenditure and CFAF 5billion in capital expenditure) in the 2012 LFR to be reduced in case the risks
identified should materialize.
23.
At the time of the budget review, it was also determined that the TFPs were executing
expenditures in the form of projects for amounts well in excess of the amounts provided in the 2012
LFR. In fact, the expenditures executed in the form of projects are now estimated at 1.2 percent of
GDP (of which 0.3 percent of GDP are financed by grants and 0.9 percent of GDP by loans)
compared to 0.1 percent of GDP provided in the 2012 LFR. The government will include the amounts
executed in the form of projects in 2012 in the draft law reporting on the 2012 budget execution.
24.
The government commits not to increase external arrears beyond CFAF 29 billion (¶13), the
stock outstanding at mid-November 2012 (indicative target, Table 3).

2

Since 2012, the definition of the basic fiscal balance under the program has been aligned with the new WAEMU
definition of the basic fiscal balance, namely revenue including resources from the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries plus grants intended for general budgetary assistance less current expenditure and
domestically financed expenditure.
3

In 2012, the average of sales price of electricity was CFAF 91 FCFA per kWh and the production cost was CFAF
119 per kWh.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

MALI

The fiscal program in 2013
25.
The proposed 2013 budget law provides for a total of expenditure and net lending of
18.2 percent of GDP, in balance with tax and non-tax revenue, and comes very close to an overall
fiscal balance. Net tax revenue is estimated to increase from 14.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to
15.3 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting a 25 percent increase in petroleum taxes compared to those
in place at end-2012, and renewed efforts to improve the collection of tax, customs, and property
revenue (¶¶31-34).
26.
During the budget review conducted with IMF staff, it also became apparent that a financing
gap remained in the amount of CFAF 55 billion (US$110 million, or 1.0 percent of GDP) in 2013,
primarily due to the following conclusions relating to the review of assumptions underlying the
proposed 2013 budget law:




downward revisions of revenue targets for the General Tax Directorate (DGI) by CFAF 6 billion
(compared to the CFAF 521 billion provided);
upward revision of CFAF 10 billion in VAT credits to be refunded (compared to the
CFAF 30 billion provided); and
upward revision of external debt service by CFAF 23 billion (with respect to the CFAF 35 billion
provided).

27.
The government hopes to count on resumed budget support from donors to cover the
financing gap in 2013. While awaiting confirmation of budget support in that amount, the
government will freeze capital expenditures provided in the 2013 budget law by the same amount,
and provided the National Assembly with a list of those expenditures prior to the vote on the 2013
budget law.
28.
At the time of the budget audit, it was also determined that Mali's TFPs were preparing to
execute expenditures in the form of projects in amounts well in excess of those provided in the 2013
budget law. In fact, expenditures executed in the form of projects are now projected at 3.1 percent
of GDP (of which 1.1 percent of GDP are financed by grants and 2.0 percent of GDP by loans)
compared to zero in the 2013 budget law. The government will increase the amounts of those
expenses in a 2013 supplementary budget to be introduced in the National Assembly as soon as
possible.
29.
In the difficult circumstances that led to an increase in military spending by one-third in the
proposed 2013 budget law with respect to the 2012 LFR, the government will nonetheless accord
priority to expenditures of the ministries of basic education, secondary education, higher education
and scientific research, health, and social development, in accordance with the 2011–17 Growth and
Poverty Reduction Strategy adopted in December 2011. Accordingly, the government is committed
to maintaining these expenditures above a floor in 2013 (Table 3).

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

30.
To ensure the quality of the sharp increase in projected military spending, the government,
with the assistance of World Bank public financial management experts, will conduct an evaluation
of the defense and security forces' public expenditures and financial management in order to
improve management performance, increase the forces' effectiveness in this area, and reduce
fiduciary risks.
31.

The government commits not to accumulate fresh external arrears in 2013 (indicative

targets, Table 3). It furthers commits to clear the outstanding external arrears (¶24) as soon as its
financial situation permits.

C.

Maintain Focus on Improving Public Financial Management

32.
While awaiting the resumption of technical assistance, the government will continue to
improve public financial management, in particular by remedying the weaknesses revealed by the
public expenditure and financial accountability assessment (PEFA) conducted in 2011. The
assessment indicated progress in Mali's public financial management system in terms of the
credibility, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the budget and the preparation and execution
of budget laws. However, it highlighted persistent weaknesses concerning tax collection, domestic
debt service, cash flow management, accounting, reporting, and external control. The government
is continuing implementation of the 2011–15 Government Action Plan to Improve and Modernize
Public Financial Management (PAGAM/GFP II), albeit with more targeted priorities and a
substantially reduced budget (from CFAF 11 billion, or US$22 million, to CFAF 2.2 billion, or
US$4.4 million).
Reform tax policy
33.
In the country's current fragile context, the government plans to prepare the way for the
gradual implementation of the following fiscal measures:


Identification and gradual reduction of exemptions:
 beginning with the proposed 2013 budget law, the inclusion of a table annexed to the
budget bill identifying all exemptions provided in the General Tax Code, Customs Code,
Investment Code, Mining Code, and all other laws or government decisions establishing
tax benefits; the legal bases for the exemptions and effective dates; and an estimate of the
forgone revenue they represent (structural benchmark, Table 2);
 gradual reduction of exemptions to the extent possible.



Preparation of a strategy to adjust domestic energy prices (petroleum products and electricity) to
international oil prices movements. This strategy includes the following elements:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

MALI

 beginning with the 2013 budget law, the inclusion in budget bills of a presentation of the
estimated consequences of the lack of petroleum and electricity price adjustment
mechanism for the government budget (structural benchmark, Table 2)
 by end-February 2013, development of proposals for adjustment of domestic energy prices
(petroleum products and electricity) to international prices:
o

preparation by the National Petroleum Office (ONAP), the DGD, and other units
concerned of different options to adjust petroleum product prices, accompanying
measures to minimize social consequences, and a communication policy in respect of
public opinion, taking account of the ONAP proposals of February 2010, the
recommendations of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department provided during the September
2011 WAEMU Commission seminar, and the report presented by the IMF mission in
March 2012;

o

commitment by the Malian authorities, EDM, and the Water and Electricity Regulatory
Commission (CREE), within the scope of their respective functions and responsibilities, to
adopt the public electricity tariff indexing formula, launch a communication campaign to
enlist public support and introduce electricity tariff adjustment by end-February 2013.

 development, with assistance from World Bank staff, of a system of transfers to limit social
tension that could result from increased food or energy price; the transfers would target the
most vulnerable segments of the population and could be increased if those prices rise.

Reform the Tax, Customs, and Government Property Administrations
34.
Priority will be given to implementing the reforms undertaken in 2011 to sustainably
improve the functioning and yield of the VAT, which account roughly for 40 percent of tax revenue.
The following measures have been implemented to that end:


On January 18, 2011, a Treasury account was opened at the BCEAO to receive all VAT receipts
paid by mining companies on imports, and 10 percent of domestic VAT receipts. The DGI and
DGD began to deposit monthly receipts to the account on June 1, 2011. The use of the account
is restricted to VAT credit refunds. This mechanism will ensure that VAT credits are duly
refunded on a regular basis in accordance with WAEMU law to gold exporters and all other
companies that generate VAT credits. The amount of VAT credits payable to gold mining
companies is estimated at CFAF 35.6 billion in 2012 and CFAF 38.5 billion in 2013. The DGI
prepared an estimate of accumulated VAT credits as at December 31, 2011 to be refunded by
the government in 2012, which came to CFAF 11 billion. These amounts will be reviewed in
March 2013 during the budget review to be conducted with IMF staff.



To continue to decrease the time required to refund VAT credits, between now and February
2013, the government will analyze the option of refunding VAT credits to mining companies by

82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

a simplified procedure in accordance with public accounting rules, beginning on January 1, 2014.
Under this approach, the VAT on mining companies would be collected, refunded, and recorded
as follows:
 The DGD and DGI collect the VAT from non-exempt mining companies;
 The Treasury refunds VAT credits directly from the account maintained at the BCEAO
(without prior issuance of payment orders); and
 The amount of VAT collected from mining companies is excluded from DGD receipts, and
the amount of mining company VAT credits attributable to their domestic transactions is
excluded from DGI revenue.


The system of withholding VAT at the source was eliminated on December 31, 2011 except for
the Treasury, for which it will be eliminated gradually beginning on January 1, 2013. From that
date, the Treasury will withhold only 40 percent of the VAT at the source, and the withholding
will be eliminated entirely as of January 1, 2014. In April 2012, the DGI sent a letter to all
companies no longer subject to VAT withholding at the source as at January 1, 2012 to remind
them of their obligations in regard to reporting and paying VAT. The DGI will verify those
companies' compliance with their VAT reporting obligations on a monthly basis (two weeks
after the close of the month) and report each quarter to the Minister of Economy, Finance, and
Budget on compliance with their reporting obligations.



To simplify the collection of VAT, the revenue threshold for payment of VAT will be increased
from CFAF 30 million to CFAF 50 million beginning on January 1, 2013 (structural benchmark,
Table 2). On January 1, 2014, the threshold will be raised to CFAF 100 million after consultation
with the WAEMU Commission, coordinating with the change of revenue thresholds established
by the Directorate of Large Enterprises (DGE) and the Directorate of Medium-Sized Enterprises
(DME) explained below.

35.
The DGI, the DGD, the National Directorate of Public Property and Lands (DNDC), and the
Directorate of Government Property Administration (DGABE) will continue their efforts to improve
tax, customs, and property administration:


Modification of revenue thresholds used by the DGE and DME in order to rationalize taxpayer
administration. To improve management of taxpayers and expand the number of taxpayers
managed by the DGE and the DME, the threshold for the DGE will be increased from
CFAF 500 million to CFAF 1 billion, and will be lowered for the DME from CFAF 150 million to
CFAF 100 million beginning on January 1, 2013 (structural benchmark, Table 2). This adjustment
will improve the DGE's management and control of companies, quickly increase the number of
taxpayers managed by the DME, and improve the management of VAT by assigning all
responsibility for VAT to the DGE and DME effective January 1, 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

MALI



Improvement of the SIGTAS taxpayer data base. The SIGTAS database contains numerous data
entry errors to be corrected by end-2013. Regular reports will be produced for this purpose.



Improved administration of taxpayers managed by the DGE. The DGI will take all steps necessary
to increase the number of taxpayers paying taxes by bank transfers for all companies managed
by the DGE by January 1, 2013.



Improved administration of taxpayers managed by the DME. The DGI will continue to pay special
attention to the operations of the DME, which will implement the following measures: (i) expand
its portfolio to increase the number of taxpayers to at least 2,000 by January 1, 2014; (ii) reduce
the VAT non-filer rate to less than 10 percent by end-2013 and less than 5 percent by end-2014;
and (iii) increase the tax audit coverage rate for year 2012 to at least 20 percent of its portfolio
by end-February 2013. The DGI will give special attention to upgrading the DME offices and
expanding its staff. The DME will move into its new offices by end-February 2013.



Strengthening of tax payment compliance. In October 2011, the DGI began publishing and
regularly updating lists of the taxpayers managed by the DGE and DME, respectively, on the
MEFB website, in order to inform the public of the results of efforts to broaden the taxable base.



Implementation of automated selection for customs inspections as soon as possible. To this end,
the DGD established a technical risk management unit, which had completed the necessary
preparatory tasks at the time of the March 2012 events.



Modernization of the DNDC. In 2011, the DNDC conducted a study to determine the potential
public property receipts and improve collection of that revenue, and a study to prepare and
implement an automation scheme. The DNDC has collected capital gains taxes on real property
sold by private individuals since October 1, 2011. It is continuing efforts to establish a land
registry and will implement a secure data storage system.



Modernization of the DGABE. The MEFB will modernize the DGABE through the introduction of
modern management tools such as results-based management, greater utilization of
automation (use of materials accounting software in the accounting offices of ministries and
public institutions), and the implementation of reforms to better monitor and optimize the
government portfolio.



Multidisciplinary tax control. The Joint Economic and Financial Intelligence Committee (CMRIEF)
was established on March 15, 2012 to strengthen the effectiveness of tax audits and identify new
taxpayers by using, notably, all databases of taxpayers or economic operators available at the
DGI, the DGD, the DNDC, the DGABE, and the directorate responsible for public procurement.
The CMRIEF identified potential tax deficiencies estimated at CFAF 7 billion in the hydrocarbon
sector and the automotive spare parts sector, which the DGI or the DGD will process. In parallel
with the sector-based approach, the CMRIEF will compare the values of imports reported by
operators in the DGD ASYCUDA database with the revenue figures reported to the DGI to

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

identify taxpayers who might have underestimated their taxable earnings, and report the results
of this investigation by end-February 2013 (structural benchmark, Table 4).


Improved accounting of tax revenue. The new Treasury integrated accounting application (AICE)
and its interface with DGD applications (ASYCUDA) and DGI applications (SIGTAS) was put in
operation in the Bamako District General Revenue Office (RGD) on January 3, 2012. The interface
with ASYCUDA was interrupted following the destruction of DGD IT equipment during the
events of March 2012, and will be restored to operation as soon as possible.

36.
To consolidate its efforts to reform the tax system and the tax, customs, and property
administrations, by end-February 2013 the government will request the IMF's intervention through
the Fund’s Topical Trust Fund on Tax Policy and Tax Administration to develop a multi-year technical
assistance program linked to the achievement of results. In order to develop its capacities in the
control of mining companies and review the possibility of introducing a surcharge on profits
generated by exceptionally high prices as part of the tax provisions applicable to mining companies,
the government will also request the IMF's intervention through the Fund’s Topical Trust Fund on
Managing Natural Resource Wealth.

Improve Expenditure Management and Transparency in Public Finance
37.
The government has agreed to incorporate the WAEMU directives 5/2009 through 10/2009
concerning transparency, budget laws, public accounting, budget nomenclature, the government
chart of accounts, and the government financial operations table (TOFE) in Mali’s laws and
regulations. The administration has elaborated drafts of the relevant amendments to domestic
legislation and regulation and has submitted those to the WAEMU Commission for opinion. The
Council of Ministers approved the proposed regulation for incorporation of Directive No. 05
covering the budget laws.
38.
Pursuant to these directives, the following cutoff dates have been established for 2012
budget execution: ordinary operating and capital expenditures to be committed by November 30,
2012; commitments of other expenditures by December 20; payment orders issued by December 31,
2012; and accountants’ payment order acceptances, approvals, and regularization of expenditures
by January 31, 2013. Accordingly, the carryover period will be limited to accounting operations, and
a circular on the annual closing was published on October 10, 2012 setting the deadlines for
commitment and validation so as to allow payment orders to be closed as at December 31, 2012.
39.
In the context of the program, the government also intends to complete the following
actions undertaken to improve cash management, accounting, and public finance statistics:


The Treasury single account (TSA) will be gradually implemented at the BCEAO. A study of the
impact of transferring all 3,415 government accounts as defined in the TOFE (other than project
accounts established pursuant to explicit provisions of agreements signed with TFPs) from
commercial banks to the BCEAO was completed on September 15, 2011. The study concluded

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

MALI

that seven banks could withstand the immediate transfer of these accounts to the BCEAO
without compromising their liquidity ratios, but six banks would see their ratios fall below the
minimum required. Accordingly, the authorities transferred the accounts (other than project
accounts) of the RGD, the Treasury Payment Office (PGT), the Treasury Central Accounting
Agency (ACCT), and the accounting offices of the regional treasurers-paymasters (TPR) in Mopti
and Sikasso at the seven commercial banks to the BCEAO in December 2011. The authorities will
take additional time to determine the strategy for transferring those entities' accounts at the
other six commercial banks, as well as accounts (other than project accounts) of other public
administrations and specialized agencies (EPA) held at any commercial bank, to the BCEAO.
However, following the events of March 2012 and the suspension of access to its accounts at
the BCEAO, the government decided to reopen the accounts of the above entities at the seven
commercial banks. The government decided to await resolution of the political-military crisis
before taking further steps to implement the TSA. In the meantime, the dormant government
accounts in the banking sector will be transferred to the TSA by end-February 2013. The Minister
of Economy, Finance and Budget will determine the conditions for the opening, operation, and
closing of public entities’ bank accounts. An agreement between the MEFB and the BCEAO
governing the operation of the TSA will be finalized.


The implementation of the new accounting software at the Treasury (AICE) will go on. The
application will be deployed at the Koulikoro treasurer general’s office by end-January 2013 and
at the ACCT by end-2013. The AICE deployment at the ACCT will allow the production of all
consolidated accounting statistical reports of government entities connected to the system,
including the Treasury balance and TOFE.



The quality of the accounts will be gradually improved. Efforts have begun to review and correct
the unusually high balances observed in reciprocal accounts, third-party accounts, and the
financial accounts of the ACCT, PGT, and RGD.



The government will continue efforts to improve public finance statistics. The TOFE was modified
as specified in the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU, ¶25) as of May 31, 2011.
Efforts will continue to reduce the statistical error required to reconcile the total balance
recorded and it’s financing. The MEFB and the BCEAO will continue to work closely to ensure
that the BCEAO continues to produce a narrow net government position covering the
transactions reflected in the TOFE (TMU, ¶6).



Monitoring of the net government position (NGP) in the banking system will be stepped up. By
February 28, 2013, the National Directorate of Treasury and Public Accounting (DNTCP) will
conduct a detailed review of all broad NGP components, as the term is applied by the BCEAO
pursuant to community provisions; all items constituting the narrow NGP (TMU, ¶6), including
government assets in the banking system available for treasury operations in 2013 (structural
benchmark, Table 4).

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI



Payment dates will be monitored more closely in order to avoid accumulation of arrears.
The expenditure management software (PRED5) will be used to monitor the time taken to
execute payment orders and ensure that payments are made in less than 90 days after validation
of the expenditures if possible. Monthly tables will be produced for this purpose (structural
benchmark, Table 4).



Projected cash flow plans will be prepared each month. Beginning in January 2013, the DNTCP
will prepare a projected cash flow plan covering the following 12 months.

40.
The following measures will be taken to gradually improve budget procedures and
monitoring of the execution of investment appropriations:


The draft 2013 budget law introduced the budgeting of commitment authorizations (CA) and
payment appropriations (PA) relating to triennial public investment expenditures. On that basis,
the MEFB will arrange to monitor the utilization of CA and PA in the PRED5 expenditure
management application.



The procedure for carryover of PA will take effect on a transitional basis to prepare for full
application of the carryover provisions established by WAEMU directives. The transitional system
authorizes PA to be carried over provided they are secured (i.e., covered by corresponding
financing or budget savings the following year) and provided for in the following year's cash
flow plan. Unsecured payment appropriations may also be carried over, up to a limit of
10 percent of the initial appropriations provided in the investment budget from domestic
resources, provided the financing is established in the following year's cash flow plan. Payment
appropriations associated with validated expenditures not yet authorized are carried over on a
priority basis, subject to the same ceiling; for amounts above the ceiling, the authorities must
prepare a supplemental budget bill (LFR). The terms of implementation of carryovers will include
an executive order adopted by the Council of Ministers no later than March 31 of the following
year identifying: (i) PA for which payment authorizations were not issued as at December 31 that
were canceled for the preceding fiscal year and carried over to the following fiscal year in
accordance with the preceding terms; and (ii) canceled PA that were not carried over



The procedure for carrying over payment appropriations will take effect by 2014 under a
mechanism that provides for full application of the carryover provisions established by WAEMU
directives and allows only secured payment appropriations included in the cash flow plan to be
carried over.

Strengthen Internal and External Control
41.
Internal control structures will be strengthened. The internal and external control structures
revealed numerous administrative weaknesses in public financial management in Mali. With respect
to internal control, the Government Comptroller’s Office (CGSP) noted the shortage of and
inadequate use of procedures manuals in the administration. To correct these weaknesses, in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

87

MALI

August 2011 the government adopted a 2011–15 national internal control strategy, which it will
implement with the support of several of its TFPs. With respect to external control, the Auditor
General's Bureau (BVG) directed attention to significant amounts pending collection for the
Treasury. The staffing of the Supreme Court accounting section will be increased, and the section
will be converted into a Court of Accounts in accordance with the applicable WAEMU directives as
soon as possible.
42.
The production and audit of the annual government accounts will be expedited. The Supreme
Court accounting section is implementing a strategy of reviewing accounts based on the assessment
of account positions produced by the DNTCP. For government accounts prior to 1992, the
government enacted a proposed validation law on June 29, 2011 and submitted it to the National
Assembly that approved it on January 3, 2013. The accounting section reviewed the government
accounts for fiscal years 1992 through 2008. The National Assembly approved the budget execution
laws for 2008 and 2009. The government submitted proposed budget execution laws for fiscal years
2010 and 2011 to the National Assembly. The government will adopt the draft budget execution law
for fiscal year 2012 by end-2013, in accordance with WAEMU directives.

Conduct a Sustainable Borrowing Policy
43.
The most recent debt sustainability analysis conducted by IMF and World Bank staff
concluded that the risk of debt distress remains moderate. The analysis also confirmed that the
sustainability of the debt remains highly sensitive to gold prices (gold represents three-fourths of
exports, and gold production will decrease in the medium term), the financial terms of the debt, and
the pursuit of sustainable fiscal policies. Accordingly, the government reiterates its commitment to
cover its external financing needs with grants and the balance with loans having a minimum grant
element of 35 percent (continuous indicator, Table 3).

Management of domestic debt will be improved. To this end, the MEFB tasked the
Directorate General of Public Debt (DGDP) with compiling an inventory of all domestic borrowing
agreements signed by the government and all government domestic debt guarantees in order to
include to payment schedules in the public debt data and the budget laws. The DGDP has begun the
inventory effort with local banks. The project has already served to identify CFAF 238.1 billion in
direct and indirect government commitments vis-à-vis the banking sector, representing 4.7 percent
of GDP, as at December 31, 2011, of which CFAF 32.3 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in payments past
due. A payment schedule is being negotiated with the creditors, and CFAF 7.5 billion is included in
the proposed 2012 LFR and CFAF 9.2 billion in the 2013 budget proposal to cover these payments.

PROGRAM MONITORING
45.
The program will be evaluated based on the indicators as at December 31, 2012 and as at
March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2013 (Table 3) as well as continuous indicators
and structural benchmarks (Table 4). The indicators are defined in the TMU, which also identifies the
nature and frequency of reports to be provided for program monitoring purposes.

ATTACHMENT II—TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the program indicators
accompanying the request for disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) presented in Table
3 of the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It also specifies the frequency
and deadlines for reporting data to the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for programmonitoring purposes.

I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central government of the
Republic of Mali and does not include local governments, the central bank, or any other public
entity with autonomous legal personality that is not included in the Central Government Financial
Operations Table (TOFE). The National Directorate of the Treasury and Public Accounting (DNTCP)
reports the scope of the TOFE in accordance with the presentation of the accounts nomenclature
provided by the BCEAO and forwards it to the Central Bank and IMF staff.

II. INDICATORS
3.
Except as noted, the following financial targets will constitute indicators for end-December
2012 and end-March, end-June, end-September, and end-December 2013.

A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government by Banks and the
Financial Market
4.
Net domestic financing of the government by banks and the financial market is defined as
the sum of (i) the narrow net government position as defined below, and (ii) financing of the
government through the issuance (net of redemptions) of securities to legal entities or individuals
outside the banking system or to nonresident banks domiciled in the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU).
5.
The broad net government position is defined as the difference between government debts
and claims vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of the net government
position is that used by the Central Bank for West African States (BCEAO) pursuant to Community
provisions. It implies a broader definition of the government than that specified in paragraph 2 and
includes local governments and certain government administrative agencies and projects.
Government claims include the CFAF cash balance, postal checking accounts, secured liabilities, and

94

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

all deposits of government agencies with the BCEAO and commercial banks, with the exception of
government industrial and commercial agencies (EPIC) and public enterprises, which are excluded
from the calculation. Government debts to the banking system include all debts to these same
financial institutions. Deposits of the Cotton Stabilization Fund and government securities held
outside the Malian banking system are not included in the calculation of the net government
position. The net government position is calculated by the BCEAO.
6.
The narrow net government position is defined as the difference between government debts
and claims vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of the narrow net
government position is defined and explained in paragraph 2. The narrow NGP is calculated by the
BCEAO.

Adjusters
7.
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government by banks and the [financial] market
will be adjusted upward if external budget support falls short of program projections. External
budget support is defined as grants, loans, and debt relief operations (excluding project loans and
grants, sectoral budget grants, IMF resources, and debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, but including
general budget support). The adjustment factor will be applied at the rate of 100 percent up to a
threshold of CFAF 25 billion and at the rate of 0 percent for larger amounts.
8.
The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government by banks and the financial market
will be adjusted upward (downward) if the net reduction in outstanding bills exceeds (is less than)
the programmed amounts (MEFP, Table 3). Outstanding bills are defined as payment orders not
paid by the DNTCP in the context of budget execution or on miscellaneous correspondent and
depositor accounts, regardless of their age.
9.
Finally, the ceiling on net domestic financing of the government by banks and the financial
market will be adjusted upward (downward) for the payment of VAT credits, other tax refunds, and
audited arrears from previous fiscal years exceeding (under) the programmed amounts (MEFP,
Table 3).

B.

Non-accumulation of External Public Payments Arrears

10.
The stock of external payments arrears is defined as the sum of obligations due but not paid
on external liabilities of the government and the external debt owed or guaranteed by the
government. The definition of external debt provided in paragraph 11(a) applies here.
11.
During the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments
arrears (except on debts that are being renegotiated or rescheduled). The performance criterion on
the non-accumulation of external payments arrears will be applied on a continuous basis
throughout the program period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

95

C.
Ceiling on Non-Concessional External Debt with a Maturity of One Year or
More and on Short-Term External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Government and/or Public Enterprises
12.
Definition of debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the definition of debt is
set out in Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision
No. 14416-(09/91):
(a)
Debt is understood to mean a direct, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
agreement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services
at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures,
commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until
sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected
service life of the property, while the lessor retains title to the property. For the purpose of this
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover
the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt.
Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment
on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
13.
Debt guarantees. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the guarantee of a debt
arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government to service a debt in the event of nonpayment
by the debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind).
14.
Debt concessionality. A debt is considered concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent; the grant element is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal
value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its
contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.

MALI

The discount rates used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs), published by OECD. For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR is
used to calculate the PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15
years, the six-month average CIRR is used. The margins for differing repayment periods (0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and
1.25 percent for 30 years or more) are added to the ten-year and six-month CIRR averages.
15.
External debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, external debt is defined as
debt denominated, or requiring repayment, in a currency other than the CFA franc. This definition also
applies to such debt to WAEMU countries.
16.
Debt-related assessment criteria. The relevant assessment criteria apply to the contracting and
guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the government, Energie du Mali (EDM), and the
Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (CMDT), insofar as the government is a majority shareholder. The
criteria apply to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been
received. The criteria also apply to private debt for which official guarantees have been extended and
which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the government. These program indicators are
monitored on a continuous basis. No adjuster will be applied to these program indicators.
17.
Special provisions. The program indicators do not apply to: (i) debt rescheduling transactions of
debt existing at the time of the approval of the arrangement; (ii) short-term external debt (maturity of
less than one year) related to imports; (iii) external debt of the CMDT guaranteed by cotton export
proceeds; and iv) short-term external debt (maturity of less than one year) contracted by EDM to finance
the purchase of petroleum products.
18.
Reporting requirements. The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to
Fund staff as soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government, but no later than

E.

Floor on the Basic Fiscal Balance

20.
The basic fiscal balance is defined as the difference between total net revenue, plus budgetary
grants (general budget support) and HIPC resources, and total expenditure cleared for payment plus net
lending, excluding capital expenditure financed by creditors or donors, pursuant to the definition of basic
fiscal balance in the WAEMU texts (WAEMU Additional Act No. 05/2009/CCEG/UEMOA of March 17,
2009, amending Act No. 4/1999 pertaining to the Convergence, Stability, Growth, and Solidarity Pact).

Adjuster
21.
The floor on the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted downward if budgetary grants (general
budget support) fall short of program projections. The adjuster will be applied at the rate of 100 percent
up to a threshold of CFAF 25 billion and at a rate of 0 percent for larger amounts.
22.
Finally, the floor on the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted downward (upward) for the payment
of VAT credits and other tax refunds exceeding (under) the programmed amounts (MEFP, Table 3).

F.

Floor on Priority Poverty-Reducing Expenditure

23.
Priority poverty-reducing expenditure is defined as the sum of the expenditure in the sectors of
elementary education, secondary and higher education, scientific research, health, and social
development. It excludes capital expenditure financed by external technical and financial partners in the
form of projects.

III. STRUCTURAL MEASURES
24.
Information on the introduction of measures constituting structural benchmarks will be sent to
IMF staff no later than two weeks after the date set for their implementation.
25.
As of May 31, 2011, changes have been made to the Central Government Consolidated Financial
Operations Table (TOFE) as described below. Revenues and expenditures recorded in suspense accounts
are recorded above the line as revenues or expenditures without being broken down. As part of the
adjustment to cash basis, a distinction is made between transactions under previous fiscal years and
transactions under the current fiscal year, as well as, in the latter case, a distinction between the “float”
(less than three months) and types of arrears (more than three months) with respect to budget
expenditures (including VAT credits and calls upon guarantees and pledges). Within the entry “net
domestic financing,” a distinction will be made between bank

financing, privatization income, and other financing sources. Bank financing includes changes in the net
government position vis-à-vis the central bank, the IMF, and resident commercial banks. In showing
operations with commercial banks, a distinction is made between the Treasury, the National Social
Insurance Administration (INPS), and other government entities. Within Treasury transactions, deposits
and withdrawals on the SOTELMA privatization income account are specifically identified. Other financing
will consist mainly of checks that have not been cashed, advance tax installments received in the current
year for the following year, the regularization of advance tax installments received the previous year for
the current year, operations with nonresident WAEMU creditors, and changes in deposits from Treasury
correspondents.

IV. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM MONITORING

Mali’s risk of debt distress continues to be assessed as moderate—unchanged from the previous Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA). Debt sustainability remains mostly sensitive to a hardening of financial
terms or an export shock stemming from the concentration of exports on gold.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Recent Developments in Public External Debt
1.
As a result of the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), Mali’s stock of external debt has declined significantly.
Mali’s stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt declined from 103 percent of GDP in 2000
to 19 percent in 2006 owing to enhanced HIPC debt relief in 2002 and MDRI debt relief in 2006
(Text Table 1). At end-2011, it had increased to 28.1 percent of GDP owing mainly to new loans by the
International Development Association (IDA), the African Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB), and the IMF (mainly through an allocation of SDR 74 million in 2009). All of
Mali’s external debt is public and the bulk is owed to multilateral creditors, mainly IDA, AfDB and IsDB.

B. Recent Developments in Public Domestic Debt
2.
Mali’s domestic public debt is small (4.7 percent of GDP in 2011, Text Table 2). It consists of
treasury bills and bonds issued on the regional market of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU), and commercial bank loans. Domestic debt has more than doubled between 2009 and 2011
mainly as a result of new issuances of treasury bills and bonds (CFAF 137 billion at the end of 2011), but
also owing to an inventory of all loans contracted or guaranteed by the government that the authorities
have been conducting as part of their plan to strengthen debt management.

C. Debt Burden Thresholds Under the Debt Sustainability Framework
3.
Mali is a medium policy performer for the purpose of determining the debt burden
thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Mali’s rating on the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) averaged 3.65 (on a scale of 1 to 6) during 2009–11, making it a
medium policy performer. The corresponding external public debt burden thresholds are shown in Text
Table 3.

II. BASELINE SCENARIO UNDERLYING THE DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
The central feature of Mali’s medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook is the steady
decline of annual gold production expected to be compensated only in part by other exports. The
baseline scenario assumes a continuation of trend GDP growth as agriculture offsets the steady decline of
gold production (Box 1). Inflation is expected to remain moderate as prudent fiscal policies are
implemented with no recourse to domestic borrowing. The current account deficit is expected to remain
stable, as the decline in gold exports is compensated by an increase of other exports including agricultural
products and other minerals, and a deceleration in import growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

Box 1. Mali: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the Baseline Scenario, 2012–32
 Real GDP growth is expected to pick up after a 1.5 percent decline caused by the political and security challenges
in 2012, and average 5 percent per year, slightly above the trend observed during the last 10 years (4.8 percent).
Near term growth is assumed to be slightly higher than average owing to an expected rebound from the current
crisis. Gold output is projected to decline by about 2 percent annually starting in 2014. Higher agricultural
production is expected to outweigh this decline over time owing to cotton and other agricultural sector reforms.
With a projected rapid population growth, the baseline scenario thus assumes low per capita income growth (and
therefore no access to middle income status which would reduce concessional financing).
 Consumer price inflation is projected to remain below the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent.
 Fiscal policy. The basic fiscal balance (revenue plus budgetary grants minus domestically financed expenditure) is
expected to be equal to or greater than zero in order to meet the WAEMU convergence criterion. Tax revenue and
domestically financed expenditure are expected to increase in sync by about 4 percent of GDP during 2012–32.
Therefore, there is no recourse to domestic borrowing to finance the budget, except for rolling over current stock of
domestic debt at market rates. In 2012, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) shrinks to 2.9 percent owing to
the suspension of donor budget support after the military coup of March 2012; the deficit is financed by donor
project support and the use of government deposits in the banking system. With the resumption of budget
support, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is projected to hover around 5.5 percent of GDP from 2014
onward, and to be financed by external loans for 50 percent and grants for the balance.
 The non-interest current account deficit is projected to stay at around 5.3 percent, slightly above the historic
average (4.7 percent of GDP). Gold exports volumes are expected to decline steadily over time, and the share of
gold in total exports is projected to fall from 74 percent in 2012 to about 32 percent in 2032. This decline is
projected to be compensated by a gradual increase of other exports (including food, cotton, and other minerals
such as cement, phosphate, uranium, bauxite, iron ore, copper, nickel, oil) ,and a deceleration of import growth.
Remittances (in percent of GDP) are projected to remain close to historical average.
 External arrears. Debt service in 2012 was hampered by the political instability, which contributed to the
suspension of budget aid and a weak revenue performance, causing the government to only serve part of the
external debt and accumulate arrears to the amount of USD 58 million. The government has duly informed the
creditors of its inability to serve its external debt in full for the time being and reiterated its willingness to clear all its
arrears as soon as possible. The DSA assumes that these arrears will be paid in five annual installments over the
2014–18 period.

III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. External Debt
5.
Under the baseline assumptions, all external debt and debt-service ratios remain below the
policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 1). The present value (PV) of
external debt is expected to slightly climb from 24 percent of GDP in 2011 to 25 percent in 2032
(Table 1a). As production from existing gold mines declines starting in 2014 and other exports’ growth
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

only partly compensates for that decline, the PV of the external debt-to-exports ratio is projected to
increase from 76 percent in 2012 to 143 percent in 2032, below the threshold of 150 percent (Figure 1c).
With a projected increase in tax revenue by 4 percent of GDP during the projection period, the PV of the
external debt-to-revenue ratio is expected to decline from 135 percent in 2012 to 122 percent in 2032,
remaining significantly below the threshold of 250 percent (Figure 1d, Table 1a).
6.
Mali’s external debt sustainability is mostly sensitive to an export shock and a hardening
of financial terms, limiting the scope for non-concessional borrowing. Under a bound test that
reduces exports growth temporarily in 2013–14 with the effect of reducing exports levels permanently
by 25 percent, the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio would exceed the threshold in the year 2024 and
remain high until the end of the projection period (Figure 1c, Table 1b, Scenario B2). Under a hardening
of financial terms, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio would breach the threshold by a large margin in the
second half of the projection period and for a protracted period of time (Table 1b, Scenario A2).

B. Public Debt
7.
The inclusion of domestic debt does not alter the assessment of Mali’s debt sustainability.
Given the small size of Mali’s domestic debt and the absence of recourse to domestic borrowing in the
base line scenario, the public debt sustainability analysis closely mirrors the external debt sustainability
analysis (Figure 2 and Table 2a). The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio slightly decreases from 29 percent in 2012 to
27 percent in 2032.
8.
Mali’s total public debt sustainability is most sensitive to a growth shock. In particular, a
permanent decline in long-term GDP growth from 5 percent to 4.7 percent would increase the PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio to 37 percent in 2032 (Figure 2; Table 2b, Scenario A3).

IV. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND
CONCLUSIONS
9.
The DSA indicates that Mali remains at moderate risk of debt distress based on the external
debt burden indicators. As in last year’s DSA, none of the debt burden thresholds are breached over the
20-year projection period under the baseline scenario, and debt sustainability remains mostly sensitive to
an export shock and to a hardening of financing terms. However, given the expected decline in gold
exports in the medium term, the uncertain prospects for export diversification, and the present political
and security situation, Mali’s debt sustainability needs to remain under close scrutiny. The above
mentioned factors necessitate recommending that the government continue to limit its external financing
to grants and concessional loans.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that qualified for the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust
and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time
the member qualifies for such debt relief.
IX. Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
X. Safeguards Assessments
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The most recent safeguards
assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update assessment
found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the operational level. The overall
governance framework should nonetheless be strengthened by the addition of an audit
committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the
control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements. The completion of
the Institutional Reform of the WAMU and the BCEAO in the beginning of 2010 should help to
correct that situation. Efforts to implement fully the International Financial Reporting
Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.

XI. Exchange Rate Arrangements
Mali is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The exchange
system, common to all members of the union, has no restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions. The union’s common currency, the CFA
franc, was pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 50 = FF 1 from 1948 until early 1994.
Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued, and the new parity set at CFAF 100 =
FF 1. Effective January 1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96
= EUR 1.
As of June 1, 1996, Mali and other members of WAEMU accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Mali’s exchange system has no
restrictions on making payments or transfers for current international transactions and the
country does not engage in multiple currency practices.
Sharing a common trade policy with other members of WAEMU, Mali has shifted key trade
policy-making to the sub-regional level. The common external tariff (CET) was adopted in
January 2000. Mali complies with the union’s tariff rate structure and has effectively dismantled
internal tariffs. Between 1997 and 2003, WAEMU tariff reform reduced the simple average
custom duty from 22 percent to 15 percent; the maximum rate is currently 20 percent. Imports
to Mali are not subject to quantitative restrictions.
Mali’s exports to the European Union generally enjoy non-reciprocal preferential treatment in
the form of exemption from import duties under the Everything but Arms initiative. Malian
goods enjoy nonreciprocal preferential access to the markets of developed countries other
than the European Union under the Generalized System of Preferences. Mali is also eligible to
benefits from the United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act. Mali imposes no de jure
restrictions on exports.
XII. Article IV Consultations
Mali’s Article IV consultation cycle is governed by the provisions of the decision on
consultation cycles, Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010). The Executive Board completed
the last Article IV consultation (EBS/10/132) on July 16, 2010.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical Issues Appendix
(As of November 30, 2012)
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Mali has been
participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since September 2001 and has
advanced the implementation of its short- and medium-term plans for improvement. The
metadata has been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB), since
June 2003.
Real sector
The economic accounts of Mali are prepared by the National Directorate of Statistics and Data
Processing (DNSI), in accordance with the System of National Accounts 1968 (SNA68) and
adapted to certain characteristics specific to Mali. They are compiled on an annual basis. There
are, however, weaknesses in the accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of national accounts data.
The main reason has been the inadequacy of source data, along with insufficient funding and
technical staffing of the DNSI. The work on implementing the System of National Accounts
1993 (1993 SNA) is ongoing, with the support of the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) Commission and AFRITAC West. At this time, the new base year, 2006, has
been completed, and 2007 is near completion.
In concert with other WAEMU member countries, the DNSI has been compiling and publishing
a harmonized consumer price index (CPI) for Bamako on a monthly basis since early 1998.
Government finance statistics
As part of the process of economic integration among the member countries of the WAEMU,
the country has made significant progress in bringing its fiscal data in line with the common
framework that has been developed with technical assistance from the Fund (the harmonized
table of government financial operations – TOFE). However, further efforts are needed to
improve the timeliness and coverage of the TOFE. Work is progressing with the assistance of
STA, AFRITAC West and AFRISTAT to expand the coverage of the TOFE to public agencies and
local governments, as well as to strengthen coverage of domestic financing items. Quarterly
budget execution reports are posted on the Ministry of Finance website on a timely basis.
In July 2007, a GFS mission visited Bamako to advance further the implementation of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, and subsequently a country page was introduced
in the 2007 issue of GFS Yearbook. To date the authorities have supplied six years of annual
GFS data and they are preparing to disseminate quarterly data to STA for publication in IFS. In
January 2008, the Minister of Finance issued a decree committing the government to the

10

development of a database which will facilitate the balance sheet approach to analysis of the
public sector; among the first steps will be an inventory and appraisal of the fair market value
of nonfinancial assets. In July 2008, STA AFRITAC West staff visited Bamako for a short followup mission and was provided with complete data on both social security agencies.
Public debt statistics are prepared and monitored by separate agencies: external debt by the
National Public Debt Directorate (NPDD) and domestic debt by the National Directorate of the
Treasury and Government Accounting. The NPDD uses CS-DRMS accounting software. Debt
data and projections are of generally good quality, although there is scope for improving
presentation as well as the coverage of debt relief (multilateral and bilateral). A Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) was finalized in late 2009, and the authorities
are working to strengthen debt data in line with the DeMPA report’s recommendations.
Monetary data
Monetary and financial statistics:
Monetary and financial statistics, compiled and disseminated by the regional Central Bank of
West African States (BCEAO), are broadly adequate and their institutional coverage is
comprehensive. The dissemination of monthly monetary data from the BCEAO takes four to six
weeks consistent with GDDS recommendations. Data are posted on the BCEAO website with a
considerably longer lag. Accuracy is somewhat hampered by the use of 1990 sorting
coefficients to estimate cross border amounts of banknotes among BCEAO countries, which in
turn are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of each
member country. Standardized Report Forms (in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistical
Manual) are still not regularly used to report monetary data to the IMF.
Balance of payments
In December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of payments
statistics was formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation adopted by the
countries participating in the WAEMU. The BCEAO national agency finalizes the data toward
mid-November of the following year, and publishes immediately thereafter in the form of a
brochure, which however are not sufficiently robust.
In general, the external sector statistics in Mali exhibit serious deficiencies. Concepts and
definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in broad conformity with the
guidelines presented in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The
adoption of BPM6 methodology is not required before 2013/2014, except for the recording of
SDR allocations as debt liabilities. The Mali balance of payments metadata should also be
updated.
The BCEAO set up a subregional unit responsible for reconciling intra-WAEMU trade data,
which is responsible for harmonizing the bilateral statistics of member states to eliminate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MALI

asymmetries before these data on internal transactions in the Union are consolidated to
prepare the WAEMU regional balance of payments. The corrections made are retroactive to
national data and help to improve them.
Balance of payments data remain weak in a number of key areas. Data on remittances, foreign
direct investment and portfolio flows are similarly weak. Project aid is currently classified as
current transfers rather than in the capital account, and several large in-kind projects are not
captured in the balance of payments data properly.
Data on international investment position is published in IFS and BOPSY up to 2007. A foreign
private capital survey (FPC) from DFI called “PRC CPE” is underway as in all Franc Zone
countries. However, foreign assets of the private non banking sector are not well covered in
the financial accounts as the surveys of residents’ foreign assets remain very partial, and no use
is made of an existing alternative source, e.g., BIS statistics.
The April-May 2003 multi sector statistics mission found that the balance of payments
compilation system is generally sound and encouraged the authorities to integrate banking
settlement sources and disseminate the balance of payments within the recommended
timeliness, as set by the GDDS. The first of these recommendations remains pending. Annual
statistics on balance of payments are reported to STA on a regular basis, but with some delay.
Poverty statistics
The PRS Annual Update identifies a key set of poverty indicators for monitoring of the PRS
implementation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 28, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Mali
On January 28, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mali.1 The Board also approved a disbursement under the Rapid
Credit Facility (RCF) during the same meeting (See Press Release No. 13/xxx).
Background
Mali’s economy is struggling under a series of shocks. The poor harvest in 2011, loss of
government control over the north part of the country following attacks by rebel groups; and
the military coup in March 2012 have all taken a heavy toll. Donors have suspended budgetary
support, while awaiting a clear road map toward free elections. It is estimated that GDP
declined by 1.5 percent in 2012, while average annual inflation reached 5.3 percent by
December 2012 on the back of food price increases. A large balance-of-payments deficit
emerged, reflecting higher food imports and the reduction in donor support.
The fiscal position came under pressure in 2012. The government tightened spending to partly
offset the revenue losses. Cuts were made in public investment and in implicit subsidies on
petroleum products and cooking gas. As a result, the basic budget deficit (revenue and budget
grants minus domestically financed spending) was contained at 1 percent of GDP. Despite
these efforts, and heavy reliance on net domestic bank financing, Mali ran up arrears on
external debt service in the amount of 0.5 percent of GDP.
The financial soundness of the banking sector has weakened in the worsening economic
environment. Overall, banks remain well capitalized, but the situation is uneven, and
nonperforming loans are on the rise. In the north, banks sustained financial and property
damage estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to prudent policies
despite severe economic and political shocks. Taking note of the challenging internal and
external environment for the period ahead, Directors agreed that a new Fund-supported
program under the Rapid Credit Facility will help Mali safeguard macroeconomic stability and
re-engage with donors. Directors also agreed that, over the medium-term, polices should focus
on strengthening the prospects for higher growth and further poverty reduction.
Directors considered that a tight fiscal stance is necessary in the near term. They noted that,
while the 2013 budget is consistent with this objective, prudence suggests freezing part of the
budgeted capital spending until donor support resumes. More broadly, Directors encouraged
the authorities to prioritize expenditures and keep them in line with available resources, while
protecting social spending. They also endorsed the plan to increase revenues through tax
reforms in a variety of areas and the envisaged adjustment in oil and electricity prices. In this
regard, Directors stressed that careful communication and targeted measures to protect the
poor will be essential to gain public support.
While acknowledging the difficult financing constraints facing Mali, Directors regretted the
accumulation of external arrears and encouraged the authorities to clear them as soon as
possible. Welcoming Mali’s intention to meet all current debt service obligations, Directors
agreed that strengthening public financial management, especially expenditure management,
and implementing WAEMU directives will support arrear resolution and prevent their recurrence.
Directors underscored that, as the political situation stabilizes, economic policies should focus
on fostering strong sustainable growth and further reducing poverty. Priority should be given to
strengthening the financial sector, addressing the underlying weaknesses arising from non
performing loans and loan concentration in the banks’ portfolios. Improving the business climate
and removing structural and institutional bottlenecks will play an important role in boosting
competitiveness and diversifying the economy. More investment in roads, irrigation, and
education is needed to fully develop Mali’s agricultural potential. A few Directors also pointed to
the possible benefits from a reduction in production subsidies in some cotton-producing
countries.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$18.4 Million Disbursement Under the Rapid Credit
Facility for Mali
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 12 million (about US$18.4 million) for Mali
under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) to support the authorities with policy advice and
financial support to maintain macroeconomic stability and growth during the next twelve
months, as part of a broad-based support by Mali's development partners. The RCF provides
rapid concessional financial assistance with limited conditionality to low-income countries
facing an urgent balance of payments need.
The Executive Board also noted the authorities’ cancellation of the previous arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), which was approved in 2011 for the equivalent of
SDR 30 million (then about US$46.3 million; see Press Release No. 11/487), which had
been designed to cover 2012-14, but was derailed by the March 2012 coup d’état and its
aftermath.
In November 2012, an IMF mission reached understandings ad referendum on the
components of an economic program that could be supported by the Rapid Credit Facility
(See Press Release No.12/437). The RCF will also pave the way for renewed donor support
following the events of early 2012.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Mali’s economy is traversing a particularly difficult period as a result of the 2011 drought,
insurgent attacks in the north of the country and political instability in the wake of the
military coup in March 2012. Economic activity contracted by 1.5 percent in 2012, inflation
was pushed up by escalating food prices, and a balance of payments deficit has emerged.
Fiscal stress intensified as a result of weakening tax revenues, the suspension of donor
budget support, and upward pressure on social and military spending. The government

2

responded with fiscal austerity. The tight liquidity situation has led to the accumulation of
arrears to external creditors in the amount of 0.5 percent of GDP.
“The authorities’ 2013 program appropriately reflects near-term priorities. It aims to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability by keeping spending in line with available revenues
and avoiding the emergence of new arrears.
“Steadfast implementation of tax policy, tax administration, cash flow management, and
energy policy reforms will be essential to maintain macroeconomic stability. The ambitious
tax revenue targets in 2013 will need to come from an increase in taxes on oil products and
progress in tax administration through systematic cross-checking of information by the tax,
customs, and procurement administrations. Prudent expenditure execution and tight cash
management will be needed to meet the deficit target and avoid the accumulation of arrears.
While electricity tariff adjustments are needed to bring the sector back to a sustainable path,
a clear reform, a public communication strategy, and targeted measures to protect the poor
will be essential to gain the population’s acceptance.
“The disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility is designed to help Mali deal with urgent
balance of payments need and catalyze financial support from Mali’s international partners,
which is critical to Mali’s economic recovery.”

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Mali
January 28, 2013
On behalf of the Malian authorities, I would like to thank the Executive Board,
Management and staff for the long-standing support of the Fund to Mali, including during
periods of severe difficulties. My Malian authorities view the current episode of adversity
as another moment when the Fund can play a critical role in restoring macroeconomic
stability and bringing the country back to a path of stronger growth and poverty
reduction. Already, the international community has extended its support to Mali in
efforts to combat terrorism, restore the country’s territorial integrity, and alleviate the
suffering of the populations severely affected by the situation in Northern Mali, which
has considerable spillover effects to the whole country and potentially large regional
implications. In this regard, my Malian authorities are particularly thankful to all
countries that are contributing to these efforts in restoring stability.
My Malian authorities are appreciative of the valuable technical and policy advice
received from the Fund in the context of the 2012 Article IV consultation and discussions
for possible support under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). The economic program
supported by the current ECF, which was approved in December 2011 started well but
was derailed since March 2012 by various shocks which took a heavy toll on the Malian
economy. The authorities have decided therefore to end the current ECF program which
has lost ground and to request assistance under the RCF. The new arrangement is
expected to finance part of the balance-of-payments deficit anticipated for the period
2012-2013, and catalyze budget support from other donors. Despite the challenges, my
authorities are committed to implement policies anchored on fiscal policy designed to
preserve macroeconomic stability and consolidate key improvements in public financial
management.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CURRENT ECF
ARRANGEMENT
Economic Developments in 2012
In 2012, the Malian economy was subject to various shocks, notably: (i) the unfavorable
agricultural campaign in 2011 and the resulting food crisis which affected an estimated
3.6 million people; (ii) the insecurity and humanitarian crisis in the northern regions of
the country following the attacks perpetrated by rebels and terrorist groups. An estimated
420,000 people fled the country to find refuge in neighboring countries; (iii) episodes of
political and social unrest since March 2012, which lasted several months before a
transitional government of national unity was formed with the priority to win back the
occupied regions with the help of the international community, and organize presidential
and legislative elections.

While GDP growth was expected to reach 5.6 percent in 2012 during the preparation of
the State budget, it is now believed that GDP will contract by 1.5 percent as a result of
the slowdown of activities in the secondary sector–with the exception of gold and cotton
production--as well as the tertiary sector. The suspension of aid by donors severely
impacted construction, hotels, and tourism activities. Overall, GDP contraction was
limited by abundant and well spread rainfalls which boosted agricultural output by 8
percent. Annual average inflation reached 5.6 percent by end-October 2012—double of
the target pursued in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)–notably as a result of the bad harvest in 2011.
The overall deficit of the balance of payments is expected to be elevated in 2012. While
the current account deficit should improve as a result of gold and cotton exports, the
improvement is not expected to compensate for the deterioration of the capital and
financial accounts resulting from the sharp drop in foreign aid.
At end-September 2012, money supply grew by 11 percent on an annual basis, due to the
use by the government of its deposits to finance the budget deficit. Banks which suffered
damages and losses closed their subsidiaries in the northern part of the country following
attacks and lootings. However, the stability of the banking sector has not been
significantly affected as of September 2012. All the banks except one were in compliance
with the minimum capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent. Nonperforming loans increased
slightly to 7.5 percent of the total. Loans which were not repaid for more than six months
because of the crisis will be included in the amount of nonperforming loans, in
accordance with prudential regulations.
With regards to fiscal policy, the government’s prompt actions help contain spending at a
level compatible with revenue and available cash flow. Priority was given to the payment
of salaries, pensions, scholarships, military and security expenditures, and to the extent
possible to social expenditures in health, education and social protection. The authorities
also reduced subsidies on energy (petroleum products and cooking gas). Despite the
shortfall in fiscal revenue and the suspension of foreign aid, the government managed to
contain the fiscal deficit at 0.7 percent of GDP, as a result of drastic cuts in domesticallyfinanced investment expenditures and an accumulation of arrears on foreign debt
servicing. However, the government has contacted all the foreign creditors with whom it
accumulated arrears to inform them of the situation and the financial difficulties that the
country is facing, and that it intends to meet its obligations as soon as it can. The
authorities have also successfully contacted WAEMU banks to request the refinancing on
the same terms of the treasury bills and bonds that will mature in 2012.
Performance under the ECF
The economic program supported by the ECF started on sound footing before losing
ground since March 2012 due to a series of adverse shocks described above. In December
2011, all performance criteria, except one, were met thanks to strong performance in
terms of revenue collection and expenditure control. The only exception was the zero
ceiling on the non-accumulation of external public payments arrears. However, since

March 2012, some of the objectives of the program supported by the ECF could not be
reached because of the effects of the shocks, notably a deterioration of the fiscal
performance, the destruction of equipment at the customs administration, the contraction
of economic activity, and the suspension of budget support grants by donors.
Notwithstanding these challenging events, the authorities pressed on the implementation
of structural measures, particularly during the second half of the year. Indeed, albeit with
some delays, the authorities managed to meet all the structural benchmarks for that
period.
POLICIES FOR 2013 UNDER THE RCF
While awaiting the resumption of budget support grants by donors, the authorities will
continue to implement a prudent fiscal policy aimed at containing expenditures below
available revenue and deposits in the banking sector, in order to avoid new arrears on
domestic and foreign debts. In that context, the 2013 budget submitted by the government
to the National Assembly in October 2012 does not envisage any budget support for
2013. However, if budget support were to materialize, the authorities will submit an
amended budget to the National Assembly. The Government will continue to give
priority to spending in education, health and social protection in compliance with the
strategic framework for growth and poverty reduction (CSCRP) for the period 2012-2017
which was adopted in December 2011.
The authorities will also continue to improve the management and transparency of public
finances and address the weaknesses identified in the public expenditures and financial
accountability (PEFA) review of 2011, notably revenue collection, domestic debt
management, and public accounting and external control of public finances. In this
regard, the authorities will pursue the implementation of the governmental action plan
aimed at modernizing the management of public finances during the period 2011-2015,
albeit with better targeting of priorities and less resources. In order to increase revenue
performance, the authorities are committed to reforming the tax, customs and government
property administrations and policies. Among the actions planned are the identification
and gradual elimination of tax exemptions, the preparation of a strategy to bring domestic
energy prices in line with the evolution of international prices, and efforts to enhance the
functioning and performance of the value-added tax (VAT) which accounts for about 40
percent of tax revenue.
With regards to the management and transparency of public expenditures, the
Government will transcribe in the Malian legislation and regulations, the WAEMU
directives related to transparency, public accounting, budgetary nomenclature and flow of
fund table for the public administration. The draft laws and regulations have already been
submitted to the WAEMU Commission for review. The authorities will also continue
their efforts towards establishing the single Treasury account--which were interrupted by
the events of March 2012--in line with the study completed in September 2011. To date,
the authorities have already transferred the accounts of public entities in seven banks
(with the exception of project accounts) to the Central Bank of Western African States
(BCEAO). With external assistance, the authorities will pursue the implementation of

the national strategy for internal control of public finances for the period 2011-15
adopted in 2011. In this respect, the staffing of the accounting section of the Supreme
Court will be increased and this accounting body will be transformed into a Government
Accounting Office as soon as possible, in accordance with the WAEMU directives.
The authorities continue to attach high importance to the preservation of debt
sustainability. Despite the government’s fiscal austerity efforts, the current difficult
economic conditions have led to the accumulation of about $58 million of external
arrears at end-2012. The authorities have sent letters to Mali’s creditors to explain the
current constraints on public finances and to reaffirm their commitment to clear these
arrears as soon as possible.
CONCLUSION
In order to restore and preserve macroeconomic stability, my Malian authorities are
requesting Fund support under the RCF. The RCF is critical to providing my authorities
with the means to sustain their adjustment efforts in a context of tremendous and
exceptional economic and security challenges, and to catalyze other donors’ budget
support.
Mali’s past performance under Fund programs has been generally satisfactory, and my
authorities are committed to continue to implement policies that would not aggravate the
current economic problems, to restore macro-stability and to renew with their track
record of good economic performance. I would therefore appreciate Directors’ favorable
consideration of my authorities’ request for Fund support under the RCF.
