BULGARIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representative for the 2008 Consultation with Bulgaria
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde and Lorenzo Giorgianni
February 13, 2009

This report is based on discussions held in Sofia during December 5-14, 2008. The
mission team comprised Mr. Bas B. Bakker (head), Mr.Tonny Lybek, Ms. Jianping
Zhou (EUR), Mr. Paolo Dudine (SPR), and Mr. Gabriel Goddard (World Bank). The
mission was assisted by the Senior Resident Representative, Mr. Juan-José FernándezAnsola. Mr. Viktor Yotzov (OED) also joined the discussions. The mission met with
Prime Minister Stanishev, Minister of Finance Oresharski, Central Bank Governor
Iskrov, other senior officials, as well as representatives of Parliament, financial and
business sectors, unions, and the media.
Political Background: The current government is a coalition of Bulgarian Socialist
Party, the National Movement for Stability and Progress (the former king Simeon SaxeCoburg's party), and the Movement for Rights and Freedom. Parliamentary elections
will take place in June-August 2009. The ruling parties' popularity has been weakened
by recent scandals related to the use of EU funds. The major opposition party, the
centre-right Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (CEDB) led by the mayor
of Sofia, Mr. Borisov, currently leads the opinion polls, promising to crack down much
harder on organized crime and corruption. Frictions among political parties could pose
risks to needed economic actions.
Exchange Rate Regime: Since July 1, 1997, the Bulgarian National Bank has operated
a currency board arrangement, pegged to the euro at the rate of lev 1.95583 per € 1.
Bulgaria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2–4, and maintains and
exchange system free of restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transfers.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
In 2008, Bulgaria’s economy continued to perform well, helped by strong
policies. GDP growth is likely to have reached 6 percent—one of the highest growth rates in
Europe. Fiscal policy continued to be prudent, with another surplus of 3 percent of GDP.
Banking sector supervision and regulation remained strong, reacting pro-actively to the
global financial turmoil.
2.
At the same time, external and internal imbalances widened further—at least
until recently. Fueled by large private capital inflows, the current account deficit widened to
25 percent of GDP. The labor market overheated, with wage growth exceeding 20 percent,
and annual inflation reached 12 percent—although it has come down in recent months.
3.
The global financial turmoil has begun to affect Bulgaria, and near-term
prospects for Bulgaria could be more difficult than they have been in a long time.
Capital inflows are likely to slow, and exports are likely to be hurt by the global slowdown.
The current staff’s forecast is that GDP growth will slow to 1 percent in 2009, but there are
significant risks that the slowdown could be even sharper.
4.
With a high current account deficit, high external private sector debt, and large
foreign currency exposures, a key task for policies is to maintain confidence in the
currency board and in the financial system. The two are linked: a strong and resilient
financial system is needed to sustain the currency board; while the stability of the
increasingly Euroized banking system hinges critically on maintaining the CBA. Fortunately,
Bulgaria’s cautious policies of recent years have helped generate substantial buffers in the
public sector: international reserves are high, public debt is low, and the government has built
up considerable reserves in the fiscal reserve account.
5.
Fiscal policy should aim at maintaining comfortable surpluses. This is not only
because surpluses have been a support pillar for the currency board, but also to preserve
balances in the fiscal reserve account—an important shield if problems were to emerge,
including in the financial system.
6.
In this context, the government’s de facto fiscal target of a 2 percent fiscal
surplus in 2009 is appropriate. While the government officially still targets a fiscal surplus
of 3 percent of GDP, in practice it realizes that the 4.7 percent GDP growth on which the
budget was based is no longer realistic, and has decided to offset part of the revenue shortfall
by keeping expenditure 10 percent below the budgeted amount (the “10 percent rule”). If, as
the government expects, GDP expands by around 2 percent, this would result in a surplus of
2 percent of GDP.

5
7.
With GDP growth likely to fall short of 2 percent, additional expenditure cuts
will be necessary to achieve the 2 percent surplus. If, as staff currently expects, GDP
growth slows to 1 percent, the shortfall would amount to around 0.6 percent of GDP. Such
expenditure cuts should be feasible, as even with the 10 percent rule the 2009 budget is by no
means tight.
8.
A significant slowing of expenditure growth will also be necessary in later years.
In previous years, domestic demand has grown much faster than GDP, resulting in a surge of
indirect tax revenues, but going forward, with the adjustment in the current account, domestic
demand and tax revenues will grow by less than GDP. With less room for expenditure
increases, spending will need to be prioritized. While the 10 percent rule was a pragmatic
solution to reduce expenditure, across-the-board cuts are not a desirable tool in the longer
run.
9.
The financial system is well capitalized and has so far been very profitable, but
now faces a more difficult time. Profitability is likely to decline, as foreign funding has
become scarce, strong competition for domestic deposits has raised funding costs, and
lending growth is expected to slow. At the same time, the reliance of banks on foreign
funding for new lending makes them vulnerable to the current disruption in international
financial markets. Nevertheless, banks are well-positioned for a slowdown, and have strong
capital and liquidity buffers.
10.
The BNB’s framework for financial sector supervision and regulation has been
effective in containing risks in the banking system, but with a slowdown of the economy
the operation of these arrangements is likely to be tested. The BNB has reviewed its
procedures and is—in line with other EU supervisors—preparing for any contingency. It is
collaborating closely with pertinent home country supervisors and it is further enhancing its
capacity to conduct stress tests, in line with recommendations of the recent IMF-World Bank
FSAP Update. These preparations are welcome, especially in light of the current challenging
economic and financial environment.
11.
The high growth rate of wages threatens external competitiveness. While wages
are low compared to Western Europe and can be expected to catch up over time, this will
need to be accompanied by similar productivity increases. The current pace of wage growth is
far too rapid for Bulgaria’s relatively small productivity growth differential with Western
Europe, and needs to slow down. It is a difficult question whether the current level of
competitiveness is a cause for concern, but the change in competitiveness certainly is.
12.
Moderation in unit labor cost increases is essential given that resources will need
to be shifted to the tradable sector. As growth in the non-tradable sector slows, GDP
growth can only be kept strong if the tradable sector takes over the slack. Without such a
shift, future growth could remain very low, which eventually could put strains on the

6
currency board arrangement. Therefore, both export-oriented and import-competing branches
need to remain sufficiently competitive.
13.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

7
II. INTRODUCTION
14.
In recent years, a surge in capital inflows has led to increasing external and
internal imbalances. The capital inflows, which were driven by expectations of rapid
convergence with the EU, led to a boom in domestic demand. This resulted in a high current
account deficit, an overheating labor market, deteriorating competitiveness and large balance
sheet vulnerabilities (Section III).
15.
The interaction of these imbalances with the global financial turmoil was at the
core of the 2008 Article IV discussions. With global deleveraging and increased risk
aversion, the large capital inflows to Bulgaria are likely to abate. The global financial market
turmoil has already started to affect Bulgaria and GDP growth is likely to slow considerably
(Section IV). The policy discussions focused on how to react to this slowdown. How can the
risks of financial instability be reduced? What is the appropriate fiscal response to the
turmoil? How can the real economy adjust to the external environment in a way that is
consistent with maintaining the currency board (Section V)?

Box 1. Bulgaria’s Reactions to Past IMF Advice
Bulgaria and the IMF have had an excellent working relationship. Policies have been generally consistent
with IMF recommendations, as reflected in the successful completion of a series of Stand-By
Arrangements. In recent years, the government has maintained prudent fiscal policy and built up large
fiscal reserves, thus providing strong support to the currency board and a much needed policy advantage
against the current global financial turbulences. However, public sector wage policies were lenient in last
two years, and structural reforms hardly progressed, reflecting a lack of political consensus.
At the time of the 2007 Article IV Consultations, Executive Directors praised Bulgaria for its strong
economic performance and strong policies, but expressed concern about rising imbalances. Directors
emphasized that the current account deficit was unsustainable and would need to be reduced
significantly over the medium term in order to contain external vulnerabilities. They also noted that,
although competitiveness appeared not to have been affected, domestic price pressures were rising, in
large part because of region-wide increases in food and energy prices, but also because of accelerating
wage increases as the labor market tightened.

Since 2004, when agreement was reached
on EU accession, Bulgaria has experienced a
surge in capital inflows and a credit boom
(Figures 1 and 2). Inflows were driven by
expectations of rapid convergence with the EU, and
were further boosted by the confidence-enhancing
effect of the currency board and strong fiscal
policy. By 2008, net inflows had increased to about
27 percent of GDP—one of the highest among
EMCs (Figure 3). Boosted by capital inflows, credit
to the private sector rose rapidly, and the credit-toGDP ratio climbed from 36 percent in 2004 to
63 percent in 2007.

•

As unemployment dropped and the labor market tightened, wage growth accelerated
to a peak of 25 percent in June 2008. The overheating of the economy, together with
rising food and oil prices, resulted in a surge of inflation, which peaked at
14.7 percent in June 2008. More recently, as oil prices collapsed, food price increases
slowed, and the global economy weakened, inflation declined, to 7.2 percent in
December.

Policies to address these imbalances had only limited success. Fiscal policy
targeted large and increasing fiscal surpluses, but these surpluses were offset by declining
private net savings. Administrative measures to restrain credit growth moderated credit
growth in the short-term, but were soon circumvented by firms’ direct borrowing from abroad
and had undesirable effects on financial intermediation.

At the same time, export
performance has deteriorated. Between 2000
and 2006, the export to GDP ratio increased
faster than in EMCs on average, but
between 2006 and 2008, performance was worse
than in most other EMCs, as the export ratio
declined somewhat.

Capital inflows have been much larger than the current account deficit—suggesting that they have driven the
current account deficit rather than the other way around.

Bulgaria: Saving and Investment
(Percent of GDP)

22.
From a saving-investment perspective,
the widening of the current account deficit is
primarily the reflection of the investment
boom. As the investment to GDP ratio increased
sharply, the saving to GDP ratio remained flat.
The high level of the current account deficit not
only reflects high investment but also low
saving—not only compared to emerging market
countries outside the region, but also compared to
other new member states.2

According to the National Accounts, the low level of private saving is the result of highly negative household
saving (-16.9 percent of GDP in 2006), while corporate saving is more healthy (21.3 percent of GDP). However,
it is likely that the distribution between households and corporates is affected by an underreporting of wages
(according to the National Accounts, the share of wages is only 35 percent of GDP) which would result in an
underestimation of household saving and an overestimation of corporate saving.

GDP growth has to a large extent been driven by the non-tradable sectors—in
particular financial services, real estate and construction.3 Capital inflows have in large part
gone to the non-tradable sector, which may have been further stimulated by the widening
profitability gap between the non-tradable and the tradable sector. Between late 2006 and
Q3 2008, the gross operating surplus of manufacturing has declined from 50 to 38 percent,
while the gross operating surplus in the non-tradable sectors has shown little change.

Construction and real estate business contributed more than half of gross valued added (GVA) growth between
2004 and 2008H1, raising its share in GVA from 20.7 percent to 24.5 percent. During the same period, average
housing prices increased by more than 150 percent, with prices in Sofia and resort areas rising even faster.

If capital inflows drop and the credit and investment boom ends, it is likely that
the current account deficit will decline—but there will also be a sharp drop in growth.
With lower capital inflows and an end to the credit boom, the contribution to growth of
construction, financial intermediation, real estate and businesses services will likely drop
sharply. Experience in other countries suggests that it may well become negative.

C. Balance Sheet and Financing Vulnerabilities are Large
25.

Balance sheet vulnerabilities have become large.
•

•

•

External debt has increased to 111 percent of GDP. Debt is mostly owed by the
private sector; public sector debt has declined rapidly to only 13 percent of GDP
(Table 1).4
The net international investment position has deteriorated to minus 97 percent of
GDP (Table 2). While the central bank and commercial banks have large foreign
assets (56 percent of GDP), there are also large non-debt liabilities (equity capital and
reinvested FDI earnings)
Foreign currency mismatches are very large. The corporate sector has high direct
foreign currency exposure; the banking sector has large indirect foreign currency
exposure because of high foreign currency lending. The large foreign currency
mismatches have in large part been the result of the belief that euro-denominated
loans carry no currency risk, as the currency board would be eventually be replaced by
the euro.

26.
The non-financial corporate sector is
particularly exposed. It has high debt, high foreign
currency exposure, and large short-term debt (Tables 1 and
4).
27.
The household sector is relatively less exposed.
Household debt is 37 percent of GDP, a third of which is
for mortgages (Table 4). Foreign currency loans from
banks are only 8 percent of GDP.

28.
These vulnerabilities could come to the fore if capital inflows dropped sharply.
The gap between private investment and private saving in 2008 was 27 percent of GDP. If
capital flows drop sharply, the private sector will be forced to adjust saving and investment
accordingly, and with new financing drying up, defaults of debtors may increase sharply,
while corporate sector defaults would in turn affect the banks. Indeed, the recent FSAP
update suggest that in a scenario with significant macro-economic stress, NPLs could
increase sharply, and the banking sector could be become undercapitalized.5
4
5

Most of the intercompany loans in Table 1 are to banks.

The FSAP update discusses a scenario with a sudden stop in capital inflows and a 30 percent drop in real estate
prices. In this scenario, the NPL ratio would increase by about 12 percentage points, and the Capital Adequacy
Ratio would decline from 14½ to 2½ percent.

November and December has eased the tightness
in the money market.8 The overnight money
market rate (SOFIBOR) has come down from a peak of 6.4 percent in October to 4.6 percent
at end December. However, the reduction in required reserves has also contributed to a
reduction of international reserves, which have declined from €14.2 billion at end October to
€12.7 billion at end December, falling another 600 million in the first ten days of January.

Many banks have reduced loan-to-value ratios to 50–65 percent and are using more conservative appraisals.

On October 21, 2008, the BNB allowed 50 percent of commercial banks’ cash on hand to be recognized as
reserve assets and eased commercial banks’ access to reserves with the BNB. Effective December 1 the
minimum required reserves on all attracted funds of the banks were reduced from 12 percent to 10 percent; and
effective January 1, 2009, the minimum required reserves on funds attracted by the banks from abroad were
decreased from 10 percent to 5 percent, while government deposits from state and local and government will no
longer be subject to reserve requirements.

33.
Reported indicators suggest that banks are generally sound. In December, the
capital adequacy ratio was 14.9 percent compared to the 12.0 percent mandatory ratio, which
exceeds the 8.0 percent EU minimum requirement. The NPL ratio was around 2.4 percent.
34.
However, these indicators are backward-looking: like other countries in the
region, Bulgaria has experienced tremendous credit growth, and

Banks are also exposed to currency induced credit
risks, especially in the non-tradable sector. While, as discussed
in the FSSA, the euroization of assets and liabilities (about half of
bank assets and liabilities are denominated in euros) partly reflects
the convergence process and parent bank funding, it leaves the
system exposed to currency induced credit risk, and suggests that
the solvency of the banking system critically hinges on
maintaining the currency board.

Since October, the business climate indicator for all economic sectors has declined rapidly.
Orders for non-residential construction have declined sharply, industrial production in
December was 8.4 percent lower than a year ago, and exports were15 percent lower, mainly
due to a slump in the exports of manufacturing good (-20.6 percent). Reflecting weakening
domestic demand, imports fell by 17.4 percent year/year, while unemployment rate rose to
6.3 percent in December, reversing the declining trend during the last few years. Furthermore,
the share of bad and restructured household loans has begun to increase, from 2.7 percent at
end December 2007 to 3.0 percent in November 2008.

However, sound provision policies have ensured early provision of NPLs.

B. Outlook for 2009 and Risks
37.
The surge in capital inflows is expected to abate in 2009. The global financial
turmoil is likely to reduce capital flows to Central and Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria.
With increasing global risk aversion, FDI would decline, while local subsidiaries would no
longer receive large capital transfers from their parent banks to fund credit growth.
38.
At the same time, shrinking foreign demand and declining commodity prices
might lead to a drop in Bulgarian exports and a decline in tourism. Some of this is
already visible in Bulgaria, as export industries have been hit hard in recent months,
including by a sharp drop in metal prices.
39.
Staff now expects GDP growth to slow to 1 percent in 2009—down from
2 percent projected at the time of the mission, and 6 percent in 2008. The reduction in
growth is in large part driven by the sharp decline in net capital inflows, from 27 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009. The drop in foreign-financed bank credit and the decline
in FDI would lead to a contraction in domestic demand by almost 3 percent. GDP growth will
remain weak in 2010, and even in later years is likely to stay below the rates experienced
during the boom years, as capital inflows are unlikely to recover to previous boom-levels.
Inflation is projected to decline sharply, from 12 percent in 2008, to 4.7 percent in 2009,
helped also by the sharp decline in global commodity prices.

These projections are subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty and there are
significant risks that growth will slow even more. A deeper-than-expected recession in
Bulgaria's trading partners and the sharp fall in regional floating currencies could lead to a
faster drop in exports. Net capital inflows could drop by more than expected, and financial
crises in other countries could spill over to Bulgaria. A recession in the construction sector
and a fall in real estate prices could lead to a sharp increase of loan defaults and loss given
default rates, which would feed back to bank weakness and a further contraction in the supply
of credit. In an alternative, illustrative, scenario, in which net capital inflows slow to around
1 percent of GDP, GDP could decline by 3 percent (Box 3).

41.
During the discussions in mid-December, official forecasters were more
optimistic about capital inflows and GDP growth. They argued that the large capital
inflows had been the result of Bulgaria being an attractive investment destination, and this
attractiveness had not been diminished by the global turmoil. With investment holding up,
GDP growth would slow less than projected by the staff. Thus, the BNB’s mid December
baseline forecast projected GDP growth of 4.4 percent in 2009—only slightly lower than the
mid-September baseline projection of the Agency for Economic Analysis and Forecasting
(AEA) of 4.7 percent.
42.
Policy makers, however, were more cautious, and recognizing that there were
significant risks that growth would be less than expected, were increasingly basing their
policies on more pessimistic scenarios. The AEA had developed a worse case scenario, in
which GDP grew by 2.1 percent only, and this scenario rather the baseline was used to set
fiscal policy (see section VC). 10
Box 2. Alternative Scenario
In a scenario in which net capital inflows dropped to near zero in 2009, and stayed weaker thereafter, the
economic downturn would be much deeper. Domestic demand, and in particular investment would shrink
sharply, and while the impact on growth would partly be offset by an improvement of the current account,
overall the economy could shrink by 3 percent in 2009 and another 1 percent in 2010.
Such a scenario would be challenging for policy makers, and would require strong corrective measures.
The decline in reserves would be more pronounced, while—in the absence of corrective measures—the
fiscal surplus would turn into a deficit of around 2½ percent of GDP in 2009, rising further thereafter.

28
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The end of the capital-inflow driven boom poses considerable policy challenges. The most
immediate challenge is ensuring that a sharp drop in capital inflows does not trigger a
confidence crisis, which would expose the considerable private sector balance sheet
vulnerabilities. The next challenge is ensuring that the economy is flexible enough to adjust
to the drop in growth in the non-tradable sector by shifting resources to the tradable sector.
Without such a shift, future growth could remain very low, which eventually could put strains
on the currency board arrangement.
43.
In many ways, Bulgaria starts the current slowdown from a strong position. The
public finances are in good shape, with one of the highest fiscal surpluses in Europe. In
addition, the balance sheets of the central bank and the government are strong, with large
foreign reserves and substantial buffers

44.
The mission and the authorities
agreed that given the large private sector
vulnerabilities, a key task for policies is to
maintain confidence in the currency board
and in the financial system. The two are
intrinsically linked: a strong and resilient
financial system is needed to sustain the
currency board; while the stability of the
increasingly Euroized banking system hinges
critically on maintaining the CBA.

a new pattern of growth. Aside from
maintaining financial sector stability (section A), a key instrument is keeping comfortably
large fiscal surpluses (Section B). This is not only because surpluses have been a support
pillar for the currency board, but also because balances in the fiscal reserve account will be an
important shield if problems were to emerge, including in the financial system.11 It will also
be important that the economy adjusts well to a decline in capital inflows, and that the
tradable sector will take over as the growth engine (section C).

11

An amendment in the budget law, that has widened the pool of eligible collateral, has facilitated using the
fiscal reserve for lender of last resort operations.

29
A. Financial Sector Stability
46.
The BNB has taken several steps to prevent a crisis by improving depositors’
confidence, easing liquidity pressures, and increasing capital cushions.
•

Deposit insurance coverage has been increased, in line with EU commitments. In
mid-November coverage was increased12 from €20,000 to €50,000; and in 2009, it
will be increased further to €100,000 per depositor per bank. In contrast to some other
EU countries, the authorities did not see a need to adopt blanket guarantees. The
authorities will also adopt other envisaged amendments to the EU directive to ensure
prompt payment of insured deposits.13

•

Reserve requirements have been lowered. While there is room for further easing
(reserve requirements are far above the euro area requirement of 2 percent), the
authorities are well aware that an easing of reserve requirements also tends to reduce
international reserves.

•

The BNB has taken further steps to increase banks’ capital and liquidity
cushions. It has persuaded most bank owners not to pay dividends, but instead
add 2008 profits to capital. It has also received comfort letters from parent banks to
ensure that they provide adequate liquidity and capital.

•

Reporting by leasing companies owned by non-bank and financial companies to
the credit register has been improved, which facilitates banks’ credit risk analysis.

47.
The authorities have taken steps to improve their ability to manage a potential
crisis:
•

The BNB has intensified its monitoring, with special focus on liquidity and credit
risks, and taken steps to further strengthen its stress testing capabilities, in line with
recommendations of the recent FSAP Update.

•

The BNB has reviewed its current crisis management framework. Both the BNB and
the Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) have conducted targeted inspections to
ensure that supervised entities have contingency plans in place.

12
13

Before the increase, 99.1 percent of depositors were covered, but only 39.9 percent of deposits.

The mission voiced concern that it was not well known that “preferential deposits” (deposits with particularly
high interest rates) were not covered by the deposit insurance fund. If after a bank failure depositors found out
that their deposits had not been covered by the deposit insurance fund, this could trigger a loss of confidence in
the system.

30
•

The Domestic Standing Group for Financial Stability, which was established in
January 2008 as a sub committee for the Financial Stability Advisory Council, has
been working on contingency plans.14

48.
The mission discussed Lender of Last Resort facilities.15 The BNB has reviewed its
processes to ensure fast action, but its scope to function as lender of last resort is constrained
by the CBA—as of mid-January, the excess coverage of the CBA amounted to about
€1.6 billion (5 percent of GDP). The government could use its fiscal reserves of around
18 percent of GDP to function as the de facto lender of last resort. The legal framework and
procedures have been amended to allow prompt action. The authorities acknowledged that in
the current environment, even the failure of a small bank could quickly lead to contagion, but
they also noted that different approaches would be considered, including closing a bank while
giving due consideration to all depositors.
49.
The authorities generally felt comfortable with the bank resolution framework.16
The 1997 banking crisis, when several banks were closed, triggered major changes in the
bank resolution framework. Furthermore, several current decision makers had crisis
management experience from this period. The authorities agreed that in the event government
capital injections were necessary, it would be important to ensure that existing shareholders
would carry the losses.
B. Fiscal Policy
50.
In recent years, Bulgaria has run large fiscal surpluses. Between 2005 and 2008,
the fiscal surplus averaged 3 percent of GDP. Bulgaria targeted large surpluses to bolster
confidence in the currency board, and to contain the current account deficit in the context of a
large private saving-investment gap. As a result of these surpluses, the gross public debt to
GDP ratio fell from 77 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2008; and fiscal reserves increased to
about 12½ percent of GDP in 2008.

14

As in other EU countries, it has been decided to delay further testing these contingency plans and instead use
the scarce resources on closely monitoring with a view to acting promptly.
15

Box 3 in the FSSA discusses emergency liquidity assistance.

16

Discussed in the FSSA and an accompanying technical note.

31

51.
Yet fiscal policy was not as tight as suggested by these headline numbers.
Nominal expenditure grew by 15 percent annually, and tax rates on corporate and personal
income were cut. This was, however, more than offset by a surge in indirect tax revenues, the
result of a domestic demand boom, which increased the absorption gap from 3¾ percent of
GDP in 2005 to 13¾ percent in 2007. Indeed, the augmented structural balance, which takes
into account the effects of both the output and the absorption gap, declined from 1.5 to
0.2 percent of GDP during this period.

1/ Actual fiscal balance adjusted for the automatic effects of both output gap and absorption gap on fiscal position. see IMF Country Report No. 07/390, Chapter III for
details.

52.
Cautious fiscal policy continued in 2008, with another large headline surplus of
3 percent of GDP. As in previous years, aggregate spending remained very tight in the first
three quarters; by September, the surplus had reached 7 percent of annual GDP. In October,
the government stepped up investment spending, increased budget allocations for social
spending,17 and overall government spending in November and December reached
10.8 percent of annual GDP. While the headline fiscal surplus remained one of the largest
among EMCs, the augmented structural balance deteriorated by 1.4 percent of GDP,
reflecting the further widening of the output and the absorption gap
53.
The 2009 budget, which was prepared before the financial turmoil of September,
and based on real GDP growth of 4.7 percent, officially aims at a surplus of 3 percent of
GDP. Based on optimistic tax revenue projections (an increase of 16 percent—higher than
the 15 percent increase in 2008), the budget aimed to increase current expenditure by
16.8 percent compared to the 2008 outcome (19.2 percent compared to the 2008 budget),
almost sixty percent of which would go to an increase of social benefits (in particular

The government also raised the 2008 surplus target to 3½ percent of GDP. Partly as a result of disappointing
revenues in the last few months, the overperformance did not materialize.

32
pensions18) and public sector wages. Capital expenditure would increase by 23 percent, to
partly make up for the expected slowdown in investment, but this increase would largely be
financed by an increase in EU transfers.19
54.
In practice, the government expected a surplus of around 2 percent of GDP, with
spending buffers partially compensating for expected revenue shortfalls. Recognizing
that GDP growth was likely to be well below 4.7 percent, the government has decided to
restrict spending to 90 percent of the budgeted amount. The remaining 10 percent would be
released depending on macroeconomic and budget developments. The authorities felt that
this approach of reducing spending was politically more feasible than revising the budget, as
there was insufficient support for reducing budgeted spending (some members of the
coalition had proposed additional spending measures, particularly to support the real
economy). With GDP growth around 2 percent and expenditure in line with the 90 percent
rule, the budget surplus would likely be around 2 percent of GDP.
55.
The staff warned that even with the spending buffers, the 2009 budget was by no
means tight, and that a sharper slowdown could turn the surplus into a deficit. If the
90 percent is rule is applied, spending will increase by 13 percent—8½ percent higher than
currently projected inflation. While the fiscal surplus was currently high, experience in other
countries suggested that if the absorption boom came to an end, the fiscal balance was likely
to deteriorate significantly.20 Staff’s medium-term fiscal projections suggest that
between 2008 and 2012, the tax revenue to GDP ratio could fall by 1½ percentage points,
which would require a commensurate decline in the expenditure to GDP ratio.
56.
Since the mission, it has become increasingly likely that GDP growth will fall
short of 2 percent, and that additional expenditure cuts may be necessary to achieve the
2 percent surplus. If, as staff currently expects, GDP growth slows to 1 percent, the shortfall
would amount to around 0.6 percentage points.
57.
The authorities agreed on the importance of maintaining sizeable fiscal
surpluses. They explained that, as in previous years, expenditure was backloaded, leaving
18

In April 2009, pensions will be increased by 10 percent. The increase will be implemented by counting each
service year as 1.1 years, which will increase the replacement ratio from 43 percent to 48-49 percent. In
addition, the minimum guaranteed pension is set to increase by 10 percent to 120 BGN. In July, pensions will be
increased by another 9.7 percent.
19

The 2009 budget includes EU grants of 3 billion leva (4.4 percent of GDP), 1.1 billion higher than the 2008
budget, and 1.9 billion more than the amount actually absorbed in 2008. The authorities explained that shortfalls
in EU transfers would result in lower capital spending, and thus would not affect the fiscal balance.
20

The augmented structural fiscal balance showed a small deficit, suggesting that if the output and absorption
gap closed, and automatic stabilizers were allowed to work fully, the current surplus could turn into a small
deficit.

33
room for further expenditure cuts if the surplus came in below expectations. They were not
only skeptical on the usefulness of discretionary fiscal stimulus, but even on the usefulness
of letting automatic stabilizers work, as the impact on growth in a small and open economy
such as Bulgaria was very small; and the negative impact on confidence might well offset the
positive impact on demand.
58.
The mission argued that fiscal and structural reforms needed to be accelerated,
notwithstanding the election cycle. The problems regarding the disbursement of EU funds
underscore the need to further upgrade control systems.21 There have been several changes to
social security contributions and social policy (¶52), and it will be essential to cost these
changes realistically and ensure fiscal neutrality, paying special attention to the impact on
long-term sustainability of the public finances.

In July the European Commission Brussels suspended funding under the EU pre-accession programs after a
strongly critical progress report on corruption and mismanagement of pre-accession funding, which amount to
5.8 million euro. In November, the Commission canceled the funds after Bulgaria had made no progress in
tackling corruption. With respect to SAPARD the European Commission has not reimbursed declared
expenditure, corresponding to the European co-financing part, amounting to 7.7 million euro and European cofinancing of 14.7 million euro. Under ISPA due to suspension the total amount of the funds delayed to be
reimbursed is 11.9 million euro. The sanctions so far do not include the €11 billion of EU funding for
agriculture and regional development that Sofia is set to receive until 2013.

60.
CGER-type calculations based on the difference between the underlying current
account and the current account norm suggest that the real exchange rate is now
overvalued by 7-20 percent (Box 4).22 These calculations have a large degree of uncertainty,
which is due to the difficulty of predicting by how much the large capital inflows will come
down over the medium-term. The sharper the decline, the more domestic demand will fall,
and the more the current account deficit will adjust even without real exchange rate changes.
61.
The authorities did not share the mission’s concern that competitiveness may
have become a problem. They pointed out that Bulgaria’s market share within the EU had
continued to increase. They argued that much of the rapid wage increase had been a
convergence phenomenon, and noted that even after the rapid wage increases in recent years,
the level of price and wages was still the lowest in the European Union (Figure 6).
Competitiveness had been further boosted by the lowering of corporate and income tax rates,
which were now the lowest in Europe.

Last year’s staff report argued that the real exchange rate was in line with fundamentals. Between 2007Q2 and
2008Q3, the REER has appreciated by 12 percent—close to the mid-point of the current overvaluation estimate.

Staff noted that even if the real exchange rate level was not yet a problem, the
recent changes had been very rapid, and warned that wage growth needed to slow.
While the wage level was indeed low by European standards, so was labor productivity, and
rapid wage increases were only sustainable if accompanied by commensurate productivity
increases. The authorities reacted that the labor market was very flexible, and that wage
growth would slow rapidly, when the economy slows.

The authorities thought there were no impediments to investment in the tradable
sector. They argued that an important reason that FDI had gone to the non-tradable sector
was that when FDI to Bulgaria started to pick up, foreign investment in the manufacturing
sector in Central Europe had already reached saturation levels. The car industry, for example,
had already built new car plants in other transition countries. They also argued that the
attractiveness of the non-tradable sector came from large capital gains, and these slowed, the
tradable sector would become more attractive.

37

Box 3. Bulgaria: Exchange Rate Assessment
In staff’s view, much of the increase in the current account deficit since 2002 is temporary, boosted by a private capital
inflows-driven domestic demand boom. Between 2002 and 2007, net private capital inflows increased from 12 to 33 percent
of GDP, raising domestic demand from 108 percent of GDP to 122 percent. If this temporary surge in capital inflows abates, the
current account deficit is likely to decline sharply.
Staff’s estimate of the underlying current account deficit is therefore well below the headline current account deficit.
Correcting for the “absorption gap”—the temporary surge in domestic demand driven by the capital inflow surge/credit boom, as
well as past changes in competitiveness that have not worked through, yields an underlying current account deficit of
12.8 percent of GDP—about half of the headline deficit.
The real exchange rate is likely to be overvalued by 7-20 percent. The underlying saving-investment deficit is about
2.9 percentage points higher than the equilibrium saving-investment balance, suggesting that the real exchange rate is
overvalued by 7.5 percent. According to the external sustainability approach, which calculates by how much the savinginvestment balance needs come down to stabilize the IIP, the real exchange rate is overvalued by 16 percent. If we compare
the current REER level with the average of the past 5 years, the overvaluation is about 20 percent.

Box 4: Bulgaria FSAP Update
A joint IMF-World Bank mission visited Sofia from June 23 to July 4, 2008, to update the findings of the 2002 Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
The financial sector has changed with the entry of foreign (mainly Eurozone) banks, which now dominate the
financial system. Various efforts to contain rapid credit growth resulted in higher intermediation costs and regulatory
arbitrage. Banks increasingly offered financial services through unregulated or less strictly regulated financial
companies (leasing companies, consumer credit companies, etc.). Some banks were booking loans abroad and selling
loans to their parents to be re-packaged. Returns—among the highest in the region—triggered strong competition for
market share. Residents were also increasingly borrowing directly from foreign banks, making Bulgaria more
susceptible to spill-overs from abroad.
Reported indicators suggest that banks are generally sound, but rapid credit growth and increased
dependence on foreign funding have increased the vulnerabilities of the banking sector especially from the
upheaval in global financial markets. The BNB adopted conservative prudential policies: 12 percent capital
adequacy ratio; Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking System are observed to a large degree; high (12 percent)
unremunerated reserve requirements; etc. Capital adequacy ratios range between 14-30 percent, liquidity ratios
22-39 percent, return on equity 18-29 percent, and nonperforming loans 0.2-2.4 percent. About half of banks’ balance
sheets are euro denominated, but positions are largely matched. However, indirect credit risk from unhedged
borrowers is a risk factor. While the system relies on domestic deposits for funding, parent bank funding has been
increasing (loan to deposit ratios range between 50-130 percent). The risks of regional contagion and spillovers are
beginning to crystallize. Banks’ exposure to real estate and construction, through lending as wells as collateral
increased, which could suffer from a drop in real estate prices.
The core banking system remains resilient under most stress test scenarios, but could under come pressure
under a more adverse scenario. Under an adverse macro scenario with a sudden stop in capital inflows and a 30
percent drop in real estate prices, the NPL ratio would increase by about 12 percentage points, and the Capital
Adequacy Ratio would decline from 14½ to 2½ percent
The robustness of the banking critically depends on maintaining the currency board arrangement, given large
currency imbalances of corporations and households (71 percent of corporate loans and 25 percent of household
loans are in euro).
The securities markets, insurance industry, and private pension funds remain relatively small and
underdeveloped despite rapid growth. The legal and regulatory framework is consistent with pertinent EU
Directives, but enforcement could be further strengthened.
Despite significant progress, further reforms on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) are needed on several fronts including implementation of preventive measures, supported by additional
1
supervisory resources.
Key Recommendations
The BNB should: (i) enhance its capacity to stress test, particularly credit and liquidity risks; (ii) draft amendments to
include non-bank borrowers in the credit registry, (iii) enhance and update its assessment tools and methodologies;
(iii) develop contingency plans, but delay the introduction of risk-based premiums by the Deposit Insurance Fund; (iv)
strengthen regional collaboration; and (v) participate in pertinent crisis management exercises (vi) create buffers in the
fiscal space for potential solvency support, in case of systemic problems.
The Financial Supervisory Commission should: (i) strengthen its capacity to enforce securities legislation; (ii) prepare
an effective oversight program of the stock exchange and settlement system; (iii) tighten the definition of related parties
and develop a map of indirect ownership of pension funds; (iv) review the rules related to switching and the automatic
assignation rule for undecided participants in pension funds; (v) increase disclosure of risk adjusted performance of
pension funds; (vi) overhaul of the pay-out design of pension funds; and (vii) change its skill mix to better enforce
insurance legislation during inspections.

Box 5. Structural Reforms and Competitiveness of the Bulgarian Economy

Structural reforms that raise labor productivity and labor participation are needed to speed up convergence of per capita
income with the European Union:
•

Current productivity levels are well below the EU average and that of other new Member States, and productivity
growth is just 3% per year.

•

Labor market performance has improved substantially in the past decade, but labor force participation remains low.
The unemployment rate, which had climbed to 20 percent at the beginning of the decade, is now at record low
levels. But while the labor market has become very tight for highly skilled workers, overall labor force participation
remains low, particularly among youth and older workers.

Recognizing the importance of further increases in employment and labor productivity, Bulgaria has recently introduced
significant education and labor reforms.
•

The government has delegated budgets to schools and now provides a fixed amount per student which has led to
a more efficient utilization of funds and which lays the ground for increases in the quality of education. Bulgaria has
also launched external student assessments, both national and international, to benchmark and track progress of
student performance. Going forward, education reforms need to be completed and consolidated in a new
Education Act foreseen for 2009, and should be expanded to include vocational education and training and higher
education.

•

In the labor market, reductions in the social insurance burden, and new employment policies focused on activating
previously inactive workers (in particular the low-skilled, youth and older workers), should contribute to increases in
labor force participation and employment.

The government has also taken measures to maintain fiscal sustainability of the health sector—improving the
pharmaceutical policy, introducing an integrated information system for the National Health Insurance Fund, and raising the
health contribution rate to 8 percent from 6 percent until 2008. However, further steps are needed to sustainably change the
underlying structure of spending from hospitals to primary health care. A continued review of the financing mechanism in the
health sector is needed to make the system financially sustainable and lay the ground for improving its quality and
restructuring the health facilities network.
Bulgaria has also made considerable progress in reducing the burden of regulation in recent years, ranking among the top
10 reformers in the World Bank’s Doing Business report in 2006/07, mostly on account of improved tax system and
administration. Notwithstanding this, regulation remains a serious constraint to enterprise operations and growth. In the
World Bank’s 2008 Investment Climate Assessment, senior managers in Bulgaria reported spending 17 percent of their time
dealing with requirements imposed by Government regulations such as taxes, customs, labor regulations, licensing and
registration. This is very high compared to other middle-income economies. The Better Regulation Programme adopted by
the Government for 2008-10, and the broader National Reform Programme (2008-10) charting a course of action based on
EC recommendations, are key steps to maintain reform momentum.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt;
ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency),
and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock.
ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth,
and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

APPENDIX II. BULGARIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aimed at Bulgaria’s successful EU integration and convergence. On June 13, 2006
the Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the Bank which
outlined the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period FY07-09. The strategic
priorities of the CPS focus on: (i) productivity and employment; (ii) fiscal sustainability and
absorption of EU funds; and (iii) social inclusion. In addition to the Bank’s ongoing lending
operations in areas such as revenue administration, social investment and employment
promotion, district heating, and environment, the CPS includes a three-year program of three
development policy loans (DPLs) of up to US$150 million each that supports institutional
reforms in the social sectors. In addition, the CPS program includes investment lending in
road, trade and transport facilitation for South East Europe, social inclusion, and municipal
infrastructure, most of which is already effective. The Bank continues to undertake
diagnostics providing a solid base for policy dialogue and design and implementation of its
lending operations in Bulgaria.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.
The Bank has the lead on the dialogue on the core structural aspects of the reforms
while the Fund has the lead on the dialogue on the macroeconomic, in particular fiscal and
financial sector, aspects of the reforms. The IMF leads in the areas of macroeconomic
stability, fiscal, income, external sector policies, and its analyses serve as inputs into World
Bank policy formulation and advice. The Bank and the Fund share responsibility in the
financial sector, public expenditure management and budgeting, and tax administration.
B.1.

Areas of shared responsibility

3.
Financial Sector. In late 2001, staff of the two institutions carried out a joint IMFWorld Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Bulgaria, providing a shared
perspective on the development agenda of the country and on the prioritization and
sequencing of reforms in the financial sector. Key findings of the FSAP have been used as
conditionalities on financial sector policies under both the SBA and the PAL program. A
follow-up to the FSAP was undertaken by Fund staff in the context of the 2004 Article IV
Consultation mission in March–April 2004 with the most recent update completed in June
2008.
4.
Revenue Administration. Joint World Bank-IMF efforts led to the Revenue
Administration Reform Project (€31.9 million), approved by the Bank’s Board in 2003,
under which the new National Revenue Agency became operational on January 1, 2006,
integrating collection of tax and social security revenues and establishing an economically

4

efficient public revenue collection system that facilitates private sector development and
complies with EU requirements.
5.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has taken the lead in the dialogue on
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and has outlined policy directions in
the context of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review1 of 2002, and the Public
Finance Policy Review2 of 2006.
B.2. Areas where the World Bank leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the IMF
policy formulation and advice.
6.
Education. The Bank has supported the government program in education. The first
and the second DPLs, which were approved by the Bank’s Board respectively in March 2007
and November 2008, support the deepening of education reforms, in particular strengthening
of the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science to assess the quality of
education, and improve school governance and financing system. In addition, a second
Public Finance Policy Review3, that was finalized in 2007, outlined options for reforms
aimed at improving quality of education at all levels with special focus on vocational
education and training as well as the quality of and access to tertiary education.
7.
Health. The Bank has supported the government program in health through two
investment operations and the DPL program. The Bank’s first and second DPLs focused on
strengthening the financial sustainability of the national health insurance system and
enhancing the efficiency of public spending on hospitals and pharmaceuticals.
8.
Social protection programs. Social protection programs—pensions, labor market
programs, social assistance, and short-term and family benefits—have a wide coverage
among the population. The Bank’s first and second DPLs support an employment promotion
program, which includes interventions to alter incentives both on the labor supply and the
labor demand sides. To create additional incentives for job searching and lower reliance of
able-bodied individuals on social welfare programs, the government has changed eligibility
criteria of some social assistance programs. The Bank has recently completed a policy note

The Bank has embarked on a multi-year poverty monitoring program aimed at assessing the
impact of government policies and economic growth on the poor. The first poverty
monitoring report, that is currently being finalized, provides a feedback loop so that policy
adjustments can be made as appropriate to take account of findings. In addition, the Bank’s
Board approved recently a Social Inclusion Loan aimed at addressing longer term constraints
to social inclusion, and facilitating the government’s absorption of grants from the European
Social Fund.

Economic and Sector Work. The country diagnostic work recently completed by the
Bank includes a Public Finance Policy Review focused on reforms in labor and product
markets, education and R&D aimed to boost productivity and employment and thus
accelerate convergence to EU income levels. Various pieces of country diagnostic work have
been finalized. These include a Judiciary Public Expenditure and Institutional Review
focusing on developing a judiciary-wide modernization program to improve judiciary’s
performance and accountability; an investment climate assessment benchmarking study on
product market regulation in Bulgaria compared with OECD countries; and a regulatory
impact assessment study. In addition the following studies are currently being finalized:
programmatic poverty monitoring and an investment climate assessment.

IFC, as of November 2008, has 17 projects in its portfolio with total
commitments of US$505 million for its own account and an additional US$234
syndicated from partner banks. In the financial sector, IFC has supported two specialized
SME banks, established Bulgaria’s first micro lending bank, and has invested in a venture
capital fund that also targets the SME sector. IFC has been involved in an oil and gas project
in the country and is investing in a renewable energy plant in the North of the country, which
will considerably add to the renewable energy capabilities of Bulgaria and contribute to the
government’s sustainable development goals. IFC has also supported a company investing in
agricultural land and promoting land consolidation. Also, IFC has invested in a number of
key manufacturing projects to support a cement plant modernization, the expansion and
modernization of an electronic assembly facility, the rehabilitation and capacity increase of a
wood panel production facility, revamping of a copper processing facility, and a project in
retail sector to establish discount stores, hypermarkets and distribution centers in the country.

As a good example of South-South investments, IFC has committed about US$90 million to
support post-privatization restructuring of a steel mill and two glass processing plants.

APPENDIX III. BULGARIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is generally adequate for surveillance purposes. Bulgaria has
participated in the SDDS since 2003.
Real sector
2.
The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts,
based on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and the
European System of Accounts 1995. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. However, government
output and final consumption are estimated on a cash basis. In addition, published national
accounts include current and capital accounts for the five main domestic sectors (general
government, financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations, nonprofit institutions serving
households, and households). Work is underway on compiling financial accounts and balance
sheets.
3.
The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure
approaches in current and constant prices since 1994. The preliminary data are now
disseminated 70 days (from the previously 80 days) after the end of the reference quarter
with final figures disseminated after approximately 5 quarters. The annual data are
disseminated about 5 quarters after the end of the reference year. The estimates at constant
prices, which follow international standards, use chain-linked indices. Problems remain in the
coverage of private sector activities as well as regarding constant price estimates of capital
formation and external trade, although progress has been made in the development of export
and import deflators.
4.
On price data, the NSI produces a domestic consumer price index (CPI), a
harmonized consumer price index (HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer
price index (PPI). All are updated monthly. The CPI series begins in 1995, the PPI in 2000
and the HCPI in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The coverage of the CPIs
was extended, although they still exclude some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied
housing and health and life insurance. Since 2004, financial services are included. The
geographical coverage of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas that account for an
estimated 65 percent of sales.
5.
The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system
for processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import
unit value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat
in this area. The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of
the national accounts. The Import and Export Division of the NSI meets monthly with the
BNB to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data
and the balance of payments data.

9
6.
The national account data on employment and hours worked are compiled by the NSI
based on Labor Force Survey and adjusted according to the ESA’95 methodology. The NSI
also obtains current monthly estimates from a quarterly survey of establishments using all
public enterprises and a sample of private employers that excludes establishments with less
than five employees. The sample included 14,500 private employers out of approximately
142,000 qualifying private enterprises. The NSI household labor force survey is an
alternative source of data, but improvements are needed to make it more consistent with the
establishment survey, especially regarding agricultural employment. The survey is conducted
four times a year.
7.
The NSI also compiles and publishes wage data for various economic sectors. The
main shortcomings include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; and (ii) reporting of
average gross earnings only, not wages for time worked and wages by occupation. However,
the National Social Security Institute (NSSI) administrative data are used to estimate wages
by occupation and age (as well as the number of self-employed and employment in small
firms). The household budget survey could provide an alternative source of data for private
sector wages.
8.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2001 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the
labor force survey.
Government finance
9.
In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission
and within the framework of fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, the authorities
have made significant progress on implementing accrual accounting for government,
budgetary and statistical systems. Consolidated data on central government operations are
routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and in IFS. For the GFS
Yearbook 2006, 2005 data for the general government sector and its subsectors were reported
on a cash basis. Since September 2008, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) prepares and submits
the SDDS indicators for the central government finances in the IMF’s GFSM 2001 format.
The same indicators are published on the MOF’s website on a monthly and quarterly basis.
10.
The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated
government budget on a monthly basis. These data do not conform to GFS standards.
Aggregate data on revenue, expenditure, balance of the general government and composition
of the financing are published in the monthly bulletin and posted on the MOF’s website. The
authorities have made progress in presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including
expenditure by functional classification. In addition, a full economic classification of
expenditure is now available, and the authorities have provided such data on an annual basis
back to 1998.

10
Money and banking statistics
11.
In 2002, the BNB began to harmonize progressively its data collection and
compilation methods in line with the ECB’s framework for monetary statistics. The revised
data for June 1995 and onward resulting from these efforts are published in IFS. Recent work
in mid-2006 aimed at fully meeting the remaining ECB requirements beginning in
February 2007, in accordance with 1995 ESA, the institutional coverage of monetary
financial institutions includes money market funds. Consistency in the coverage of the
BNB’s claims on banks (which included claims on liquidated banks) and the banks’
liabilities to the BNB improved in January 2003 after the BNB wrote off most of the claims
on the liquidated banks.
Balance of payments
12.
Bulgaria reports monthly balance of payments and external debt data on a regular
and timely basis, but data on reinvested earnings by foreign-owned companies are subject to
large revisions due to incomplete responses on surveys used for preliminary estimates. The
data on reinvested earnings and equity are revised with the annual survey of the NSI on
foreign direct investment in non-financial enterprises. In early 2006, the authorities revised
the methodology for estimating trade-related transportation receipts and payments to align it
more closely with actual costs. Since joining the EU in January 2007, the trade data with EU
countries are being collected following the INTRASTAT system.

1.
According to preliminary flash estimates, GDP growth slowed to 3.7 percent
year/year, down from 6.8 percent in Q3 2008. From a demand side perspective, the
slowdown was driven by a slowdown in gross fixed capital formation (from 22.2 to
9.7 percent) and exports (from 3.8 to -6.8 percent). The flash estimate was close to staff’s
projections (4.0 percent), and does not lead to changes in staff’s GDP projections.
2.
BOP data confirm that capital inflows slowed sharply in the fourth quarter. Net
capital inflows amounted to €701 million, down from €3,416 million in the third quarter. The
decline was driven in part by a reduction in foreign borrowing (by €785 million), in inbound
FDI (by €753 million), and in non-resident deposits (by €589 million). The counterpart of the
decline in private capital inflows was a decline in official reserve assets by €2 billion euro.
3.
The foreign reserve loss has stopped in February. Following a reserve loss of
0.6 billion euros in January, reserves increased by €0.1 billion in the first three weeks of
February.
4.
Private sector credit growth remained very low in January. The annualized
month/month growth rates was 5 percent, slightly up from 1.6 percent in December. The
year/year growth rate slowed to 30.0 percent, down from 31.1 percent in December, and
61.8 percent in January 2008.
5.
Wage growth has remained high, further exacerbating staff’s concerns about
competitiveness. Nominal wage growth slowed to 18 percent year/year in December, down
from 25 percent in June. The decline was in line with the slowdown in inflation (from 14.7 to
7.2 percent), and real wage growth remained very high. The unemployment rate picked up
from its record low of 6.0 percent in November to 6.1 percent in December.
6.
In line with other countries in the region, financial markets continue to be under
pressure. Since the staff report was issued, the Bulgarian stock market index (SOFIX) has
lost another 4 percent, while sovereign CDS spreads have reached 634 basis points.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Bulgaria
On March 4, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Bulgaria. 1
Background
Bulgaria has been hit by the global financial crisis, with clear signs that the country’s capitalinflows driven boom has come to an end and that the real economy is slowing down.
Since agreement was reached on EU accession in 2004, Bulgaria experienced a surge in
capital inflows and a credit boom. Inflows were driven by expectations of rapid convergence
with the EU, and were further boosted by the confidence-enhancing effect of the currency
board and a strong fiscal policy. By 2008, net inflows had increased to about 27 percent of
GDP. Boosted by capital inflows, credit to the private sector rose rapidly, and the credit-toGDP ratio climbed from 36 percent in 2004 to 67 percent in 2007. The surge in inflows
generated strong GDP growth, but also a sharp widening of external and internal imbalances.
GDP grew by more than 6 percent annually, leading to a significant narrowing of the income

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
gap with Western Europe. Growth remained strong in 2008—at 6 percent, Bulgaria was one of
the fastest growing countries in Europe.
As the growth of domestic demand outpaced GDP growth, the current account deficit widened
from 5 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated 25 percent of GDP in 2008. As unemployment
dropped and the labor market tightened, wage growth accelerated to 25 percent in June 2008.
The overheating of the economy, together with rising food and oil prices, resulted in a surge of
inflation, which peaked at 14.7 percent in June 2008. Competitiveness deteriorated, and the
unit labor cost -based real effective exchange rate appreciated 27 percent in the two years
ending in mid-2008.
The global financial market turmoil has had a severe impact on financial asset prices in
Bulgaria. Foreign parent banks have reduced new financing to their local subsidiaries and
credit growth to the non-government sector has slowed sharply.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Bulgarian authorities for their prudent policies that have
built strong balance sheets in the public sector including large foreign reserves, low public
debt, and a substantial Fiscal Reserve Account. They noted that there are substantial buffers
in the banking system. At the same time, large capital inflows contributed to an investment and
consumption boom, creating a large current account deficit and increasing private sector debt,
while heavy reliance on foreign capital is a source of vulnerability. Looking forward, Directors
considered that economic growth would slow sharply with the downturn in partner countries
and only modest net capital inflows. Moreover, as risks are predominantly on the downside,
the authorities were advised to monitor developments closely and adapt policies, as
warranted.
Directors considered that the currency board arrangement has served Bulgaria well as an
anchor for macroeconomic stability. They took note of the staff assessment that the real
effective exchange rate is somewhat overvalued, but that determining its extent is a difficult
question. The authorities were encouraged to avoid any further erosion in international
competitiveness as a result of real wage increases exceeding productivity gains.
Directors considered that the most immediate policy challenge will be to maintain confidence in
the currency board arrangement and in the banking system. While the banking sector remains
well capitalized, liquid, and highly profitable, a severe recession could cause nonperforming
loans to increase and bank capital to erode. Directors welcomed steps to improve depositors’
confidence, increase capital cushions by curtailing most banks’ dividend payout, and to secure
commitments from parent banks to provide adequate liquidity and capital to their subsidiaries.
They observed that the substantial Fiscal Reserve Account allowed a major lender-of-lastresort capacity. They supported the authorities’ efforts to improve Bulgaria’s crisis
management capacity by intensifying the monitoring of liquidity and credit risks, further

3
strengthening the stress testing capacity, and cooperating more closely with foreign
supervisors.
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to maintaining prudent fiscal
policies, which will provide crucial support for the currency board arrangement. They
concurred with the authorities’ intention to maintain a fiscal surplus of 2 percent of GDP in
2009, in part by containing public spending. They cautioned, however, that were growth to
slow more than expected, additional expenditure cuts will be necessary to achieve the targeted
surplus. They viewed the rule to restrict spending to 90 percent of the amount budgeted as an
effective short-term tool, but emphasized that prioritization and further spending restraint will
be needed to sustain appropriate fiscal surpluses over the medium term.
Directors noted that further structural reforms will be key to a smooth and speedy economic
recovery and achievement of convergence with the European Union. They welcomed the
recent education and labor market reforms to raise productivity and labor market participation
rates, and the progress made in reducing administrative burdens for businesses.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Bulgaria
and Victor Ivanov Yotzov, Advisor to the Executive Director
March 4, 2009
The Bulgarian authorities appreciate the continued constructive dialogue with the Fund. They
broadly share staff analysis and recommendations as presented in the Article IV paper. The
authorities attach high value to the findings and recommendations of the recent FSAP update.
Recent Developments
By and large, 2008 was yet another successful year. The confidence inspired by the good
economic performance in the last years and the recent accession to the EU has continued to
attract substantial amounts of capital inflows, mostly in the form of FDI. As a result, for a
fifth consecutive year real GDP growth is expected to exceed 6 percent, led primarily by
private investment and (to a much lesser extent) by private consumption. Over the last couple
of years, the private investment-to-GDP ratio has surged, while the private consumption-toGDP ratio remained stable, suggesting that consumption has not been the main driver of
recent high growth rates.
On the back of rising energy and food prices, inflation accelerated in the first half of 2008
but, as oil and food prices reversed, disinflation is currently in place. On the other hand,
robust growth, liberalized market conditions, and overall positive expectations were the main
driving forces behind the sharp drop in unemployment, which, in turn, resulted in a tighter
labor market and accelerated wage growth. This tendency, which can be observed in many
other countries in the region, is also affected by the strive to lower the huge wage
differentials (Bulgaria has the lowest income level within the EU countries) as well as by
pressures arising from the still present outward migration.
Solid economic growth, steady capital inflows, and a prudent fiscal policy with sizable
surpluses over the last five years resulted in a significant increase of the Fiscal Reserve
Account. Accumulated reserves were used to buy back and retire all outstanding Brady
bonds, to make early repurchases to all outstanding loans to the Fund, as well as to prepay a
the external public debt ratio, which is now expected to fall below 15 percent of GDP. Gross
external debt, however, has been on the rise since 2003 as the private sector debt has begun
to grow rapidly, in line with the investment boom that the country has been experiencing.
Fiscal Policy
A well known fact is that under a currency board arrangement fiscal policy remains key to
maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the
authorities continue sticking to a prudent fiscal stance. At the same time, given the relatively
low starting position, the main policy objective in the last years has been maximization of the
capital flows’ utilization as that provides the country with the unique opportunity to speed-up
real convergence, deepen economic integration, and substantially increase living standards in
a relatively short period of time. The growth model over the last years, however, has been
associated with a strong absorption boom where domestic demand grows much faster than
GDP, resulting in widening external imbalances. In this regard, the authorities have long

2
acknowledged the need to offset sustained private sector saving-investment imbalances by
running fiscal surpluses. As the latter objective has become more important over the last
years, the fiscal stance has strengthened remarkably. Last year was no exception and the
fiscal surplus is estimated at about 3 percent of GDP – one of the largest among all emerging
market countries.
The macro-framework of the 2009 budget was prepared before the financial turmoil and
envisaged a more favorable external environment associated with somewhat slower but still
strong domestic growth of 4.7 percent and a fiscal surplus of 3 percent. As external
circumstances have rapidly deteriorated over the last months, the authorities have no illusions
that what was budgeted is hardly achievable anymore. Recognizing that the stronger than
initially expected deterioration in economic activity would require additional expenditure
cuts in order to achieve a surplus, the authorities decided to restrict spending to 90 percent of
the budgeted amount – a practice that has been successfully used in the past and proven
effective. By applying this policy, the authorities reaffirm their strong commitment to sound
macroeconomic policies, acknowledging the paramount importance of a prudent fiscal stance
in the context of the currency board arrangement.
External Sector
Despite the continued increase in public savings, the private sector’s saving-investment
imbalance has translated into a sizable current account deficit. Exacerbated by high oil and
other key commodity prices, in 2008 the external current account deficit has approached 25
percent of GDP. The size of the deficit itself is high enough to raise concerns about external
stability. While the authorities share the legitimacy of these concerns, it has become apparent
that the recent trend of a widening deficit will sharply reverse as FDI associated imports drop
substantially. The authorities are aware that the financial turmoil in mature markets has
highlighted the speed and scope at which financial markets can re-assess risk premia. In the
case of Bulgaria, the challenge is even larger given the monetary framework which provides
only limited tools to tackle the problem. With a high current account deficit, high external
private sector debt, and large foreign currency exposures, staff advice is that a key task for
policies is to maintain confidence in the currency board and in the financial system. While
agreeing with the general notion of the advice, the authorities would appreciate a more
concrete and detailed advice on how to deal with the consequences of a possible sharp
decline in capital inflows in the context of an ongoing global financial crisis.
With regard to the exchange rate assessment staff suggests that, according to different
methodologies used, the real exchange rate is likely overvalued by a wide range from 7 to 20
percent. While all the approaches have well known caveats and a high degree of uncertainty,
the important thing is that the widening current-account deficit has hardly been accompanied
by loss of external competitiveness. Real exchange rate appreciation over the last years is
rather moderate when benchmarked against conventional relationships between the exchange
rate and the current account deficit. The appreciation in the real exchange rate is much more
likely to reflect movements in the equilibrium rate. Purchasing power parity and dollar-wage
comparisons across countries, too, suggest that Bulgaria’s prices and production costs remain
broadly competitive–a suggestion also supported by regression-based estimates of the real

3
equilibrium exchange rate. Moreover, export volume growths are in double digits over the
last couple of years. In 2008 for example, export volume growth is estimated at 12.5 percent
– up from 10.2 percent in 2007, while import volume growth slowed to 9.5 percent from 17.3
percent a year ago. It may well be the case that a one-off private investment boom is the main
driver of the large current account deficit. Accordingly, once this boom dissipates (which is
already happening), it is expected that the current account deficit will approach its
equilibrium level rather soon.
Financial sector
Until just months ago, bank credit expanded rapidly. In many respects this was a welcome
development as it symbolized growing financial intermediation. The pace of the bank credit
growth, however, remained too high for too long, and was associated with an increase in
macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The rapid bank credit growth was hardly surprising given the
extremely low initial base, declining nominal interest rates, rising income expectations, and a
stable, well capitalized, and highly profitable banking system. All this suggests that the rapid
credit growth, which was experienced until recently, was a healthy one, reflecting the overall
strong economic performance – a suggestion broadly supported by the recent FSAP update.
Following the global financial turmoil that started in 2007 and significantly intensified after
September 2008, foreign funding has declined, resulting in strong competition for deposits
and a sharp reduction in credit growth. While interest rates on deposits rose by about 2 pp,
banks have become much more cautious and domestic credit growth in 2008 slowed to 32
percent, compared to 62 percent in 2007. The interbank market was affected as well, but after
some targeted steps taken by the central bank it calmed down, volumes have mostly resumed
and interest rates have moderated.
The steps taken by the government and the central bank were focused on preventing a
depositors’ confidence crisis, easing liquidity pressures, and increasing capital cushions. In
this regard, the deposit insurance coverage was increased, in line with EU commitments,
from €20,000 to €50,000 and will be increased further to €100,000 per depositor per bank in
2009. Reserve requirements in local currency were lowered from 12 to 10 percent and to 5
percent in foreign currency. The BNB has also taken further steps to increase banks’ capital
and liquidity cushions by persuading most bank owners not to pay dividends, but instead add
2008 profits to capital. It has also received comfort letters from parent banks to ensure that
they provide adequate liquidity and capital. In addition, the BNB has intensified its
monitoring, with special focus on liquidity and credit risks, and taken steps to further
strengthen its stress testing capabilities, in line with recommendations of the recent FSAP
Update.
The challenges ahead
Notwithstanding past achievements, the authorities now recognize that the end of the capitalinflow driven boom creates significant policy challenges. Recent developments in the
country, as well as in the region as a whole, suggest the need of a swift change in policy
priorities. Until just a short time ago, these were speeding up convergence and raising living
standards, whereas now the priority is focused primarily on preserving macroeconomic
stability. The authorities and staff share the view that the most important challenge is

4
ensuring that the likely drop in capital inflows does not result in a confidence crisis. In this
regard, maintaining confidence in the currency board arrangement and the financial system is
crucial. With a view to the fulfillment of this objective, keeping public finances in check is
regarded as key instrument. As rightly underscored by staff, in many ways Bulgaria starts the
current slowdown from a strong position. The public finances are in good shape, the balance
sheets of the central bank and the government are strong, with large foreign reserves and
substantial buffers accumulated in the fiscal reserve account. The financial system is stable
and well capitalized. All this are important prerequisites needed by each and every economy
to weather the current global downturn.
Finally, with regard to the ERM II, the authorities maintain their long stated position that
they will seek to joining at the earliest possible date. The ongoing global financial crisis has
not changed the authorities’ determination. On the contrary, they have started talks with their
European partners and are ready to provide them with firm and detailed policy commitments.
The authorities’ plan is to uphold the currency board arrangement at the existing exchange
rate until Bulgaria joins the EMU. The Bulgarian government and the central bank have
committed to unilaterally maintain a zero deviation of the exchange rate after Bulgaria joins
the ERM II.
