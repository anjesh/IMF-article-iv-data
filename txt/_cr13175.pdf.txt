KEY ISSUES
Political and economic context. The Kyrgyz Republic became a parliamentary
democracy in 2010 following political turmoil and ethnic unrest. The shift in the political
system provided an impetus for comprehensive economic reforms. While the
authorities have implemented critical fiscal reforms, financial sector reforms turned out
more challenging than expected. The current coalition government has managed to
maintain a relatively stable political environment, but the political situation remains
fragile. Notwithstanding the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions in 2012,
policies have remained generally prudent.
Article IV discussions focused on policies needed to secure sustainable and inclusive
private sector-led growth over the medium term. The authorities agreed that reducing
the reliance on external aid and ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability, supported
by fiscal consolidation, is essential for macroeconomic stability. In the near term, fiscal
consolidation will help ensure that debt remains on a declining path and support the
central bank’s efforts to curb inflation. The authorities acknowledged that a
well-functioning financial sector is needed to generate savings and support private
sector-led growth. They also recognized that improving the businesses environment,
governance, and institutions remains pivotal in strengthening the role of the private
sector and supporting sustainable and inclusive growth. In this context the
government’s commitment to resolve the dispute with the gold mining company
constructively is expected to limit potential damages to the investment climate. Traction
of previous IMF advice has been broadly satisfactory.
The program is broadly on track with all end-December quantitative performance
criteria (QPC) met. However, one structural benchmark and two indicative targets were
not observed at end-December. The structural benchmark on Zalkar’s sale was met with
a delay in early May. The continuous QPC on contracting or guaranteeing of new
nonconcessional external debt by the public sector was also missed. The authorities are
requesting a waiver of nonobservance of this QPC, based on corrective actions being
taken. The authorities are also requesting the fifth disbursement (SDR 9.514 million) to
become available upon completion of this review.

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Context
1.
The shift to a parliamentary democracy in 2010 provided an impetus for the Kyrgyz
Republic to reform the economy. The Kyrgyz economy is the most open one in the region, and
depends heavily on gold exports and remittances. The political turmoil and internal ethnic conflict in
2010 disrupted economic activity. To address the effects of the domestic crisis, the new government
increased social outlays, wages, and pensions, leading to fiscal tensions. Nonetheless, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio declined, helped by recent debt write-offs.1 The authorities introduced tax policy
and tax administration measures to strengthen revenue collection and improved public financial
management to increase the efficiency of spending. However, the new political system and frequent
changes in government have made some aspects of economic reform more difficult and led to
delays, particularly in the financial sector (Box 1).
Box 1. Kyrgyz Republic: How Much Traction did Previous IMF Advice Receive?
Staff Advice
Consolidate the fiscal position

Raise revenues through tax policy and
tax administration measures

Enhance customs administration

Reduce fiscal risks stemming from
state-owned enterprises and boost
revenues from dividends
Strengthen public financial
management

Policy Actions
Fiscal policy
The authorities reduced the fiscal deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP in
2012 from 6.4 percent in 2010 and are committed to reduce the deficit
further, to less than 3 percent of GDP by 2015, to maintain a sustainable
debt position.
The authorities removed the turnover tax exemption on electricity, heat
and natural gas for commercial users; moved to a contract-based tax
regime for food services; they strengthened tax administration and
moved the tax policy function back to the ministry of finance in March
2013.
The authorities improved the customs valuation system and moved the
majority of imported goods from weight-based to price-based
valuation.
The government adopted a resolution on the procedures for the
submission of budgets of the 20 largest SOEs.
The authorities strengthened PFM by a number of reforms. They also
established the high-level committee to coordinate PFM reforms
chaired by the Minister of Finance. Treasury reforms are in progress.
The authorities expanded targeted cash transfers to the poor.

Enhance social safety nets and targeted
social assistance programs
Monetary and financial sector policies
Resolve Zalkar
The authorities found resolving the bank difficult in a challenging
political environment. This measure took some time to implement.
Zalkar was sold to a fit and proper buyer in May 2013.
Strengthen central bank independence The authorities phased out the special bank refinancing fund (SBRF) and
and financial sector oversight
liquidated it in October 2011. They developed a privatization strategy
for SSC Bank. The draft Banking Code was submitted to the government
for consideration at end-April 2013.

2.
Despite the recent progress, the Kyrgyz Republic faces significant economic
challenges. The key near-term challenge is to maintain macroeconomic stability and to put the
financial sector on a sound footing. The authorities agreed that key medium-term challenges
include diversifying the economy away from gold, reducing dependence on remittances and
external support, and creating a business environment conducive to private sector-led growth.
3.
Meeting the challenges will require actions on many fronts. Fiscal consolidation is critical
to ensure sustainability of public finances, keep debt on a declining path, and support the central
bank’s efforts to curb inflation. In this context, it is essential to maintain and strengthen central bank
independence, which recently has come under pressure. Moving ahead with reforms in the banking
sector and improving the business environment will be key to strengthening the role of the private
sector. Enhancing the provision of high-quality public services and addressing corruption are
essential elements of a successful development agenda. The government will also need to address
the remaining ethnic tensions and actively participate in the regional dialogue on the development
of the hydro-power sector.

B. Recent Developments
4.
The political situation has stabilized but remains fragile. The three-party coalition
government formed after the breakup of the previous coalition in August 2012 has managed to
maintain a relatively stable political environment. Nevertheless, the political situation remains fragile
as some members of parliament continue to voice their disagreement with the government’s reform
agenda.
5.
The economic situation deteriorated in 2012 (Figure 1). Gold production dropped by
40 percent owing to disruptions at Kumtor, the largest gold mine. Solid growth in other sectors,
fueled by remittances inflows, cushioned the drop in overall output to -0.9 percent. The current
account deficit increased substantially, mainly due to the decline in gold exports and an increase in
imports of inputs for ongoing energy infrastructure projects. Official assistance and remittances,
which have the strongest impact on the exchange rate, mitigated depreciation pressures. The capital
and financial accounts have been volatile, primarily because of upward revisions to private external
debt, sizable debt relief, and short-term flows related to mining activity. Inflation increased to
7.5 percent by end-2012, owing to rising international food prices in the summer.
6.
Notwithstanding adverse economic conditions, fiscal policy remained prudent. The
2012 fiscal deficit was 5.4 percent of GDP and below the targeted 6 percent of GDP, although
somewhat higher than in 2011 owing to the expenditure carryover. The revenue-smoothing
arrangement with Kumtor and buoyant customs revenue in the first nine months of 2012 offset the
shortfall in gold-related revenue. However, growth in customs revenue decelerated in late 2012. The
government curtailed some nonpriority expenditure to accommodate lower-than-budgeted external
financing on account of delays in the implementation of structural measures agreed with donors.
Unexpected external grants in late 2012 led to a better-than-projected fiscal outturn.

7.
Despite lowering the policy rate, the central bank continued to mop up excess
liquidity, although not consistently throughout 2012. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
(NBKR) reduced the policy rate in several steps to 2.6 percent, in response to negative economic
growth and moderate inflation. The shift in monetary policy has not affected the average lending
rate in the banking system. Toward end-2012, however, sterilization efforts were not sufficient to
offset strong growth in foreign inflows. As a result, reserve money increased by more than expected.
Growth in private credit was strong on account of buoyant demand across most sectors and a
one-off factor (a micro-finance institution became a bank in November 2012).
8.
The banking sector has remained generally stable (Text Table 1). Nonperforming loans
continued to fall during 2012, while provisioning increased. Capital adequacy and liquidity of the
banking system remained sufficient, while profitability increased. However, dollarization, even
though on a declining trend, is still high.

C. Program Implementation
9.
The program has been broadly on track, albeit with some slippages. All end-December
2012 QPC and all but one structural benchmarks were met (Tables 13 and 14). The structural
benchmark on the sale of Zalkar was met with a delay in early May. The end-December
2012 indicative targets on state government tax collections and reserve money were also missed.
The continuous QPC on the ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external
debt was missed in early 2013.2 The law on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) and the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code were submitted to parliament
in December 2012. The revised SSC sales strategy was approved by the government in February
2013. A government resolution on the procedures for submission of budgets of the next 10 largest
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to the government was adopted at end-March 2013 (LOI ¶7). The
authorities are requesting a waiver of nonobservance of the continuous QPC based on corrective
actions being taken. The authorities are making progress toward meeting the structural benchmarks
scheduled for the coming months.

D. Outlook and Risks
Outlook
10.
With prudent macroeconomic policies and continued structural reforms, the
medium-term outlook is broadly favorable (Text Table 2). Nongold growth this year is expected
to be lower than in 2012 because of the negative impact on the investment climate from the
ongoing government dispute with Kumtor. With the expected recovery in the gold sector, overall
growth is, however, expected to be strong (Box 2). Going forward, staff projects that growth will
stabilize at 5 percent, supported by continued remittances inflows, strong private credit growth, and
structural reforms leading to a better business environment. In the absence of renewed supply
shocks, inflation is expected to remain in single digits. The current account deficit in 2013 is
expected to decline, primarily owing to the recovery in gold production. The authorities’
development strategy envisages somewhat more optimistic economic growth over the medium
term—7 percent—based on accelerated reforms, in combination with strengthened security,
political stability, and increasing energy independence. External public debt remains unchanged at a
moderate risk of debt distress (Country Report No. 12/139).

2

The Electric Power Station, which is part of the public sector, signed a credit line with the Eurasian Development
Bank for a total amount of US$30 million (0.5 percent of GDP). The loan does not have a material impact on the debt
outlook.

Box 2. Kyrgyz Republic: Gold Production in the Kumtor Mine
Geological factors—an unexpected shift of ice and waste into the central pit of the Kumtor mine in early
2012—resulted in a drop in gold production by 40 percent in 2012. The decline was stronger than expected
because of additional complications with the
900
bedrock and a lower gold content in the ore. As a
Gold Production at Kumtor Mine
(In thousands of ounces)
result Centerra, Kumtor’s parent company, lowered
800
medium-term gold production projections. While
half of the 2013 production is expected to fall to the 700
last quarter, Centerra announced that 2013 will be
600
the last year with back-loaded production as the
mine continues to build up stock piles.
Going forward, production is expected to stabilize at
650 thousand ounces per year. As a result of the ice
block removal from the central pit, gold reserves in
the mine are expected to be higher, extending the
life of the mine by four years to 2026.

Risks
11.
Political fragility, the narrow structure of the economy, and exogenous shocks are the
main risks for the Kyrgyz economy in the near and medium terms (Box 3). The political
transformation into a nascent parliamentary democracy entails risks of political instability. Political
turmoil could lead to uncertainty and disruption in policy implementation. The security situation in
Afghanistan could also deteriorate after the NATO troop withdrawal in 2014, and this could in turn
spill over to neighboring countries, including the Kyrgyz Republic. A key potential economic shock is
that a slowdown in global growth could spill over to the Kyrgyz economy via lower remittances and
weaker external demand from Russia and Kazakhstan. The economy also remains vulnerable to
global oil and food price shocks which could raise imports and inflation, and could also be hit by
further disruptions in gold production and lower gold prices. These shocks would aggravate external
vulnerabilities by putting pressure on international reserves.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of risks. They agreed that
rebuilding policy buffers and reducing vulnerabilities through fiscal consolidation and continued
exchange rate flexibility are key to mitigate these risks. They also agreed to tighten monetary policy
as needed to prevent second-round effects of increases in international food and fuel prices on
inflation. Moreover, structural reforms geared toward improving the effectiveness of fiscal and
monetary policies are expected to help mitigate vulnerabilities.

Despite these new developments, the authorities are committed to achieving the

deposits, which had increased in late 2012 owing to
grants from Russia and the ADB. The authorities noted that they do not expect sizable privatization
receipts this year because of political constraints that prevent the sale of large state-owned entities.
3

With the recent agreement on Russia’s duty free exports of oil products to Tajikistan, Kyrgyz fuel imports are
expected to be lower on account of lower fuel re-exports to Tajikistan.

4

Because the loan from Turkey (US$90 million over 2013–15) was reclassified from a PIP loan to a budget support
loan (based on a recent agreement between the Kyrgyz and Turkish governments), foreign-financed capital
investment is projected to decline with a corresponding increase in current spending in 2013–14.

15.
The ongoing dispute with Centerra, Kumtor’s parent company, entails risks to the
budget in 2013 and beyond. The government noted that the annual revenue loss on account of
the special tax regime agreed with Kumtor in 2009 is 1.5 percent of GDP (in 2011, Kumtor’s tax
payments amounted to 2.1 percent of GDP).5 According to Centerra, Kumtor operates under a valid
agreement approved by the then government and parliament and therefore the tax regime cannot
be revised. Parliament requested to resolve the dispute before end-June through cancellation of the
special tax treatment agreement for Kumtor. Staff urged the authorities to resolve the dispute in a
constructive manner, noting that failure to do so could lead to significant costs and pressures on the
budget. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the risks and emphasized that they would
work with Centerra on a constructive resolution of the dispute (LOI ¶14).
16.
The authorities are strengthening the role of the ministry of finance in core areas of
tax policy. Following the recent return of the tax policy function to the ministry of finance, the
authorities will now create a new, adequately staffed tax policy department in the ministry of finance
(LOI ¶7, structural benchmark). This department will become the focal point on all tax policy-related
matters. The government expects comprehensive technical assistance from the IMF in this area. The
authorities have also expressed interest in receiving technical assistance from the IMF that would
help identify key challenges in tax administration and provide recommendations regarding future
priorities and options for reforms.
17.
Better monitoring the largest state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will help limit potential
fiscal costs. The coverage of the reporting requirements for the 10 largest SOEs was expanded to
20. The expansion of the list should also help mobilize additional revenues through improved
monitoring. To prevent the 10 largest SOEs, which are part of the public sector, from contracting
nonconcessional loans, as happened recently and led to the nonobservance of the continuous
performance criterion, the authorities will issue a government resolution requiring these SOEs to
provide all information on their borrowing plans and debt service obligations (LOI ¶7). The
government, as the owner of these SOEs, has the power to stop any nonconcessional external
borrowing.
18.
Reforms in public financial management (PFM) are continuing. The government has
recently updated the action plan on PFM reforms. As part of this plan, the government has drafted a
law on public procurement that is expected to be submitted to parliament for approval in June. This
law is expected to enhance the transparency and efficiency of public spending. The authorities will
issue a regulation on expanding the coverage of the commitment register to include local budgets
and special means. The ministry of finance will also develop and approve regulations on accounting
and financial reporting using the unified chart of accounts on the basis of international norms
(structural benchmarks). The authorities expect that these measures will enhance control over public
spending. They are also working with parliament to ensure that the new Budget Code is in line with
recent IMF technical assistance advice and the WB recommendations (LOI ¶8).
5

Under the 2009 agreement, Kumtor pays 13 percent of gross revenue. If Kumtor were to operate under the
common tax regime, it would pay income tax (11 percent at the current gold price), royalty (5 percent), sales tax
(2 percent), and a tax on maintaining infrastructure (2 percent).

12

19.
The government continues to improve debt management and to reduce the debt
service burden on the budget. The authorities acknowledged that transforming the government
securities market into a deep and liquid market requires time (LOI ¶6). Staff proposed to improve the
operational infrastructure for the primary market of government securities at the NBKR to develop
the domestic debt market. Staff commended the authorities for the discontinuation of direct sales of
government securities. The government is looking forward to the upcoming Financial Stability
Assessment Program that will assist in identifying reform options to deepen the domestic debt
market. The authorities agreed that debt sustainability should be the guiding principle in assessing
the financing arrangements of any large-scale infrastructure investments.6

B. Monetary Policy
20.
Keeping the policy rate low could lead to further increases in reserve money, thereby
putting additional pressure on core inflation. During the first three months of 2013, reserve
money growth continued to rise. Staff noted that if this continues, there is a risk of overheating as
the negative output gap gradually disappears. Staff therefore advised the NBKR to mop up excess
liquidity and contain reserve money growth, and consistent with this, to raise the policy rate
gradually to ensure it is positive in real terms (staff also advised the authorities to take steps to
improve the monetary transmission mechanism; see bellow ¶33). While the authorities concurred
that core inflation remains high and needs to come down to single digits, they were reluctant to
commit to raising the policy rate because headline inflation was still at comfortable levels. However,
the NBKR also agreed to remain vigilant and tighten monetary policy as needed to prevent
second-round effects of potential increases in international food and fuel prices, while being mindful
of other risks (LOI ¶9).
21.
Staff stressed that strengthening the NBKRs operational independence is instrumental
in raining in inflationary pressures. The authorities concurred that lending to the economy in
support of growth would increase inflation and severely endanger macroeconomic stability. Staff
also noted that NBKR lending would lead to market distortions, moral hazard, and, most importantly
the NBKR’s exposure to vested interests.

C. Financial Sector Policies
22.
After repeated attempts to resolve Zalkar have failed, the authorities managed to sell
the bank in May.


Zalkar was established in late 2010 as the “good bank” following the failure of Asia Universal
Bank (AUB), the largest bank at that time. The government became the owner of Zalkar, but
committed to selling the bank to complete the resolution process that had started with the split
of AUB. Zalkar is currently the ninth largest commercial bank in the Kyrgyz Republic and not
systemically important. Nonetheless, Zalkar’s sale is important to strengthen the NBKR’s
credibility in resolving problem banks and to improve investor confidence in the financial sector.



The last auction, originally planned for December 2012, was postponed to end-January 2013 to
allow potential buyers additional time for due diligence. Notwithstanding the extra time, the
auction was unsuccessful.



The authorities saw liquidation of Zalkar as very difficult in the current political situation and
stepped up their efforts to sell the bank to complete its resolution. ITB holding, one of the
shareholders of ITB bank of Russia signed a contract to buy 90 percent of the shares of Zalkar on
May 3, 2013. A direct sale transaction was registered in the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange on the same
day. The NBKR confirmed that the buyer was deemed fit and proper. The bank was not
immediately recapitalized. However, the buyer committed to meet capital requirements during
the five months following the election of a new board of directors scheduled for mid June. Staff
noted that it will be essential that recapitalization is completed as planned and Zalkar’s
operations are closely supervised.

23.
The NBKR has advanced the work on the Banking Code. The draft Banking Code that the
NBKR prepared with the assistance of the resident legal advisor and TA from the Fund was
submitted to the government in early April. The NBKR highly valued IMF assistance in this regard.
Staff urged the authorities to resist calls to dilute key features of the draft Banking Code when
sending it to parliament. In particular, the scope of judicial review of the NBRK’s actions should be
limited and legal protection of the NBKR’s staff enhanced. Furthermore, compulsory bank
liquidation should be an out-of-court procedure and the NBKR’s governance should be further
enhanced by strengthening internal audit procedures and extending the term of engagement of the
NBKR’s external auditors.
24.
Staff stressed the importance of swift enactment of amendments to the AML/CFT Law
and to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, and the Payment System Law. If these
amendments are not enacted swiftly, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) may move the Kyrgyz
Republic from the list of jurisdictions under monitoring (gray list) to the list of jurisdictions with
strategic AML/CFT deficiencies (black list) that have not made sufficient progress in addressing these
deficiencies. It is important to preserve key provisions related to the criminalization of money
laundering and financing of terrorism, the definition of suspicious transactions, customer due
diligence, the supervisory framework and the status of the State Financial Intelligence Service Unit in

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

line with TA recommendations. The authorities agreed to increase the communication with
parliament to ensure that the amendments to the AML/CFT legal framework and the payment
system law are adopted swiftly and in line with Fund technical assistance (LOI ¶13).

D. Other Program Issues
25.
Program design and modification of performance criteria. The review schedule and
timing of disbursements is outlined in Table 11. Revised and new quantitative performance criteria
(QPC), indicative targets, are proposed for June, September, and December 2013, and March and
June 2014 (LOI Table 1). The authorities are requesting an upward modification of the QPC on the
NBKR’s net international reserves for end-June 2013, mostly reflecting higher-than-expected reserve
accumulation in 2012, with the subsequent modification of the QPC on the NBKR’s net domestic
assets. The authorities are also requesting a downward modification of the QPC on general
government overall deficit target for end-June 2013 to reflect the changed profile of external grants.
The authorities are requesting a waiver of nonobservance of the continuous PC on the ceiling on
contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional debt by public sector based on corrective
actions being taken. The structural conditionality—existing and proposed—is summarized in Table
14 and LOI Table 2.
26.
Program monitoring will continue to be performed on a semi-annual basis. The fifth
review will be based on continuous and end-June 2013 QPC and the sixth review on continuous and
end-December 2013 QPC. Structural conditionality will focus on macro-critical areas, particularly
strengthening the tax policy function and public expenditure management, which is essential to
support fiscal consolidation efforts (LOI Tables 1 and 2).
27.
Financing. Donors and the Fund are expected to fill the estimated balance of payments gap
in 2013–14 (Text Table 4). In 2013, the authorities are more cautious in projecting donor support,
given the disbursement delays in the past. The authorities requested that the fifth and sixth
disbursements under the ECF arrangement be directed to the budget.

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE
AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
28.
Discussions centered on policies needed to secure sustainable and inclusive private
sector-led growth over the medium term. The authorities agreed that reducing the reliance on
external aid and ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability is essential for macroeconomic stability.
They also acknowledged that creating a well-functioning financial sector is needed to support
private sector-led growth. Finally, the government agreed that work on improving the regulatory
burden on businesses should continue. Traction of previous IMF advice has been broadly
satisfactory (Box 1).

A. Promoting Fiscal Sustainability
29.
Restoring fiscal sustainability will be essential in the medium term. The authorities
recognized that the budget has become more dependent on external assistance since 2009, when
the global crisis hit, and 2010, the year of the internal crisis. They also agreed that creating a sound
and predictable revenue base and reducing the dependency on external assistance will play a pivotal
role in reducing the structural deficit (defined as the nongold structural deficit excluding grants, see
Box 4).7 This would help achieve debt sustainability, the key anchor of fiscal policy, with public debt
declining to 42 percent by 2018 (see Annex I in Country Report No. 12/139). At about 50 percent of
GDP, the Kyrgyz Republic’s public debt is among the highest in the region. Staff noted that with no
significant correlation between growth and tax policy, and low fiscal multipliers in small open
economies such as the Kyrgyz Republic, fiscal consolidation is not expected to be a significant drag
on growth. Staff agreed with the authorities that while cutting inefficient spending is not expected
to harm growth, employment and social objectives will need to be safeguarded.
30.
The authorities agreed that embarking on a sustainable medium-term fiscal path will
require tax policy measures (see Selected Issues Note “Tax Policy in the Kyrgyz Republic”). In
particular, staff emphasized measures such as removing tax exemptions and raising rates for
import-related taxes. In addition, gradually phasing out the turnover (sales) tax would remove
distortions. As an offsetting measure for losses from removing the turnover tax, staff suggested a
moderate VAT rate increase. The authorities agreed that some tax policy measures are needed, in
particular those related to removing some of existing tax exemptions and raising the excise rates.
However, the authorities noted that phasing out the turnover tax and raising the VAT rate would
result in an uneven distribution of the tax burden on VAT payers. The authorities argued that they
need to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the revenue cost from the current tax policy setting.
Staff supported this view and noted that the proposed tax policy measures would help prepare the
budget for the loss in nontax revenue from the expected closure of the U.S. transit center at the
Manas airport in 2014.

7

The fiscal impulse from the nongold primary structural deficit excluding grants is similar to the one from the
nongold overall structural deficit excluding grants.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Box 4. Kyrgyz Republic: Computing Structural Fiscal Balances
The nongold structural balance excluding grants (the structural balance) shows gradual fiscal consolidation
that should be maintained going forward.¹ In 2009, the structural deficit reached about 12 percent of GDP.
Since then, the authorities have been gradually reducing the structural deficit but the dependence on
external grants remains strong at 3 percent of GDP on average in 2010–12. While the conventional deficit
measure points toward some fiscal expansion in 2012 and 2013, the structural balance shows a negative
fiscal impulse, which is similar to the fiscal impulse from the nongold primary structural deficit excluding
grants. The cyclically adjusted deficit in 2013, however, indicates a positive fiscal impulse, but this is largely
explained by the recovery in the gold sector. To bring the deficit to a sustainable level, the authorities will
need to reduce the structural balance to 5 percent of GDP by 2017, implying annual consolidation of
1 percent of GDP. With a structural deficit of 5 percent of GDP, the unadjusted deficit would fall to
1.5 percent of GDP. At this level, with strengthened revenue collection and streamlined expenditure,
dependence on external assistance would be lower—grants would decline to 1 percent of GDP by 2017.

¹ Potential GDP was estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Using the aggregated approach (IMF, 2011) general
government revenues and expenditures were adjusted for cyclical changes using commonly assumed elasticities of one
for revenues and zero for expenditures. The nongold structural balance was derived by excluding gold-related revenues
from total revenues and using cyclically adjusted nongold GDP. No adjustment was made for asset prices (real estate and
equities) given their limited association with tax receipts (lack of asset prices data is another constraint). The results
should be interpreted with caution, however, as the quality of the estimate of potential output is constrained by the short
span of the series.

31.
More fiscal space is needed for priority spending. Although the authorities have made
progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, more work is needed (Table 15). Health,
education, and infrastructure remain underfunded, leading to diminishing capacity to generate
growth. Notwithstanding increases in spending on social assistance programs in 2012 and a
projected rise in 2013 (the cumulative increase in 2011–13 would be 60 percent), it remains low. In
addition, security-related spending may have to increase following the withdrawal of NATO troops
from Afghanistan. Staff stressed that streamlining expenditures will need to advance forcefully, in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

particular cuts in inefficient spending, and civil service and public procurement reforms would yield
fiscal savings. The authorities agreed that ensuring financial sustainability of the pension system in
the medium term and more reforms to beef up social protection and education are needed. Staff
also advised to improve targeting of social protection measures to ensure that the most vulnerable
segments of the population are reached. A Programmatic Expenditure Review conducted by the
World Bank should help the authorities to address these challenges.

Staff’s recommendations to strengthen the operational framework for monetary
policy received cautious support at the central bank. The NBKR agreed in principle with the
staff’s advice—based on recent TA and examples from other countries that have been in a similar
position—to introduce the policy rate as an instrument that will signal the monetary stance to the
economy and will serve as an operational target for open market operations, instead of the discount
rate currently used. However, the NBKR indicated that more analysis and time is needed to review
the role, function, and mechanism for setting the policy rate, as well as the role of other instruments
necessary to create a corridor around the new policy rate. The NBKR will develop a model with the
help of the IMF and EBRD to improve inflation forecasting. The NBKR agreed to further improve its
communication about the macroeconomic outlook and forecast through more regular and frequent
press briefings, expert and discussion forums, and publishing notes and articles.

C. Strengthening Balance of Payments Stability
34.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with fundamentals (see
Selected Issues Note “Exchange Rate Assessment and Reserve Adequacy in the Kyrgyz
Republic”). The REER has not changed materially since the previous assessment conducted in
mid-2011. Current estimates indicate a small undervaluation of 2.1 percent on average (Text Table
5). Although the current account deficit widened substantially, the nominal exchange rate
depreciated by 2 percent in 2012, mainly supported by strong capital inflows from official

assistance.8 With the NBKR intervening in the exchange market only in early 2012, the volume of net
foreign exchange sales was substantially lower than in 2011. Staff and the NBKR shared the view that
maintaining exchange rate flexibility has been crucial for the Kyrgyz Republic to absorb shocks
during the crisis and that this practice should continue. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff
assessment of the exchange rate.9

However, continuous current account deficits remain a concern for balance of
payment stability (see Selected Issues Note “Exchange Rate Assessment and Reserve
Adequacy in the Kyrgyz Republic”). The large deficit reflects insufficient national savings relative
to investments supported by sizable official external resources. While supporting investment is
needed for growth, the accompanying wide current account deficit increases external vulnerabilities.
The assessment of foreign reserve adequacy shows that the current level of reserves may not be
sufficiently resilient to external shocks or further disruptions in gold production. If the recent drop in
the gold price (by US$200 per ounce) lasts

Balance of payments data remains deficient and subject to uncertainties. The authorities are addressing these
deficiencies with the help of IMF TA.

The Kyrgyz Republic maintains a Multiple Currency Practice (MCP), which predates the ECF arrangement. The official
rate may differ by more than 2 percent from market rates because it is based on the average transaction weighted
rate of the preceding day. In practice, this has never happened. New trading software in the foreign exchange
market, which is being tested currently, is expected to eliminate the existing segmentation of the foreign exchange
market and remove the MCP.

D. Improving Competitiveness Through Structural Reforms
36.
Staff argued that despite improvements in the business climate legislation,
implementation is lagging behind (see Selected Issues Note “Business Environment and
Governance”). Weak economic governance and a high level of perceived corruption are still seen as
key hurdles to the development of the Kyrgyz economy. The authorities agreed that creating a level
playing field for all businesses and more decisive business environment and governance reforms are
needed to boost medium- and long-term growth, promote diversification, increase FDI, and raise
employment. The government is also committed to resolve the dispute with Centerra constructively
to ensure that it does not lead to disruptions in gold production and hurt the overall investment
climate. It agreed that a stable and predictable investment climate with proper contract
enforcement, strengthened property rights, less red tape, and addressing corruption are essential
for attracting investment and spurring private sector-led growth.
37.
Staff emphasized the importance of strengthening transparency and accountability in
the energy sector. Below cost-recovery electricity tariffs, weak governance, and a poor regulatory
framework render the energy sector financially unviable and unattractive for investment. Energy
sector finances suffer from a long overdue need to raise domestic electricity tariffs, which the
government finds difficult to implement on the back of political economy considerations. To date,
poor management of the sector has led to asset dilapidation. The quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy
sector, estimated at around 3 percent of GDP, is unsustainable with the current tariffs at below cost
recovery levels.
38.
The staff reiterated that the State Development Bank (SDB) will have to operate in line
with principles of good governance and transparency (see Selected Issues Note “Best
Practices for Establishing Development Banks”). The authorities are drafting the regulations of
the State Development Bank (SDB) in line with the law approved by parliament. The government
agreed that all SDB regulations need to be consistent with international best practices and principles
of good governance and transparency. The authorities reiterated their commitment to cooperate
closely with IMF staff and the other donors on the SDB charter (LOI ¶15).
39.
The full effect of possible accession to the Kazakhstan-Russia-Belarus Customs Union
(CU) is unclear at this stage and will depend on the outcome of negotiations. This year, the
authorities intend to develop a road map for joining the CU. The road map will define the legal and
technical framework of accession compliant with WTO requirements. Accession to the CU is
expected to secure the current concessional terms for oil products imported from the CU countries,
mainly Russia. External tariffs for non-CU countries could increase, reducing the Kyrgyz Republic’s
attractiveness for Chinese imports for re-export to other CIS countries. The authorities noted that
over time, accession could enable the Kyrgyz Republic to take advantage of increased regional
trade, which could boost investment in the country. Staff advised the authorities to carefully

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

examine the challenges as well as the benefits of accession to the CU. The authorities have
commissioned an in-depth study on the impact of CU accession.10

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The Kyrgyz economy is recovering well after contracting in 2012, but vulnerabilities
remain. The disruption in production in the largest gold-mining company took a heavy toll on the
economy, resulting in a negative overall growth rate and a higher current account deficit. GDP in
2013 is expected to grow by 7.4 percent, and inflation should settle at around 7 percent.
Persistent current account deficits remain a concern for balance of payments stability.
However, beginning in 2013 the current account deficit is projected to decline mainly on the back of
higher export earnings and robust growth of remittances. A slowdown of growth in the main trade
partners, Russia and Kazakhstan, or disruptions in gold production and lower-than-expected gold
prices, pose risks.
41.
Improving the business climate, governance, and institutions remains a key pillar of
sustainable and inclusive growth. A stable and predictable investment climate and addressing
perceived corruption will be essential for attracting more investment. Evenhanded and consistent
application of the existing business legislation would improve business confidence and foster high
and sustainable private sector-led growth. The authorities’ continued commitment to cooperate
with staff on the setup of the SDB is welcome and will help ensure that the SDB is established in line
with the commitments under the ECF arrangement and does not jeopardize macro-financial stability.
42.
Restoring fiscal sustainability will be essential, as the budget has become more
dependent on external assistance since the 2009 global and 2010 domestic crises. In the near
term, fiscal consolidation is expected to be achieved through nonpriority expenditure restraint, PFM
reforms, and further strengthening tax administration. Over the medium term, creating a sound and
predictable revenue base and reducing the dependency on external assistance will play a pivotal role
in reducing the structural deficit. The recent move of the tax policy function back to the ministry of
finance is welcome as it should help shield tax policy decisions from political considerations and
pave the way for better revenue performance in the future. The authorities are also mindful of the
need to create fiscal space for priority spending, such as health, education, and infrastructure
accompanied with the improvement in the quality of spending. The planned work on pension
reform will be instrumental to make the pension system more equitable and affordable and
financially viable in the future.
43.
Tight monetary policy continues to be warranted to keep inflation at bay. The central
bank needs to stand ready to mop up excess liquidity through NBKR notes and gradually increase
the policy rate to better signal the monetary stance to the market. The NBKR needs to effectively use
10

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development highlights in its “Transition Report 2012: Integration
across Borders” that the CU could bring benefits, but also costs and risks to its member countries. The report
emphasizes that at this early stage, assessing potential costs and benefits for CU members more thoroughly is
premature.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the recent IMF TA findings and recommendations to overhaul its current monetary policy
framework, notwithstanding its limited means to impact economic activity and inflation. This will lay
the ground work for a more sophisticated monetary policy framework that will enable the NBKR to
exercise better control over inflation. It is crucial that the NBKR continues resisting pressures to lend
in support of the economic growth.
44.
The financial system is broadly stable, but vulnerabilities remain. Although it took
longer than anticipated, the sale of Zalkar is welcome and should help boost confidence in the
financial sector. However, it will be essential that the bank is in full compliance with capital
requirements by end-2013. Disposing of the remaining 10 percent of the bank’s shares would
reaffirm the government’s commitment to strengthen financial sector stability. The banking code,
once approved, will constitute a milestone toward restoring confidence in the banking system,
leveling the playing field and setting the stage for higher private savings. It will also strengthen the
NBKRs independence in dealing with problem banks. It is essential that the key features of the Code
are preserved during the parliamentary approval process. In particular, compulsory bank liquidation
should be an out-of-court procedure and the NBKR’s autonomy and governance should be further
enhanced. Timely enactment of the amendments to the AML/CFT Law (customer due diligence,
supervisory framework, and the Financial Intelligence Unit) and to the relevant provisions of the
Criminal Code, and the Payment System Law will be necessary to avoid the very strong possibility
that the Kyrgyz Republic is placed on the FATF AML/CFT strategic deficiencies black list.
45.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth review and approval of the request for a
waiver of nonobservance of the continuous PC on the ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new
nonconcessional debt by the public sector based on corrective actions being taken. Staff also
recommends approval of the request for modification of the performance criteria for end-June 2013,
and establishment of new performance criteria for end-December 2013. The modified performance
criteria and policies for the remainder of 2013 are appropriate to achieve the program’s objectives.
46.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic be held
in accordance with the Board Decision No. 14747-(10/96), adopted September 28, 2010 (as
amended), on Article IV consultation cycles.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
May 20, 2013

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th street, N.W.
Washington, DC, 20431
USA

Dear Ms. Lagarde:
The third review of our economic and financial program, supported by an arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF), was completed by the IMF Executive Board on December 3, 2012. We
are grateful to the IMF for its continued support of our economic reform program.
The ECF arrangement continues to play a critical role in our efforts to maintain macroeconomic
stability and promote sustainable and inclusive growth in a low inflation environment. The program
has been fundamental in stabilizing the Kyrgyz economy and in consolidating much-needed
financial support from donors following the 2010 events. While the economy rebounded strongly in
2011, 2012 turned out to be a challenging year. The political environment has been stable since a
new cabinet took over in September 2012, but the disruption in gold production in the largest
gold-mining company took a heavy toll on the economy with negative overall growth and a higher
current account deficit.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the program remains broadly on track and the government is
committed to the reform path under the ECF arrangement. For the fourth review of the
ECF-supported program, all performance criteria, except one continuous performance criterion, and
all but one of the structural benchmarks were met. However, indicative targets on reserve money
and state government tax collections were missed. Structural reforms continued in line with our
commitments in the Letter of Intent (LOI) and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) dated June 2, 2011 and the LOIs dated November 17, 2011; April 12, 2012; and November
14, 2012. The government has submitted the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) law and the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code to parliament in
December 2012. We have revised the privatization strategy of the Settlement and Savings Company
to ensure the disposal of a majority government stake and adopted it on February 27, 2013. We
have made significant progress in drafting the new Banking Code with the help of the IMF resident
legal advisor and submitted the Code to the government in March 2013. We adopted a government
resolution on the procedures for submission of budgets of the next 10 largest state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) to be approved and monitored by the government. Regrettably, we were not able

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

to sell Zalkar Bank within the timeframe under the ECF arrangement. However, we managed to sell
Zalkar Bank to a fit and proper buyer in early May. The “Electrical Stations”—one of the 10 largest
SOEs—signed a nonconcessional loan agreement with the Eurasian Development Bank, in the
amount of US$30 million on February 21, 2013, leading to the nonobservance of the continuous
quantitative performance criterion on the contracting of new nonconcessional external debt.
In view of the broadly successful implementation of the program to date and our continued
commitment to the program, we request completion of the fourth review under the
ECF-supported program, and a waiver for missing the continuous quantitative performance criterion
on the ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt based on
corrective actions being taken. We request the fifth disbursement under the ECF arrangement in the
amount of SDR 9.514 million (US$14 million). We ask that the fifth and sixth disbursements under
the ECF arrangement be channeled to the budget. Moreover, we request the modification of the
end-June 2013 quantitative performance criteria to reflect the changed macroeconomic outlook.
The government believes that the economic and financial policies set forth in our LOI and MEFP of
June 2, 2011, LOIs of November 17, 2011; April 12, 2012; and November 14, 2012, supplemented
with this LOI and the modified quantitative performance criteria and updated structural benchmarks
(Tables 1 and 2, respectively) are adequate to meet the objectives of the ECF arrangement. During
the period of the ECF arrangement, the Kyrgyz government will continue to maintain a policy
dialogue with the Fund and stands ready to take additional measures as needed. We will consult
with Fund staff on such measures and in advance of revisions contained in the MEFP dated June 2,
2011, LOIs of November 17, 2011; April 12, 2012; and November 14, 2012 and this updated LOI in
accordance with Fund policies.
As in the past, the government of the Kyrgyz Republic agrees to publish this letter and other
ECF-related documents circulated to the IMF Executive Board on the IMF website.
I. Policies for the Remainder of the Year and Beyond
1.
The policies and commitments set out in the LOI and MEFP dated June 2, 2011, the LOIs
dated November 17, 2011; April 12, 2012; and November 14, 2012, remain valid and are updated
with this LOI.
2.

Maintaining macroeconomic stability remains the cornerstone of our program.



Growth in 2013 is expected to rebound on the account of the recovery in the gold production
and continued strong performance in the nongold sector. We expect growth to be 7 percent on
average over the next three years, before stabilizing at 5 percent thereafter.



Twelve-month inflation dropped slightly over the first three months of 2013 mainly because of a
continued decline in food prices. We will continue to keep monetary conditions tight to maintain
inflation in single digits in 2013 and beyond.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC



The current account deficit is projected to decline in 2013, mainly reflecting the recovery in gold
exports. We anticipate that the current account deficit will continue to decline over the medium
term.



Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue in line with the path set out under the ECF
arrangement. The fiscal deficit is projected at 5.3 percent in 2013 and expected to decline to
2.6 percent by 2015.



Public debt in percent of GDP is projected to remain on its downward path in the medium term.

3.
We are mindful of the risks to our medium-term projections. A deterioration of global
economic conditions could spill over to the Kyrgyz economy through reduced external demand and
lower remittances from Russia and Kazakhstan. Moreover, a sustained increase in international food
and fuel prices could put pressure on inflation and exacerbate external vulnerabilities.
A. Fiscal Policy
4.
Because of shortfalls in revenues and external financing in 2012, we cut nonpriority
outlays, while safeguarding critical social expenditures. Lower gold production has led to a
decline in gold-related revenues. Delays in implementing structural measures agreed with the World
Bank added to revenue and financing shortfalls. The revenue-smoothing arrangement, which we
negotiated with the Kumtor gold company, and buoyant customs revenues throughout the first nine
months of 2012 have partially offset the shortfall in revenues. However, growth in customs revenues
decelerated in late 2012. Owing to the decline in the overall resource envelope, we reduced
spending on goods and services and capital projects while maintaining social outlays. At the same
time, the implementation of foreign-financed energy infrastructure projects was faster than
expected. In late 2012, we received external grants that led to a better-than-anticipated overall fiscal
deficit—5.4 percent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP projected earlier.
5.
We continue to place strong emphasis on fiscal consolidation in 2013 and the medium
term. The government is basing the 2013 budget on conservative revenue forecasts, nonpriority
expenditure restraint, and social considerations. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to decline to
5.3 percent of GDP, in line with our commitment to consolidate the fiscal position.


We do not expect the exceptionally strong growth in customs revenues to continue in 2013.
Therefore, tax revenues are no longer anticipated to reach budgeted levels. Nontax revenues in
percent of GDP are also expected to decline because of the reform to regularize government
provided fee-based services.



We are continuing our efforts to strengthen tax administration and to reduce noncompliance,
including with the support from the IMF. We are implementing a formal compliance
improvement plan for several sectors that pose a significant revenue compliance risk. Technical
assistance from the IMF would help us identify key challenges in tax administration and provide
us with recommendations regarding future priorities and options for reforms.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC



The government remains committed to reducing the overall wage bill in percent of GDP. Savings
generated by the ongoing civil service reform will allow us to increase wages in segments of the
public sector. The ongoing public procurement reform, including the pending introduction of
e-procurement, will also generate fiscal savings by reducing outlays on goods and services.



We will ensure that the pension increase in 2013 continues to be tied to the changes in the
minimum subsistence level. We intend to submit the draft pension reform concept note to
parliament in October. This concept note will propose various options for making the pension
system more equitable and affordable, but will also discuss ways to ensure financial
sustainability of the pension system.

6.
We continue to improve debt management and to reduce the debt service burden on
the budget. The medium-term debt management strategy, adopted as part of conditionality under
the ECF arrangement, will be updated this year. We acknowledge that transforming the government
securities market into a deep and liquid market will take time. To develop the domestic debt market,
we are improving the operational infrastructure for the primary market of government securities at
the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), which will remain the government agent for
conducting primary auctions and the central depository for all government securities. We
discontinued direct sales of government securities by the ministry of finance and will ensure that the
sales take place only at organized auctions. The upcoming Financial Stability Assessment Program
will assist us in identifying reform options to deepen the domestic debt market.
7.
We are strengthening the role of the ministry of finance in core aspects of fiscal policy.
We returned the tax policy function to the ministry of finance and will create a new, adequately
staffed, department on tax policy in the ministry of finance (structural benchmark). This department
will become the focal point on all tax policy-related matters. The government expects
comprehensive technical assistance from the IMF in this area. We expanded the coverage of the
reporting requirements for the 10 largest state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to 20. The expansion of
the list should help mobilize additional revenues and limit potential fiscal costs through improved
monitoring. We will ensure that all reports from these SOEs are shared regularly with the ministry of
finance. To prevent the 10 largest SOEs, which are part of the public sector, from contracting
nonconcessional loans, which recently led to nonobservance of the continuous performance
criterion, we will issue a government resolution requiring these SOEs to provide all information on
their borrowing plans and debt service. With this information, the ministry of finance can prevent
the SOEs from contracting nonconcessional loans or incurring external arrears.
8.
We continue our work on public financial management (PFM) reform and will work
with parliament to ensure that the new Budget Code is in line with recent IMF technical
assistance advice. The government has recently updated the action plan on PFM reforms. As part of
this plan, we have developed a draft law on public procurement, which we will submit to parliament
for approval in June. This law is expected to enhance the transparency and efficiency of public
spending. We will issue a regulation on expanding the coverage of the commitment register to
include local budgets and special means. The ministry of finance will also develop and approve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

regulations on accounting and financial reporting using the unified chart of accounts on the basis of
international norms (structural benchmarks). We expect that these measures will enhance control
over public spending.
B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
9.
The NBKR will maintain a tight monetary policy stance to keep inflation in single digits
in 2013 and beyond. Core inflation remains stubbornly high and the expected recovery in
economic activity this year may add to inflationary pressures. We will respond to these pressures by
further tightening monetary policy. However, declining international food and fuel prices are
expected to partly offset the pressures. We acknowledge that second-round effects of unexpected
external price shocks will require further policy actions. The NBKR will maintain its policy of
intervening in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive volatility and ensure orderly
market conditions.
10.
We plan to strengthen the operational framework for monetary policy in order to
improve transmission channels. We welcome suggestions of the recent IMF technical assistance
mission in inflation modeling and monetary tools. We will review the role, function, and mechanism
for setting the policy rate to better signal the monetary stance to the economy, as well as the role of
other instruments necessary to create a corridor around the new policy rate. To better withdraw
excess liquidity, we will conduct timely and sufficient OMOs and reassess the maturity of notes used
for OMOs. The potential adverse impact on NBKR profits will not be a constraint to the
implementation of monetary policy. The NBKR and the ministry of finance will continue the close
cooperation to facilitate liquidity management. We will further improve the NBKR’s communication
about the macroeconomic outlook and the NBKR’s forecast through more regular and frequent
press briefings, expert and discussion forums, and publishing notes and articles. We will develop a
model with the help of the IMF and EBRD during this year to improve inflation forecasting and
better understand economic relationships in our country.
11.
We plan to improve reserve management in line with IMF technical assistance
recommendations. The NBKR will develop a comprehensive strategic asset allocation framework
and will continue to develop the investment policy further. We intend to review governance
procedures and the role of different committees, as well as the risk management framework related
to the reserve management activities. We will provide adequate resources (IT, staffing, training, and
support from other units) to support the reserve management function in the NBKR.
12.
Our financial sector remains broadly sound. Banks are well capitalized and liquid, and
nonperforming loans continue to decline. Deposits and loans have also increased. We continue our
efforts to address remaining vulnerabilities in the banking sector:


42

The government has intensified its efforts to sell Zalkar Bank to a fit and proper buyer. In early
May, we managed to sell 90 percent of Zalkar’s shares to one of the shareholders of ITB bank of
Russia (ITB holding). We will ensure that the bank is in full compliance with capital requirements
by end-December 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC



We will send the Banking Code to parliament by end-September 2013, in line with our
commitments under the ECF arrangement. We will ensure to communicate to parliament the
major benefits of the new code so that it is approved in line with IMF TA advice.

13.
We will work with parliament to ensure that the amendments to the AML/CFT legal
framework and the payment system law are adopted swiftly and in line with Fund technical
assistance. The Fund technical assistance missions discussed with us the draft provisions of the
Criminal Code (on the criminalization of money laundering and financing of terrorism, and
confiscation), the Terrorist Assets Freezing Regulations, and the AML/CFT Law (customer due
diligence, supervisory framework, and the Financial Intelligence Unit) that were altered during the
parliamentary committee review process. We will urge parliament to bring the relevant provisions of
these legislations and the provisions on identification of suspicious transactions and on State
Financial Intelligence Service in line with IMF TA advice. We will also urge parliament to adopt and
publish the AML/CFT law together with the payment system law swiftly. Timely action would help
avoid that the Financial Action Task Force places the Kyrgyz Republic on its black list in June 2013.
C. Structural Policies
14.
We recognize the need to further improve the business environment, a key pillar of
sustainable and inclusive growth. We acknowledged that weak governance is still seen as one of
the key impediments to the development of our economy. We will put all our efforts toward a
constructive resolution of the dispute with Centerra to ensure that it does not lead to disruptions in
gold production. A stable and predictable investment climate with proper contract enforcement,
strengthened property rights, less red tape, and addressing corruption are essential for attracting
investment and spurring private sector-led growth.
15.
We will continue close cooperation with IMF staff and other donors on the set-up and
operations of the state development bank (SDB). We are also studying successful examples of
development banks in other countries and will reflect on their experience. The government will
ensure that all regulations of the SDB currently being drafted are consistent with international best
practice and principles of good governance and transparency. All public resources to the SDB will be
channeled through the budget.
D. Program Monitoring
16.
The ECF-supported program will continue to be monitored through quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. Quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets for March 2013, June 2013, September 2013, December 2013, March
2014, and June 2014 and continuous performance criteria are set out in Table 1 and structural
benchmarks are set out in Table 2. Program reviews will continue to be conducted semi-annually,
based on end-June and end-December test dates. The fifth and sixth reviews are expected to take
place on or after November 15, 2013, and on or after April 30, 2014, respectively. The
understandings between the Kyrgyz authorities and IMF staff regarding the quantitative

Attachment I. Revised Technical Memorandum of
Understanding
May 20, 2013
I.

Introduction

1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets and
adjustors, and establishes the content and frequency of the data to be provided to IMF staff for
program monitoring related to the economic program supported by an arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The indicators presented in Table 1 of the Letter of Intent dated
May 20, 2013 reflect the understandings on quantitative performance criteria reached between
the authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic and staff of the IMF.
II. Quantitative Performance Criteria
A. Definitions and Concepts
2.
Test dates. Quantitative performance criteria are set semi-annually starting June 30,
2011 through December 31, 2013, and are to be met at the end of each period.
3.
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR). The NBKR is the central bank of the
country and is responsible for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy, bank
supervision, and the payment system. For the purpose of the program, the NBKR includes all its
central and regional offices.
4.
Public sector. For the purpose of the program, the public sector comprises the general
government, the NBKR, the 10 largest nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and agencies
in which the government owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but which are not
consolidated in the budget, as listed in Table 1a), and any other newly created public
development institution. The State budget comprises central and local government budgets. The
general government budget includes the State and Social Fund budgets.
5.
Foreign-financed Public Investment Program (PIP) loans and grants. The foreign
financed PIP is a program of investments in infrastructure and social sectors agreed by the
general government of the Kyrgyz Republic and its donors (including but not limited to
international financial organizations). The PIP is fully financed by related grants and loans.
6.
Program loans and grants are loans and grants received by the general government for
direct budget support from external donors and not related to PIP financing.
7.
The stock of external payment arrears for program monitoring purposes is defined as the
end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid within the grace period
specified in the relevant debt contract, including contractual and late interest. For arrears to exist,
a creditor must claim payment of amounts due and not paid. Amounts in dispute are not
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

considered arrears. Arrears for which a clearance framework/rescheduling or restructuring has
been agreed with the creditor are not considered arrears for program monitoring purposes.
Program arrears would include any debt service due under such agreements that has not been
paid.
8.
Concessional and nonconcessional debt. Concessional debt is defined as debt with a
grant element equivalent of 35 percent or more. The grant element of a debt is the difference
between the present value (PV) of the debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of
the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt with a
maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of debt
and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month
average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same margins for
differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to
29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more). The debt refers also to commitments contracted
or guaranteed and for which value has not been received. The calculation of concessionality will
take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity, grace period, payment
schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees. The calculation is performed by the
authorities and verified by the IMF staff based on the data provided by the authorities.
9.
Valuation changes (program exchange rates). For program monitoring, U.S.
dollar-denominated components of the NBKR’s balance sheets will be valued at the program
exchange rates. The program exchange rate of the KGS to the U.S. dollar is set at the
end-2010 exchange rate of KGS 47.0992 = US$1. The corresponding cross exchange rates and
program gold price for the duration of the program are provided in Table 2.
B. Quantitative Performance Criteria
Floor on net international reserves of the NBKR in convertible currencies1
Definitions
10. Net international reserves (NIR) of the NBKR. The floor on NIR will be calculated as the
difference between total international reserve assets and total international reserve liabilities of
the NBKR in convertible currencies. Total international reserve assets of the NBKR are defined as
the NBKR holdings of monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, reserve position in the IMF, and any
holdings of convertible foreign currencies in cash or with foreign banks, and debt instruments
1

Convertible currencies are defined as currencies that are freely usable for settlements of international
transactions.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

issued by nonresidents that are liquid. Accrued interest on deposits, loans, and debt securities
are included in reserve assets and liabilities, correspondingly. Reserve assets pledged as collateral
or otherwise encumbered, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and illiquid assets
of the NBKR are excluded. Also excluded are net forward positions, defined as the difference
between the face value of foreign-currency denominated NBKR off-balance sheet claims on
nonresidents and foreign currency obligations to both residents and nonresidents. Total
international reserve liabilities of the NBKR in convertible currencies are defined as the sum of
Kyrgyz Republic’s outstanding liabilities to the IMF and other convertible currency liabilities to
nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year. NIR is not affected when
foreign assets are received by the NBKR through foreign currency swaps with resident financial
institutions. Total international reserves and NIR decline with the provision of foreign assets by
the NBKR through foreign currency swaps with resident financial institutions.2 For program
monitoring purposes, total international reserve assets and liabilities will be valued at the
program exchange rates as described in paragraph 9. Thus calculated, the stock of net
international reserves in convertible currencies amounted to US$1,819 million on December 31,
2012.
11. Net foreign assets (NFA) of the NBKR. NFA consist of net international reserve assets
plus other net foreign assets, including the medium- and long-term foreign obligations of the
NBKR, other net claims on CIS countries, reserve assets pledged as collateral or
otherwise encumbered, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, and illiquid assets.
For program monitoring purposes, other NFA will also be valued at program exchange rates.
Adjustors
12. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward/downward to the full extent of any
excess/shortfall in program grants and program loans, as given in Table 3 and upward/downward
to the full extent that amortization and interest payments of public external debt is less/more
than the amortization and interest payments given in Table 3.
Ceiling on the net domestic assets of the NBKR
Definitions
13. Net domestic assets of the NBKR (NDA) are defined as reserve money of the NBKR
(defined below), minus NFA as defined above. Items in foreign currencies will be valued at
program exchange rates.

2

In case of a foreign currency swap that involves receipt of foreign currency by the NBKR and transfer of local
currency to a resident financial institution, total international reserves increase, NIR is unchanged, and net claims
on domestic banks in soms increase. In case of a foreign currency swap that involves transfer of foreign currency
by the NBKR and receipt of local currency from a resident financial institution, total international assets and NIR
decline, while the NBKR net claims on resident banks remain unchanged.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

14. Thus defined, NDA consist of: (a) net claims to the general government from the NBKR; (b)
net claims to other depositary corporations by the NBKR; (c) net claims on other financial
corporations; and (d) all other net assets of the NBKR (other items net). Thus defined, the stock of
NDA amounted to minus KGS 16,271 million on December 31, 2012.
Adjustors
15. The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward/upward to the full extent of any
excess/shortfall in program grants and program loans, as given in Table 3 and downward/upward
to the full extent that amortization and interest payments of public external debt is less/more
than the amortization and interest payments given in Table 3.
Ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government
Definitions
16. The overall cash deficit of the general government will be measured from the financing
side (below the line) at current exchange rates and will be defined as the sum of:
a) the change in the stock of net claims of the domestic banking system and nonfinancial
institutions and households on the general government. The change in the stock of net
claims of the domestic banking system on the general government is defined as the
change in the stock of the banking system claims on the general government, less the
change in the stock of all deposits of the general government with the banking system.
The claims of the banking system on the general government include: bank loans to the
general government; any securities issued by the general government and held by
domestic banks, with the exception of those issued in relation with bank rescue
operations; and overdrafts on the current accounts of the general government with
banks;
b) the change in the stock of net claims of foreign governments, banking systems, and
nonfinancial institutions and households on the general government;
c) net privatization receipts, i.e. any new sales net of purchases of shares;
d) net foreign loans disbursed to the general government for budgetary support; and
e) net foreign loans disbursed to the general government for PIP financing.
17. The quantitative performance criteria for the fiscal balance are calculated on the projected
exchange rate. Reporting and adjustments, as defined above, will be made using current
exchange rates.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Adjustors
18. The ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government will be
adjusted downward to the full extent of any excess in program grants, as given in Table 3. The
ceiling on the cumulative overall cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted
downward to the full extent of any shortfall in program loans, as given in Table 3 and
upward/downward to the full extent that PIP loans are more/less than PIP loans given in Table 3.
Ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt and
accumulation of new external payment arrears by the public sector (continuous
quantitative performance criteria)
Definitions
19. Debt. In connection with the contracting or guaranteeing of short-, medium-, and
long-term external debt by any entity of the public sector, for program purposes, the definition
of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No. 6230–(79/140, Point 9, as revised on August 31,
2009 (Decision No. 14416–(09/91)) and reads as follows:
a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the
principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number
of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
i.

loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);

ii.

suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and

iii.

leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover
the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that
is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise
to debt.
20.

For program purposes, external debt is defined based on the residency of the creditor.

21. External debt ceilings apply to the contracting or guaranteeing by the public sector (as
defined in section II. A., paragraph 4) of nonconcessional external debt, i.e. external debt with
grant element of less than 35 percent (see section II. A., paragraph 7), except normal short-term
import-related credits and NBKR international reserve liabilities.
22. Exclusions from the external debt limits. Disbursements by the IMF are excluded from
the ceilings on external debt. Also excluded from external debt ceilings is the contracting or
guaranteeing of new external debt that constitutes a rescheduling or refinancing of existing
external debt on the terms more favorable to the debtor.
23. Guarantees. For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor
(involving payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the
public sector to finance partially or in full a shortfall incurred by the debtor.
24. New external payments arrears. The ceiling on accumulation of new external payments
arrears is a continuous quantitative performance criterion.
C. Indicative Targets
Ceiling on reserve money
25. Reserve money is defined as the NBKR’s national currency liabilities to the economy,
which includes currency issued and liabilities to other depositary corporations.
Cumulative floor on state government tax collections
26. Tax collections in cash correspond to the line “Tax Receipts” in the Treasury Report and
comprise the following categories: tax on income and profits; taxes on goods and services;
specific taxes on services; turnover taxes; taxes on property; taxes on international trade; and
other taxes. Tax collections include collections of tax arrears but exclude tax offsets.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Cumulative floor on state government spending on targeted social assistance
27. Targeted social assistance spending comprises state government spending on Unified
Monthly Benefit (UMB) and Monthly Social Benefit (MSB) programs.
III. Reporting Requirements Under the Arrangement
28. The government and the NBKR will provide the IMF with the necessary economic and
financial statistical data to monitor economic developments and the quantitative targets
(see Table 4). In particular, the government and the NBKR will provide the following specific
information.3
A. The Balance Sheet of the NBKR
29. The NBKR will provide to the IMF its analytical balance sheet on a daily basis. The
information provided will clearly identify the following items in the definitions specified above:
the gross foreign assets and liabilities of the NBKR, decomposed by currency and instrument for
the assets and by currency and creditor for the liabilities (decomposition provided on a monthly
basis); the net foreign assets of the NBKR; the net international reserves of the NBKR; mediumand long-term liabilities; the net domestic assets of the NBKR; net credit from the NBKR to the
general government, disaggregated by state government and the KRDF; net credit from the
NBKR to commercial banks; net claims to other financial corporations; other items net; and
reserve money. The balance sheet will be provided using both actual and program exchange
rates. The above information will be provided to the IMF Resident Representative and/or
transmitted by e-mail to the IMF.
B. Monetary Survey
30. Monthly banking system data, in the form of monetary surveys of the banking sector and
other depository corporations, will be reported to the IMF by the NBKR within 16 days of the end
of the month. The information provided will clearly identify the following items: net foreign
assets and net domestic assets of the banking system, medium- and long-term liabilities, net
credit from the banking system to the general government disaggregated by the state
government, the social fund and the KRDF, net claims to the rest of the economy, other items
net, and broad money. The monetary survey will be provided using both program and actual
exchange rates.
31. The NBKR will provide monthly data to the IMF within seven days after the end of the
month on the amount of holdings of treasury bills, treasury bonds and other securities issued by
the state government, differentiated by the following categories of holders: the NBKR; resident
3

banks; resident nonbanks (including separately the social fund and deposit insurance fund); and
nonresidents. The information will be provided in both the book (nominal) value and the actual
value, where applicable.
C. International Reserves and Key Financial Indicators
32. The NBKR will provide detailed monthly data within 20 days from the end of the month on
the composition of both its gross and net international reserves in convertible currencies and
holdings of monetary gold. These data will be provided at two alternative sets of the exchange
rates and the gold price: first, at those used to derive the NFA position in the NBKR accounts;
and second, at those specified in the program (see Section I). The NBKR will also provide data on
net foreign financing flows, including disbursements of program loans and grants, amortization,
interest payments on external debt, interest income on reserves, other direct foreign currency
payments by the government and the NBKR. In addition, weekly reports should be sent to the
IMF on (a) nominal exchange rates (including the official and interbank exchange rates), foreign
exchange interbank market turnover, and the volume of NBKR foreign exchange sales and
purchases in the domestic interbank market and with other parties, on a daily basis; and (b)
treasury bill yields and the amount of treasury bill sales and redemptions on a weekly basis every
Monday. On the twenty-fifth day of the month following the reference month, the NBKR will
provide indicators of financial soundness of the banking system, including the ratios of
regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets, nonperforming loans to total loans, and return on
equity, as well as data on bank deposit and lending rates by maturity.
D. External Debt
33. The ministry of finance, together with the NBKR, will provide monthly information on the
disbursements, principal and interest payment—both actual and falling due—on contracting and
guaranteeing of medium- and long-term external loans by the state government, nonfinancial
public enterprises, and the NBKR; and any stock of outstanding arrears on external debt service
payments within 21 days of the end of each month. In addition, the ministry of finance will report
the total amount of outstanding government guarantees and external arrears on a monthly basis.
While the NBKR will provide the debt service payment data on private debt, the ministry of
finance will provide data on debt service on public and publicly guaranteed loans.
E. Budgetary and Extra Budgetary Data
34. In addition to the monthly treasury report, the Social Fund will report monthly on its
operations. This information will be provided to the Fund staff within 26 days from the end of

Status of HIPC and MDRI Assistance
On November 30, 2011, the Executive Board considered the addition of income and indebtedness
criteria for end-2010 to the HIPC Initiative framework, which resulted in the removal of the Kyrgyz
Republic from the ring-fenced list of eligible countries.
Safeguards Assessments
An update assessment with respect to the new ECF approved by the IMF Board on June 20,
2011 was completed on October 28, 2011. The assessment concluded that the National Bank of the
Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) has established important safeguards in financial reporting, external, and
internal audits. While the chairperson is accountable to parliament, governance arrangements need
to be strengthened by establishing independent board oversight and more effective reporting by
the Audit Committee that became operational following the 2009 assessment. The proposed new
Banking Code also presents an opportunity to strengthen institutional autonomy and giving the
NBKR sole responsibility for the governance of official foreign exchange reserves. Previous
assessments were completed in April 2009, October 2005, and January 2002.
Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of the Kyrgyz Republic has been the som (100 tyiyn = 1 som) since May 15, 1993. The
de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating arrangement. The NBKR participates and intervenes in
the interbank foreign exchange market to limit exchange rate volatility as necessary. The de facto
exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes daily
the exchange rate of the som in terms of the U.S. dollar, which is determined in the interbank
foreign exchange market. The official exchange rate of the som against the dollar is calculated as the
daily weighted average of the exchange rates used in the purchase and sale transactions of dollars
conducted in the foreign exchange market through the Trade Information Electronic System (TIES)
of the NBKR for the reporting period from 3:00 pm of the previous trading day to 3:00 pm of the
current trading day. The government uses the official exchange rate for budget and tax accounting
purposes as well as for all payments between the government and enterprises and other legal
entities. The Kyrgyz Republic maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP), which predates the
arrangement, arising from the use of the official exchange rate for government transactions. The
official rate may differ by more than 2 percent from market rates because it is based on the average
transaction weighted rate of the preceding day. In practice, the official and market rates have never
differed by more than 2 percent. The new trading software that is currently being tested will enable
automatic matching and settlement of transactions and will eliminate the existing segmentation of
the foreign exchange market. The software is expected to be rolled out to banks over the next few
months and to remove the MCP. Staff does not recommend approval of this MCP.
The Kyrgyz Republic maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for the MCP discussed above
and exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons relating to the restriction of financial
transactions and the freeze of accounts of certain individuals or organizations associated with

terrorism pursuant to (i) relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and (ii) the list of current terrorist
organizations designated by the U.S. Secretary of State. The authorities have notified these
measures to the Fund in May 2007.
Article IV Consultations
The Kyrgyz Republic is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The 2011 Article IV consultation
discussions were held in April–May 2011 and were completed by the Executive Board in June
2011 (see CR No. 11/155).
FSAP Participation and ROSC Assessment
An FSAP update mission in October 2006 reviewed progress since the 2002 assessment, and the
Board considered the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) along with the fourth PRGF
review in May 2007. A fiscal ROSC mission was held in March 2001 and the ROSC Fiscal
Transparency Module was published on March 13, 2002. A data ROSC mission was held in
November 2002 and the ROSC Data Module was published in November 2003. A fiscal ROSC
reassessment was held in September 2007.
Resident Representative
The eighth resident representative of the Fund in the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Gvenetadze, took up his
post in Bishkek in October 2009.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 8, 2013)
World Bank Group strategy: The Kyrgyz Republic Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY12–13 was
discussed by the Board in August 2011. The ISN focuses on the country’s recovery and stabilization
needs, while paving the way for support for long-term development. The need for an interim
strategy approach was underscored by the fragile political, social and economic situation in the
country and the absence of a medium-term development framework upon which a full IDA strategy
could be based. Since then, the country has made important progress towards restoring stability and
a joint IDA/IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering FY14–17 is expected to be presented to
the Board in July 2013. Closely aligned to the new National Sustainable Development Strategy, the
CPS will retain its focus on improved governance with three broad areas of engagement: i) public
administration and public service delivery; ii) business environment and investment climate; and
iii) natural resources and physical infrastructure.
Budget support and investment lending
FY13 IDA Program: The FY13 IDA lending envelope envisaged an allocation of US$67.2 million for
four operations, out of which three have been approved by the Board. The Additional Financing for
Village Investment Project 2 (US$4.2 million) was approved in December 2012, the Education Sector
Support Program (US$16.5 million) was approved in March 2013, and the Second Health and Social
Protection Project (US$16.5 million) in May 2013. The Board presentation of the First (in a series of
two) Programmatic DPO (US$30 million) is currently expected in early FY14. Also in 2013, the World
Bank restructured the Financial Sector Development Project (originally approved in March 2012) and
its Board approval is expected in May 2013.
FY13 Planned Trust Funds (TF) Program: Up to US$40.2 million for: GAFSP for irrigation
(US$16.5 million), Global Fund for Education (US$12.7 million), Health Results-Based Financing
(US$11 million).
Analytical advisory activities
FY12–13 Analytical Advisory Activities (AAA) program included: programmatic Public Expenditure
Review, Kyrgyzstan Conflict Analysis Filter, Gender Assessment, programmatic Poverty Studies,
Preparation of a New Statistical Master Plan (SMP–2) and Information Matters–Transparency and
Accountability GPF grant. In addition, the World Bank has been providing technical assistance to the
mining sector and in developing a Public Sector Reform Roadmap and recently launched a Private
Sector Strategy Development activity.

Trust funds
In addition to IDA funds, the Bank manages a significant number of cofinancing and stand alone
Trust Funds (TF). The current TF portfolio amounts to a total of US$100 million including 31 Bank
and 14 Recipient Executed TFs. The largest are cofinancing for Agribusiness and Marketing
(US$4.7 million), Water Management Improvement (US$4.4 million), Second Village Investment
(US$13.7 million), Public Financial Management (US$7.5 million) and stand-alone TFs, which include
Fast Track Initiative-2 (US$6 million), EU Food Crisis Rapid Response (US$9.75 million), EITI
Implementation (US$8 million), EITI (US$6.9 million), Agricultural Productivity (US$6.8 million).
IFC program and portfolio
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) continues to contribute to sustainable private sector
development with long-term financing and advisory services to local financial institutions, and direct
financing to small enterprises for the expansion and modernization of their operations. The
engagement of IFC has accelerated in the period of 2009–12, and these efforts have been
complimentary to World Bank efforts in private sector development and development of the
financial sector. IFC will continue focusing on private sector development and aiming to increase its
investments with a particular focus on the banking, manufacturing, mining, and agribusiness sectors.
In addition, IFC is planning to participate in financing investment programs of privatized entities if
privatization is undertaken in an open and transparent manner and in line with international best
practice. In infrastructure, IFC is exploring opportunities, primarily on a sub national basis, in power
transmission, hydropower plants, and municipal utilities. In addition, an IFC PPP Advisory program is
being implemented in the Central Asia region and IFC is seeking to engage with the Kyrgyz
government to assist with privatizations and concessions. IFC PPP team provided assistance in
managing privatization of Zalkar bank and will be assisting the Government in implementing CASA
1000 energy project.
IFC strategy and program:


Increase access to finance for MSMEs by strengthening local financial institutions and providing
credit lines for MSME financing to local banks and expanding microfinance institutions.



Develop institutional capacity and support capacity building of financial institutions (including
leasing and insurance, if there are opportunities) and microfinance companies and improve
corporate governance in local enterprises.



Increase private sector participation in infrastructure through selective advisory and investment
climate engagement.



Assist the agribusiness sector directly and through MSMEs finance to banks and microfinance
companies.



Support the improvement of business environment and investment climate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Since becoming a member of IFC in 1993, the Kyrgyz Republic has received commitments totaling
more than US$120 million from IFC’s own funds to finance more than 35 projects in the financial,
banking and microfinance, oil, gas and mining sector, agribusiness, pulp, and paper sectors. New
commitments in 2012 amounted to US$10.7 million for investments in three projects representing
banking, microfinance, and infrastructure sectors. As of March 31, 2013, IFC’s committed portfolio
was US$28 million, which includes investments in eight companies, representing banking,
microfinance, real and infrastructure sectors.
IFC will continue its advisory services work in the financial sector, developing corporate governance
and improving the business environment. The Azerbaijan-Central Asia Financial Infrastructure
Project will help improve regulatory framework for credit bureaus, collateral registries and consumer
protection, enhance the system of credit reporting and build capacity of financial intermediaries in
the area of risk-management, credit underwriting and secured lending. IFC’s new Investment
Climate Project is designed to help reduce the gap between enactment of reforms and their
implementation, simplify business inspections and improve the investment climate for agribusiness.
The agribusiness component of this project is designed to support development of Food Safety
Framework and harmonization of agribusiness regulation with WTO standards, which is aimed at
enhancing export potential of agriculture produce and improving income opportunities for the
Kyrgyz farmers. Implementation of this component will be supported by IFC’s regional Food Safety
Program. IFC’s recently launched Central Asia Tax Project, focuses on tax administration reform, and
seeks to further improve risk-based approaches to tax inspections, simplify tax reporting, and VAT
administration. Under the second phase of Central Asia Corporate Governance Project (CACGP II) IFC
will continue efforts to help build sustainable local businesses through improving the corporate
governance of enterprises and banks and, at the policy level, strengthening the regulatory
framework. IFC Transformation for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) Project will continue to support
the strengthening of MFIs’ institutional capacity, help them transform into deposit-taking
institutions or banks and extend their outreach, especially to rural populations. The recently
launched Housing Microfinance Advisory Project seeks to improve the housing conditions of
low-income groups by introducing new home improvement loan products to local MFIs. Regarding
investment activities, IFC will continue working with existing clients, predominantly MFIs, focusing
on: their lending to MSMEs through credit lines; their risk management practices through advisory
services and specific lending products; and their provision of short-term trade finance. Aiming to
advance energy efficiency and renewable energy agenda, IFC will establish Regional Renewable
Energy Advisory Program, which can be utilized in the Kyrgyz Republic. The program will be
designed to help the governments improve regulatory framework for renewables, and support IFC
and non-IFC projects through provision of sectoral expertise, market assessments, product design
and financial structuring.
MIGA has supported private sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic by extending guarantees to
foreign direct investments in four projects in the manufacturing, services, and mining sectors. The
total amount of foreign direct investment facilitated by MIGA guarantees is over US$360 million.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

MIGA’s current portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic consists of guarantees for two projects in the
transport sector: an airline (Kyrgyz Airlines); and an airport services company (Manas Management
Company). The projects are owned by Austrian and Italian investors. The combined gross exposure
from these projects is US$14.8 million. Both of these projects were the subject of disputes between
the investors and the government during the last four years. The settlement between the Kyrgyz
government and investors, which was worked out in May of 2008 with MIGA’s mediating role, has
now been fully implemented by both sides. This finally resolves this matter that had been pending
for more than four years. In August 2009 MIGA's guarantee holders withdrew their claim against
MIGA and released MIGA from any liability. In addition, they have dismissed their claims against the
government, which had been pending in the London Court of International Arbitration. There were
no new MIGA projects in the Kyrgyz Republic in FY12 and FY13.
MIGA program: MIGA’s current portfolio in the Kyrgyz Republic consists of one project, financed by
Austrian and Italian investors, in support of the country’s manufacturing and services sector. The
outstanding gross exposure from this investment is US$10.8 million.
ICSID: The Kyrgyz Government lost an ICSID supported lawsuit relating to an expropriated hotel and
defaulted on the required payment. In October, the Canadian court approved the confiscation of
Kyrgyz holdings on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Kyrgyz government has contested this
decision. In April 2013, a Canadian company initiated arbitration proceedings related to a mining
concession.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ADB)
(As of March 31, 2013)
The Kyrgyz Republic joined ADB in 1994. ADB's country partnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic
is presented in the joint country support strategy (JCSS) for 2007–10. The JCSS was prepared in
cooperation with four development partners—the Swiss Cooperation, the United Kingdom's
Department for International Development, the United Nations Agencies, and the World Bank
Group. Four other development partners—the European Commission, the German Government
(presented by GTZ and KfW), International Monetary Fund, and United States Agency for
International Development joined the JCSS at the later years. In line with the country development
strategy, the JCSS identifies four priority areas: (i) promoting economic management consistent with
strong and sustained pro-poor growth; (ii) improving governance, promoting effective public
administration, and reducing corruption; (iii) building sustainable human and social capital; and
(iv) ensuring environmental sustainability and natural resources management.
A new country partnership strategy (CPS) 2013–17 is being prepared. The government and ADB
have agreed to the overall CPS 2013–17 framework, which supports the National Sustainable
Development Strategy (NSDS) 2013–17. The CPS is expected to be finalized in August 2013. ADB’s
Strategy 2020 and NSDS share a common goal of inclusive growth.
The overarching goal of the CPS 2013–17 will be inclusive economic growth. The CPS will support
the government in addressing key constraints to economic growth, and overcome uneven access to
economic opportunities to ensure that this growth includes the poor and disadvantaged groups.
The CPS will focus on the following priority sectors: (i) public sector management for better
investment climate, including access to finance; (ii) transport and logistics; (iii) energy; (iv) education
and training; and (v) water supply and sanitation (WSS). ADB has been active in these areas for some
time but will focus more strongly, within each sector, on addressing regional disparities.
ADB’s Country Operations Business Plan (COBP) for 2012–13 was approved in December 2012. The
country operations business plan, 2012–13 has been developed during the transition of both the
government strategies and the CPS. COBP 2014–16 are being discussed with the government, and
will support the priority sectors of the CPS 2013–17.
ADB is one of the major development partners in the country. All assistance provided to the Kyrgyz
Republic is from concessional ADB’s special fund resources—Asian Development Fund (ADF). The
Kyrgyz Republic has been eligible for ADF grant and loan since 2009. ADB’s annual lending began
with US$40 million in 1994 and reached the peak level of US$167.8 million in 2010. Based on the
results of the 2012 country performance assessment (CPA), the Kyrgyz Republic received an ADF
allocation of US$121.4 million for 2013–14, comprising US$53.9 million in grants and
US$67.5 million in loans. The indicative ADF resource allocation for 2015–16 is tentatively equal to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

the allocations of 2013–14, which will be confirmed by the CPAs 2013 and 2014. The country may
receive additional ADF resources for the projects of regional importance.
As of 31 March 2013, the country has received 35 loans worth US$820.4 million, 18 ADF and one
GEF grants worth US$323.3 million. The Kyrgyz Republic has also received eight grants from Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR grants) amounting to US$8.5 million. ADB is the largest funding
agency in the transport and education sectors.
The active ADB portfolio of 11 projects (total size of US$451.8 million) contained nine ADF loans
(total size of US$216.9 million) and 11 ADF grants (total size of US$254.9 million).
ADB has also provided 81 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to US$45.8 million as of
today. ADB also provides TA through the regional technical assistance facility. Among the most
recent assistance is technical assistance for developing an e-procurement strategy for the Kyrgyz
Republic.
The performance of ADB’s portfolio is partially satisfactory. Contract awards and disbursements as of
31 March 2013 reached US$0.4 million and US$4.9 million (0.6 percent and 10.2 percent of year’s
projections), respectively. The Kyrgyz portfolio has one project with actual problems and two
projects with potential problems. The two projects are potential problem projects due to delays in
implementation and disbursements, and one project is an actual problem due to delays in the
project start-up. The Community-Based Infrastructure Services Sector Project was suspended on
June 11, 2012 due to poor project management and integrity issues.
The Kyrgyz Republic is a strong advocate for regional economic cooperation, and is an active
participant in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The Kyrgyz
Republic has benefited significantly from regional road development. Following CAREC initiatives in
key areas approved at sector meetings, the Kyrgyz Republic is taking measures in trade policy and
trade facilitation sectors to increase trade and transport flow. ADB is also helping to develop
procedures and technical tools to enhance land acquisition and resettlement practices to foster
more effective infrastructure development in the region.
As of the end of 2011, cumulative direct value-added official cofinancing for the Kyrgyz Republic
since 1997 amounted to US$54.7 million for eight investment projects and US$3 million for seven
technical assistance projects. Currently, there is no active project with cofinancing arrangements.
The Kyrgyz Republic was selected as one of the pilot countries during the February 2003 Rome
Conference on Harmonization. Since then key development partners have learned to better
coordinate and harmonize procurement procedures, oversee financial management and monitoring,
share project implementation units, and conduct joint country portfolio reviews. Recently, the World
Bank and ADB have been jointly assessing the public procurement system in the Kyrgyz Republic.
ADB cooperates extensively with civil society organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic to strengthen the
effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of the services it provides.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of May 1, 2013)
Overview of EBRD activities to date
The Bank has been actively supporting the transition in Kyrgyz Republic since 1995. From 1995 to
the end of April 2013, the Bank signed 95 projects accounting for a net cumulative business volume
of €419 million. Investment portfolio stood at €190 million represented by 44 active operations. The
current private sector portfolio ratio (as a percentage of the total portfolio) is 75 percent which is
well above the Bank’s 60 percent mandated ratio. The last country strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic
was approved by EBRD’s Board in September 2011, and was designed to ensure continued EBRD
support for the recovery of the country’s economy and sustainable growth after a period of social
and political unrest in the recent past. The EBRD’s key priorities under the last country strategy
remain valid and include supporting local private enterprises, in particular through support for
micro, small, and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs), alongside support to strengthen the financial
sector and develop critical infrastructure.
Fostering the private sector: The Bank’s operations in support of local private enterprises took
advantage of the ETC Initiative, which was instrumental in enabling the Bank to deliver a number of
small projects with significant transition impact, particularly in the areas of corporate governance
and business conduct.


In 2012 EBRD signed six corporate sector projects. These include an MCFF loan to a local
producer and exporter of dried fruits and soft drinks to purchase new production equipment
and build storage facility; a loan to finance complementary facilities in one of the best office
buildings in the capital; a DLF to complete construction and fit-out of a new mid-market hotel
and an MCFF to support expansion of an existing hotel in Bishkek to improve supply of good
quality accommodation; an MCFF loan to the largest distributor and processor of seafood in the
country which is expected to improve operational efficiency and quality of the products through
utilization of higher energy efficient equipment and modernization of storage facilities.



The mining sector remains a major contributor to economic growth, export receipts and fiscal
revenues. In 2012 the Bank supported the activities of Kumtor mine by disbursing US$76 million
to finance further investments in its mining operations.



Under operations of its Small Business Support team, the Bank facilitates the skills transfers to
the local consultancy industry and improves the know-how and management of the MSME
sector through its two twin programs: Enterprise Growth Programme (EGP) and Business
Advisory Services (BAS). The objective of the EGP is to assist MSMEs to operate successfully and
help to develop new business skills at the senior management level in order to be able to
compete in a market economy. The EGP introduces industry-specific management expertise by
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

providing the advisory services of experienced senior executives from economically developed
countries. These advisers transfer management and technical know-how to enterprises, sharing
their commercial experience directly with the CEOs and senior managers of local companies.


On the other hand EBRD BAS Kyrgyz Republic enables MSMEs to access a diverse range of
consulting services by facilitating projects with local consultants on a cost sharing basis. Direct
assistance to enhance enterprise performance is combined with systemic market development
activities to create sustainable and commercially viable infrastructures of MSME support in the
Bank’s countries of operations. As of the end of 2012 BAS Kyrgyz Republic had undertaken more
than 500 projects engaging 205 consultants. Sixty percent of the enterprises assisted are located
in rural areas outside the main cities. Despite the difficult business climate, turnover increased in
nearly 66 percent of BAS beneficiary companies in the year following project completion, while
14 percent of beneficiaries secured external investments with an average size of €530,000. BAS
also supports professional capacity building of local advisory services to serve the MSME sector
on a sustainable basis and introduced more sophisticated advisory services in areas such as
quality management and energy efficiency. BAS Kyrgyz Republic is funded by the Swiss
government.

Strengthening financial institutions: In 2012, the EBRD continued supporting the country’s
financial institutions. The Bank signed four new loan agreements with local banks and MFIs in local
currency. These included a loan to Bai Tushum and Partners, a long-standing partner—the first
micro-finance company in the region—which successfully transformed itself into a bank, with a
positive impact on competitive environment in the banking sector.
In 2012 the Bank approved the new US$20 million Kyrgyz Sustainable Energy Efficiency Facility
(KyrSEEF) which will provide financing for small-size energy efficiency improvements in the
residential, service, agribusiness, SME, and industry sectors and will be an example of an integrated
approach combining policy dialogue, financing and TC-supported capacity building at local
intermediaries, and benefiting from donor-funded investment incentives. The Bank has been actively
engaged in policy dialogue on stabilizing the banking sector, strengthening deposit insurance,
enhancing the regulation of the microfinance sector and continued providing Technical Consultation
(TC) to its partner financial institutions under the Kyrgyz Financial Sector Framework.
Building on the Memorandum of Understanding signed in the context of the local currency
financing program, the Bank commenced work on developing the corporate bond market using a
combination of TC and investments supporting the issuance of local currency corporate bonds by a
leading bank. Technical cooperation projects with the Central Bank and the securities market
regulator aim at improving corporate bond market issuance and disclosure standards and
strengthening the regulatory framework for bond issuance and trading.
Support for critical infrastructure: To build the institutional framework for sustainable operations
of municipal services, the Bank strengthened its activities in municipal infrastructure projects in
2011 and 2012. The Bank approved a €20 million framework to improve water supply and
wastewater treatment supported by cofinancing grants from bilateral and multilateral donors.



Under this framework in May 2011, the Bank signed new water/wastewater projects for Osh and
Jalalabad municipalities. The EBRD’s €6 million loan to the projects is cofinanced by a capital
expenditure grant from SECO (Switzerland). In August 2012 the Bank signed water project for
Kara-Balta having provided a sovereign loan of €2 million cofinanced by a capital grant of
€3 million from the EBRD Shareholder Special Fund. The capital expenditure grant is required to
meet IMF conditions for nonconcessional lending and mitigate affordability constraints. Projects
in the water sector enabled the Bank to make progress with water tariff reforms, meeting IFRS
accounting standards, and promoting efficiency in the Bishkek water company.



In order to support the transport infrastructure of Bishkek city the Bank provided a sovereign
loan of up to €7.7 million cofinanced by a capital grant from the EBRD Shareholders’ Special
Fund of €4.2 million to finance the purchase of new trolleybuses and partial rehabilitation of
related infrastructure. In addition, this investment will provide support for the introduction of
electronic ticketing in the municipally operated public transport sector in Bishkek.

Policy dialogue: EBRD is continuing support to the Business Development and Investment Council,
which has been providing local and international business representatives (representing the mining,
industry, agro-processing and tourism sectors) with a platform to discuss the main barriers to doing
business with top officials of the government.


The Bank continued to actively engage in policy dialogue with the government and local
authorities to promote the further reform agenda in corporate and infrastructure sectors.



The Bank is providing support to the development of local capital markets through policy
dialogue, TC and possible projects deepening the market and reducing bank funding
mismatches.



The Bank has been working on developing TC to provide institutional capacity building support
to the State Agency for Geology to support mining sector reform.



The Bank has offered TC to support the government’s efforts to improve public procurement
under the joint EBRD-UNCITRAL technical cooperation project designed to upgrade public
procurement regulation in the CIS to the new UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods,
Construction, and Services.



The Bank continues its support for renewable energy development including through TC to the
Ministry of Energy and Industry to support the renewable energy framework, and a possible
financing of a pilot mini-hydro project(s).



The Bank has been providing TC to the Deposit Insurance Agency and intends to continue
assisting the Agency to improve IT, increase operating procedures effectiveness, strengthening
monitoring and risk management.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The four institutions responsible for collecting,
compiling and disseminating macroeconomic statistics—the National Statistics Committee (NSC),
the Ministry of Economic Regulation (MER), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the National Bank of
the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR)—have legal and institutional environments that support statistical
quality, and their respective staff are well-versed in current methodologies.
2.
The NSC maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated website with data that largely
incorporate international methodological recommendations with adequate coverage and timeliness
(http://www.stat.kg). In February 2004, the Kyrgyz Republic subscribed to the SDDS.
3.
A data ROSC mission in November 2002 concluded that the quality of the macroeconomic
statistics had improved significantly in the last few years. The authorities’ response to the data ROSC
(posted on the IMF website (www.imf.org/external/np/rosc) includes an update on the status of
implementation of the ROSC recommendations.
National accounts
4.
In general, dissemination of national accounts statistics is timely. Technical assistance has
been received from the IMF, EUROSTAT, OECD, the World Bank, and bilateral donors. While
significant progress has been made in improving the national accounts estimation process,
problems persist regarding the quality of the source data, due mainly to excessively tight collection
deadlines associated with the release schedule. Efforts are needed to improve the quality of the
source data for quarterly GDP estimates. Moreover, while the quarterly GDP estimates are
disseminated on a discrete basis for SDDS purposes, these estimates are still derived from
cumulative data. Difficulties also remain in properly estimating the degree of underreporting,
especially in the private sector. To improve the coverage and reliability of primary data, work has
been undertaken to introduce sampling procedures. Improved sampling procedures have been
adopted for household surveys and new report forms have been introduced for the enterprise
survey. The NSC has established a division of sample surveys, which would assist in improving the
sampling techniques.
5.
The November 2008 STA mission on national accounts assisted the staff of the National
Accounts Division in NCS to produce discrete quarterly GDP estimates at current and constant
prices, using both the production and expenditure approaches. The mission made a number of
recommendations, including: (a) need to introduce the new establishment surveys; (b) disseminate
the industrial production index (IPI) as a chain-linked indices, in line with international standards;
(c) investigate the inconsistency between the IPI and the producer price index (PPI); (d) fully
computerize the calculation of volume estimates for agriculture in line with international practice;
and (e) obtain time series data for loans and deposits of financial institutions.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

Price and labor market statistics
6.
The concepts and definitions used in the CPI, which has been published since January 1995,
are broadly consistent with international standards. The price index covers all urban resident
households of all sizes and income levels, but needs to cover rural households, which comprise the
majority of the population.
7.
The PPI, which has been published since October 1996, is compiled broadly in accordance
with international standards, although its coverage needs to be improved. The coverage of the PPI
was broadened in May 1997 and is expected to be further expanded in the coming years.
8.
Progress has been made in computing unit value indices for imports and exports. Work
continues with regard to computation of these indices using a standard index presentation and the
development of an export price index. However, problems in customs administration have led to
incomplete coverage of trade and the lack of an appropriate valuation system. Moreover, the data
processed by customs have suffered due to the use of an outdated computer software system.
9.
Problems exist in the compilation of the average wage, especially with respect to the
valuation of payments in kind and the coverage of the private sector. Monthly and annual data are
not comparable because of different coverage and classifications. These problems extend to
employment data as well. The coverage of unemployment includes an estimate of unregistered
unemployed.
Government finance statistics
10.
The scope of central government statistics falls short of international standards because it
excludes data for the Social Fund (these data are published separately). Other limitations involve the
discrepancies between the deficit and financing data. While revenue and expenditure data generally
accord with the GFSM 1986, there are misclassifications in both categories (for example, some
nontax revenues are classified as taxes, and certain expenditure items are misclassified in the budget
and treasury accounts). Monthly GFS data are reported to STA for publication in the IFS; the latest
data reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook were for 2006, and covered general government
and its subsectors; and the data were compiled using the GFSM 2001 analytical framework.
11.
The provision of data on public external debt service has improved. Data on actual debt
service, guaranteed debt service, outstanding debt and revised debt projections, are provided on a
monthly basis. The quality (including timeliness) of external debt data is adequate. The External Debt
Division of the ministry of finance is now solely responsible for monitoring external debt, and has
benefited from on-site training provided by a Swiss-financed long-term consultant and the
computerization of its database.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Monetary and financial statistics (MFS)
12.
The 2002 data ROSC mission found that: (a) the residency criterion was not uniformly
applied, as the currency denomination was used to classify some transactions with foreign and
domestic units; (b) deposits with banks in liquidation were included in broad money; and (c) source
data did not provide sufficient information for a more detailed sectoral breakdown (e.g.,
subsectorization of nonbank institutions as recommended in the MFSM).
13.
The April/May 2004 STA mission on MFS found that the NBKR had made substantial
progress in implementing ROSC recommendations pertaining to monetary statistics. To address the
outstanding issues, the mission further recommended that the NBKR (a) improve the basic source
data to allow for proper classification of the transactions with foreign and domestic units; (b) fully
implement the MFSM’s methodology concerning accrual accounting; (c) exclude deposits with
banks in liquidation from monetary aggregates and classify them as restricted deposits; and (d) set
up a working group to follow up on consistency between monetary and balance of payments
statistics. The mission also recommended expanding the current broad money survey to include the
accounts of credit unions and microfinance companies.
14.
The new accounting framework for banks implemented in January 2009 revealed some
problems in classification of a part of the Social Fund deposits. Efforts are under way to address the
consequences of the introduction of the new accounting rules.
15.
Monetary data have been reported electronically to STA using Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). STA identified classification issues in the reported SRF data, which were communicated to the
authorities. The data will be published in IFS and IFS Monetary and Financial Statistics Supplement
as soon as these issues are resolved.
External sector statistics
16.
Data on the balance of payments and international investment position are compiled and
disseminated on a quarterly basis. The 2002 data ROSC mission noted that the compilation of
balance of payments statistics broadly follows the methodology recommended in the BPM5.
However, deficiencies remain with respect to data on remittances, trade, services, and foreign direct
investment. There is also a need to improve compilation procedures for achieving temporal
consistency of data, and investigating and reconciling discrepancies. The March 2004 STA mission
on balance of payments statistics noted that while progress had been made in several areas, further
improvements were needed in the international transactions reporting system; data sampling
methods; and data validation and coverage, particularly on trade, services, private sector external
debt, and foreign direct investment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 18, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Kyrgyz Republic
On June 10, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic.1
Background
The economy contracted in 2012 because of disruptions in gold production. Strong nongold growth, fueled by remittances inflows, cushioned the drop in overall output to
-0.9 percent. The current account deficit increased substantially, mainly owing to the
decline in gold exports and an increase in imports of inputs for ongoing energy
infrastructure projects. Official assistance and remittances, which have the strongest
impact on the exchange rate, mitigated depreciation pressures. Therefore, the som
depreciated by less than 2 percent against the U.S. dollar during 2012. Inflation
increased to 7.5 percent by end-2012, owing to rising international food prices in the
summer. The recovery in the gold sector along with continued strong performance in the
other sectors is expected to boost growth to 7.4 percent in 2013. Inflation should settle
at around 7 percent.
Notwithstanding adverse economic conditions, fiscal policy remained prudent. The
2012 fiscal deficit was 5.4 percent of GDP, below the targeted deficit of 6 percent of
GDP, but slightly higher than in 2011 because of expenditure carryover. The
revenue-smoothing arrangement with the Kumtor gold company and buoyant customs

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

revenue in the first nine months of 2012 offset the shortfall in gold-related revenue. The
government also curtailed nonpriority expenditure to accommodate lower-than-budgeted
external financing.
The National Bank of Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) reduced the policy rate in several steps
to 2.6 percent, in response to negative economic growth and moderate inflation.
However, sterilization efforts were not sufficient to contain reserve money growth. The
banking sector remained generally stable. Nonperforming loans continued to decline
while provisioning increased. Capital adequacy remained high at 18 percent. While
credit growth has been strong, credit remains low at 13 percent of GDP.
The authorities continued to pursue structural and governance reforms. Progress has
been made in public financial management, including public procurement, and financial
sector reform. The government has also adopted a medium-term energy sector strategy
in 2012 in order to improve transparency, accountability and sustainability of the energy
sector.
The medium-term outlook is broadly favorable. The Kyrgyz economy is expected to
grow by 5 percent in the medium term and inflation is expected to gradually decline to
5 percent. Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue with the deficit declining to
2½ percent of GDP by 2015. The current account deficit is projected to improve,
reaching 3 percent of GDP in 2018, while reserves are expected to increase to
4.2 months of imports. Risks mostly emanate from exogenous shocks via increased
commodity prices and a slowdown in global growth that could spill over to the Kyrgyz
economy through the trade and remittances channel.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress under the Extended Credit Facilitysupported program, including adherence to the fiscal targets despite political uncertainty
and a temporary slowdown in growth. Given remaining downside risks to the outlook,
Directors encouraged steadfast implementation of reforms to consolidate the fiscal
gains, strengthen the financial system, and enhance the business climate with a view to
diversifying the economy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal consolidation to
ensure sustainability, rebuild policy buffers, reduce dependence on external assistance,
and keep debt on a declining path. Restraining and rationalizing non-priority
expenditures and the wage bill will be important to create space for higher social and
infrastructure spending. These steps should be complemented by measures to broaden
the tax base through tax policy and administration reforms. Directors also called for
further progress on fiscal institutional reforms, including in public financial management.
They urged strict monitoring of borrowing by state enterprises.

3

Directors supported the authorities’ tight monetary policy stance in view of underlying
inflationary pressures. They stressed the need to revise the monetary policy framework
to enhance monetary policy transmission, and to strengthen the independence of the
central bank to ensure sound monetary and financial policies. Continued exchange rate
flexibility should help absorb external shocks.
Directors welcomed progress toward strengthening the financial sector. Following the
resolution of Zalkar Bank, it will now be important to ensure its full compliance with
capital requirements. Directors looked forward to timely enactment of the draft banking
code with all its key features, particularly those aimed at further enhancing the central
bank’s autonomy and governance. Directors welcomed the enactment of amendments
to the Criminal Code and urged the authorities to swiftly implement the changes to the
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism payment system laws.
Directors encouraged the authorities to diversify the economy and increase its
resilience. They stressed the need to improve the business climate and institutions and
enhance governance, including in the energy sector. Directors underscored the
importance of evenhanded and consistent application of business laws to lay the
foundation for strong private-sector-led growth. They looked forward to a constructive
resolution of the Kumtor gold mine dispute.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Completes Fourth Review Under an ECF Arrangement with the Kyrgyz Republic,
Approves US$14.4 Million Disbursement, and Completes Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Kyrgyz Republic’s economic performance under the program supported by a threeyear, SDR 66.6 million (about US$100.8 million) Extended Credit Facility arrangement that
was approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on June 20, 2011 (see Press Release No.
11/245). The Executive Board’s decision enables the immediate disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 9.5 million (about US$14.4 million) to the Kyrgyz Republic. This would
bring total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 47.57 million (about US$72
million).
In completing the review, the Board approved the authorities’ request for a waiver of
nonobservance of the continuous quantitative performance criteria on contracting or
guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the public sector. The request for the
waiver was approved based on the corrective actions taken by the authorities.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2013 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Kyrgyzstan. Under the Article IV of its Articles of Agreement, the IMF has a mandate to
exercise surveillance over the economic, financial, and exchange rate policies of its members
in order to ensure the effective operation of the international monetary system. A Public
Information Notice on the Board’s assessment of the Consultation will be released
separately.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, stated:
“The Kyrgyz authorities have made good progress under their ECF-supported program. The
fiscal targets were met despite a temporary slowdown in growth. The economy is recovering,
and the medium-term outlook is favorable. Steadfast implementation of the program will be
important to consolidate the gains and guard against downside risks.

2

“Fiscal consolidation is a priority in the medium term to reduce vulnerabilities, rebuild policy
buffers, and ensure sustainability. The authorities’ consolidation plans appropriately focus on
restraining current spending while preserving social and capital outlays. Reforms in tax
policy and administration and public financial management should continue.
“Maintaining a tight monetary policy stance is necessary to mitigate underlying inflationary
pressures. Stronger de facto independence will help the central bank to maintain low
inflation.
“Creating a well-functioning financial sector is key to supporting private sector-led growth.
The new banking code, once approved, will help restore confidence in the banking system.
The resolution of Zalkar Bank was an important step, and its operations will need to be
closely supervised to ensure compliance with prudential standards.
“Diversification of the economy will help reduce volatility in growth stemming from
disruptions in gold production. Good governance and sound institutions remain critical to
create a level playing field, improve investor confidence, and lay the foundation for strong
private sector-led growth.”

Statement by René Weber, Executive Director for the Kyrgyz Republic
And Jerome Duperrut, Advisor to Executive Director
June 10, 2013
On behalf of our Kyrgyz authorities, we thank staff for the constructive surveillance policy
discussions in the context of the Article IV Consultation, the insightful staff reports, and the
continued support under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The authorities
remain committed to strengthening the foundations for growth and development: maintaining
macro-economic stability, improving institutions and governance, promoting national
reconciliation, and strengthening regional cooperation. The essential contribution of the Fund
in all three dimensions of its activities—surveillance, lending, and capacity development—is
acknowledged and highly appreciated. The ECF will continue to provide a solid anchor for
economic policies going forward. The positive traction of Fund’s advice is clearly shown in
Box 1.
Macro-economic outlook and policies
After a difficult 2012, when economic growth was negative as a result of a temporary large
contraction in gold production due to adverse geological factors, the outlook for 2013 is more
reassuring. Gold production has recovered and non-gold growth continues to show strength.
Capital investment activity, partly linked to the reconstruction efforts in the South of the
country, retail trade, and exports are significant contributors. Over the first four months of
the year, GDP grew by 8.2 percent, which puts the Kyrgyz Republic on track to meet staff’s
forecast for 2013. The authorities are confident that the Kyrgyz Republic will be able to grow
at a similar, swift pace over the medium-term. At the same time, we concur with staff that
risks exist, with fluctuations in the gold production and price, and an economic slowdown in
the main partner countries being the most pronounced ones. The Kyrgyz authorities are
committed to negotiating in a responsible manner with its foreign investor on the financial,
environmental, and social aspects of the Kumtor mine in order to find a lasting and mutually
beneficial agreement. They are keenly aware that a stable and predictable business climate is
key to attracting investment and generating sustainable and inclusive growth. The Kyrgyz
Republic has also started preparations to join the customs union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
Russia, which should further open export markets as well as improve the economy’s
competitiveness and investment environment. Russia’s recent accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and Kazakhstan’s proceeding WTO accession process strengthen the
case for joining the regional customs union.
Major progress in enhancing the stability of the domestic banking system has been made with
the sale of 90 percent of shares of Zalkar Bank to Russia’s Investment and Trade Business
Holding, which was a precondition for the completion of this review. The authorities expect
that the recapitalization of this bank will be completed by the end of the year. Furthermore,

2
with the support of the Fund’s technical assistance, they are making good progress in
revising the Banking Code. This Code is expected to be submitted to Parliament for approval
in September. The authorities are looking forward to the upcoming FSAP mission in July,
based on which they expect to deepen the domestic debt market and further strengthen the
financial sector.
With an unanticipated decline in gold-related fiscal revenue and public spending approaching
40 percent of GDP, major corrective action was needed by the authorities in the second half
of 2012 to meet the overall fiscal deficit target under the ECF arrangement. This adjustment
effort included significant cuts in spending on goods, services, and infrastructure, while propoor spending was protected. The authorities note staff’s assessment that the Kyrgyz
Republic compares favorably with others in terms of tax collection, including among
countries in the region. The ministry of finance has recently regained the overall
responsibility of all fiscal policy matters, as the tax policy unit was transferred back from the
ministry of economy. Going forward, the authorities are committed to further consolidate the
fiscal position, in line with program objectives. They expect tax revenues to level off in part
following tax policy changes, such as the reduction of some fee-based services, but they are
confident that the tax intake will benefit from further improvements in tax administration. On
the expenditure side, the civil service reform should result in a lower overall wage bill, while
leaving some room to allow for targeted wage increases. A new law on public procurement
should allow for curbs on public goods and services spending. Combined with reductions in
transfers and subsidies, these savings should create some fiscal space for increased education,
health, and social assistance outlays. The authorities plan to reform the pension system with a
view to make it more equitable, efficient, and sustainable. Based on this fiscal policy
strategy, the ratio of public debt to GDP should continue its downward path over the coming
years. The authorities will update their medium-term debt management strategy accordingly.
The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) is committed to keeping monetary
policy tight in order to ensure that inflation remains in single digits. Further monetary policy
tightening could be considered to prevent second-round effects from rising food and fuel
prices. The NBKR appreciates the staff’s thorough discussion of the determinants of
monetary policy transmission mechanism, as well as the helpful Fund technical assistance.
The NBKR has indicated that it will review the effectiveness of its current monetary
targeting framework and its signaling instruments and that is sees merit in further improving
its communication to the markets. The authorities agree with the staff’s assessment that the
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and that the current level of reserves is
adequate. They continue to value the flexible exchange rate regime, with the NBKR
refraining from intervening in the foreign exchange market, except in cases of excessive
volatility.
The Kyrgyz authorities are committed to improve on past laxity in combating money
laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In October 2011, they made a high-

3
level political commitment to work with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and
Eurasia Group (EAG) to address strategic AML/CFT deficiencies. Since then, they have
taken steps towards improving the AML/CFT regime along the lines of the action plan,
including through amendments to the Criminal Code and to the Law on Combating
Terrorism, which were adopted by Parliament at end-April and signed by President in late
May. Concerning the proposed law on Criminal Liability of Legal Persons and Entities, it
should be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. The authorities trust that these reforms
will ensure that the Kyrgyz Republic remains on the list of jurisdictions under monitoring at
the upcoming FATF plenary meeting. Furthermore, the Kyrgyz authorities expect that their
cooperation with the World Bank/UNODC Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) will
yield positive results.
Program performance
The ECF-supported program remains on track as all performance criteria were met, except
the one on the ceiling of contracting new nonconcessional external debt. This was due to one
of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) signing a nonconcessional credit line. The authorities are
taking remedial action by issuing a resolution requiring the main SOEs to provide all
information on their borrowing plans and debt service obligations to the ministry of finance.
This early reporting requirement should be effective in preventing the contracting of new
nonconcessional loans. The Kyrgyz authorities kindly ask the Board to approve this fourth
review under the ECF-supported arrangement, and the Waiver of Nonobservance of the
above-mentioned performance criterion, with the related disbursement to be directed to the
budget. Furthermore and due to the improved economic performance, the authorities ask for
modifications to the end-June 2013 quantitative performance criteria on net international
reserves and the general government overall deficit. The existing and proposed structural
benchmarks targeting fiscal policy and the financial sector well complement the program’s
quantitative conditionality.
