EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Program implementation during 2003 and the first nine months of 2004 was uneven. The
majority of quantitative targets were met, but there were delays in implementing structural
reforms and slippage in fiscal transparency that led to postponement of the conclusion of the
second review. The performance criteria on the basic fiscal balance for end-2003 and nonconcessional external borrowing were not observed. The authorities are requesting waivers
for the nonobservance of these criteria.
Macroeconomic performance in 2004 was satisfactory and the program’s growth and
inflation objectives for the year are likely to have been achieved. Real GDP growth is
estimated to have reached about 6 percent, despite the impact of the locust invasion, with
inflation remaining subdued. The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is likely to have
doubled to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2004, but the basic fiscal balance (excluding HIPC
expenditure) is estimated to have remained at the 2003 level.
The macroeconomic objectives for 2005 include real GDP growth of about 6.5 percent and
consumer price inflation of about 1.6 percent on average, barring any major supply-side
shocks. A relatively low level of public domestic and external debt (6 percent and 41 percent
of GDP, respectively), and a low primary deficit indicate that the fiscal position will be
sustainable in 2005. Analysis by the staff and the authorities further indicate that debt
sustainability can be preserved in the medium term under reasonable assumptions.
To ensure fiscal transparency and good governance and to prevent budgetary irregularities,
the authorities will revamp the procurement regulations, limit the share of contracts that are
not subject to tender procedures, and reduce the scope for firms to get compensation for work
performed under invalid contracts. All resources provided to the public sector by the Islamic
Conference Organization or the Millennium Challenge Account will be subject to budgetary
procedures.
The financial system is generally sound but burdened by bad loans, credit concentration, and
inadequate regulatory and judicial framework. The authorities will prepare an action plan for
financial sector development and soundness to be agreed with staff during the third review.
The sale of the state-owned groundnut processing company, SONACOS, will be finalized by
June 2005, and the pricing policy for the electricity company will be made more flexible. The
monitoring of other public enterprises and the debt management capacity will be
strengthened to enhance the assessment and control of the government’s contingent
liabilities.
Structural reforms to reduce production costs in the export sector are essential to prevent the
erosion of external competitiveness, especially in the face of continuing appreciation of the
euro (to which the CFA franc is pegged) against the U.S. dollar.
The authorities would prefer to exit from the PRGF arrangement on its expiration in April
2006. They would like to explore options for other types of arrangements with the Fund
based on the outcome of the Board discussions on the financial instruments for Fund support
to low-income countries.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Executive Board consideration of the second review, the first PRSP progress
report, and the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), originally scheduled for June 30, 2004,1
was delayed due to a serious breach of budgetary discipline and transparency. The
government signed contracts for infrastructure projects in Thiès, the second largest city,
without budgetary appropriation. Work on the projects, valued at 1 percent of GDP, started
in 2003 and continued in 2004. Contractors were promised payment with future budgetary
resources, and provided with letters of comfort to facilitate borrowing from banks.
2.
The Board meeting was postponed to allow the staff to reach understandings
with the authorities on remedial actions to restore discipline and prevent similar
problems in the future. Discussions on these issues were held in Washington in
August 2004 but were not conclusive. As a result, it was not possible to complete the review
before end-October 2004. The delay in the completion of the second review meant that the
Article IV consultation had to take place earlier than at the end of the usual 24-month cycle
(ending in April 2005).

from 5.9 percent of GDP in 2002 to
6.5 percent in 2003 (Table 10).
However, substantial private capital
inflows, combined with debt relief, led to an increase of 36 percent in the net international
reserves of the central bank (Table 9).2
5.
The real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciated by about
12 percent during November 2000October 2004, reflecting mainly the
appreciation of the euro (to which
the CFA franc is pegged) against
the U.S. dollar (Figure 3). However,
since 1994 (when the CFAF was
devalued), Senegal’s REER has
depreciated by about 8 percent,
compared to an appreciation of the
REER in almost all other countries of
the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU).

The central bank net foreign assets and the broad money are not analytically meaningful
concepts measured at the individual WAEMU country level. The broad money aggregate
includes only the CFAF banknotes issued by the Senegal branch of the BCEAO. However,
CFAF banknotes issued by BCEAO branches in other WAEMU countries are also legal
tender and circulate in varying degrees in Senegal (although the volume in circulation in each
country is not known). These banknotes are recorded as Senegal’s foreign assets when they
are returned to the BCEAO branch in Senegal. Thus not only are the estimates of the broad
money and net foreign assets subject to measurement errors, the methodology for
compilation of broad money data blurs the concept of domestic liquidity.

-7-

6.
The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) widened from 0.1 percent of GDP in
2002 to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2003, driven by a substantial increase in expenditures.
Revenue performance strengthened throughout the period. Tax revenue increased slightly but
remained below the program objective (Tables 6 and 7).
7.
The end-December 2003 performance criterion on the basic fiscal balance
(program definition) was not observed (Table 1). The breach of this performance criterion
was foreseen at the time of the first review (February 2004).3 It was attributed to a fiscal
stimulus introduced in mid-2003—and supported by the Executive Board—involving
additional drought-related expenditure and accelerated spending of resources accumulated in
the government’s HIPC Initiative account. As foreseen at the time of the first review, the
authorities have requested a waiver for the nonobservance of this criterion. The staff supports
this request, given that the fiscal outcome involved a minor deviation from the original target
and resulted from an appropriate fiscal stimulus.
8.
On the monetary front, banks’ excess reserves increased during the first three
quarters of 20044 and net domestic credit contracted slightly, owing to a reduction in
government net indebtedness to the banking sector (Table 9). In an effort to stimulate
credit growth, the BCEAO lowered its key lending rates by two percentage points during
July 2003-March 2004. Banks’ interest rates remained practically unaffected, however,
because banks’ large excess reserves obviated their need for central bank credit.
9.
The staff estimates the NPV of
debt-to-export ratio at about 114 percent,
following the attainment of the completion
point and after enhanced HIPC Initiative
relief. The ratio is well below the HIPC
Initiative threshold of 150 percent and the
ratio projected at the decision point.5 In its
meeting of June 2004, the Paris Club revised
downward the NPV of Senegal’s debt to the
Paris Club as of end-1998, and agreed to
grant Senegal debt relief of US$ 94 million
in NPV terms, compared to US$ 126 million

committed to at the Decision Point. However, the Paris Club creditors also agreed to provide
additional debt relief of US$ 336 million in NPV terms. The authorities have initiated
contacts with all creditors with a view to increasing the rate of participation in the Initiative
and securing greater debt relief (Table 14).
10.
The implementation of structural reforms in 2004 was uneven. A new investment
code was introduced, the real estate registry was digitized, and the audited accounts of the
state-owned electricity company were published (Table 3). However, the submission of
budgets to the Audit Court for verification was delayed and monthly reports on taxes due and
collected were not issued. Most other reforms in the area of public expenditure management
were implemented on time, but the spending irregularities in Thiès (para. 1) constituted a
setback in fiscal governance.
11.
Some progress has been made on the implementation of the poverty reduction
strategy since early 2003. The business environment has been improved through regulatory
reform (para. 41), the administrative capacity has been strengthened, project implementation
accelerated, and structural reforms in the water, telecommunication, and electricity sectors
implemented, albeit with delays. However, few policy initiatives targeting vulnerable groups
have been introduced and the establishment of committees monitoring PRSP implementation
has been delayed. Although spending for social sectors increased in 2003, health expenditure
declined, owing to low implementation capacity. While recent poverty data are not available,
the latest household survey (2001-02) suggests that poverty decreased from 68 percent in
1994 to 57 percent in 2001. The decrease was larger in urban centers than in rural areas.6
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
The discussions focused on the implementation of the program in 2004,7 the
annual program for 2005, and the medium-term objectives, policies, outlook, and risks.
A. Macroeconomic Outcome and Program Implementation in 2004
13.
The macroeconomic outcome for 2004 is expected to have been favorable. Real
GDP growth is estimated to have reached about 6 percent, despite a locust invasion, with an
average annual CPI inflation rate below ½ percent. Despite oil price increases, the external
current account deficit (including official transfers) is estimated to have declined slightly

review, but served as a reference for the staff’s assessment of the policy performance in
2004.

owing to a pick-up in exports, while
capital inflows are estimated to have
declined. The resulting overall balance
of payments deficit is estimated to have
been more than financed by exceptional
financing, including debt relief under
the HIPC Initiative, allowing an
increase in net international reserves
(Table 10 and Figure 4).

deterioration is explained by the
postponement to 2004 of costs
associated with structural reforms that had been initially programmed for 2003, lower grants,
and higher HIPC-related expenditures on rural development and locust eradication.
Moreover, the supplementary budget enacted in September 2004 allocated additional
resources to fund fully the irregular expenditure in Thiès. With external financing exceeding
the deficit, net government position with the banking sector is estimated to have improved
(Table 9).

15.
The basic fiscal balance—the fiscal objective subject to program
conditionality—is estimated to have remained at the 2003 level. The authorities
committed to ensuring that the additional financing of Thiès-related expenditures included in
the 2004 supplementary budget (CFAF 9 billion) would have no effect on the basic fiscal
balance.8 To this end, they took a number of compensatory measures, including cutbacks in
non-priority expenditure and reduction of domestically-financed capital expenditures.
16.
The revenue target for 2004 is estimated to have been attained. The authorities
expected the tax policy measures implemented in 2004 to be revenue-neutral9 but direct tax
collections for the year as a whole are estimated to have been higher than expected because
of the ongoing improvements in administration of the large tax payer unit.
8

The entire cost of Thiès-related projects was CFAF 40 billion (1 percent of GDP). The 2004
budget included CFAF 31 billion of these expenditures, which had been committed before
the budget was approved.
The measures included a new corporate income tax law that: (i) lowers the marginal
effective tax rate from 35 to 33 percent, (ii) reduces exemptions, and (iii) simplifies small
business taxation by subsuming numerous taxes in one synthetic tax. The new investment
code streamlining the incentive structure also went into effect.

9

- 10 -

17.
The ceiling on non-concessional borrowing (continuous performance criterion)
was not observed. In October 2004, the Port of Dakar (a public enterprise) contracted a nonconcessional loan from the regional development bank (BOAD). The authorities have
requested a waiver for the breach of this performance criterion. The staff supports the request
on the grounds that: (a) urgent repairs were needed as the dilapidated state of the port had
become a major bottleneck for export and import activities, and (b) the authorities’ request is
consistent with the staff’s proposal to exclude CFAF loans from the institutions within the
WAEMU region from the ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing under the program.
B. The Macroeconomic Framework for 2005
18.
The macroeconomic objectives for 2005 include real GDP growth of about
6.5 percent and CPI inflation of about 1.5 percent on average, barring any major
supply shocks. The external current account (including official transfers) deficit is projected
to narrow to about 5.5 percent of GDP, partly reflecting favorable terms of trade
developments. The projected primary deficit of about 1.9 percent of GDP and a relatively
low level of domestic and external debt (6 percent and 41 percent of GDP, respectively, at
end 2004), indicate that fiscal sustainability will not be an issue in 2005. Senegal will also
comfortably meet all but one of the WAEMU fiscal convergence criteria.10 The main risks to
the short-term economic outlook include the continuing and sustained rise in oil prices, lower
recovery of the agricultural sector from the locust invasion, and the slackening of political
resolve to follow through with the reform agenda and implement appropriate macroeconomic
policies.
C.

Fiscal Policy and Reform

19.
The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is expected to increase slightly to
about 3 percent of GDP in 2005, almost entirely financed by external resources (Figures
5 and 6). Given the favorable macroeconomic conditions, low debt levels, absence of central
bank financing, and little risk of crowding out the private sector from the credit market,11 the

10

The basic fiscal balance, as currently defined by WAEMU, will slip below the required
balanced position, but the balance excluding social expenditure financed by HIPC
(WAEMU’s proposed new definition of basic balance) should be in surplus.

11

The likelihood of crowding out is small, given the excess liquidity in the banking system.

- 11 -

projected larger fiscal deficit can be
accommodated without undermining
macroeconomic stability.

20.
The increase in the
government’s net indebtedness to
the banking system will be contained
in 2005 as the government repays
statutory advances from the central
bank falling due in 2005 (Figure 6).
The authorities intend to issue
government securities on the WAEMU
regional market to finance specific
projects. The staff encouraged the
authorities to issue government
securities to repay the statutory
advances ahead of schedule and
provide liquidity to the government
securities market. The authorities were
not prepared to do so at this stage in
view of the likely increase in the cost

physical infrastructure, which, if
implemented in their entirety, could pose a risk to the fiscal outlook. The authorities have
agreed to scale back the 2005 capital expenditure in line with the country’s expected projects
implementation capacity. Therefore, the 2005 fiscal program assumes that investment
spending will not exceed 75 percent of the amounts budgeted. This rate is slightly higher than
the historical implementation ratio and assumes an expansion of the capacity to implement
projects.
22.
Current expenditure is projected to decline by 0.1 percent of GDP. The new
compensation policy for the civil service, announced recently, together with the expected
increase in recruitment will raise the wage bill relative to GDP, but this increase will be

compensated by a reduction in interest expenditure and transfers. The public sector wage bill
would rise to 29 percent of fiscal revenue.13
23.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to link salary increases to
performance, but expressed concern about the delays in the recruitment of new civil
servants for priority sectors. As of end-October 2004, net recruitment reached no more
than 70 percent of the target. The authorities indicated that they did not intend to use the
margin provided by delayed recruitment to raise salaries.
Revenue reforms
24.
The staff urged faster implementation of the long overdue improvements in tax
administration. The authorities noted that the electronic data sharing between the customs
administration, the tax administration, and the Treasury—which is essential for monitoring
tax evasion and assessing the performance of each tax agency—is expected to become fully
operational before end-June 2005. Implementation of a new software for management of the
property tax base and the digitization of land and forest registry are proceeding (MEFP para.
33). These improvements would allow proper assessment of property tax and may facilitate
mortgage lending.
25.
The transfer of direct tax collection responsibilities from the Treasury to the Tax
Administration Agency (recommended by FAD technical assistance missions) has not
been achieved yet. The authorities expressed concern that combining the responsibilities for
tax collection and tax assessment could provide opportunities for corruption. However, they
agreed to revisit the issue once the computer link between the three tax agencies (including
the Treasury) becomes effective.
26.
No progress has been made on the harmonization and reduction of excises for oil
products. The authorities argued, and the staff agreed, that reducing the excise tax would
induce undesirable revenue losses in the short term. However, given the possible benefits of a
lower excise tax for the economy, they agreed to consider the measure at a later stage.
Public expenditure management and fiscal transparency
27.
The agenda of fiscal structural reforms focuses on improvements in public
expenditure management, fiscal transparency and reporting, and public procurement.14
13

This ratio is below the WAEMU convergence criterion ceiling (35 percent of revenue), but
it excludes transfers to autonomous public agencies for payment of wages and salaries, which
are included in the WAEMU criterion.

14

Senegal is an FAD pilot case for enhanced treatment of structural fiscal issues. Additional
details on the fiscal structural reforms are provided in the accompanying Selected Issues
Paper.

- 13 -

The specific reforms will be based on the recommendations of (i) the World Bank’s Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the review of Country Procurement
Practices (CPAR), (ii) the Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) of April 2004, and (iii) the
fiscal ROSC of January 2005.
28.
The procurement laws, regulations, and procedures will be revamped with the
assistance of the World Bank, to ensure transparency and good governance, and
prevent budgetary irregularities (MEFP, para. 43-44). In the meantime, the following
measures have been taken or planned: (a) the 2005 budget law—which was enacted in
December 2004—includes a provision (drafted with IMF assistance) that permanently limits
the scope of any provision in the State’s Obligations Code and other laws that allow firms to
get compensation for work performed under invalid contracts; (b) the share of contracts
signed under special provisions that bypass competitive tender procedures will be subject to
a ceiling (proposed as a quantitative performance criterion—PC, MEFP, Table 1); and (c) no
government contracts will be signed before the required budget allocations are approved by
the parliament (proposed PC).
29.
The government agreed with the staff’s recommendation that the use of any
funds received for the preparation of the Islamic Conference in Dakar in 2006 or from
the U.S.-funded Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) should be subject to the usual
budgetary procedures. These resources are expected to be in the form of grants, but their
amounts and specific nature (cash or non-cash) were not known at the time of the preparation
of the 2005 Budget Law. Therefore, a supplementary budget will be prepared to reflect the
projected use of any cash grants in a transparent manner.
30.
Expenditure tracking and fiscal reporting are other areas of concern. The recent
introduction of the SIGFIP software could ameliorate tracking of expenditure, but a number
of technical problems remain.15 The delays in the preparation of the monthly Treasury
balances exceed two months (one of the longest in the WAEMU zone). The Government
Financial Operations Table (TOFE)—the main instrument of budgetary control—is not
prepared on a monthly basis, and the quarterly table is frequently revised, sometimes after
several months. These deficiencies make it difficult to verify fiscal data and monitor fiscal
developments on a timely basis. The authorities attribute these delays to technical problems.
However, they have now committed to the preparation of a monthly TOFE beginning with
the January 2005 accounts (proposed PC).
31.
There have been delays in the transmittal of Treasury accounts and budget
execution laws to the Audit Court and the review of the documents by the Court prior
to transmittal to the Parliament has been slow. Owing to these delays, the last budget
15

The system can only track domestically financed expenditure, there are substantial delays

- 14 -

execution law voted by the Parliament is that of 1996. The authorities have now committed
to send the 2003 accounts to the Audit Court in early February 2005 (prior action). The
ability of the Audit Court to properly exercise its ex-post review role and impose
accountability on the Treasury is constrained by a lack of resources. The authorities noted
that the Court’s resources will be augmented with the support of international partners.
32.
Progress has been made with the preparation of a medium-term expenditure
framework in four ministries. The framework will be gradually extended to all ministries,
but it needs to be improved, particularly to permit reconciliation of PRSP priorities with the
annual budget. The staff pointed out that the rising level of capital expenditure made it more
urgent to put in place effective procedures for medium term investment planning and the
assessment of recurrent costs associated with capital expenditure.
D. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
33.
The authorities noted that the current monetary arrangement within the
WAEMU has served Senegal well. The staff agreed that the elimination of central bank
financing of the budget, the repayment of the BCEAO’s statutory advances over the next
nine years, and adherence to WAEMU convergence criteria should contribute to monetary
stability in the WAEMU region and help enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. It
pointed out, however, that the existence of substantial excess reserves in the banking system
impedes the ability of the central bank to influence interest rates, and the differentiated
reserve requirement system inhibits financial integration within the region. It encouraged the
authorities to raise these issues at the WAEMU Council of Ministers’ meetings.
34.
The recent FSAP mission found that the banking system is reasonably sound
(Table 15), but vulnerable to excessive credit concentration and a large stock of
nonperforming loans.16 At end-June 2004, gross non performing loans amounted to
14 percent of total loans. Some banks are also in noncompliance with the prudential norms.
To address these weaknesses, the staff proposed raising the capital adequacy ratio above
8 percent to account for the specific risks inherent in the Senegalese economy. The staff
stressed that the regulatory framework for loan recovery and collateral seizure should be
simplified and the efficiency of the judicial system enhanced, along the lines recommended
by the FSAP report, to facilitate the reduction of nonperforming loans. These measures,
together with stringent enforcement of prudential norms, will enhance the soundness of the
system and reduce banking risks, thereby improving credit availability.
35.
The authorities were not prepared to commit to the measures proposed by the
staff and the recent FSAP report to enhance the soundness of banks and the
16

See “Senegal-Financial System Stability Assessment-Update” (IMF Country Report
No. 05/126).

- 15 -

development of the financial market. They argued that some of the measures had to be
endorsed by the WAEMU regional authorities before they could commit to them. The staff
urged the authorities to put forward these reforms at the WAEMU Council of Ministers’
meetings. To this end, the authorities will prepare an action plan for financial sector
development to be agreed with the staff during the third review. Regarding measures to
combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), the authorities
explained that a draft law criminalizing the financing of terrorism is under preparation at the
WAEMU level with a view to its adoption in 2005, and that a financial intelligence unit is
being set up, in order to strengthen implementation of AML legislation.
36.
The staff urged caution in the establishment of the postal savings bank. It argued
that this new agency should be created only with majority private capital. The authorities
explained that even if the postal bank is created, it will not extend credit until the majority of
its capital is privately owned. In the meantime, they expect to recapitalize the Post Office and
separate its financial operations (deposit collection) from postal services. The staff urged the
authorities to complete the separation in 2005.
37.
The authorities disagreed with the staff’s advice against the establishment of a
subsidiary for the Regional Solidarity Bank (BRS).17 They argued that the BRS could play
a useful role in making credit available to clients without access to bank credit. The staff
pointed out, and the authorities agreed, however, that the main mechanism for channeling
credit to these groups should be the microfinance institutions, which already exist and are
expanding their operations.
E. Public Enterprise Reforms and Governance
38.
After two failed privatization attempts in 1995 and 1999, and following several
months of negotiation, the authorities have decided to sell the groundnut processing and
vegetable oil refining company (SONACOS) to the only bidder that made an offer in
June 2004. The transfer of ownership will be completed by end-June 2005. The staff will
follow up on this commitment during the next review mission and, if needed, agree on steps
to ensure the completion of privatization. The authorities agreed that, while it remains in
public ownership, SONACOS will not have recourse to budgetary transfers, and its
borrowing and arrears will be subject to ceilings.18 The preliminary results of an FAD study
presented in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper indicate that privatization of
17

The BRS was created in May 2004. Its capital of US$45 million has been paid by the
WAEMU states and, indirectly, the BCEAO. The original plan to raise 90 percent of the
capital from the private sector has not yet been realized. The next step is the establishment of
a subsidiary in each WAEMU country. The BRS is expected to lend primarily to
microfinance institutions and small enterprises.
18

Budgetary transfers to SONACOS amounted to 2 percent of GDP in 2001.

- 16 -

SONACOS would have little adverse impact on the net income of groundnut farmers. The
authorities also agreed to eliminate the tax on vegetable oil protecting SONACOS to provide
a level playing field for the operators in this sector. The revenue impact of this measure is
negligible.
39.
Despite some improvements, the financial position of the electricity company
(SENELEC) remains fragile, constituting a serious contingent liability for the
government.19 Its profitability has been affected by the 5 percent cut in electricity prices
announced in July 2004, in application of a rigid pricing formula (which is based on
historical prices and weights, and is applied once a year), administered by the electricity
sector regulatory commission. The authorities are committed to adopting a new marketoriented formula by October 2005 in consultation with the World Bank (structural
benchmark). They also agreed that SENELEC will not receive any current budgetary
transfers and both its arrears and indebtedness to the banking system will be subject to
ceilings. The company’s financial position and prospects will be monitored by the World
Bank. The authorities indicated that their medium-term strategy for SENELEC, agreed with
the World Bank, consisted in attracting a partner to take over its management.
40.
The government intends to tighten surveillance of the companies in which the
state holds substantial equity, to better monitor and control contingent liabilities.20 The
28 public enterprises, in which the government is the majority owner, have a combined
outstanding debt of about 3 percent of GDP (Table 16). In 2005, the authorities will launch a
tender to privatize the state lottery company, LONASE, which had accumulated losses
amounting to 0.6 percent of GDP by end December 2003. The Industries Chimiques du
Sénégal (ICS), the largest company in which the state owns a substantial minority stake,
made losses amounting to about 1 percent of GDP in 2003 and has accumulated debt
equivalent to 3 percent of GDP. The government has agreed not to make any budgetary
transfer to the company in 2005 and to press for cost cutting, management improvement, and
other remedial measures that would entail little impact on public finances in later years.
41.
The staff welcomed the steps taken to improve the business environment and
urged further simplification of regulations affecting private sector activities. On the
recommendation of the Presidential Investors’ Council (PIC), a new corporate income tax
code and a streamlined investment code became effective in 2004. A law on build-operatetransfer (BOT) procedures for large projects was adopted in February 2004. Steps are also
being taken to accelerate the administrative process for registration under the investment
code and, more generally, for business authorization and licenses, with the Investment
Promotion Agency (APIX) serving as a facilitator for investors. The authorities noted that the
19
20

In 2001, SENELEC received budgetary transfers of about one percent of GDP.

Eleven public enterprises were privatized or liquidated in the run up to the completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

- 17 -

recent creation of the National Council Against Corruption and Extortion should also
alleviate investors’ concerns. The staff pointed out that the Council should propose credible
reforms soon to correct the persistent perception of a high level of corruption in Senegal.21
F. External Competitiveness, Trade, and Payments
42.
The authorities agreed with the staff on the need for reinforcing Senegal’s
external competitiveness. Senegal’s export performance has not been a major impetus to
economic growth, even since the devaluation of 1994, mainly because of structural
weaknesses that have raised export production costs and the absence of export diversification
(Box 1). Going forward, the authorities consider the agriculture and agro-food industry,
fishing, tourism, telecommunications, and textile as promising export sectors. However, the
development of these sectors is impeded by the problems of soil erosion, depletion of fish
stocks, and inefficiencies in the groundnut, and electricity sectors. The staff emphasized and
the authorities agreed that, apart from addressing these impediments, the key element of the
government strategy should be creating an environment that would promote private sector
activities in these sectors.
43.
Senegal continues to maintain an exchange system free of restrictions on making
payments and transfers for current international transactions, and its trade regime
broadly conforms to the provisions of the WAEMU common regional trade policy.
Intraregional trade is essentially free, whereas imports from third countries are subject to the
common external tariff (CET). The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to the
process of WAEMU economic convergence and their support of the regional integration
efforts, in particular in the areas of tax harmonization and the implementation of the customs
union.
44.
The staff stressed the need for further trade liberalization. It noted that Senegal
should take a leading role in trade liberalization efforts, rather than await other WAEMU
countries to join the effort. The authorities expressed concern that the subsidies in the
industrial countries dampened the political will for liberalization. The staff agreed that the
subsidies were not helpful, but noted that they did not eliminate the benefits of further trade
liberalization. It encouraged adherence to the revised timetable for the phase-out of the
temporary taxe dégressive de protection (TDP), and urged that the number of imported
commodities for which the import duty is calculated on the basis of administrative prices be
brought in line with WAEMU rules. The authorities noted their intention to apply the
procedure to fewer products from July 2005, when the WTO’s temporary approval of the
number of administrative prices expires.
21

In 2004, Senegal ranked 85th among 146 countries in the corruption perception index of
Transparency International (11th least corrupt among 31 African countries). Its score was the
second worst since appearing on the list (1998).

- 18 -

Box 1. Senegal’s Export Performance and External Competitiveness
Senegal’s export performance has been
relatively weak over the past ten years, with the
share of exports in GDP remaining relatively
constant (Figure 7). Exports grew by about
3 percent in volume terms, on an average annual
basis during 1995-2003. Furthermore, the
concentration of exports—as measured by Gini
coefficient—has remained broadly stable over
the period, indicating that export diversification
has been minimal.
Senegal’s export performance has been weaker
than most other WAEMU countries (Figure 8),
although it is the only country in WAEMU
where the REER has persistently depreciated
relative to its post 1994 devaluation level
(Figures 3 and 9). This development would
imply that structural weaknesses, common to all
WAEMU countries, may have affected
Senegal’s export performance more than the
other WAEMU members These weaknesses—
highlighted by the authorities and the private
sector—include erratic electricity supply, large
production costs arising from high electricity,
water, telecommunication, labor, and real estate
costs, Dakar’s saturation as an industrial
production site, burdensome administrative
procedures, and the inefficient judicial system.
The declining trend in the terms of trade and
export prices indicates that the profitability of
the sector may have also been a factor
constraining export growth during 1998–2003
(Figure 9).
Export market share developments (Figure 7)
suggest that during 2000–03, competitiveness
may not have been affected by the appreciation
of the REER resulting from the depreciation of
the U.S. dollar against the euro. Nevertheless,
the continuation of the euro appreciation is
likely to be detrimental to competitiveness. In
this light, ameliorating the structural weaknesses
noted above has taken on more urgency as a
means to prevent the erosion of competitiveness.

G. Medium-Term Outlook and Policies
45.
With monetary and exchange rate policies determined at the regional level, fiscal
policy will remain the main instrument of macroeconomic policy in Senegal, supported
by structural reforms. Over the recent years, fiscal policy has been conducted in a prudent
manner, leading to low primary deficits. This fiscal stance has been buttressed by the
cautious monetary policy of the BCEAO, which is aimed at underpinning the exchange rate
anchor, and delivering low inflation. On the structural front, reforms have been implemented
with delays and occasional backtracking on initial plans, hindering the realization of the
country's growth potential and its poverty reduction goals. Nevertheless, the government has
privatized many public enterprises, enhanced the environment for private sector activities,
and made some improvements in the country's infrastructure. Looking forward, the
authorities agreed with the staff that the prudent fiscal stance should continue, and priority
should be given to addressing the structural bottlenecks in order to enhance the efficiency of
the economy, particularly in the export sector.
46.
The staff’s medium-term scenario is based on real GDP annual growth of about
5 percent and continued low inflation during 2006-2010 (Table 11).22 This growth rate is
about one percentage point higher than the average growth rate since the devaluation of the
CFAF in 1994 (Box 2).23 Its attainment would require implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies, market-oriented structural reforms, and an efficient government
investment program.
47.
The baseline scenario allows for a narrowing of the resource gap over the
medium term. Private savings should strengthen moderately, facilitated by rising real per
capita income and financial sector development. Reflecting these trends, the external current
account deficit (including official transfers) would decline marginally from the projected
5 percent of GDP in 2005 to around 4.5 percent by 2010 (Table 12). The current account
deficit is relatively large and has been on a rising trend in recent years, but it does not
constitute a serious sustainability risk over the medium term, assuming the policies outlined
in this report, including the stance of medium-term fiscal policy, and continued flow of
development and budgetary aid. The pooling of reserves by WAEMU member countries and

22

Assuming that the elasticity between poverty reduction and growth observed during 1994–
2001 holds, a real GDP growth rate of 7 percent per year would be needed to attain the
Millennium Development Goal of reducing the poverty rate to 34 percent by 2015.

23

The introduction of the 1993 System of National Accounts and a shift in the base year
from 1987 to 1999 in early 2003 led to a downward revision of average annual real GDP
growth rate during 1997–2003 from 4.8 to 4.2 percent.

the convertibility guarantee by the French Treasury further diminish the risk of external
current account sustainability.24
48.
Senegal exits from the enhanced HIPC Initiative with a good basis for
maintaining sustainable external debt levels over the medium term, especially if
borrowing remains at concessional terms. This result, which is consistent with the analysis
underlying the HIPC completion point document, is confirmed by the preliminary
conclusions of the authorities’ first post completion point debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
(Box 3) and the staff’s updated assessment of external debt sustainability (Appendix I).
49.
The authorities are committed to maintaining a prudent borrowing policy in the
post-HIPC Initiative period, and to strengthening their debt management capacity. The
need for efficient domestic debt management procedures has heightened, given growing
reliance on issuance of government securities for budgetary financing and increasing
borrowing by public enterprises on the regional market. The staff emphasized that the
capacity to identify, measure, and monitor existing and future contingent liabilities—
including those arising from public enterprise borrowing—should be strengthened. The staff
noted, and the authorities agreed, that the proposed Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) for the
implementation of large projects could also entail contingent liabilities for the government
and need to be carefully assessed.
50.
In support of the medium-term objectives, the staff suggested that the basic
fiscal balance (excluding HIPC expenditure) should be kept positive in the medium
term and the overall fiscal deficit contained to 2–2.5 percent of GDP (Table 11). While a
larger fiscal deficit could still be consistent with fiscal sustainability, a more prudent fiscal
stance is warranted in light of the country’s limited absorptive capacity and the government’s
growing contingent liabilities. To this end, the strong tax performance should be sustained
through improvements in tax administration and continued fight against tax evasion and
fraud. The baseline scenario assumes that capital expenditure will return to the trend in 2006,
increasing gradually in later years to accommodate higher spending in the infrastructure,
health and education sectors. The wage bill is assumed to stabilize at 5.6 percent of GDP,
taking into account the compensation policy recently announced, while other current
expenditure would rise to accommodate higher recurrent costs of investment projects.
51.
The medium-term outlook is subject to a number of downside risks. Senegal’s
economy remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including higher oil prices, severe

24

In the context of the WAEMU, the issue of current account sustainability is more
meaningfully examined from a regional perspective, as reserves are pooled.

- 22 -

droughts, and locust invasion, and severe political strife in the WAEMU region.25 There is
also a risk that the political resolve to continue with key structural reforms would slacken.
Moreover, the steady flow of external financing—on which the robust growth of the
economy depends26—will largely hinge on the authorities’ ability to maintain a high level of
credibility in formulating their fiscal policy and implementing structural reforms. The
authorities saw little risk in this regard. They pointed to the increase in private sector
investment projects approved by the investment promotion agency since 2001, the rising
level of remittances (about 6.5 percent of GDP in 2003), and their recent qualification for the
U.S. MCA as indications of confidence in the Senegalese economy and government policies.

25

While it is difficult to quantify these risks, staff estimates indicate that a US$5 per barrel
increase in oil prices above the current WEO projections would cut average annual GDP
growth rate by about 0.6 percentage points during 2005–2010, and worsen the external
current account deficit by about 0.6 percent of GDP per year during the same period. The
recent locust invasion may have lowered economic growth by about 0.8 percent in 2004.
26

Official flows of loans, grants, and debt relief have averaged 7 percent of GDP since the
1994 devaluation.

- 23 -

Box 3. First Post HIPC Completion Point Debt Sustainability Analysis
The authorities’ first post HIPC completion point debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
concludes that Senegal’s external public debt remains sustainable over the medium to long
term. The DSA was carried out by the National Committee on Economic Policy with the support of
Debt Relief International. It is based on a loan-by-loan exercise for the end-2003 debt stock. The
report presents three different scenarios. The key debt indicators (after debt relief) are reported in
the table below.
The baseline scenario assumes unchanged debt relief compared with the HIPC completion point
and an average annual real GDP growth rate of 6 percent.
The optimistic scenario envisages debt relief beyond HIPC completion point terms (including
bilateral debt cancellations), real GDP growth rate of 7 percent, and larger borrowing over the
medium term.
The pessimistic scenario, which serves as a stress test, rests on more unfavorable assumptions
regarding debt relief received and real economic growth (averaging 3 percent per year), and allows
for terms of trade shocks.

H. Relations with the Fund, Capacity to Repay, and Program Monitoring
52.
The authorities indicated that they would not request an extension of the current
PRGF arrangement (beyond its current expiration date of April 2006) to compensate
for the delays in the completion of the first and second reviews. They expressed
preference for exiting from the PRGF in favor of an arrangement without access to Fund
resources for signaling purposes. The staff explained that the Fund’s current procedures
preclude a no-access arrangement. However, alternative options could be discussed during

- 24 -

future review missions based on the outcome of the Board discussions on the financial
instruments for Fund support to low-income countries. The authorities further requested that
the remaining resources committed under the current PRGF arrangement be rephased to
allow drawing of the full amount on the completion of the remaining three reviews. The staff
supports the request as the program is now broadly on track to achieve the original
macroeconomic and structural reform objectives, including the privatization of SONACOS,
rehabilitation of SENELEC, and strengthening of public expenditure management.
53.
The program will be monitored by quantitative and structural performance
criteria, structural benchmarks, and indicative targets as indicated in the MEFP,
Tables 1 and 3 (see also Box 4 below). Progress under the program will be further assessed in
the context of the third and fourth reviews (Table 17), which will include the examination of
an action plan to strengthen the financial sector.
54.
Senegal has an excellent record in meeting its debt obligations to the Fund. Given
the trajectory of its external and fiscal positions, Senegal should not have any difficulty
discharging its future obligations to the Fund (Table 13) in a timely manner.

Box 4. Senegal: Structural Conditionality
Coverage. Structural conditionality proposed for the 2005 program (MEFP, Annex, Table 3)
focuses on (i) tax administration, public expenditure management and control, and fiscal
transparency and (ii) completion of reforms in the groundnut sector, which is critical for
safeguarding public finances and enhancing conditions for economic growth and poverty
reduction.
Prior actions not yet implemented comprise the submission of the end-year budget and treasury
accounts of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to the Audit Court.
Performance criteria comprise (i) the preparation of monthly tables of government’s financial
operations (TOFE); and (ii) the elimination of the tax on vegetable oil.
The four structural benchmarks refer to tax administration, public expenditure management
and fiscal transparency.
Structural areas covered by World Bank lending. The World Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy for the fiscal years 2003–05 envisages conditionality in infrastructure, electricity sector
development, rural development, health, education, private sector development, and public
financial management. The Bank has taken the lead role in supporting technical and policy
work, including with technical assistance and investment lending, for envisaged reforms in the
electricity and groundnut sectors, and for postal and pension systems; all these reforms have a
systemic impact on the public finances and on macroeconomic stability and are also included in
the PRGF-supported program. The Bank and Fund staffs also coordinate their approach in the
area of public expenditure reform.
Structural areas for future conditionality. In the context of subsequent reviews of the
program, conditionality will be also considered in the area of financial sector reform.

- 25 -

I. Statistical Issues and Disclosure
55.
Overall, Senegal's economic database is comprehensive and adequate for
program monitoring, but there are weaknesses in the data on national accounts,
production, international trade, and social indicators. The authorities are committed to
improving the quality and availability of economic, financial, and social indicators, with
technical assistance from the Fund and other international organizations. To strengthen the
quality of Senegal’s statistical database, a National Statistical Institute is being set up, as
recommended by a 2001 STA mission.
56.
Senegal participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its
metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
since September 2001, but should be updated for virtually all sectors.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
57.
Senegal has attained macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability,
accompanied by robust economic growth, but the economy remains fragile and
vulnerable to shocks. In the short term the staff does not foresee any substantial risk on the
macroeconomic front—barring supply shocks, and assuming the policies outlined above.
However, the financing need and rising recurrent costs of the large infrastructural projects,
the limited scope for tax revenue growth (in light of the strong performance in recent years),
and the growing contingent liabilities of the government could pose a problem in the medium
term, especially if the flow of aid tapers off.
58.
The fiscal stance for 2005 is in line with the macroeconomic objectives. The fiscal
program allows for modest increases in current expenditure, keeps the investment outlays in
line with the absorptive capacity of the economy and foreign financing, and aims at an
ambitious, but feasible, revenue target. The staff welcomes the planned measured increase in
the wage bill relative to GDP.
59.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy should be focused on maintaining the trends
in the past two years, with low budget deficits, a strong revenue effort, and tight control
on current expenditure. This strategy would allow measured increases in capital and propoor spending. The authorities should ensure that capital spending remains consistent with
the absorptive capacity and fiscal sustainability.
60.
Improving public expenditure management and fiscal transparency remains a
key program objective. There have been substantial delays in implementing reforms in
these areas, and the Thiès-related budgetary irregularities amounted to a serious set back in
fiscal transparency and governance. The staff urges the authorities to move forcefully to
enhance transparency and good governance, particularly in procurement. It also stresses the
need to ensure that the use of any funds received from the MCA or Islamic Conference
Organization is subject to transparent budgetary procedures.

- 26 -

61.
The privatization and rehabilitation of public enterprises are essential for
improving the efficiency of the economy, enhancing export prospects, and reducing the
contingent liabilities of the government. The staff welcomes the sale of the state-owned
groundnut processing company, after many years of delay, and urges the completion of the
transfer of ownership by end June 2005. The fragile financial position of other enterprises
also needs urgent attention. The authorities should take steps to improve the efficiency of the
electricity company, and modify the procedures for setting its electricity prices to take into
account costs and market conditions in a timely fashion. The government’s capacity to
identify, measure, and monitor existing and future contingent liabilities—including those
arising from public enterprise borrowing—should be strengthened.
62.
Preserving competitiveness will pose a challenge in the period ahead. So far, the
appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar has not had a major impact on Senegal’s
external competitiveness, but further appreciation could pose a problem. Structural reforms
and infrastructural development are essential to lower the cost of production, raise the
productivity of the export sector, and prevent the erosion of competitiveness.
63.
The staff welcomes the plans for the issuance of additional government securities
on the WAEMU regional market. This initiative could spearhead the development of the
securities market. To further encourage financial market development (and improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy) the excess liquidity in the banking system should be
reduced and the country-specific reserve ratios unified.
64.
The large nonperforming loans and credit concentration in the banking system
are potential sources of vulnerability. The staff urges the authorities to simplify the loan
recovery procedures to allow a reduction in bad loans. Consideration should also be given to
raising the capital adequacy ratio above 8 percent to account for the specific risks inherent in
the Senegalese economy. The authorities should remain vigilant in detecting fragility in the
banking system and impose timely corrective action on banks facing difficulties or in noncompliance with prudential norms. These and other measures should be included in the
government’s action plan for the financial sector, to be agreed with the staff during the next
review.
65.
The staff commends the authorities for the production of their first post HIPC
completion point DSA. This analysis and that of the staff indicate that there is little risk to
debt sustainability over the medium term, assuming the policies outlined in this report.
66.
Policy credibility is critical for the continued support of the development
partners on which the success of the growth and poverty reduction policies depend.
Repeated slippages in the reform agenda and in fiscal governance, such as the fiscal
irregularities in 2003, would erode policy credibility and serve as a disincentive to the flow
of aid and investment.
67.
The staff recommends the completion of the second review under the PRGF
arrangement. It also recommends that waivers be granted for the non observance of the

- 27 -

floor on the end-December 2003 basic fiscal surplus and the continuous ceiling on the
contracting of non-concessional debt. The staff also supports the request for rephasing of the
arrangement, as the program is now back on track to achieve the original macroeconomic and
structural reform objectives. The main risk to the program stems from the possibility of
policy reversals if the political will for reform slackens. However, against this risk should be
set the strength of the authorities’ 2005 program—including the steps being taken to improve
governance and ensure budgetary discipline—and their commitment to take additional
measures as needed.
68.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Senegal will be held in
24 months subject to provisions applying to countries under Fund arrangements.

APPENDIX I

Assessing Senegal’s External Debt Sustainability1
1.
External debt sustainability is preserved under the baseline scenario, and is robust to
a series of plausible shocks, including a worsening of borrowing terms. There are little risks
of unfavorable debt dynamics, especially if the authorities remain committed to a prudent
debt management strategy in the post-HIPC period. The updated DSA yields estimates for the
key debt indicators that are broadly consistent with those calculated at the time of the HIPC
Completion Point.
2.
The long-term macroeconomic scenario underlying the DSA is more conservative
than the baseline of the April 2004 HIPC Completion Point document. The key
assumptions underlying the long-term macroeconomic framework are: (i) real GDP growth
averaging 5.2 percent annually, or about ½ percentage point lower than in the HIPC baseline;
(ii) export volume growth averaging 4.9 percent per year, compared to 5.6 percent in the
HIPC document; (iii) a doubling of the fiscal deficit (averaging 2.8 percent of GDP) against
1.5 percent of GDP for the HIPC scenario; and (iv) larger new borrowing, reflecting the more
expansionary fiscal stance.
3.
Under this macroeconomic scenario, Senegal can maintain a sustainable external
debt with ratios well below the reference thresholds. Senegal’s key debt ratios would
continue to decline over the medium to long term (Table 1a and Figure 1).
4.
Senegal’s external debt remains sustainable over the long term, even in the
presence of some exogenous shocks. Stress tests show that a shock to export growth—with
exports falling by about 10 percent in 2005 and 2006—would be the main risk. However, the
debt indicators would return to a sustainable level after a temporary hike (Figure 1 and
Table 1b). Besides, neither lower economic growth (set at 0.6 percent in 2005 and 2006) nor
lower nondebt inflows (with current transfers falling to 2 percent of GDP in 2005 and 2006
from 8 percent in 2004) would lead to unsustainable debt dynamics. Likewise, the debt
sustainability path is robust to a combination of moderate shocks involving lower economic
growth, lower nondebt inflows and a devaluation (Table 1b). It is also shown that a scenario
based on key variables set at their historical averages—the historical scenario—would display
a sustainable debt path, thereby suggesting that the results of the baseline scenario are robust.
5.
Senegal’s external debt sustainability would also be preserved in the event of a
measured deterioration of borrowing terms. A three-percentage point increase in nominal
interest rates for new borrowing—implying a grant element falling to below 20 percent—
would lead to a significant deterioration of the debt indicators (Table 1b and Figure 2), but
they remain below the indicative thresholds over the long term.
1

The analysis is based on the DSA template for low-income countries. Senegal’s debt
sustainability is reviewed in relation to the following reference thresholds: (i) 150 percent for
NPV of debt to exports; (ii) 40 percent for NPV of debt to GDP; and (iii) 20 percent for the
debt service to exports ratio.

APPENDIX II

Dakar, February 4, 2005
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato,
1.
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund on April 28, 2003 approved
a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in the
amount of SDR 24.27 million, in support of Senegal’s economic growth and poverty
reduction program for 2003–05. The first review under this arrangement was completed on
February 13, 2004. The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (the
“Memorandum”) describes the results achieved in 2003 and during the first nine months
of 2004, as well as the policies that the government of Senegal will pursue in 2005 to meet
the program’s objectives. It includes the measures taken to correct the shortcomings noted in
the implementation of infrastructure works in Thiès in 2003 and 2004, which led to a
postponement of the completion of the second review, initially scheduled for June 2004.
2.
As stated in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum, all of the program’s quantitative
performance criteria were met as at end-December 2003, with the exception of the floor on
the basic fiscal balance (program definition).This criterion was not met because of the
emergency spending program adopted to cope with the adverse effects of the 2002 drought.
In addition, the Autonomous Port of Dakar, faced with the looming breakdown of essential
infrastructure, contracted a nonconcessional external loan of CFAF 6 billion from the West
African Development Bank in October 2004 to carry out essential works, thereby exceeding
the ceiling on nonconcessional public sector external borrowing. The extraordinary
circumstances that led to the nonobservance of these criteria are explained in the attached
Memorandum. Therefore, the government of Senegal hereby requests a waiver for the
nonobservance of these two performance criteria.
3.
The government of Senegal believes that the policies and measures set forth in the
attached Memorandum, as well as the policies presented in the previous Memoranda of
April 10, 2003, January 26, 2004, and May 18, 2004, will permit the achievement of its
program objectives; however, it will promptly take any additional measures deemed
necessary in this connection. The government of Senegal will consult the Managing Director
of the IMF on the adoption of these measures and before making any amendments to the
policies described in the Memorandum.
4.
To facilitate the attainment of the objectives and the implementation of the abovementioned policies, the government of Senegal hereby requests the completion of the second

- 53 -

review and the disbursement of the third loan under the three-year arrangement, in an amount
equivalent to SDR 3.47 million.
5.
It is expected that the third review under the PRGF-supported program, which will
make available the disbursement of the fourth loan, be completed by end-August 2005. This
review will include, among others, the examination of an action plan to strengthen the
financial sector. The fourth and last program review, which will make available the
disbursement of the fifth loan, is expected to be completed no later than end-February 2006.
6.
In spite of the delay in concluding the second review, the government does not wish
to extend the current arrangement under the PRGF beyond its expiration on April 27, 2006. It
requests that the remaining PRGF resources committed to Senegal be rephased over the
remaining period of the arrangement.
7.
The government of Senegal consents to the publication of this letter, the
memorandum on its economic and financial policies, and the report of Fund staff on the
second review of the program.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Abdoulaye Diop
Minister of Economy and Finance

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

SENEGAL
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies for 2004–05
Dakar, February 4, 2005
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Senegal’s commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals is spelt out
in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The medium-term economic and financial
growth and development objectives will continue to be framed by the guidelines set out in
the PRSP, in particular, the need to meet the strong demand for social services. The growth
targets, which the government has set itself, fall within the framework of the Accelerated
Growth Strategy, which seeks to raise the growth rate of real GDP, in the medium and long
terms, to an annual average of 7 percent. A recent joint study by the government of Senegal
and the World Bank showed that the incidence of poverty had declined by 16 percent
between 1994 and 2002, as a result of the robust growth of the economy.
2.
A national framework for monitoring and evaluation is in place to facilitate the
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. The report on the first year of PRSP
implementation distributed to the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards in May 2004, takes
account into the comments of the development partners. The procedure for updating the
PRSP will be launched at the beginning of 2005. The new document will incorporate the new
priorities, namely the development of infrastructure and the improvement of mobility in the
capital, and the conclusions of the first and second annual PRSP progress reports. The second
progress report will be completed by end-March 2005.
3.
This memorandum updates the information in the memorandum of May 18, 2004 that
describes the performance of financial policies and the implementation of structural reforms
in 2003 and the program for 2004. The current memorandum reviews performance during the
first nine months of 2004 and assesses the outlook for the rest of the year. It also presents the
financial program for 2005, including the fiscal outlook.
A. Program Implementation in 2003
4.
The quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2003 were met, except for
the floor on the basic fiscal balance (program definition). Net credit to government declined
by CFAF 42.3 billion more than expected; SENELEC did not accumulate any arrears to
suppliers; and no government domestic or foreign payments arrears were accumulated;
SENELEC incurred a new nonconcessional external loan from the West African
Development Bank (BOAD) in July 2003, for which the IMF Executive Board granted a
waiver. A government circular was issued in November 2003, requiring all public enterprises
wishing to contract foreign debt to seek the prior consent of the Ministry of Economy and
finance, which will verify the concessionality of the loan.

- 55 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

5.
All quantitative indicators for end-December 2003 were observed, except for the floor
on tax revenue and the ceiling on guarantee deposits. Tax revenue target was not achieved
because of unfavorable trends in the tax base. Outstanding guarantee deposits slightly
exceeded the program ceiling, mainly because of cash management problem at SENELEC,
which prevented repayment of the remainder of a bank loan guaranteed by the government
until March 2004. The other indicators, the ceilings on the wage bill, expenditure executed
through exceptional procedures (cash advances and early payments), the stock of
correspondent accounts (program definition), and the stock of SONACOS debt were all met.
Similarly, the floors on credit flows in the correspondent accounts of the postal service and
the Treasury were observed and the SENELEC met its basic balance target.
B. Structural Reforms
6.
In the second half of 2003, the government implemented major reforms, in particular,
in the tax system, recruitment policy, and public expenditure management. It also launched
an ambitious program to build capacity in the energy and groundnut sectors and to make the
regulatory framework and administrative procedures less burdensome for private sector
operators.
7.
Considerable progress was made in the selection of an Independent Power Producer
(IPP) and the privatization of SONACOS. The call for bids on an IPP concession was sent
out to potential bidders on November 5, 2003. Likewise, for the privatization of SONACOS,
the tender documents were submitted to pre-qualified investors on January 13, 2004.
8.
A key element of the first program review was formulating a medium-term civil
service recruitment policy, to allow the government to accelerate compliance with the PRSP
targets. These involve a 23 percent increase in staff over the level in 2002. Following the
adoption of the plan in October 2003, a first wave of 1,356 employees was recruited in 2003,
for the Education and Justice ministries.
II.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IN 2004

A. Economic and Financial Developments in 2004
9.
The economic and financial environment in 2004 was marked by a spike in oil prices,
which exceeded US$50 per barrel in September 2004, and swarms of locusts invading
Senegal. Despite these exogenous factors, the level of activity held steady. The impact of the
locust infestation was contained through mobilization of domestic and external resources
(both material and financial), effective protection of large production areas, especially those
in the south, and the dynamism of the industry and services sectors. Nevertheless, primary
sector is estimated to have grown by only 2 percent compared to 11.6 percent originally
expected, reflecting a sharp decline in grain production. The secondary sector, affected by
rising oil prices, is estimated to have grown a little less than expected in the program. The
tertiary sector, which benefited from the effects of the good 2003 harvest, the development of

- 56 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

the electronic industry, and increased employment in the civil service, is estimated to have
grown slightly more than planned. In the first nine months of 2004, the Industrial Production
Index (IPI) rose more than 10 percent, the private service turnover index climbed to
20 percent, and the trade margin index grew by 8 percent. Real GDP is estimated to have
grown by 6 percent as programmed.
10.
Given the relatively high price of the barrel of oil on the world market, the inflation
rate, measured by the GDP deflator, is expected to have been higher than originally expected.
At end-November 2004, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HIPC) increased by
0.4 percent on a year-on-year basis.
11.
At end-September 2004, the basic fiscal balance was better than expected despite a
small underperformance in tax revenues. The tax revenue target for the year is estimated to
have been reached thanks to higher expected performance of indirect taxes (particularly VAT
on the Thiès projects) during the last quarter.
12.
A supplementary budget law was adopted in September 2004 to allocate
CFAF 31.5 billion in resources from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. In
conformity with PRSP guidelines, resources from the enhanced HIPC Initiative were
allocated to the priority sectors (agriculture, education, health, sewerage and rural
electrification) and to projects that impact poverty reduction (microfinance and creation of
artisans’ villages). CFAF 26.5 billion (i.e., 83 percent) has been allocated to rural areas. The
supplementary budget law also allocated resources for completing the infrastructure work in
Thiès, which had not been provided for in the initial appropriations of 2004 budget (see
paragraph 18).
13.
At end-December 2004, the basic fiscal balance (excluding HIPC expenditure and
temporary structural reform costs) is registered to have a surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP and
the overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is expected to amount to 2.7 percent of GDP.
14.
Net foreign assets are estimated to have grown by CFAF 71 billion, and domestic
credit to have increased by 14 billion, reflecting a tangible improvement in the government’s
net position and a 6-percent increase in credit to the rest of the economy. The money supply
is expected to have therefore grown by 7 percent, or just a little less than the growth in
nominal GDP.
15.
The current deficit on the balance of payments (including current official grants)
should be 6.2 percent of GDP, less than in 2003, the improvement in some export sectors,
notably mining, and the decrease in food imports being stronger than the increase in imports
of petroleum products.
B. Structural Reforms in 2004
16.
The implementation of the reforms undertaken since 2003 continued in 2004. These
reforms concern mainly the computerized management of fiscal operations, tax policy, hiring
policy, the compensation strategy in the civil service, the groundnut and electricity sectors,

- 57 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

and a less burdensome regulatory framework and administrative procedures for private
operators. The process of privatizing SONACOS was delayed. But the government has now
accepted an offer for its sale. The transfer of ownership will be implemented by June 2005.
17.
The government paid off the end-2002 arrears in social security contributions
amounting to CFAF 11.3 billion owed by liquidated or bankrupt enterprises and local
governments to the Senegalese pension institute (IPRES) (CFAF 8.2 billion) and social
security fund (CSS) (CFAF 3.1 billion).
18.
The government had expected that the infrastructure work in Thiès in 2004, totaling
CFAF 40.1 billion, would be completed before April 4 2004 for the Independence Day
celebration. Given the urgency, contracts with private-sector companies were signed in 2003
before budgetary appropriations were approved. The companies began work in 2003 based
on bank pre-financing, prior to approval of the contracts by the competent authorities. The
companies incurred CFAF 11 billion in expenditures in 2003 that were not invoiced
until 2004. The 2004 budget included CFAF 31 billion of appropriations for the works in
Thiès. However, to ensure full funding of the projects, the government included the
remaining CFAF 9.1 billion in the draft 2004 supplementary budget voted by the assembly in
October. The review of the compliance of contracts for the work in Thiès with the
procurement code, conducted with assistance from the World Bank, showed that because of
the urgency, some deadlines were shortened, raising the risk of errors in assessing the quality
and cost of the offers.
19.
The projects carried out in Thiès form part of the government’s policy to create new
regional focal points of development. Under this policy, starting in 2004 the government
initiated an infrastructure investment program in the country’s secondary cities. This
investment program falls under the wealth creation policy, which is one of the priorities in
the PRSP. The works in the secondary cities would (i) reduce the large economic
development gap between these cities and the capital; (ii) create infrastructure that can help
attract investors to these localities; (iii) develop public infrastructure that enables local
government agencies to upgrade to the same level as the capital; and (iv) create conditions
for local development through productive activities that help reduce poverty in these areas
and excessive demographic pressures on the capital.
C. Performance Relative to Program Targets in 2004
20.
At end-June 2004, all the quantitative objectives of the program had been met, except
for the floor on net credit flows in the correspondent accounts of the SN La Poste at the
Treasury. At end-September all the targets that had previously been proposed as PCs (but not
established as such by the Board) were met. However, indicative targets for tax revenue, the
stock of deposits in correspondent accounts, expenditures executed through exceptional
payment procedures, the basic balance of SENELEC, and the stock of debt of SONACOS,
were breached by small amounts. The Autonomous Port of Dakar borrowed CFAF 6.1 billion
at an interest rate of 8.5 percent per year over 10 years with three years’ grace from the West
African Development Bank in October 2004. This loan was needed to make the necessary

- 58 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

urgent repairs to prevent the closing of the port, which would have had serious repercussions
on the national economy.
21.
The government took the prior actions initially envisaged for the second review
including publication of the implementing decree and circular for the investment code, and
production of a report on tracking expenditure execution by major line items. It also installed
the SIGFIP software and published the audited accounts of SENELEC in the projected time
frame. By contrast, the Treasury accounts for FY 2002 were not forwarded to the Audit
Court on time, and the interconnection between the Tax Administration, the Customs
Administration and the Treasury is still not functional due to delays in the computerization of
the Treasury’s aggregate database. A detailed report on public investment project execution
is still to be produced.
III. KEY TARGETS AND COMPONENTS OF THE 2005 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PLAN
22.
In 2005, the poverty reduction strategy will be pursued on two levels in a context of
maintaining financial stability. On the one hand, the government will seek to improve quality
and expand availability of basic social services through its recruitment policy, particularly in
the education and health sectors, and the compensation policy for the civil service. On the
other hand, the government will continue its infrastructure investment program and the
strategy to promote the growth of private investment.
23.
The transparent and competition-friendly regulatory framework, established since
February 2004 with the adoption of the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) law, will facilitate
private sector involvement in building quality infrastructure. This law seeks to grant
concessions in a transparent and competitive manner. An Infrastructure Council was created
in February 2004, with representatives from civil society, government, parliament, and
experts. It will be responsible for ensuring consensus during the management stage of major
infrastructure projects. The government will pay special attention to the type of risk assumed
in public/private partnership (PPP) operations, especially in the context of financing major
infrastructure projects. Each PPP operation should clearly explain all financial liabilities,
implicit or explicit, assumed by the government. To ensure that major projects are effectively
managed, the government will request support from the World Bank for feasibility
assessments. It will also request the staff of the International Monetary Fund to ensure that
these projects are consistent with the macroeconomic framework of the program.
24.
The new Investment Code, which took effect in 2004, and the new legislation on
corporate taxation will introduce simpler regimes. The government will keep up close
communication with the private sector, in particular through the Presidential Investment
Council (CPI) and will continue its strategy of enhancing good governance.
25.
Based on these policies, the 2005 program aims to: (i) achieve a real growth rate of
about 6.4 percent; (ii) maintain price stability in line with the WAEMU multilateral

- 59 -

surveillance targets; and (iii) keep the fiscal and current balance of payments deficits at a
sustainable level.
26.
Real GDP growth in 2005 should reflect a sustained expansion of all sectors.
Primary sector growth is expected to rise as a result of recovery of grain production after the
decline in 2004. The growth of the secondary sector should be led mainly by construction
and public works thanks to the implementation of a major program to improve urban
mobility in Dakar and continued infrastructure development in the secondary towns.
27.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) should improve.
Export growth will be sustained mainly by an increase in the volume of groundnut-based
products and the recovery of phosphoric acid production.
A. Fiscal Policy, Tax Reform, Government Expenditure Management, Recruitment
and Compensation Policy
Fiscal policy
28.
Efforts to strengthen the structure of the budget will be continued and consolidated in
2005. The basic fiscal balance (program definition) will stand at 0.7 percent of GDP in 2005
compared with 1.4 percent of GDP in 2004. The overall deficit, including grants, will move
from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2005. The fiscal program is based
on the following principal parameters: (i) tax revenue projected at CFAF 802.2 billion, a tax
burden of 18.4 percent of GDP; (ii) a wage bill of CFAF 247.3 billion, incorporating the
moderate financial impact of the recruitment program and compensation policy; (iii) the
growth in other current expenditures (CFAF 309.9 billion) and capital expenditure from
domestic resources (CFAF 279 billion); and (iv) the temporary costs of structural reforms are
estimated at CFAF 18.5 billion, mainly to cover the recapitalization of the postal service
(CFAF 15.5 billion).
29.
The social (HIPC) expenditure that was the subject of a supplementary budget law in
previous years was incorporated into the initial budget law in 2005, to accelerate the pace of
expenditure on the social sectors. The expenditure under the HIPC Initiative in 2005 will
amount to CFAF 59.6 billion, of which 49.6 billion was allocated to capital expenditure, and
10 billion to operating expenditure. Financing for these expenditures will include:
(i) expected HIPC relief for 2005 of CFAF 51.1 billion; and (ii) CFAF 8.5 billion remaining
from the supplementary budget laws of 2001 and 2003.
30.
In executing the budget, the government will take into account revenue performance
relative to program targets. Consequently, if there is a revenue shortfall, the government will
take fiscal measures to keep the deficit in line with the program, including reductions in nonpriority spending, if necessary.
31.
Resources that may be received within the framework of the Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA) program and the preparation of the summit of the Organization of Islamic

- 60 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

Countries are not reflected in the 2005 budget. The amounts and procedures for spending
these resources are still not known. In the interest of strengthening fiscal discipline and
transparency, the government will adopt a supplementary budget law to present the external
funds made available to the government and all of its agencies, to finance any expenditure
associated with these initiatives.
32.
Starting with the 2006 budget, the government will ensure the consistency of the
capital expenditure budget with the capital expenditure shown in the TOFE. In addition, in
the process of preparing the public investment program under the budget law, the
government will take account of capacity constraints, recurrent expenditures, such as
operating and maintenance costs and the level of domestic and external debt that is
compatible with public debt sustainability.
33.
The government will keep up its efforts to expand the tax base and to improve
efficiency in tax collection. The ongoing tax reform should support a lasting and sustainable
level of fiscal revenue collection in 2005, while fostering a flexible and attractive environment
for private enterprise. To this end, in step with the reform of the General Tax Code, the
government has introduced several capacity-building measures in the Directorate General of
Taxes and Government Property (DGID). These measures include recruitment of at least 105
employees (55 tax officers and 50 assessors) per year at the DGID during 2004–05; continuing
computerization of the DGID, and digitizing the Land Registry. The electronic data-sharing
system will become fully operational by June 2005. It will make it possible to prepare monthly
reports on taxes assessed and collected with a maximum lag of one month. The digitization of
the Land Registry will enhance the efficiency of land and government property management.
The numerical mapping of the 40 largest urban areas was finished in December 2004.
34.
Under the recent tax reforms, efforts have been stepped up to fight tax fraud and tax
evasion. The key elements of the reform include a more proactive investigation of tax
offenses, on-site audits in processing VAT reimbursement claims, a better control of
exemptions, penalties for purchases made without delivery of an invoice, and enforcement of
the use of the single taxpayer ID number (NINEA).
35.
At the same time, the government has carried out a reform of the corporate tax,
including the new Investment Code. Implementation decrees and a circular were issued in
May 2004 with the objective of preserving fiscal neutrality and simplifying the tax regime.
36.
With a view to liberalizing the oilseed industry, in particular the privatization of
SONACOS, the special tax on imports of vegetable oils was suspended in June 2004 and the
law eliminating the tax on vegetable oil protection was voted in July 2004. After agreement
with the World Bank, the law was promulgated in December 2004. The tax will be
completely phased out by December 31, 2005.
37.
The government has decided to increase the percentage of gross wages that is
exempted from the calculation of the tax base on earned income for the contribution to the
retirement fund (the exempted wages pass from 10 to 13.2 percent) starting in January 2005,

- 61 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

thereby reducing the tax burden on wages. The negative impact of this measure on projected
revenue collection in 2005 amounts to CFAF 5 billion (about 0.01 percent of GDP).
Public expenditure management
38.
The draft 2005 budget was prepared in the context of a series of fiscal and financial
reforms that were a necessary part of PRSP implementation. These reforms revolve around
three pillars. First, a medium-term fiscal framework was prepared for four ministries. With
this new expenditure planning system, the budgets were prepared for the Health, Education,
Environment, and Justice sectors based on their sectoral programs. Second payment orders
procedures were also decentralized for these four line ministries. Lastly, a single budget
document was prepared, containing both the government’s current and capital expenditure,
based on a harmonized system of classification. The government will also take measures to
reconcile current and capital expenditures with PRSP priorities, paying particular attention to
Regional Operation Plans (POR) and the priority actions in the PRSP for vulnerable groups.
39.
With a view to strengthening the decentralization process and improving absorptive
capacity, the government plans to decentralize the consolidated investment budget (BCI)
from 2006. To that end, it will take action in 2005 on the different standards (laws,
conventions, and interministerial decrees), allowing fiscal decentralization to be implemented
in 2006, after the testing done in 2005 in the education and health ministries. The goal in
2007 is to extend the decentralization of management of the BCI’s internal resources to all
the departments of the spending ministries with projects that the government has entrusted to
local authorities.
40.
The government will continue to implement the ambitious program of budgetary and
public financial management reforms through action plans validated in July 2003 and
designed to reinforce fiscal management (CFAA) and procurement procedures (CPAR).
41.
With a view to computerizing the management of fiscal operations, the government
installed the Integrated Government Finance management System (SIGFIP) in July 2004.
The government is committed to increasing the effectiveness of this budget execution
tracking system with an automatic link with personnel expenses. Similarly, in order to better
track public expenditure execution and enhance fiscal transparency, the SIGFIP system will
be modified in two ways. First, information on expenditure execution will be presented with
the same level of detail as in the TOFE, making it possible to monitor the differences in the
levels of payment orders and actual payments. Second, SIGFIP will also be used to track
expenditure that have been committed and verified but for which no payment order has been
issued. This procedure will help to reduce the duration of the expenditure cycle. All these
changes should take effect in the first half of the year. This system is fully capable of
interfacing with the ASTER accounting software that will be installed in the Treasury. The
government has signed an agreement with France to install ASTER before January 1, 2007.
The agreement includes a plan for training and technical assistance, given the operational
complexity of the system.

- 62 -

42.
To better monitor public finances, the DGCPT will produce a monthly TOFE based
on monthly consolidated account balances, with a 60-day lag starting in 2005. The January
2005 TOFE will be prepared no later than March 31, 2005. Furthermore, the government will
make the TOFE more transparent by: (i) establishing a correspondence table between the
Treasury balance and the broad TOFE aggregates; (ii) improving the presentation of the
Treasury’s correspondent accounts in the TOFE; and (iii) ensuring the consistency between
the net government position with the banking system derived from the monetary data and
derived from the TOFE. All these measures will become effective by end-June 2005.
43.
To limit the use of contracts granted to a single bidder, annual procurement plans will
be established in the large spending ministries. The government will reduce the percentage of
contracts granted to single bidders to 20 percent of the total contracts granted by government
ministries. This performance criterion will be reexamined on the occasion of the third review
on the basis of the most recent information about contracts signed by all ministries and
government agencies.
44.
The government will conduct a study by end-March 2005 to harmonize the
Government Obligations Code and the Procurement Code and to improve the legal
framework for procurement. The government has included in the draft budget law for 2005
an article limiting the terms of application of Article 45 of the Code of Government
Obligations, which was approved with the passage of said budget law. This Article enables
contracting parties with the government to benefit from financial compensation, even if the
contracts were not approved by the competent authorities. Article 19 of the 2005 budget law
has the legal hierarchy so as to amend Article 45 of the Obligations Code as the budget law
has the same rank as the Code of Government Obligations, and may therefore amend the
latter’s provisions. Consequently, this article of the budget law permanently replaces the
provisions of Article 45 of the Code of Government Obligations. Furthermore, there are
currently no other provisions (in other laws) that permit contracting parties with the
government to receive financial compensation under the terms set forth in Article 45 of the
Government Obligations Code.
45.
The government intends conduct a systematic audit of budget execution. The internal
audit structures have been reorganized and revitalized. External audits of the government’s
management accounts by the Audit Court will continue and the parliamentary review of the
budget execution laws will be enhanced. The treasury accounts for the year 2000 were
submitted to the Audit Court in April 2004, while those of 2001 were submitted in July 2004,
in compliance with the initial program timetable. However, the accounts for 2002 were
submitted in November 2004, with a three-month delay. The accounts for 2003 will be
submitted no later than end–February 2005. The government will also support the Audit
Office in submitting the revised budget laws to the National Assembly by the deadlines set in
the WAEMU directives. Capacity building in the Audit Office includes financing from the
Multi-Donor Trust Fund managed by the World Bank to recruit assistants for auditing these
accounts.

Civil service recruitment and compensation policy
46.
A key component of the first program review was the formulation of a policy of
recruiting 15,000 new employees into the civil service over three years. The objectives
pursued are greater efficiency in the public service, to improve the quality and scope of basic
social services, in addition to strengthening judiciary, security services, and revenue offices.
Appointments in the first wave of hiring for 2003 were completed in June 2004. The final
proposals for 2004 have already been made. The implementation of the recruitment strategy
has suffered some delays. The hiring of 5,000 employees, planned initially for the last quarter
of 2003, was staggered over 2003 (1,356 employees) and the first quarter of 2004 (3,186
employees). The final proposals for 2004 were made and the staff hired should be available
to the units that need them by end-June 2005. As projected, 5,000 additional employees will
be recruited to start work in the last quarter of 2005. The government will continue and
accelerate the special recruitment program to meet all staff needs and improve the provision
of public services in compliance with PRSP objectives.
47.
The government has also implemented a new compensation strategy in the civil
service, effective October 2004. The strategy seeks to make wage increases performancerelated, provide additional incentives to staff to make civil service employment more
attractive, and strengthen the quality of public services. This new compensation policy has
been taken into account in the wage bill envelope for the 2005. A technical and financial
audit of the payroll is under way and the final report is expected in June 2005.
B. Postal Service
48.
The Government’s sectoral policy letter, adopted in February 2003, set out the
development objectives and strategy for the postal system. The objectives are to (i) improve
the overall performance of the postal sector by opening it up to the private sector;
(ii) upgrade the legal and regulatory framework of the sector and strengthen sectoral
regulation; (iii) safeguard the right of citizens to communication; (iv) transform Post Office
into a modern and effective enterprise by implementing a strategic plan; and (v) promote the
sustainable development of postal financial services by creating a subsidiary bank. The
implementation of the action plan attached to the policy letter, which includes
recapitalization of the postal service, was delayed, but will be completed in 2005, except for
the postal bank, which is scheduled to be established in 2006. The postal bank will not
undertake any credit operations until private shareholders hold a majority interest.
C. Financial Sector Reform
49.
After the success of the Treasury bill issue, the government will continue to issue
securities on the regional financial market to meet its needs. It is also continuing to explore
the possibility of deepening the government securities market in Senegal under the WAEMU
Community Directives. In particular, it plans to resort to the bond market to finance the
program to improve urban mobility in Dakar in 2005.

- 64 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

50.
The improvement in access to credit for the establishment and growth of enterprises,
in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, is a priority of the government’s action
program. A broad-based dialogue was launched in 2004 between the government, the private
sector, the central bank, banks and financial institutions, microfinance institutions, and the
regional stock market (BRVM), to foster the contribution of the financial sector to the
development of economic activity. An action plan is being elaborated. It revolves around the
following pillars: development of local financial intermediation; improvement of the
framework, monitoring governance of enterprises; promotion of new financial products and
nonbank financial intermediation (investment companies, risk capital companies, mortgage
funds, etc.); reform of the legal and judicial environment; and tax incentives to increase the
credit supply and mobilize long-term resources.
51.
The government’s actions will also include initiatives at the regional level to increase
bank financing to the economy, promote the regional financial market, and enhance the
soundness of the financial sector, and follow up the findings of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) update. The action plan will be discussed during the third
review program. Meanwhile, the government has already decided to hire 60 magistrates and
to build the capacity of the courts through specialized training in economic and financial
matters, to improve the enforcement of financial contracts and reduce the cost of financial
intermediation.
52.
The government will continue to actively participate in consultations with the
BCEAO in the reform of the legal framework applicable to microfinance in WAEMU. The
reforms consist of: tightening prudential standards with a view to consolidating the
microfinance sector; intensifying the involvement of the BCEAO in inspection of the
institutions and granting of licenses; and standardization of financial statements to reduce
reporting lags and increase transparency of accounts.
53.
The recent mission to update the FSAP confirmed the soundness of the financial
system. The policy aimed at financial sector development and supervision will be continued
in order to consolidate the gains so far. The authorities will continue to pay special attention
to the exposure of banks to large enterprises, which is the main vulnerability facing the
banking system.
54.
To combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, a law was adopted in
July 2003 to implement the rules derived from the 40 FATF recommendations. A decree
creating the National Financial Information Processing Unit (CENTIF) was also adopted in
August 2004. A standard community law against financing terrorism is being prepared within
WAMU for adoption by the community in 2005.
D. External Debt Policy
55.
The government will not contract any guarantee foreign borrowings on
nonconcessional terms (where the grant element is less than 35 percent of the actual amount
borrowed) and it will not accumulate any arrears. The instructions regarding prior

- 65 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

authorization by the Minister of Finance for any foreign borrowing by public entities, as
defined in the circular from the Prime Minister’s Office dated November 24, 2003, will be
strictly enforced. The government will also improve the management and monitoring of
external public debt by: (i) making sufficient professional staff and logistical resources
available to the Public Debt Division; and (ii) implementing an action plan of ongoing
training in modern debt management techniques. To guarantee the reliability of the database
on external public debt, cross checking data with all donors will be a priority task. The
government will put in place a monitoring mechanism to ensure that public enterprises take
due account of profitability and sustainability concerns before borrowing, within the
framework of the close surveillance modalities described below
56.
Incorporation of the debt sustainability analysis into the macroeconomic framework is
now one of the responsibilities of the National Economic Policy Committee (CNPE). The
first analysis has been available since October 2004 and will be updated every six months.
These frequent analyses will continue to help define a borrowing policy consistent with the
medium- and long-term macroeconomic framework. The preliminary results of the debt
sustainability analysis confirm that the debt profile remains sustainable. The analysis also
shows that high growth over the long term and a prudent fiscal policy will preserve
sustainability and provide impetus towards attaining the millennium development goal of
poverty reduction.
57.
Under the HIPC Initiative, the government will continue its efforts to raise the rate of
participation of its creditors in the initiative.
E. Public Enterprises
Groundnuts
58.
Government policy for the groundnut industry was defined in the Policy Letter for
Development of the Groundnut Industry (LPDFA) adopted in May 2003. Its main aim is to
revitalize and diversify production, so as to increase the revenue of small farmers and reduce
the vulnerability of growing a single crop, groundnuts. The policy deepens and consolidates
the liberalization policy adopted, in particular by privatizing SONACOS and assigning
responsibilities for production, collection, storage, distribution, transportation, and marketing
of groundnut seeds to professionals, and rationalizing the judicial and regulatory framework.
59.
The government has taken a decision to privatize SONACOS, and is taking the
following steps to transfer ownership of the company:
•

provisional sale to the buyer no later than one week after the government’s decision
on privatization of the company’s announced;

•

launch negotiations with the buyer one week after notification of the provisional sale;

•

negotiation of all transaction documents (specifications, contract transferring shares,
etc.) to clearly specify all the buyer’s obligations;

- 66 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT

•

sign the share transfer contract, which officially establishes the actual privatization of
the company;

•

call the general assembly of shareholders of the privatized company; and

•

convene the board of directors of the privatized company.

60.
The privatization of SONACOS could give rise to social costs estimated at
CFAF 3 billion. These charges will have to be charged to the budget in 2005.
61.
The government intends to finalize this process by June 30, 2005. Pending the
conclusion of the process of privatizing SONACOS, the government will grant no subsidies
to the company, will ensure that it does not accumulate any payment arrears, and will limit its
bank borrowing to the amount SONACOS needs to finance the 2004–05 harvest.
62.
To guarantee the activity of the vegetable oil factories after privatization, the
government has laid down a sectoral development strategy, which hinges on; (i) a seed policy
tailored to the newly liberalized processes of production, harvesting, and marketing; and
(ii) the replenishment of the stock of improved groundnut seeds. This policy is based on
assigning responsibility for the production of certified seeds to associations of producers and
farmers, capacity building in the planning and production of seeds by seed producers and
their organizations, and building the supervisory and certification capacity of the seed control
division of the Agriculture Department.
Electricity
63.
In 2004, the monitoring of SENELEC was reinforced by the regular production of its
financial statements. The audited accounts at December 31, 2003 and June 30 2004 were
published, and the quarterly provisional statements at end-September 2004—which are
subject to limited review by the auditors—were announced to the public in December 2004.
The government is committed to continuing to publish the half-yearly audited accounts and
to announcing the release of examined quarterly provisional statements within 60 days.
SENELEC will furnish the IMF every quarter with all the data needed to closely monitor its
financial situation.
64.
The government will not make transfers to SENELEC for its current operation. It will
ensure that the SENELEC does not accumulate payment arrears and that its indebtedness to
banks remains below the level deemed reasonable by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
An action plan has also been prepared as part of the financial rehabilitation of SENELEC.
This plan, which focuses on restoring short-term cash flow and profitability, rebuilding the
company’s image, and gradually meeting demand, will be implemented in 2005. In the
medium term, the government will take action to restructure the company by progressively
separating production activities from transportation and distribution functions. The
government also intends to divest from SENELEC gradually and invite the private sector to
manage and invest in SENELEC.

- 67 -

65.
The Electricity Regulatory Commission lowered electricity prices by 5 percent
starting in August 2004, based on a formula in effect since 1999 that expired on December
31, 2004. The process of revising the formula, which started in November 2003, has been
delayed owing to the late receipt of the necessary documents. The new formula will be
compatible with operator profitability and established in close collaboration with the World
Bank. The new formula will be effective by July 1, 2005 or (October 1, 2005, in case an
objection is raised by an interested party, as permitted under the regulations).
66.
In keeping with the objectives of the PRSP, the government will implement a rural
electrification policy to raise electricity coverage in the rural areas from 8 percent in 2003 to
15 percent in 2005. In that connection, the government will act on the guidelines listed in the
development policy letter for the rural electricity sector and a SENELEC subsidiary for rural
electrification has just been created. Most of the fixed capital expenditure of operators will be
financed by the rural electrification fund, which will be established in 2005. This fund will
receive contributions from donors and limited transfers from the government.
Other public enterprises
67.
To prevent any adverse consequences for government finances, supervision of the
financial situation of public enterprise will be tightened. The Government Portfolio
Management and Supervision Unit, has already established a quarterly trend chart of
management indicators to closely monitor the management of those enterprises and to alert
the authorities if need be. One monitoring indicator will be the total debt of public
enterprises, which will be the subject of a quarterly report available with a lag of no more
than 45 days. The unit’s resources will be increased for that purpose. These quarterly reports
will include a clear opinion on the financial health of public enterprises and any
recommended corrective measures needed, as well as a complete inventory of all financial
obligations and guarantees extended by the government to these enterprises. In the case of
public/private partnerships, a framework for assessment will be set up in 2005 to clarify the
nature of the government’s conditional obligations.
68.
The government has placed the Senegal National Lottery (LONASE) on the list of
enterprises to be privatized. The losses of the lottery have led the government to cancel the
company’s accumulated tax liabilities of CFAF 24 billion.
69.
Although the Chemical Industries of Senegal (ICS) is not a public enterprise (the state
holds 47 percent of the capital), the company will be closely monitored by the Government
Portfolio Management and Supervision Unit. The company made losses amounting to
CFAF 35 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) in 2003. The government will not to make any
budgetary transfer to the company in 2005 and will press for cost cutting, management
improvements, and other remedial measures that would entail little impact on public finances
in later years.

F. Private Sector Development and Governance
70. The projects registered under the Investment Code increased in value from
CFAF 196 billion in 2001 to CFAF 412 billion in 2002 and CFAF 579 billion in 2003. The
APIX (Agency for Investment Promotion and Major Projects) will continue to play a key role
in facilitating access by private sector operators to investment incentives, and coordinating
the related administrative processes. To shorten the response time of the public institutions
involved in applications for business licenses, a draft law on administrative procedure will be
submitted to the Parliament in the first quarter of 2005. In keeping with the objective to
improve the quality of the services offered to investors, APIX launched the procedure for
one-stop-shop certification under the ISO 2000 standard.
71.
The Presidential Investment Council has become a forum for effective dialogue and
an instrument of reform, thanks to its close follow-up of implementation of the
recommendations adopted by the government. An interministerial working group chaired by
the Secretary General of the government is in charge of weekly tracking and presentation of a
report on the measures adopted at the Council’s half-yearly sessions. In particular, its efforts
led to measures in 2003, which have relaxed the regulatory and administrative conditions that
apply to the private sector.
72.
Regarding the national program for good governance, the National Assembly passed
a law in 2003 creating the National Council against Corruption and Extortion, which has
been in place since April 2004. The Commission organized a workshop in December 2004,
to launch its activities.
G. External Competitiveness and Trade Policy
73.
Membership in the franc zone has enabled Senegal to consolidate its macroeconomic
stabilization gains, in particular moderate inflation and low public deficits. Despite the sharp
appreciation of the euro against the dollar in recent months, the competitiveness of the
Senegalese economy has been relatively unaffected. The government intends to emphasize
strengthened competitiveness, especially through structural reforms to reduce production
costs, such as utility, transportation, and communications costs.
74.
The government also plans to promote economic diversification, a determining factor
in the success of sustained growth policy in the medium term. The sectors identified as
potential engines of growth are, in particular, agriculture and agroindustry,
telecommunications, tourism, manufacturing, textiles, and fisheries. Measures will be taken
in these sectors to strengthen their competitiveness with a view to greater integration into the
world economy.
75.
Regarding trade policy, the government is committed to continuing its efforts to
harmonize its practices with WAEMU regulations. In particular, the government will limit
the number of products subject to reference values, as of July 1, 2005.

IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
76.
To ensure effective implementation of the program, the government has reached
understandings with Fund staff on the prior actions described in Table 3 of the annexed TMU
concerning program monitoring. Implementation of Senegal’s program during 2005 will be
monitored using quantitative performance criteria (end-March and end–September, 2005)
and indicators (end-June and end-December 2005), as well as structural performance criteria
and benchmarks listed in Tables 1 and 3 of the TMU. It is expected that the third and fourth
reviews, which would make available the disbursements of the fourth and fifth loans,
respectively, be completed by end-August 2005 and end-February 2006, respectively.

Performance criteria
5.
The performance criteria for the basic fiscal balance (program definition) are floors
set at CFAF 13.5.8 billion for March 31, 2005 and CFAF 44 billion for September 30, 2005.
The indicative targets for June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2005 are floors set at CFAF 32.7
and CFAF 29.2 billion, respectively.
Adjusters
6.
The floor for the basic fiscal balance (program definition) will be increased by the
amount by which the stock of net deposits in correspondent accounts of SN La Poste at the
Treasury could increase, as a consequence of its recapitalization by the government.
Reporting requirements
7.
During the program period, the authorities will report monthly to Fund staff
provisional data on the basic fiscal balance (program definition) with a lag of no more than
45 days. The data on: revenues, expenditures, special accounts and correspondent accounts

- 73 -

that are included in the calculation of the basic fiscal balance; expenditure financed with
HIPC-related resources; and costs of structural reforms incurred will be drawn from
preliminary treasury account balances. The costs of structural reforms incurred will also be
provided by the authorities in the form of a table similar to the one above with a lag of no
more than 45 days. Final data will be provided as soon as the final balances of the treasury
accounts are available, but not later than two months after the reporting of provisional data.
B. Change in Net Bank Credit to the Government
Definitions
8.
The definition of government for the purpose of calculating net bank credit to the
government is the one applied by the BCEAO. It is broader than the definition of government
in paragraph 2. Net bank credit to the government reflects the net credit position of the
government—including postal checking accounts (CCP)—vis-à-vis the central bank and
commercial banks. Net bank credit to the government is the difference between the
government’s gross indebtedness to the banking system and its claims on the banking system.
Government claims include all deposits at the central bank and commercial banks, and
secured claims (obligations cautionnées), as well as (for reporting purposes) Treasury cash
holdings. The government’s debt to the banking system includes central bank credit (mainly
statutory advances, IMF net credit, refinancing of secured liabilities, the deposit by Kuwait,
and government securities held by the central bank), commercial bank credit (including
government securities held by resident commercial banks), ex-ONCAD securities, and
private deposits at the CCP. Government securities held outside the Senegalese banking
system are not included in net bank credit to the government. The net bank credit to the
government as calculated by the BCEAO serves as the basis for program monitoring.
9.
The change in net bank credit to the government as of the date for the quantitative
performance criterion or benchmark is defined as the difference between the stock on the
date indicated and the stock on December 31 of the preceding year.

Performance criteria
10.
The amounts set in the above Table on Net Bank Credit to Government for March 31,
2005 and September 30, 2005 are ceilings and constitute performance criteria. The amounts
set in the above table for June 30 and December 31, 2005 are ceilings and constitute
indicative targets.
Adjusters
11.
The ceiling on the cumulative change in net bank credit to the government will be
lowered (raised) by the amount by which disbursements of external budgetary assistance
(defined as budgetary grants, program disbursements, and debt relief, excluding Fund
resources, and HIPC Initiative debt relief) exceed (fall short of) program projections as set
out in the Table 2. The adjustment will be for the full amount of any excess disbursement but
will be limited to CFAF 20 billion in the event of a shortfall.

The ceiling will be adjusted for the difference between programmed HIPC-related
resources and actual HIPC-related resources. HIPC-related resources consist of debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative received during the period under consideration and of the stock of
resources in the Treasury’s HIPC account at the BCEAO at the end of the preceding year.
The ceiling will be lowered (raised) for HIPC-related resources exceeding (falling short of)
programmed amounts as set out in Table 2.
13.
The ceiling will be raised (lowered) for HIPC-related spending exceeding (falling
short of) programmed amounts (as set out in Table 2). HIPC-related spending consists of
expenditures in priority sectors that have been financed with HIPC-related resources.
14.
The ceiling will be lowered (increased) for expenditures on structural reforms that fall
short of (exceed) the programmed amount (as set out in Table above). The ceiling will be

- 75 -

APPENDIX II

raised only when these additional costs are not covered by additional, unforeseen, external
budgetary assistance as defined in paragraph 12.
15.
In addition, the ceiling on net bank credit to the government will be lowered (raised)
for government paper issued in 2005 held by an entity or person outside the Senegalese
banking system that exceed (fall short of) the programmed amount.
16.
Moreover, the ceiling on net bank credit to the government will be lowered by the
amount by which the stock of net deposits in correspondent accounts of SN La Poste at the
Treasury could increase, as a consequence of its recapitalization by the government.
Reporting requirements
17.
The BCEAO will report the provisional data on the net bank credit to the government
to Fund staff on a monthly basis, with a lag of no more than one month after the end of each
observation period. Final data will be reported with a maximum lag of two months.
C. Domestic Payments Arrears
Definition
18.
Domestic payments arrears are duly certified domestic expenditure commitments
cleared for payment (dépenses ordonnancées) but not paid during a period of 90 days after
the date the payment order (ordonnancement) was cleared.

arrears as defined above as soon as incurred. The government will also report to Fund staff
on a monthly basis and with a 60 day delay all committed expenditure (dépenses engagées)
and all certified but not yet cleared for payment expenditure (dépenses liquidées non encore
ordonnancées).
D. External Payments Arrears
Definition
21.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due but unpaid on
outstanding external debt (as defined in paragraph 25) that has been contracted or guaranteed
by the government, with the exception of external payment arrears arising from government
debt being renegotiated with creditors including Paris Club creditors.

E. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of
New Non concessional External Debt by the Government
Definition
24.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85), adopted
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the government for
which value has not been received. It does not apply to government or governmentguaranteed CFAF borrowing from WAEMU residents.
25.
The definition of debt as specified in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt reads as follows: ”(a) For the purposes of this
guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, including: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to
the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a), arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual

- 77 -

APPENDIX II
ATTACHMENT
ANNEX

obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”
26.
Any external debt of which the present value, calculated with the reference interest
rates mentioned hereafter, is superior to 65 percent of the nominal value (grant element of
less than 35 percent) is considered nonconcessional, with the exception of IMF lending under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which is considered concessional even if it does
not meet the 35 percent grant element threshold. For debt with a maturity of more than
15 years, the ten-year reference market interest rate, published by the OECD, is used to
calculate the grant element. The six-month reference market rate is used for debt with shorter
maturities.
27.
For purposes of this performance criterion, government is understood to include the
government as defined in paragraph 2 above, as well as public institutions of an industrial
and commercial nature (EPIC), public administrative institutions (EPA), public institutions of
a scientific and technical nature, public institutions of a professional nature, public health
institutions, local administrations, public enterprises, and government-owned or controlled
independent companies (i.e., public enterprises with financial autonomy of which the
government holds at least 50 percent of the capital).
Performance criterion
28.
The government as defined in paragraph 27 will not contract or guarantee
nonconcessional external debt as defined in para. 26. This performance criterion is monitored
on a continuous basis. It does not apply to: debt rescheduling and restructuring operations;
import-related credit and pre-export financing secured on export contracts of less than one
year maturity; and government or government-guaranteed CFAF borrowing from WAEMU
residents.
Reporting requirements
29.
The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as
soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government.
F. Government Contracts Signed without Budgetary Appropriation
Definition
30.
Government contracts are written contracts signed by the government to buy goods
and services or to execute works.
Performance criterion
31.
The government will not sign any contracts which create a financial obligation for the
government without budgetary appropriation. This performance criterion is monitored on a
continuous basis

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of eight west
African states, which include Senegal. An on-site safeguards assessment of the BCEAO
completed on March 3, 2002, proposed specific remedies to alleviate vulnerabilities that were
identified by staff. Based on the 2002 financial statements, the staff noted that the BCEAO has
improved the explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled for
the next fiscal year, with a view towards a gradual alignment with IAS accounting to the extent
applicable to central banks by 2005. The external auditor has apprised the Board of Directors of
the BCEAO of the quality of internal controls in June 2003, and the financial statements for the
year 2002 were published on the bank’s website. The staff will continue its follow up on the

APPENDIX III

progress of the BCEAO in implementing the proposed recommendations as part of the ongoing
safeguards monitoring process.
Financial reporting framework. The Fund staff recommended that the BCEAO formally adopt
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and publish a complete set of financial statements,
including detailed explanatory notes. It was agreed by the BCEAO and Fund staff that the
BCEAO will strive to improve its financial and accounting reporting by aligning its practices
with those recommended by IAS, which have been adopted internationally by other central
banks.
Internal controls system. The staff noted that the absence of oversight of the bank’s
governance, financial reporting, and internal control practices by an entity external to the
management of the BCEAO represented a significant risk. It was agreed y the BCEAO and Fund
staff that, after seeking the opinion of the external auditor (Commissaire Contrôleur), the
BCEAO staff will propose to the BCEAO Board of Directors that it adopt a resolution whereby
the external auditor will be required to apprise the Board of Directors, during its annual review
and approval of the financial statements, of the state and quality of internal controls within the
bank.
The staff follows up regularly on the BCEAO’s progress in implementing the recommendations
in the context of the Fund's semiannual regional consultation missions.
X.

Exchange System:

Senegal is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union's common currency, the
CFA franc, had been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective
January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 = F 0.01.
Effective December 31, 1998, the parity was switched to the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = €1.
On October 31, 2004, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of the SDR was SDR 1 = CFAF 771.87.
Senegal has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

Senegal is on the 24-month Article IV consultation cycle, in accordance with the provisions of
the decision on consultation cycles. The 2002 Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on April 28, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/167, and IMF Country Report
No. 03/168). In concluding the Article IV consultation, Executive Directors urged the authorities
to continue to build on their prudent fiscal management of recent years, and to implement the
structural reform agenda with greater determination and urgency in order to stimulate broadbased economic growth, reduce poverty, and strengthen the public finances. They urged the
authorities to take further measures to boost revenue in 2003 and the medium term, while

- 92 -

APPENDIX III

pursuing the objective of creating a more efficient, transparent, and business-friendly tax system.
They agreed that an increase in civil service employment may be appropriate to alleviate
shortages of staff in social services, domestic security, and revenue administration but
underscored the need for the increased hiring to be based on a careful assessment of staffing
requirements, and to take into account the long-run impact on the public finances. Finally, they
emphasized that decisive action needs to be taken to address the financial and operational
problems facing the state-owned electricity and groundnut companies, including carefullydesigned privatization of the electricity company (SENELEC) and the groundnut company
(SONACOS).

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance

A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund conducted a mission under
the FSAP program in November 2000 and January 2001. The Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) was issued in August 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 01/189). An FSAP
update was undertaken in June 2004, focusing on development issues (in particular nationwide
supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs to credit), in line with the priorities
defined in the PRSP.
A ROSC on the data module, based on a September 2001 mission, was published on
December 2, 2002. An FAD mission will visit Senegal in January 2005 in order to conduct a
ROSC on the fiscal transparency module.

APPENDIX IV

Senegal: Relations with the World Bank
(As of December 31, 2004)
Partnership in Senegal’s development
1.
In May 2002, the Government of Senegal outlined its development strategy in a poverty
reduction strategy paper (PRSP). The PRSP was presented to the Bank and IMF Boards in
December 2002. It covers the period 2003–05. The Government provided the first annual
PRSP progress report in March 2004. The PRSP sets out the following pillars of the
government’s strategy: (i) creation of wealth within a healthy macroeconomic framework;
(ii) capacity building and promotion of basic social services; (iii) improving the living
conditions of vulnerable groups; and (iv) implementation and monitoring/evaluation.
2.
Regarding the division of responsibilities between the Bretton Woods institutions, the
IMF takes the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies and monitors
macroeconomic performance by way of quantitative performance criteria and indicators. In
addition, the IMF’s PRGF contains structural conditionality in areas such as electricity and
groundnut sector reform, which have a direct bearing on macroeconomic stability and growth
prospects.
3.
The PRSP and its comprehensive poverty analysis have provided the framework for the
Bank’s new country assistance strategy (FY03–05). The Bank is currently supporting the
implementation of the PRSP in the areas of health/nutrition, education, HIV/AIDS, rural
development, transport, water, and urban development through the implementation of a
portfolio of specific projects, as outlined more fully below.
World Bank Group strategy and portfolio
Lending
4.
IDA has provided external assistance to Senegal since 1966. The main objective of the
Bank’s assistance strategy for Senegal has been to reduce the incidence of poverty and improve
employment. In the current CAS, the Bank is working to (i) develop country ownership through
policy dialogue; (ii) use public expenditure reviews with a focus on impacts at the levels of the
consolidated central budget; (iii) monitor linkages between implementation and aggregate
results; and (iv) emphasize investment in human capital through the lending and advisory
services.
5.
As of December 31, 2004, the World Bank had approved 131 credits for Senegal with a
total amount of about US$2.6 billion. Past projects had supported agricultural diversification,
irrigation, human resources development, institutional development, and expansion of the
country’s infrastructure, particularly its transport system. In recent years, the emphasis has
shifted to better utilizing and maintaining existing facilities and to helping the government
resolve some of the key issues hampering long-term development prospects. The current active
portfolio has a commitment value of about US$706.5 million equivalent, with an undisbursed
amount of about US$504.8 million. The portfolio is composed of 17 credits in various sectors
(rural development, human resources: population/health/ nutrition/education/social

- 95 -

APPENDIX IV

development, HIV/AIDS, infrastructure/urban development, energy/water, industry, and private
sector development, budget support).
Sector issues
6.
The implementation of the Health SIP has experienced delays as a result of
(i) difficulties in making the information management system operational; and (ii) weak
financial programming and monitoring capacities at the decentralized level. The Government is
taking corrective measures to address these issues.
7.
In 1999, the Government adopted a ten-year program (PDEF) with the ultimate
objective of reaching universal primary education by the year 2008 (up from 60 percent of
gross primary enrollment in 1999). A Quality Education For All Project (QEFA—Education
SIP) covers the first three years of the ten-year program. Key issues in education include the
need to (a) consolidate gains in expanding access while addressing the needs of the under- and
un-served areas; (b) support quality improvements in education through interventions at the
school and at local education structures; (c) improve sector management (in particular,
financial and personnel management); and (d) prepare for smooth deconcentration, and
eventual decentralization, to the regional and departmental levels.
8.
Up until 1996, the urban water sector was facing two major issues: (i) a shortage of
water production and distribution capacity in the Dakar area requiring substantial immediate
investments, (ii) low managerial efficiency with no financial viability of the sector. To deal
with these issues, the government adopted two Water Sector Projects in 1996 and 2001
supported by seven donors, including the World Bank as lead agency. The Water Sector is now
closed. The Long-Term Water Sector project includes a large physical investment program and
institutional reforms (PSP), which have increased access to potable water in the Dakar area and
improved overall management of the sector.
In the transport sector, capacity constraints are being addressed with a program of new
investments, especially in rehabilitating rail links between Senegal and Mali, as well as
institutional reforms. The Transport SIP was launched in 1999 with support from several
donors, including the World Bank. Key issues in transport include the need to strengthen
institutional capacity, direct private sector involvement in investment and management of the
sector, improving the condition of the priority road network and reducing the cost of road
maintenance and rehabilitation.
9.
Due to global difficulties in the energy sector, the two “privatization” efforts conducted
over the last five years to bring private sector expertise and private financing into SENELEC
were not successful. The Bank is now assisting the Government in a third effort taking into
account the lessons learned and the overall international context where private sector interest in
investing in Africa is reduced. A Rural Electrification Services project was approved in
September 2004, and an Electricity Efficiency Enhancement project is currently under
preparation.
10.
As of, 2004, credits from the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) portfolio totaled
US$37 million and included two large investments (the GTI-Dakar power plant—the first

- 96 -

APPENDIX IV

independent power producer of the country—and Ciments du Sahel—the country’s second
cement producer). Direct SME investments were made to finance a 130-room hotel, a private
school, a microfinance institution, and expand a fishing fleet. Prior equity investments in the
financial sector in housing and leasing are mature and IFC is seeking exit. IFC has been active
in advisory work with FIAS assessments of investment red tape and the taxation system. IFC is
also an active participant in the President’s Investors’ Advisory Council, a forum for high-level
dialogue between the government and private sector (domestic and foreign).
Current and medium-term initiatives
11.
A new Country Assistance Strategy (FY03–05) was approved in April 2003. The CAS
supports the government’s PRSP, based on the pillars of wealth creation and capacity
building/development of social services. As regards infrastructure, the CAS proposes new
lending services to support electricity sector development,1 expand small-scale urban
infrastructure, and develop key infrastructure through public/private partnership. With regard to
private sector development, the CAS supports new lending for a private investment promotion
operation,2 a private sector adjustment credit,3 and possibly an operation to strengthen the rural
financial system (high lending case). New lending services for rural development would
include the preparation of the second phase of the Agricultural Services and Producers
Organizations project, a program to support appropriate rural development activities in the
Casamance region,4 and an operation on Agricultural Markets As regards social services, new
lending services include the preparation of the second phase of the Quality Education for All
project. A Coastal and Marine Biodiversity project (GEF/IDA) was approved in November
2004. A PRSC was approved in December 2004, and areas of focus include public finance
management, health (policy reforms and transversal issues such as human resource
management) and fiscal decentralization.
World Bank-IMF collaboration in specific areas
12.
The IMF and the World Bank staff maintain a close working relationship, especially
with respect to (i) the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy; (ii) reforms in public
finance management; and (iii) structural measures in specific sectors, such as electricity and
groundnuts, which have systematic impact on the public finances and on macroeconomic
stability.
13.
The conditionality for the groundnut and electricity sectors in the new PRGF-supported
program has been developed in close collaboration with World Bank staff, and the Bank takes
the lead role in working out the technical details of the envisaged reforms. The IMF and the
Bank also coordinate their activities and conditionalities in the area of public expenditure
reform, an area in which both institutions have an interest.

APPENDIX V

Senegal: Statistical Issues
(As of January 12, 2005)
1.
Overall, Senegal's economic database is comprehensive, but there are weaknesses in
the data on national accounts, production, international trade, and social indicators. The
authorities are strongly committed to improving the quality and availability of economic,
financial and social indicators, and for this partially rely on technical assistance from the
Fund and other international organizations. In order to strengthen the quality of Senegal’s
statistical database, a National Statistical Institute is being set up, as recommended by an
STA mission (April 2001).
2.
Senegal participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its
metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
since September 10, 2001. However, there is now a need to update the metadata for virtually
all sectors.
3.
A data Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission, which took
place in September 2001, carried out a review of Senegal’s data dissemination practices
against the GDDS, as well as an in-depth assessment of the quality of national accounts,
consumer price, monetary, balance of payments, government finance, and income poverty
statistics. The main findings of the mission were as follows: (i) Senegal generally follows the
recommendations of the GDDS for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of all data
categories; (ii) improvements need to be made in data coverage (especially national accounts
by institutional sectors), periodicity (especially quarterly government financial statistics), and
timeliness (especially balance of payments, monetary, and poverty); and (iii) plans for
improvement in these areas should address resource constraints, reinforce the legal
framework for data collection and coordination, and clarify the responsibilities for
dissemination of government operations, public debt, and monetary data. The mission also
found that, while statistics were generally established on the basis of acceptable sources,
those relating to government finance were weakened as a result of the absence of an
integrated accounting source and the practice of not investigating revisions.
4.
On October 17, 2002, the authorities conveyed to the Fund their observations on the
draft data ROSC and their consent to the publication of the final version on the Fund website.
The data ROSC was published on December 2, 2002.
5.
In discussions with the government in the context of the 2002 Article IV
consultations and the monitoring of the PRGF-supported program, the staff has urged the
authorities to address the lack of quarterly (or half-yearly) indicators for overall economic
activity. The national accounts and balance of payments data are prepared only on an annual
basis. The authorities publish a quarterly industrial production index and a semi-annual
services sector output index.
Specific issues in various topical areas are discussed below.

- 100 -

APPENDIX V

Real sector
6.
The national accounts compilation generally follows the System of National Accounts,
1993. While the staff demonstrates professionalism, the lack of adequate financial resources
has constrained efforts to collect and process data. Data sources are deficient in some areas,
particularly with respect to the informal sector. Owing to financial constraints, business and
households surveys are not conducted regularly, which impedes the production of national
accounts estimates (e.g., input-output tables and institutional sector accounts are not
compiled annually). However, efforts are being made to improve data collection procedures,
strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data
dissemination. A project to implement the System of National Account 1993, a shift in the
base year from 1987 to 1999, and improvement of estimates of informal activities, was
completed in early 2003 and revised data have already been published in the IFS. Other
actions, as indicated in the February 2004–April 2005 AFRITAC West Work Program, are
the redevelopment of the industrial production index, development of a statistical register,
production of a CPI with national coverage, and completion of the labor-informal sector
survey.
7.
Senegal has embarked on a process of regional harmonization of statistical
methodologies within the framework of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU). A new harmonized consumer price index was introduced in January 1998.
However, the coverage is limited to Dakar, the weights are based on a household budget
survey conducted during only three months in 1996, and the regular provision of financial
resources required for the price collection is not assured.
Public finances
8.
Government finance statistics (GFS) data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance
from the customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources. The authorities have not reported
data to STA for the 2004 GFS Yearbook, interrupting the delivery of summarized
information that resumed in 2001. They do not report subannual data for publication in IFS,
although this would be reasonably costless owing to the existence of reasonably detailed
quarterly government financial operations tables (TOFE). In part to improve its GFS, Senegal
started implementing recommendations made by a May 2000 FAD mission to correct a
reported deterioration in the treasury accounts, as well as to integrate special accounts. Such
groundwork could be instrumental for enhancing the compilation of a regional harmonized
summary table of fiscal operations (TOFE).
9.
An AFR team worked with the authorities in February 2004 on improving fiscal
reporting in the context of the PRGF-supported program. The focus was on (i) public
accounts that are outside of the direct purview of the treasury; (ii) the treatment of
correspondents’ accounts in the TOFE; and (iii) ensuring consistency between treasury and
banking system information concerning government transactions. The mission found that the
recent adoption by the authorities of the five WAEMU directives on public finances had set
off a series of reforms, which should contribute to improving the overall government
financial operations and bring the TOFE much in line with the extended WAEMU TOFE.

- 101 -

APPENDIX V

However, the full implementation of these reforms could take time because of delays in
addressing the weakness in the computerization system at the treasury. In the interim, the
mission proposed a number of specific recommendations for improvement of the fiscal
accounting practices. The authorities will review with Fund staff the modalities for
incorporating these recommendations.
Monetary data
10.
Preliminary monetary data for Senegal are compiled by the national agency of the
Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and released officially by the headquarters of
the BCEAO. There has been an improvement in the timeliness of data provided on interest
rates, monetary institutions, and deposit money banks. The authorities are now reporting
monetary data to STA on a regular basis, with a reduction in the lag from about six months to
three-four months. Most of the key monetary statistical issues have been resolved.
11.
A monetary and financial statistics mission visited the headquarters of the BCEAO in
Dakar in May 2001. The mission reviewed the procedures for collecting and compiling
monetary statistics and addressed outstanding methodological issues that concern all the
member countries of the WAEMU. The mission also briefed the BCEAO authorities on the
methodology in the new Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and discussed
the modalities for introducing an International Finance Statistics (IFS) area-wide page for
the WAEMU zone, which was subsequently introduced in the January 2003 issue of IFS.
12.
The BCEAO organized a regional seminar on monetary and financial statistics with
representatives from the BCEAO’s headquarters and the national agencies in Dakar during
April 22-25, 2003; STA staff also participated. Participants agreed to set up a working group
consisting of representatives from the national agencies and various departments of the
BCEAO’s headquarters, which will follow up on the implementation of the seminar’s
recommendations to foster implementation of the MFSM.
Balance of payments data
13.
Balance of payments data for Senegal are compiled by the national agency of the
BCEAO. A long-term adviser from STA was posted at BCEAO headquarters to provide
technical assistance to all BCEAO member countries (until July 1999). With his support,
several steps were taken to tackle balance of payments deficiencies, including:
(i) implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual 5th edition methodology; (ii) modified
and simplified related surveys for companies and banks; (iii) improvement in the
computerization of procedures and (iv) significant strengthening of staff training. Definitive
balance of payments data can now be provided with a delay of less than one year. Further
efforts are required to enhance the quality and coverage of Senegal’s balance of payments
data. In particular, their latest published data show significant inconsistencies between the
balance of payments and the international investment position.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Senegal's PRGF Arrangement and
Approves US$5.3 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Senegal’s economic performance under an SDR 24.27 million (about US$37 million)
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review
enables a further release of an amount equivalent to SDR 3.47 million (about US$5.3 million),
which will bring the total amount disbursed under the arrangement to an equivalent of SDR
10.41 million (about US$15.9 million).
The Board also granted a waiver for the nonobservance of two performance criteria and
approved the rephasing of the schedule of disbursements for the remainder period of the
arrangement. The three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on April 28, 2003 and is
scheduled to end on April 27, 2006 (see Press Release No. 03/62).
Following the Board discussion of Senegal, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Senegalese authorities managed the economy well in 2003 and 2004, achieving robust
economic growth and low inflation. The fiscal deficit and government indebtedness were
maintained at sustainable levels. Progress in structural reforms continued, although its pace
needs to be stepped up. Slippages in fiscal governance and transparency are being corrected to
ensure budgetary discipline and strengthen procurement rules and practices.
“The macroeconomic outlook for 2005 appears favorable, with continued vigorous economic
growth, low consumer price inflation, and a sustainable fiscal position. The fiscal program for
2005 allows for modest increases in current expenditure, keeps the investment outlays in line
with the absorptive capacity of the economy and foreign financing, and aims at an ambitious but
feasible revenue target.
“The prudent fiscal policy of recent years should be continued over the medium term. The
authorities should strive to maintain low budget deficits, collect revenue efficiently, and tighten
control on current expenditure to allow for measured increases in capital and pro-poor spending.
They should also monitor and control the growth of contingent liabilities, including those arising

-2-

from public enterprise borrowing and the proposed public private partnerships in the
implementation of investment projects.
“Vigorous implementation of structural reforms, especially in the electricity and groundnut
sectors, improvements in the business climate, and upgrades to the communication and transport
infrastructure will be key to lowering the cost of production, raising the efficiency of the export
sector, and preserving the external competitiveness of the economy.
“The authorities are preparing an action plan for the development and soundness of the financial
system. The plan should include measures to simplify loan recovery procedures and improve the
efficiency of the judiciary system to help reduce nonperforming loans and increase credit
availability.
“The issuance of additional government securities on the WAEMU regional market is welcome,
as it could spearhead the development of the securities market. However, the excess liquidity in
the banking system and the differentiation of reserve requirement ratios across the WAEMU
countries could hinder financial development. The authorities should work in a regional context
to address some of these issues,” Mr. Cartens said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, or PRSP. This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies,
to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, and
are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.

IMF Statement on the Conclusion of the 2004 Article IV Consultation with Senegal
On, March 7, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2004 Article IV consultation with Senegal.
Under Article IV of its Articles of Agreement, the IMF has a mandate to exercise surveillance
over the economic, financial and exchange rate policies of its members in order to ensure the
effective operation of the international monetary system. The IMF's appraisal of such policies
involves a comprehensive analysis of the general economic situation and policy strategy of each
member country aimed at helping member countries achieve orderly macroeconomic and
financial conditions and sustainable economic growth. IMF economists visit the member
country, usually once a year, to collect and analyze data and hold discussions with government
and central bank officials. Upon its return, the staff submits a report to the IMF's Executive
Board for discussion. The Board's views are subsequently summarized and transmitted to the
country's authorities.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Senegal
March 7, 2005

On behalf of the Senegalese authorities, we would like to thank staff for their fruitful
collaboration and appreciable work reflected in their well-written set of reports. We also wish
to express our appreciation to the Executive Board and the donor community for their
unfailing support that has contributed to warranting the success of the thrust of the
authorities’ vast program of macroeconomic and structural policies. The efforts of the
authorities combined with donor technical and financial assistance have contributed to the
sharp reduction in poverty over the past few years. According to the latest household survey
poverty decreased significantly in the past few years, with the percentage of poor households
dropping from 61.4 percent to 48.5 percent between 1994 and 2001.
Recent Economic and Financial Developments and Performance Under the PRGF
Against the backdrop of a locust invasion and sharp increases in oil prices, Senegal’s
macroeconomic performance was very strong in 2004. For the second time in a row, real
GDP growth rate is expected to have reached about 6 percent.1 Average annual CPI inflation
was contained below one-half of one percent. The external current account deficit (including
and excluding official transfers) is estimated to have declined as a result of strong export
performance—albeit the appreciation of real exchange rate due to the U.S. dollar
depreciation vis-à-vis the euro.
Fiscal performance was strong in 2004, with the basic fiscal balance kept to its 2003 level.
The revenue target is expected to have been achieved, with a slight increase in tax revenues
as a fraction of GDP compensating partly the reduction in the share of grants. On the
expenditure side, current expenditures as a fraction of GDP are projected to have decreased
slightly while capital expenditures are expected to have remained stable. Directors may recall
that, in 2003, additional drought- and HIPC-related spending led to the increase in the overall
fiscal deficit and the nonobservance of the performance criterion on the basic fiscal balance,
one of the two missed performance criteria for which the authorities are requesting waivers.
The conduct of prudent monetary policies at the regional level explains the low inflation rate
achieved. In particular, available estimates indicate that money supply grew less than
nominal GDP and net foreign assets increased by about 6.4 percent, thereby leading to an
improvement in the government’s net position vis-à-vis the banking system. Other
noteworthy developments on the monetary front include the reduction in banks’ net credit to
the government, and the lowering of the regional central bank’s (BCEAO) key lending rates.
Most structural reforms were implemented satisfactorily, including the introduction of a new
investment code, the digitization of the real estate registry, and the publication of the halfyearly audited accounts of the electricity company, SENELEC. In the area of budgetary and
1

In 2003, real GDP growth rate was 6.5 percent.

-2public financial management, the implementation of the ambitious reform agenda has
continued to proceed, although more slowly than initially planned in view of unanticipated
technical difficulties.
The authorities also undertook urgently needed repairs to the Port of Dakar, as the poor
conditions of the facilities were adversely affecting trade-related activities. The financing for
the repairs came from a non-concessional loan from the regional development bank (BOAD).
In view of the urgency of the situation, my authorities are requesting a waiver for the missed
performance criterion related to this non-concessional loan.
Regarding the infrastructure work undertaken last year in Thiès, and which is consistent with
the wealth creation pillar of the PRSP, the authorites agree that Thiès-related expenditures
should have followed stricter budgetary procedures. However, in view of the rush to
complete the project within a certain time framework, some deadlines were shortened, and
not all budgetary procedures were followed. With the assistance of the World Bank, a review
of the compliance of contracts with the procurement code has been made, and corrective
measures have been taken. In this regard, they undertook all compensatory measures needed
to make sure that these expenditures have no effects on the basic fiscal balance. In addition,
they took appropriate remedial actions to avoid the occurrence of similar problems in the
future, including the repeal of the provisions that permit contracting parties with the
government to receive financial compensation, even without formal approval by the
competent authorities.
Macroeconomic and Structural Policies for 2005
The outlook for the Senegalese economy is favorable, with real GDP, for 2005, projected to
grow by more than 6 percent. Inflation is expected to be kept low; with average CPI inflation
estimated to be about 1.5 percent. The current account deficit is expected to narrow further
down to 5.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal position will be sustainable, with the primary fiscal
deficit projected to amount to less than 2 percent of GDP.
Fiscal Policy and Reform
The overall fiscal deficit, including grants, is projected to be about 2.9 percent of GDP. On
the expenditure side, the authorities have already taken measures aimed at accelerating the
pace of HIPC-related social spending. The authorities are committed to strengthening fiscal
discipline and transparency, particularly in managing resources that may be received from
the Organization of Islamic Countries and within the framework of the Millennium
Challenge Account (MCA). With a view to strengthening fiscal management and
procurement procedures, they will continue the implementation of their program of
budgetary and public management reforms according to a set of policy actions and measures
adopted since mid-2003.
On the revenue side, the authorities will continue to work on expanding the tax base and
improving tax collection. To date, numerous capacity-building projects have been initiated
that aim at enhancing the capacities of the Tax Authority, including the recruitment of

-3additional tax officers and assessors and the computerization of its operations. In parallel, the
government has intensified the combat against tax fraud and evasion, most notably through
on-site audits of tax reimbursement claims and strategic investigations of tax offenses.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
Prudent monetary policy will continue to be conducted at the regional level by the BCEAO.
The authorities will continue to commit to the monetary arrangement within the West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Given the successful sale of treasury
bills in 2003, the government intends to issue further securities on the regional market to
cover its financing needs while strictly adhering to the WAEMU directives. The authorities
will pursue their ongoing consultations with all relevant parties to stimulate the contribution
of the financial sector to the development of economic activity.
The authorities welcome the conclusions of the 2004 Financial Sector Assessment ProgramUpdate (FSAP) report. While they are particularly pleased that the report acknowledges that
the stability of the financial sector has been preserved, they are aware of the need to address
financial vulnerabilities related to the excessive exposure of banks to large corporations.
As an illustration of their commitment to transparency, they have already expressed their
consent to the publication of this FSAP report on the Fund’s website. However, as Senegal
belongs to the monetary union, WAEMU, the implementation of some of the measures
recommended in the Report can only be done at the regional level, and the authorities will
work closely with the regional authorities to that effect. With regard to measures to combat
money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the authorities are also involved in the
WAEMU’s ongoing efforts to put in place a legal framework aimed at criminalizing the
financing of terrorism.
Structural Reforms
As I noted during previous Board discussions on Senegal, the authorities’ willingness to
strengthen the ownership of the privatization program has explained partly delays in its
implementation in the past. Since consensus has now been reached, the government is
determined to press ahead with the privatization agenda. In this regard, the privatization of
the groundnut processing and vegetable oil refining company, SONACOS, has been decided
upon, and, subsequently, the transfer of ownership is expected to be completed by the midst
of this year. As mentioned by staff, the authorities have taken actions to eliminate the tax on
vegetable oil protection. Concerning the electricity company, SENELEC, the authorities’
intention is to progressively increase the share of electricity produced by private investors
under Independent Power Producer (IPP) arrangements and transfer its management to
private agents. The government has made it clear that SENELEC will not benefit from any
current budgetary transfers and that the company’s indebtedness to banks will not exceed a
certain level.
On the delays in the submission of budgets to the Audit Court for verification, we would like
to reassure the Executive Board that the authorities have completed the prior action for the
second review, namely the submission of the budget and treasury accounts of fiscal years

-42002-03 to the Court. Capacity constraints continue to undermine the production of monthly
reports on tax due and collected. However, the electronic data-sharing system expected to be
operational by June 2005 will enable the preparation of such reports within a maximum lag
of one month. In the meantime, such reports will be produced with the available information
systems every month, starting with the month of January 2005.
Looking forward, the authorities intend to maintain the conduct of prudent fiscal policies,
with a renewed focus on fiscal discipline and transparency. The authorities are convinced that
higher long-run growth remains critical to sustain the remarkable progress achieved thus far
in the fight against poverty. In this respect, the authorities launched early this year the
Accelerated Growth Strategy (SCA) after consulting with representatives from the private
sector, NGOs, civil society, and the donor community. Consistent with the wealth creation
pillar of the PRSP, the SCA aims to define a road map for achieving growth rates above
7 percent and it is to be elaborated through broad-based consultations with all national
stakeholders and international partners. The rationale for the SCA relates notably to the fact
that higher-than-prevailing growth rates are critical for Senegal to achieve the MDGs by
2015. Technical committees comprising representatives from the private and public sectors
have been put in place that are in charge of defining action plans for the implementation of
the SCA. Based on these action plans, a validation workshop and a roundtable with donor
representatives are scheduled in October and December 2005 successively.
Conclusion
My Senegalese authorities would like to reiterate their strong commitment to the adjustment
process. They are appreciative of the assistance provided by donors and the multilateral
institutions. It is their intention to pursue steadfastly the reform process. In view of the
progress made in the implementation of the program, and the corrective actions taken, I
would like to request Directors’ support for the proposed decision.
Regarding the next steps in Senegal’s relations with the Fund, my Senegalese authorities are
of the view that PRGF programs have been critical in enabling Senegal to achieve
macroeconomic stability, implement critical structural reforms and achieve external debt
sustainability. My authorities’ intentions in their next stage of development endeavors is to
create an expanded and transformative private sector-led economy that would enable Senegal
to attain high growth and reduce poverty. This, in turn, requires an increased access to global
capital and money markets. In order to boost the credibility rating already achieved, my
Senegalese authorities would, in place of PRGF, like to have a relationship that would allow
them to continue to benefit from the Fund’s signaling role. Accordingly, my Senegalese
authorities intend in the near future to contact the Fund and the broader donor community
regarding the strategy that would enable them to achieve this goal.
