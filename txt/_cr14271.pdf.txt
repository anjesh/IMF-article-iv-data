STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 3, 2014

KEY ISSUES
The economy is embarking on sustainable growth, but the main challenge will be to boost
long-run growth by structural reforms and reorienting fiscal policy. Supply-side slowdowns
in the energy sector are ending, while available evidence suggests non-energy growth is robust
and economic slack is being used up. Non-energy growth should settle around a long-term
2–2½ percent per annum rate, while new energy sector investment may begin to bear significant
fruit over the medium term. Headline inflation is trending down (in part for statistical reasons),
while core inflation remains moderate. Domestic risks are to the upside. The main medium-term
external risk would be a sustained decline in energy prices.
With excess capacity in the labor market significantly diminished, the time is drawing near
for policy tightening. Although ad hoc measures will reduce the budget deficit this fiscal year,
the underlying baseline suggests a growing overall imbalance and unsustainable debt
accumulation on unchanged policies, although the authorities have announced their intention to
pursue fiscal consolidation. The CBTT will have to carefully consider how to tighten the monetary
stance given high excess bank liquidity.
Sustainable growth requires re-configuring fiscal policy, although achieving this will be
challenging for the time being in view of national elections due in 2015. Ad hoc measures
should be replaced with policies that durably improve non energy-based revenues and spending.
The proceeds from extracting non-renewable resources should be saved and invested as a
stepping stone to lasting prosperity. Fuel subsidies need to be curtailed and social programs
rationalized. Non-energy sector tax bases should be broadened and tax expenditures limited.
Greater flexibility is needed in the foreign exchange market. Despite sizable reserves, foreign
exchange shortages, which impose unnecessary economic costs, have recurred. There is no
concrete evidence of either a parallel market or arrears on foreign exchange, and the CBTT has
recently sold foreign exchange with the objective to clear the market, but a recurrence of the
situation could indicate the existence of an exchange restriction. The CBTT can address the
problem through increased flexibility in the foreign exchange system.
Structural reforms are underway, but more are needed to foster a diversified economic
base. Financial sector reform is advancing, including expanding the CBTT’s regulatory perimeter
to systemically important non-bank financial institutions. Recent streamlining of regulations that
have hampered business activity is welcomed, but needs to be further advanced. Government
operations are increasingly hamstrung by a poorly functioning civil service. Perceptions of
corruption can be reduced by adopting a transparent procurement process. Programs that mask
underemployment should be replaced with more effective training. Growing statistical
shortcomings have rendered the conduct of surveillance ever harder, and must be addressed.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Trinidad and Tobago is embarking on sustained growth after several years of weak
performance, attributable to the global crisis and energy sector supply-side slowdowns.
Growth estimated at 1.6 percent for 2013 was buoyed by 2.5 percent growth in the non-energy
sector. Although data limitations inhibit analysis, government subsidies and transfers appear to be
supporting consumption while public development spending supported construction.
2.
Inflation has fallen. Headline inflation dropped to 5.6 percent in 2013, partly due to a
change in methodology that eliminated a significant upward bias to food price inflation as of April
2013. Core inflation has remained within a narrow range of 2 to 3 percent. Recorded unemployment
dropped to a record low of 3.7 percent in QI-2013, the latest data available, although a substantial
amount of underemployment still goes unreported.
3.
The external position remains healthy given strong external buffers and a structural
current account surplus. External reserves grew from $9.2 billion at end-2012 to US$9.8 billion in
February 2014, helped by December’s $550 million external bond issue. The Heritage and
Stabilization Fund (HSF) grew to $5.1 billion (September 2013), due to contributions and earnings.
4.
The estimated current account surplus rebounded to 11.8 percent of GDP in 2013.
Conclusions must be tempered by serious data deficiencies, but there are signs that excess bank
liquidity may be leaking into imports, especially automobiles.1 There is also a widespread view that
portfolio outflows are starting to respond to interest rate differentials that have moved marginally in
favor of U.S. dollar-denominated assets.2
5.
Although the external stability assessment indicates a large degree of overvaluation
using official inflation data, there is a severe bias in measured inflation (Annex 1). Estimates
calculated using the official CPI indicate exchange rate overvaluation of 8.1 to 25.6 percent in 2013.
However, adjusting for the measurement bias in inflation reduces that to 2.6 to 8.5 percent. Other
indicators, such as the stability of Trinidad and Tobago’s global share of non-energy exports,
suggest that competitiveness may not yet be a critical problem. However, as energy resources
dwindle, the country will need to rebalance exports towards the non-energy sector.
6.
The foreign exchange market has become a focus of concern once again. The Central
Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) administratively determines both the price of U.S. dollars
(within a narrow range) and the marginal volume via its own sales (Box 1). The CBTT has historically
1

Official trade data from the Statistical Agency are available only up to February 2012. Data for the rest of 2012 and
2013 are the CBTT’s estimates using trading partner data (although the CSO has also recently provided some
unaudited trade data). In addition, the capital and financial account has incomplete coverage and lacks detail on
external assets and liabilities, resulting in a large and unexplained private capital account, equivalent to 10 percent of
GDP in 2011. The CBTT is enhancing its BOP compilation system to meet international standards. The CBTT’s plan has
been to fully transition from BPM5 to BPM6 by 2014, and subscribe to SDDS. However, progress has been very slow,
in significant part due to the challenges at the CSO, and significant delays are likely.
2

According to the CBTT, sales of new automobile increased by 16 percent in 2013, while those of motor vehicles and
parts are estimated to have grown 35 percent in 2013, Q1, yoy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

responded to excess foreign exchange demand by adjusting sales quantities in subsequent auctions
until the market clears, including a sale of $200 million into the market in late May, 2014.
7.
However, market participants have reported fairly widespread and persistent foreign
exchange shortages since the fourth quarter of 2013. The persistence of the shortages, in
contrast to previous episodes, may suggest growing balance of payments pressures stemming from
high domestic liquidity, rather than merely a temporary mis-calibration of short-term shifts in supply
and demand. Banks reportedly favor providing foreign exchange for current transactions, but there
is no data on the types of transactions for which shortages have arisen, or on the length of delays.
Several business associations have expressed concerns about foreign exchange shortages and the
impacts on their members. Some have complained that their members are unable to pay foreign
suppliers, risking adverse impact on their credit standing vis-à-vis foreign suppliers. In addition,
repeated shortages have resulted in incentives to hoard foreign exchange. The CBTT reports that its
most recent injection of $200 million was sufficient to clear unsatisfied demand queues for foreign
exchange, although it acknowledges the market could return to a position of excess demand.
8.
Fiscal policy was relatively expansionary in FY 2012/13 (October 2012–September
2013). The central government deficit was estimated at 3.5 percent of GDP. The outturn was lower
than the budget target of 4.6 percent as revenue outperformance exceeded expenditure overruns
(the latter incurred partly due to payment of previous multi-year wage settlements), but the degree
of over-performance fell compared to recent history.
9.
Subsidies and transfers grew further. Energy subsidies rose by 1.6 percentage points of
GDP, which did not, however, prevent energy arrears from growing further.3 Unlike previous years,
capital expenditures exceeded the budget, in part due to a reallocation of resources from
underperforming projects to other areas of the public sector investment program.
10.
Social programs remain overlapping and poorly coordinated. The government is moving
forward with reforms to better target vulnerable households and develop a central registry for some
programs, to provide better client-service and to monitor and detect fraud.
11.
Debt remains moderate. Gross central government and nonfinancial public sector debt
ratios declined, to 16.0 and 30.7 percent of GDP, respectively (September 2013). Central government
external debt was only 6.2 percent of GDP at end-FY 2013, while HSF assets totaled 18.5 percent of
GDP at end-September 2013.
12.
The authorities intend to significantly outperform the FY 2013/14 deficit target. This is
being accomplished by ad hoc measures, including larger than budgeted dividend from state-owned
enterprises and by reining in current expenditures, notwithstanding election pressures.4 In addition,
3

Fuel subsidy arrears to the state-owned energy company Petrotrin were estimated at 3.0 percent of GDP by the end
of FY 2012/13. Additional cash has been appropriated for petroleum subsidies in FY 2013/14 (totaling some
3¾ percent of GDP), both to finance ongoing subsidies and reducing arrears, which are expected to be eliminated by
the fiscal year’s end.
4

Dividends from nonfinancial SOEs, excluding the National Lotteries, already totaled 1¾ percent of GDP in the first
quarter of FY 2013/14, compared to 0.8 percent of GDP budgeted for the whole fiscal year. This includes a dividend
from the National Gas Company equivalent to ¾ percent of GDP.

the development budget is likely to be under-executed as in prior years. Overall, staff project the
FY 2013/14 deficit at 1½ percent of GDP. Absent these factors, the deficit would be closer to
3½ percent of GDP, suggesting the underlying structure of fiscal policies remains accommodative.
13.
The authorities are making significant efforts to reduce arrears. Energy subsidy arrears
are being eliminated by netting them off against tax arrears from the state-owned energy company
Petrotrin. Budget allocations for VAT refunds have been increased to TT$500–600 million per month
in order to reduce arrears on refunds to TT$ 1 billion by end-FY 2013/14. The intention is to clear
them in FY 2014/15 and then change the system so only net VAT proceeds are remitted in future.
14.
Fiscal revenues over-performed in FY 2012/13, and are set to do so this year too.5
Direct tax revenues are on track due to robust economic activity and improvements in tax
administration. Yields from indirect taxation were mixed as higher customs duties were more than
offset by lower net VAT yields, the latter reflecting in part the partial clearing of refund arrears. On
revenue policies, the authorities have begun the initial steps to eventually implement a property tax,
to be phased in over three years. The authorities also intend to reform the VAT, but preparatory
work has not yet significantly begun.
15.
The National Insurance System (NIS) continues to run surpluses. While benefit
expenditures exceeded contributions for the first time in FY 2012/13, earlier than projected, portfolio
returns financed a continued accumulation in reserves.6 In line with the 8th actuarial review’s
recommendations, benefits were increased in 2013–14 by some 50 percent to compensate for
inflation since the previous review, while revenues were boosted by raising the maximum level of
income subject to contributions (which also raises future benefits), and by increasing the
contribution rate. However, further actuarial reforms will

term (Box 2).7
16.
Monetary policy remains accommodative.

Revenues have over-performed in recent years, especially reflecting conservative energy price assumptions when
projecting energy-sector revenues.

The NIS’s accumulated assets totaled TT$ 24.6 billion (13¾ percent of the staff’s estimated GDP) in June 2013.

7

Although the NIS is not a part of the general government, the government has a contingent legal liability to meet
benefit obligations. The system is administered by the National Insurance Board of Trinidad and Tobago (NIBTT),
which comprises representatives of government, employers and labor.

17.
The banking system appears sound. After-tax profits have recovered from cyclical lows
while system-wide NPL ratios have fallen 1.2 percentage points and capital is one-quarter of riskweighted assets. Systemic liquidity, stemming from foreign exchange generated by the energy
sector and domestic liquidity injections from fiscal operations, remains high, rising to TT$ 7.5 billion
at end-March 2014, compared to an annual average of TT$3.6 billion in 2012.
18.
The CBTT continues to absorb excess liquidity.8 Treasury bonds totaling TT$ 1.56 billion
were issued in mid-2013 and commercial bank deposits with the CBTT were rolled over. After limits
on Treasury borrowing for liquidity sterilization were reached, they were increased in December
2013.9 Nonetheless, excess liquidity continues to challenge the abilities of the CBTT to absorb it.
19.
Financial sector reform is advancing (Box 3). Securities legislation, passed at the end of
2012, has enhanced the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the CBTT and
SEC are collaborating on developing a new regulatory model for non-bank systemically important
financial institutions. Legislation to modernize insurance regulation, including introducing risk-based
regulatory capital, is anticipated for the summer of 2014, while laws on pension reform and bringing
credit unions into the central bank’s regulatory perimeter are still in the pipeline. The authorities
have also taken steps to improve crisis prevention and planning, including at the regional level.
20.
The wind-up of CL Financial Corporation (which owned CLICO, a failed insurance
company) continues. A large majority of holders of government bonds issued after the collapse
took up the offer to exchange their bonds for shares in the CLICO Investment Fund, which had been
owned by CL Financial. Meanwhile, the government plans to recoup much of its remaining exposure
to CLICO by selling its traditional insurance operations, and has retained a consultant to value those
assets.
21.
The government has advanced on structural reforms, notably to improve rankings on
global competitiveness indices. The government has reduced the average time to start a business
from 43 days to 3 and to obtain construction permits from 42 weeks to 6. It is also reducing the time
to clear shipments through customs and intends to establish appropriate insolvency frameworks,
reform procurement legislation, expedite property registration and improve contract enforcement.
22.
Elsewhere, structural reform progress is lagging. There has been little to no progress in
improving public service efficiency (Box 4). Many officials express frustration at the slow pace of
hiring, promotions and disciplinary actions. Personnel decisions are cumbersome, requiring actions
from three public agencies, subject to excessive judicial challenges, and excessively centralized. In
addition, government bodies, including special purpose vehicles, have proliferated.
23.
Despite the low recorded unemployment rate, there is evidence of significant
underemployment. The estimated elasticity of employment to GDP is low, suggesting that official

The Central Bank’s primary tools for liquidity absorption are open market operations through the issuance of
treasury bills, notes and bonds on behalf of the government and special fixed-term deposits with commercial banks.
The proceeds of the treasury sales are kept at the CBTT rather than being made available for Government spending.

9

The limits on Treasury bills were increased from TT$ 15 billion to TT$ 30 billion, and on Treasury notes from
TT$ 5 billion to TT$ 15 billion.

data may underestimate the degree of slack in the labor market. Temporary make work programs
reduce measured unemployment, but contribute little value added.10
24.
Finally, and critically, there has been little concrete progress in improving the
statistical base. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) has yet to move into suitable quarters and
remains woefully under-staffed and under-resourced. The production of critical data (including GDP,
trade, and labor, as well as tourism statistics) continues to fall further behind, grinding to a halt in
critical areas and rendering the conduct of surveillance ever harder (Box 5).

RISKS AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
25.
Real growth is projected at near 2½ percent in 2014, as energy sector growth recovers
following the maintenance outages of recent years. Non-energy growth should remain buoyant due
to the high level of support from public expenditure.
26.
Over the medium term, reduced slack in the labor market may become a binding
constraint. Non-energy growth should settle in around long-term potential estimated at 2 to
2½ percent per annum. Absent a wide-ranging program of reforms, structural impediments will
continue to hamper non-energy investment, and hence long-run potential output in that sector.
Real medium-term energy sector growth potential is estimated around 1 percent per annum.
27.
Beyond the medium term, a recent pickup in energy sector investment may bear
significant fruit, especially if deepwater exploration proves as productive as hoped.11 Foreign
direct investment in the energy sector reached a historical high of $2.3 billion in 2012, and capital
expenditure in the sector is expected to be around $3.3 billion in 2014.12 Core inflation should
remain relatively low, although demand-side pressures will have to be monitored carefully as the
output gap closes.
28.
On unchanged policies, projected fiscal deficits would grow to 5.5 percent of GDP by
2019, given falling energy prices in the WEO baseline. This assumes no fiscal adjustment since
specific, quantified adjustment measures have not been announced. However, the authorities’ have
set a balanced budget target for 2016, and a range of measures is under discussion that could
provide considerable scope for consolidation.

10

See Box 1 on “Underemployment in Trinidad and Tobago” in Trinidad and Tobago: Staff Report for the 2013 Article
IV Consultation, IMF, October 2013.
11

The government has provided a range of fiscal incentives to the energy sector in recent years, including
accelerated capital allowances, that energy company executives credit with the recent pickup in investment in the
sector. In addition to the stimulus for new investment from such incentives, new technologies, such as Ocean Bottom
Cable (which greatly improves results from seismic surveys), also hold out hope for increased production from
previously developed provinces and improves prospects for Trinidad and Tobago’s unexplored deepwater fields.

12

The split of profits across the natural-gas value chain among upstream gas production, the National Gas Company,
which aggregates and distributes natural gas, and the downstream users of natural gas is expected to be an
important factor in determining the scale of investment in the industry. The government is currently drawing up a
Natural Gas Master Plan that will play a critical role in determining, among other things, pricing along the gas value
chain.

2/ Fiscal data is central government unless otherwise specified and refers to the fiscal year ending in September.
3/ Excluding debt issued for sterilization.
4/ Starting in 2013, assumes no additional contributions to the HSF.

29.
Even under the conservative baseline, a debt sustainability analysis indicates no major
concerns through the projection period (Annex 2). Although the central government’s debt
trajectory is of some concern, the debt ratio’s low initial level allows it to remain below 40 percent of
GDP. Moreover, external debt remains at less than 20 percent of GDP by the end of the projection
period, while the share of short-term debt is exceptionally low. Thus, rollover risks are limited and
debt metrics are relatively insensitive to changes in risk parameters.
30.
The main external risk over the medium term would be a sustained decline in energy
prices (Annex 3). Prices for Trinidad and Tobago’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports have held up
well as it shifts its exports from the United States to Asia, Europe and Latin America.13 Technological
changes along with the development of a significant LNG export capacity from the United States
could pose a long-term threat if it significantly expanded global natural gas supplies. However, local
producers are confident that demand for natural gas will continue to outstrip supply.
31.
There are significant elements of conservatism in the medium-term projections. Energy
price projections already embody market expectations about the impact of the shale revolution.
Moreover, staff projections are based on equally weighted (low) U.S. and (high) Asian gas prices,
even though Trinidadian natural gas is no longer sold to the United States. Estimated energy
reserves, based on past energy audits, appear conservative given the recent pick up in investor
interest in the sector.

13

The global energy market for natural gas remains significantly fragmented, with benchmark prices in the U.S.
averaging around $4 in 2013, while prices in Japan averaged around $17 in 2013.

The potential for spillovers from instability within the Caribbean is uncertain. Trade
links are limited, but there are significant gaps in knowledge about financial links.14 The Caribbean
Regional Financial Project will shed light on these links, with results expected in late 2014.
33.
Domestic risks are likely to the upside. The baseline, which is based on current policies,
assumes neither fiscal consolidation nor significant structural reform. While the electoral cycle
suggests prospects for either are limited in the coming year, the authorities have set broad goals to
achieve both over the medium-term, Once implemented, policy reforms could serve as near-term
headwinds, but would also put the country on a more sustainable trajectory, help restore private
sector confidence and enhance competiveness and potential growth in the non-energy sector. On
the downside, failure to address an actuarial gap in the public pension system in the long term
would pose an increasing contingent fiscal burden.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The time is drawing near for a tightening of policies as the business cycle turns.
34.
Staff noted the time may be drawing near for policy consolidation. Excess capacity in
the labor market has fallen with the unemployment rate dipping to 3.7 percent in 2013 Q1 and with
relatively solid growth since then. Although there appears to be significant underemployment
among low-skilled government workers, employers report shortages of skilled labor, which could
pressure wages higher.15 Core inflation remains low, but staff advised the authorities to remain
vigilant for incipient inflationary pressures in view of labor market developments, and the recent
pick-up in credit for consumer and real estate lending.
35.
Fiscal policy is being tightened in FY 2013/14, but staff cautioned against excess
reliance on ad hoc measures and on raising dividends from state-owned enterprises. While the
government should reap rewards from its ownership of profitable enterprises, staff cautioned that
excess reliance on such dividends could, in the long-run, undermine company finances. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ intention to maintain discipline on current spending in the run-up to 2015
elections.
36.
Staff pointed to some indicators that suggest tightening monetary policy fairly soon.
These include the fall in the unemployment rate, increases in credit to consumers and for real estate
and the shift in interest rate differentials in favor of U.S. dollar rates.

Of the eight licensed commercial banks, three are subsidiaries of large Canadian banks, which, along with the two
large indigenous banks, have extensive operations across the Caribbean region. Banks have foreign country exposure
of about 10 percent of total assets, of which about 40 percent is to Caribbean countries. The two largest domestically
owned banks (Republic Bank and First Citizens Bank) have substantial operations in the Caribbean: the former has
subsidiaries in Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Grenada, Guyana and St. Lucia, while First Citizens has operations in
Barbados, Costa Rica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

In an inaugural business conditions index, released by the CBTT in April 2014, 17 percent of respondents reported
a shortage of skilled labor as a constraint to business.

37.
The CBTT will have to consider how to tighten monetary policy. Given already high
excess liquidity, a repo rate hike would not work via dampening banks’ demand for liquidity, but it
could signal banks to raise the structure of interest rates. However, if banks do not follow suit, high
growth in consumer and real estate credit could continue. Thus, staff advised that the CBTT should
continue to closely monitor inflation and risks in the consumer and mortgage sectors and be
prepared to tighten prudential standards if necessary, along with interest rate hikes.
38.
The authorities agreed with staff’s diagnosis of the conditions under which monetary
policy should be tightened. However, they felt that prudential standards were already sufficiently
conservative, notably with respect to mortgages and that there are no signs of incipient credit
deterioration. At the same time, supervisors have been advised to remain vigilant to prevent any
relaxation of current lending standards. While they noted that a significantly faster than expected
normalization of the monetary policy stance in the United States would force an undesirable pace of
tightening of their own stance, they expressed confidence that the pace of normalization would be
gradual enough not to be disruptive.
39.
The CBTT will have to contend with a structural liquidity overhang for the foreseeable
future. For the moment, the CBTT has little choice but to continue to absorb liquidity using the
range of instruments at its disposal. However, the problem should ultimately be tackled at its source
with a move towards durable fiscal surpluses and structural reforms to encourage private
investment. The authorities agreed with the assessment, but are optimistic that business investment
will soon pick up.
40.
The reported shortages of foreign exchange raise renewed concerns. The problem is at
root that the CBTT determines both the price of foreign exchange (within a narrow margin), and the
residual supply to the market. When the CBTT is caught by unanticipated mismatches in supply and
demand, foreign exchange shortages can result. In the past, shortages have been addressed
relatively quickly through increased allocations in future central bank sales. However, shortages in
the most recent episode appeared to be more persistent, although there has been no concrete
evidence that a parallel market in foreign exchange has arisen. In late May, 2014, the CBTT
responded to the shortages with a sale of US $200 million into the market, bringing total sales for
2014 to US $610 million with the objective of meeting existing estimated demand queues. The CBTT
also agreed with the Bankers Association of Trinidad and Tobago to further improvements in the
distribution of foreign exchange. The CBTT believes that these combined actions will help to restore
normalcy to the market and eliminate accumulated, unsatisfied demand.
41.
The current system of foreign exchange allocation has imposed easily avoidable costs,
despite the high level of foreign exchange reserves. Uncertainty about foreign exchange
availability has led to an inefficient allocation of foreign exchange as it is hoarded (as evidenced in
the buildup of U.S. dollar deposits in the local banking system), further exacerbating the shortages.
If, notwithstanding the recent actions of the CBTT, shortages recur, Trinidadian businesses may
suffer damage from being unable to pay their foreign suppliers, and those parties unable to
purchase foreign exchange from authorized dealers at the official exchange rate could be
incentivized to pay a premium to purchase foreign exchange elsewhere.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

42.
A lasting solution to the shortages requires that the CBTT introduce greater flexibility
to the foreign exchange market. This could be achieved through an unconditional commitment to
meet foreign exchange demand or by allowing greater flexibility in the pricing mechanism (e.g. by
widening the limits on the exchange rate). Either way would likely restore confidence in the foreign
exchange market, eliminate shortages and hoarding, and provide authorities a rapidly responding
barometer of foreign exchange supply and demand conditions, thus providing useful signals about
macroeconomic policy. It may be that recent shortages are masking budding balance of payments
pressures, stemming from high government subsidies and transfers and bank credit for imported
goods (notably automobiles). Should there be continued pressures for foreign exchange,
notwithstanding the changes introduced by the CBTT in late May, a failure to introduce greater
flexibility into the foreign exchange market could lead to renewed shortages, indicating the
existence of an exchange restriction.
43.
The authorities disagreed that foreign exchange shortages were a serious problem.
They believed that shortages were temporary and that concerns have been overblown. They also
believed changes to the system introduced on April 1 should be given more time to work, and that
there was sufficient flexibility in the current system, since the amounts to be auctioned off can be
changed over time. They oppose an unconditional commitment to meet all foreign exchange
demand, given their goal to continue to build foreign exchange reserves for the foreseeable future.
However, they have recently acknowledged that the changes on April 1 had not eliminated
shortages, and hence they took the further actions noted above.
Over the medium term, the fiscal position should move back into surplus.
44.
Although growth is reviving, achieving a sustained pick up will require more balanced
growth. First, the country has achieved only limited success in diversifying its economy outside the
energy sector. Second, while data limitations do not allow for definitive conclusions, non-energy
growth appears to be concentrated in government and private consumption, rather than in the
investment required to enhance potential growth.
45.
Staff affirmed its view that the fiscal
position should move towards surpluses
over the medium term. Saving and investing
the substantial resources extracted from the
energy sector would spread that resource
wealth over future generations. Within those
structural surpluses, spending should shift
from public consumption towards investment,
and fiscal consolidation should be based on
policy changes that durably improve the
structure of non energy-based revenues and
spending, rather than ad hoc measures.

Staff recommended quickly moving to start ending fuel subsidies. Cheap fuels induce
excessive reliance on automobiles, leading to efficiency-killing traffic jams and environmental costs,
and disproportionately benefit the well-off. The government prefers to first make compressed
natural gas (CNG) widely available as a substitute for gasoline and diesel, while encouraging
conversion of vehicles to CNG use, before removing fuel subsidies. Staff noted, however, that
concurrent reduction of fuel subsidies would boost incentives to switch to CNG.
47.
Staff welcomed the intention to rationalize social programs, notably through the
creation of a central benefits registry. This would help detect fraud and ensure that benefits are
provided as efficiently as possible. Staff also advocated more ex-post monitoring of program
effectiveness, given that many programs are not currently evaluated.
48.
Staff encouraged making revenue generation more buoyant, efficient and equitable,
notably by broadening the non-energy tax base. The government has already started to adopt
some measures including property taxation and reforming transfer pricing. Reform of the VAT to
minimize exemptions and zero-ratings is critical to improve its efficiency and equity, and to ensure a
level playing field across economic activities. Other reforms such as redressing the erosion of excise
tax bases and enhancing personal and corporate income tax revenues could also be considered, if
needed. Finally, staff cautioned that tax incentives should be granted sparingly, with full
accountability and periodic reviews of such “tax-expenditures”.
49.
As in previous discussions, the staff has developed a long-term fiscal path (active
scenario) that illustrates the impact of this set of policies through 2019. This includes (i) tax
measures that yield 3½ percent of GDP (more than compensating for the gradual decline in energy
revenues); (ii) current expenditure reductions of 4 percentage points of GDP, mainly through
reducing fuel subsidies and better targeting social programs and other transfers, and (iii) increasing
capital expenditures by 1¼ percent of GDP.
50.
Staff continued to advocate setting fiscal policy in a long-term context, managed as
part of a national balance sheet. Thus, sustained transfers into the HSF should be conditioned on a
return to fiscal surpluses. Staff inquired whether HSF resources might be drawn down in the event of
an adverse shock to energy prices, but the authorities maintained that it was the intent to continue
building the HSF, emphasizing the saving aspect of the fund more than the stabilization aspect.
Actuarial reports suggest that the national insurance system is not yet on a sound long-term
footing, posing a sizable contingent fiscal liability. While welcoming the proposed expansion of the
system to include the self employed, further parametric reforms of the employee scheme will be
needed, whether on contributions or benefits, including possibly phasing in later retirement times as
people continue to live longer.

51.
The authorities agreed with the need to continue medium-term fiscal consolidation
and to reallocate spending. They pointed to the revenue measures already in train and noted
preparatory work will be done to reverse erosion in the VAT base caused by extensive zero-ratings
and exemptions, though actual VAT reform is unlikely to take place in the next year or two. A
number of other measures will also be considered in time, including, on the expenditure side, to rein
in transfers and subsidies. The authorities maintained their position that while it is desirable to run
fiscal surpluses, they would continue making transfers to the HSF solely by considering excess
budgetary revenues from the energy sector. On pensions the authorities noted that, in addition to
extending the system to include the self employed, the National Insurance Board of Trinidad and
Tobago had adopted many corrective measures proposed under the latest actuarial review, and was
reducing the interval between reviews from 5 to 3 years to increase the scope for more frequent
parametric reforms.
Structural measures will be critical to achieve more balanced growth
52.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue to pursue an aggressive program of
structural reforms. These will be necessary to encourage growth in the non-energy sector. At
present, the business community reports that there are a number of critical impediments to
investment in that sector. These include an inefficient public service that slows government decisionmaking, excessive regulations that inhibit business formation, governance concerns that lead to
perceptions of a non-level playing field, labor market distortions that inhibit human capital
formation and flexibility, and serious data shortcomings that subject business planning to great
uncertainties.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

53.
Staff welcomed progress in financial sector reforms and removing the impediments to
doing business, but the public service remains beset with a range of serious problems. Staffing
in the public service is administratively cumbersome, subject to excessive judicial challenges and too
centralized. Staff urged the government to revisit legislative changes that had amplified the
litigiousness of personnel decisions and to explore ways to give greater autonomy in such decisions
to government agencies.
54.
In addition, government bodies continue to proliferate. While often well-intended, such
proliferation leads to overlapping mandates, severe coordination challenges, and quite likely, overstaffing. Staff noted that a serious effort to streamline the overall structure of government and
publically-owned bodies could yield substantial gains in efficiency.
55.
Other important legislative reforms should be fast-tracked. Trinidad and Tobago
continues to fall short on governance indicators and perceptions of corruption and staff supported
calls from the business community for rapid progress on procurement reform. The government
should also move to establish appropriate insolvency frameworks, including corporate bankruptcy
and bank resolution legislation.
56.
Staff expressed concerns that government temporary employment programs distort
the labor market. While data are insufficient to establish a strong causal link, there is a prima facie
case that employment in these programs is competitive with private sector jobs since they require
participants to work much less than the officially required hours.
57.
Staff echoed widely-held views that social transfers and make-work programs may be
inculcating a sense of dependency on the part of the beneficiaries of those programs. While
social safety nets are critical to protecting the most vulnerable segments of society, inclusive growth
should be promoted through the provision of skills demanded by the economy and improved job
matching. Some combination of carrots and sticks may be needed to help move participants into
productive private sector employment, including via a greater role for training.
58.
In the absence of concrete progress in lasting reforms to remedy data shortcomings,
data lags are growing, rendering surveillance ever harder. Staff urged the authorities to take
quick action to provide the CSO with the resources needed to begin to rebuild its capacity.
59.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s views on the need for wide-ranging
reforms. However, they cautioned that some problems had proved resistant to past attempts at
reform, and that meeting reform challenges will take time. For now, they pointed to a specific
emphasis on easing impediments to doing business. They did not see the temporary employment
programs as particularly distortionary to the labor market, pointing out that participants in those
programs do not have the skills to work in the private sector, and noting that these programs were
increasingly oriented towards providing skills-training, which would improve prospects for more
inclusive growth. They continue to acknowledge the problems with statistics and agreed that
strengthening the national statistical infrastructure was critical, although they believe the plan to
alleviate resource shortages on a temporary basis via a loan of staff from the CBTT will make some
difference.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

60.
Staff welcomed multi-agency efforts under way to prepare for the upcoming FATF
assessment of AML/CFT in early 2015. Continued focus and allocation of resources will be needed
in the coming months to ensure that the country meets the 2012 FATF standards.

STAFF APPRAISAL
61.
In the near term, and recognizing that severe data limitations make any assessments
challenging, numerous signs point to a need to soon tighten the macroeconomic policy
stance. Fiscal policy is already being tightened this fiscal year, but in significant part through ad hoc
measures. Thus, there is a need to design and implement fiscal policies that durably improve the
structure of non-energy based revenues and spending, although some measures are in train.
Consideration will also have to be given to starting to tighten monetary policy, especially as the
normalization of the monetary policy stance in the United States draws nearer. In view of already
existing excess liquidity and a weak transmission mechanism, consideration should be given to
tightening already conservative prudential standards should signs of froth emerge in specific asset
markets.
62.
Trinidad and Tobago is finally embarking on sustained growth, but diversifying the
economic base remains the most critical medium-term challenge. The recent strong renewal of
interest in exploration and development in the energy sector along with new technologies and the
opening up of potentially “game-changing” deepwater acreage holds out the promise of significant
increases in non-renewable resources. Nonetheless, sea-changes are continuing in the global energy
industry, and prudence suggests the government should be conservative in its long-term
assumptions about the sector’s potential.
63.
Diversification will require reorienting government expenditure towards supporting
investment in the non-energy sector. To date, government spending has been concentrated on
supporting current consumption through an excessively generous and poorly targeted set of
subsidies and transfers, notably, regressive and expensive fuel subsidies. There is ample scope for
revenue and expenditure reforms to move to structural fiscal surpluses and create the fiscal space
for increasing public investment, while protecting the most vulnerable members of society. Further
parametric reforms will be needed to put the National Insurance System onto a sustainable longterm footing, although there are no solvency concerns over the medium term.
64.
Trinidad and Tobago’s external position remains healthy, with a large current account
surplus and a high level of external buffers. Although standard methodologies indicate a large
degree of overvaluation using official inflation data, it is difficult to conclude that there is a
significant exchange rate misalignment given the severe historical bias in measured inflation.
65.
The government will need to build on recent successes in implementing structural
reforms to unlock the country’s full growth potential. There has been significant progress in
easing the impediments to doing business, although more remains to be done. However, there are
still critical needs to improve the efficiency of the public service and the functioning of labor
markets.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

66.
There has been much progress in financial reform, but there may still be a need to
introduce greater flexibility into the foreign exchange market. Important measures have been
made to modernize financial regulation and bring systemically important non-bank financial
institutions into the regulatory perimeter. However, the foreign exchange allocation system has led
to an apparently widespread and persistent recurrence of foreign exchange shortages that, while
recently eliminated according to the authorities, could indicate the existence of an exchange
restriction if they recur. It is hoped that the recent changes introduced by the CBTT will introduce
the required degree of flexibility into the foreign exchange allocation system to durably eliminate
these shortages. Staff will continue to monitor developments closely and follow up with the
authorities as needed to determine if an exchange restriction has arisen.
67.
Critically, the lack of reliable and timely data is an overarching problem that hampers
public and private decision-making. Since the last Article IV discussions, there has been little
concrete progress in implementing lasting reforms to remedy data shortcomings. The CSO still has
no permanent quarters after its building was condemned last year and it remains starved of
resources, leading statistics production to seriously lag in critical areas. Data shortcomings now
severely constrain staff’s ability to conduct economic surveillance. Moreover, aside from the plan to
help alleviate resource shortages on a temporary basis, there are no concrete signs of implementing
an action plan to resolve the problems at the statistical agency, and there is therefore a critical and
urgent need to provide the CSO the resources needed to fulfill its mission.
68.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. The Foreign Exchange Market
Most foreign exchange is provided directly to the market by private companies that earn
foreign exchange, primarily in the energy sector. The central bank also auctions off dollars,
obtained from the government, which receives tax payments in foreign exchange and converts the
proceeds with the central bank. The central bank, which accounts for about 20 to 25 percent of the
market, conducts both non-competitive sales and a competitive auction. However, the price of foreign
exchange is set in the non-competitive sale, and authorized foreign exchange dealers have not been
allowed to sell foreign exchange at a spread greater than 1 percent over the non-competitive rate in
the week after the last non-competitive sale. New limits are determined every time there is a new
central bank non-competitive sale. The CBTT also sets, at its discretion, (but based on an analysis of
market data to determine supply and demand conditions) the amounts it sells at each non-competitive
and competitive sale.
The CBTT made some changes to its foreign exchange allocation system on April 1, 2014, but
the changes did not fundamentally alter the basic allocation system, which entails administrative
determination of both the price and the marginal quantity sold into the market.1 Some foreign
exchange dealers have reportedly been disadvantaged by the new system since, given excess foreign
exchange demand, dealers bid away the small margin between their buying and selling rates. But
importantly, the new system does not entail any changes to the mechanism for pricing U.S. dollars to
the ultimate customer, which is still constrained by narrow CBTT limits. On May 23, 2014, the CBTT
announced it had agreed with the Bankers Association of Trinidad and Tobago on further
improvements in the distribution of foreign exchange.
_________________

The changes involved a shift in the CBTT’s sales from the non-competitive auction towards the competitive
auction, as well as changes in the rules governing inter-dealer allocations, which have been determined according
to central bank guidelines.

recent reforms, would have totaled 3½ percent of GDP annually by 2060, with a negative net asset
position equivalent to 87 percent of 2060 GDP. A 2010 actuarial review foresaw the system’s
expenditures exceeding contributions from 2017/18, while the system’s financial assets would continue
growing through 2026/27 but, absent reforms, be depleted by 2039/40.2
The actuarial review proposed reforms (some since partly adopted) to reduce the estimated shortfall,
but additional measures remain necessary. These included:



Increasing the general average premium to 17.6 percent over the projection period (from
11.4 percent in 2012 to 25 percent in 2041–60);



Increasing maximum insurable earnings, which would benefit the system now through higher
contributions (albeit with higher earned pension rights in the future); and



Increasing the retirement age.

Contribution rates were increased to 11.7 percent in 2013 and to 12.0 percent in 2014, along with increases
in maximum insurable earnings, consistent with actuarial recommendations. Auditors subsequently
estimated that these reforms reduced the required increase in the general average premium from
17.6 percent to 17.1 percent (still, however, well above the current 12 percent contribution rate). The new
measures postpone exhausting the scheme’s accumulated assets only from 2039–40 to 2044–45. Thus,
further reforms (including a possible increase in pension ages) are still required.
Also, the government announced it would table legislation in 2014 to include the self employed in
the pension system. While these contributions and benefits would be managed by the National Insurance
Board, they will remain segregated in an independent fund.

two-thirds payable by employers and one-third by employees, and capped at TT$12,000 (US$1,890) per month. The

Box 3. Financial Sector Reform Agenda
The authorities are in the midst of wide-ranging financial reforms, including improving
regulation of non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs). Five SIFIs have been
identified, each of which is regulated by its own Act. The long-term objective is to bring these
institutions under the regulatory and supervisory perimeter of the CBTT.
Joint work has begun among the CBTT and the Ministries of Finance and Planning on a National
Financial Crisis Contingency Plan. A recent IMF technical assistance mission recommended that the
Plan include a policy and operational framework that is based on the current legal framework, together
with structures and procedures adaptable to changing policy preferences, financial market
developments, and legislative changes. Trinidad and Tobago is also spearheading work on a Regional
Crisis Management Plan and is taking a leading role in the Caribbean Regional Financial Project, in
conjunction with Fund staff.
Multi-agency efforts are under way to prepare for the upcoming assessment of AML/CFT in
early 2015 under strengthened CFATF standards.
There is also financial sector legislation in the pipeline:



Insurance Act (revision). There are 30 active life and general insurance companies in Trinidad and
Tobago. The current legislation is outmoded. Revised legislation has been in the works since 2008,
but has run into roadblocks, including the collapse of CLICO. The draft legislation is modeled
primarily on Canadian law and includes a major strengthening of regulatory (risk-based) capital.
The pending legislation reportedly has broad industry support and the authorities are hoping for
passage by the summer of 2014.



Credit Union Act. The Act would transfer supervision from the Commissioner for Co-operative
Development to the CBTT. It takes account of international standards and best practices of other
jurisdictions. A law has been drafted but will be revised based on the findings (expected mid-2014)
of a Commission of Enquiry into the collapse of CL Financial group and the Hindu Credit Union.



Occupational Pensions Plan Act. An Act is being developed to update current provisions,
harmonize pension rules for the private and public sectors, and ensure that pension plans are
governed and regulated in accordance with international best practices.



Unit Trust Corporation (UTC) Act. UTC is working with the CBTT to revise its Act, which has been
unchanged since the UTC’s 1982 creation. The law will need to cover a number of instruments and
practices developed since then and clarify UTC’s ownership structure and governance. Passage is
expected by 2015.



Real Estate Legislation. A new act would require that all agents be licensed. At present, only
about one-third of the 1500 practitioners are licensed.

Box 4. Structural Reform Challenges––The Public Service
Trinidad and Tobago’s public service employees represent one quarter of total
employment. These include permanent, contract, and daily-paid workers in 48 ministries,
agencies, and departments.
Human resource management in the public service is highly concentrated in a cluster of
centralized government agencies. Line ministries and departments have little autonomy with
their authority generally confined to providing performance reports and making
recommendations for filling vacancies. They do not have powers to make their own hiring and
promotions decisions, nor can they generally discipline their own staff.
At the same time, decision-making is highly fragmented among those centralized agencies.1
The Chief Personnel Officer sets the terms and conditions of employment, conducts wage
negotiations for public service positions, and advises the government on human resources
management policies. The Service Commissions Department (SCD) appoints, promotes and
disciplines staff.2 Finally, the Ministry of Public Administration is responsible for restructuring of
ministries and departments, training and development. Coordination is poor among the agencies,
including due to limited information sharing. The fragmented nature of administration also makes
accountability very low, so it is extremely difficult for line ministries and agencies to identify where
bureaucratic bottlenecks reside.
As a result, recruitment and promotions are protracted. The centralized agencies are
overburdened with long work backlogs, compounded by largely manual operational procedures,
particularly for recruitment. For example, negotiations for the 2008–2010 wage round were only
concluded in 2012. Moreover, personnel decisions are subject to excessive judicial challenge. The
Judicial Review Act of 2000 granted public service staff very broad rights to challenge decisions
made by the Service Commissions in the high court. Accordingly, to reduce the risk of lawsuits,
the Service Commissions have become extremely deliberate in documenting and taking decisions.
Given long delays in personnel
decisions, agencies find ways to bypass
normal procedures. Recognizing the slow
pace of decision-making, in 2006 the
Public Service Commission allowed
ministries to promote and hire on a
temporary basis, leading to significant
increases in the numbers of acting and
temporary appointments. Temporary staff
increased from 1,920 in 2005 to 12,636 in
2011, while new permanent appointments
declined from 916 to 628.

Box 4. Structural Reform Challenges––The Public Service (concluded)
Over the same period, the number of personnel in an acting capacity (i.e. given higher
responsibilities without a formal promotion) increased from 7,881 to 18,012. These patchwork
solutions have worsened staff morale and retention of qualified professional staff. Consequently,
the public service is unable to carry out many critical functions accurately and expeditiously.
The Public Service regulatory framework is extremely outdated. For example, governing
legislation for the civil service, fire service, prison service, and public service commission date to
1965. Thus, many positions, as well as terms and conditions of service, are outdated and have not
been reviewed for decades.
An ongoing “Gold-to-Diamond” reform aims to transform the public service in the next
decade. Under this reform, a new public service structure will increase middle management
positions to accommodate the majority of qualified employees who are currently working in lower
level positions. The reform will modernize job descriptions, emphasize merit and performance,
and aim to inculcate a culture of excellence. In addition, there are efforts to rationalize social
services and enhance hiring, staffing and promotion practices in the public service. However,
given resistance to past reforms, it is too early to judge whether the current reform will be
successful.

Box 5. Data Issues
Data shortcomings have reached critical mass and now severely constrain staff’s ability to
conduct economic surveillance. The government data collection agency, the Central Statistical
Office (CSO), temporarily ceased operations in mid-2013 and now operates under extreme
resource constraints, leading to very long lags for GDP, trade and labor data.1 Official trade data
are available up to February 2012, labor market data up to March 2013, while the GDP data for
2012 is still only provisional.2 There are also significant gaps in tourism statistics, while
expenditure-side and quarterly GDP estimates are not compiled. The central bank’s efforts to fill
data gaps, although laudable, have resulted in estimates that are flawed due to methodological
weaknesses.
The government is aware of these long-standing problems and has received an aggressive
plan from Statistics Sweden to modernize the CSO. The report prioritizes: (i) connecting the
agency better with data suppliers and users; (ii) improving IT systems; and (iii) enhancing human
resources. The ultimate aim would be legislation to place the CSO on an independent footing by
the end of 2014.
However, there has been little concrete progress implementing reforms. CSO staff are still in
temporary locations and permanent quarters are unlikely in the next 12-18 months. The CSO’s
self-proclaimed goal to bring a wide range of statistics rapidly up-to-date once they move into
new quarters is laudable, but severe resource shortcomings cast serious doubt on its achievability.
A plan to temporarily alleviate resource shortages entails the CBTT recruiting 15 staff and
assigning them to the CSO for one year. The aim is to clear backlogs of trade and labor market
data. Meanwhile, the CSO has committed additional resources (TT$2 million) for the same
purpose, and is collaborating with the Customs Department to resolve trade data issues.
___________________________
1

The CSO currently has 350 staff, and due to inadequate office accommodation, some staff work from home,
rotate office spaces, or do not work at all.

2

Additional trade data recently became available from March 2012 to October 2013. However, the CSO, which is in
the process of validating the data, has cautioned that they are not yet reliable.
3

For example, the CSO intends to finalize new current and constant price GDP for 2010-2014 by end-July 2014.

1/ Includes VAT and Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM).
2/ 2013 reflects the first quarter unemployment rate.
3/ The data refer to fiscal year October-September.
4/ Defined as non-energy revenue minus expenditure of the central government.
5/ Excluding debt issued for sterilization. Does not include arrears on the fuel subsidy.
6/ The current account balance for 2011 and thereafter have been revised to re-classify dividend payments from the "other private
sector capital" account to the "factor income" account. A recent sharp downward revision in the 2012 current account surplus was
based on “mirror data” from trading partners, in the absence of official trade data, which has not been produced since February
2012. The authorities have provided no official explanation of the revision, but their anecdotal explanations appear inconsistent with
other data sources.
7/ Before 2009, Henry Hub price in Louisiana. From 2009, the average of Henry Hub and Asian LNG prices.

Annex I. Trinidad and Tobago: External Stability Assessment
Trinidad and Tobago’s external position remains healthy, with a large current account surplus and a
high level of external buffers. Although modified CGER methodologies indicate a large degree of
overvaluation using official inflation data, it is difficult to conclude that there is a significant exchange
rate misalignment given a severe bias in measured inflation that distorts the real effective exchange
rate. While the energy sector’s substantial current account surplus easily outweighs the non-energy
current account deficit, in the longer term, results suggest there will need to be a rebalancing towards
the non-energy sector as energy resources dwindle.
The current account and external position remain healthy. The current account (CA) surplus in
2013 is estimated to have rebounded to 11.8 percent of GDP, after a temporary dip to 4.9 percent of
GDP in 2012. Gross official reserves were US$9.8 billion at end-February 2014, equivalent to
11.7 months of imports of goods and non-factor services. In addition, the net asset value of the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund was US$5.1 billion at end-September 2013 (18.5 percent of GDP).
The real exchange rate remains within the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated
equilibrium level in 2013. With moderation in inflation in 2013, there was only a modest
appreciation in the REER. However, reflecting continual appreciation from 2009, mostly because of
overstated and high inflation, the REER calculated using the official CPI has increasingly diverged
from the equilibrium level, with overvaluation estimated at 25.6 percent in 2013. Adjusting for the
estimated inflation bias however suggests the overvaluation of the REER falls to 8.5 percent, broadly
consistent with fundamentals. The equilibrium real exchange rate is calculated using estimates from
an augmented CGER methodology for oil exporters.1 Among the set of explanatory variables,
commodity terms of trade contribute the most in the determination the equilibrium rate.

The macroeconomic balance approach also suggests that the underlying current account (CA)
would also lie within the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated CA norm over the
medium term. The analysis applied estimates from a model tailored to oil exporters,2 used 2018 as
the reference year, and obtained a current account norm of a surplus of around 12 percent of GDP.
Estimates suggest an overvaluation of 8.1 percent, but again, adjusting for measurement bias in
inflation, overvaluation is estimated at 2.6 percent. The fiscal balance and oil trade balance are the
main determinants of the estimated current account norms.
Results from the external sustainability approach suggests the need to rebalance the
economy towards the non-energy sector as energy resources dwindle. Following the external
sustainability approach (see Bems and de Carvalho Filho, 2009), the future paths of the current
account and NFA are derived based on rules for inter-temporal allocation of temporary energy
income. Under the three considered rules, Trinidad and Tobago would need to maintain a CA
surplus of around 18 percent of GDP

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of May 2014)
Since graduation in 2003, Trinidad and Tobago has had no lending program with the World Bank
Group. However, technical and advisory services have been provided since then focusing on
promoting a better investment climate in order to stimulate inclusive growth, economic
diversification and increased competitiveness; strengthening institutional capacity; and, building a
modern and efficient public sector, with a view to promote the achievement of the country’s longterm development objectives.
Since the fall of 2013, the Government has been more proactively reaching out to the Bank and
new technical assistance activities are now being developed in a number of areas, including
financial sector development, anti-money laundering and the fight against terrorism financing.
Trinidad and Tobago also receives grants in the Accounting and Extractive Sectors (Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative - EITI).

Reimbursable Advisory Services
Reimbursable Advisory Services Program: The RAS program with the Government of Trinidad
and Tobago currently covers: (i) Pension Systems Harmonization; (ii) Public Debt and Cash
Management; (iii) Doing Business Reform; (iv) Investment Promotion Special Economic Zones; and
(v) Broadband Strategy.

Technical Assistance
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes - Accounting and Auditing (ROSC): In
September 2010, Trinidad and Tobago asked the World Bank to carry out a A&A ROSC, to facilitate
the development of strong accounting and auditing standards in the private sector, State-Owned
Enterprises, and the financial sector. The ROSC was completed in April 2013. Under the
coordination of the Ministry of Finance and in consultation with key stakeholders at the Ministry of
Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, Central Bank and Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Trinidad and Tobago (ICATT), it is expected that the World Bank will continue to provide support
for implementing the recommendations of the ROSC, especially with regards to improving the
financial reporting and auditing standards and to build sustainable capacity in key institutions in
Trinidad and Tobago.
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI): At the International EITI conference in Paris in
March 2011, Trinidad and Tobago was officially granted candidate status for EITI. The Ministry of
Energy & Energy Affairs (MEEA) publicly confirmed the Government's commitment to EITI and
committed to making Trinidad and Tobago's energy sector one of the most transparent in the
world, as well as to work closely with civil society. Trinidad and Tobago is expected to be soon
declared a compliant EITI country, the third country in the region (after Peru and Guatemala). With

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

support from a MDTF EITI grant, one of the successes in Trinidad was raising awareness with youth,
civil society, communities, and parliamentarians. The MDTF EITI grant was extended up to
September 2014, and Trinidad and Tobago is expected to ask for a second grant, which would focus
on building a Caribbean knowledge hub for extractive industries with UWI, developing an
environmental indicator to include in the EITI, and finally automating the information on EI
revenues.
National Risk Assessment (NRA): The World Bank is supporting Trinidad and Tobago's National
Risk Assessment (NRA) on Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorism Financing (TF). This project
targets to assist them in their self-assessment of ML/TF risks with broad participation from various
stakeholders. In addition to better understanding of the ML/TF threats and vulnerabilities in the
country, the project aims to improve the skills and knowledge of the government agencies in
assessing ML/TF risks and applying a risk based approach in this area. A workshop to begin the
NRA was held on March 17-19, 2014 in Port of Spain, organized through the AML/CFT Compliance
Unit of the Ministry of National Security and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Over the next six
months, the World Bank team will continue to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of
National Security and the FIU with a view to complete the NRA by October 2014, ahead of the
Mutual Evaluation of Trinidad and Tobago's AML/CFT effectiveness under the FATF standards
expected to be conducted in January 2015.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK (IDB)
(As of April 15, 2014)
Financing
The IDB approved the new Country Strategy with Trinidad and Tobago in November 2011. This
strategy is the reflection of the enhanced relationship with the county and envisages a financial
envelope for 2011–2015 for around US$1.6 billion.1 The 2010 and 2011 approvals represented a
substantial increase from the previous years: disbursements consisted of a few budget-support
loans, implying significant positive cash flow. In contrast, in 2012 and 2013 approvals were
investment loans concentrated in the water and sewage and urban development sectors, thus
resulting in a negative net cash flow with the IDB in those years.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Trinidad and Tobago—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

As of June 2014
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The most affected
areas are: national accounts, prices, and external sector statistics. Data shortcomings, especially in national

accounts and balance of payments data, severely constrain staff’s ability to conduct economic
surveillance. Since the last Article IV discussions, there has been little concrete progress in implementing
lasting reforms and TA recommendations back to the 1990s to remedy data shortcomings. The statistical
agency (CSO) still has no permanent quarters after its building was condemned last year and it remains
starved of resources, leading statistics production to seriously lag in critical areas, including national
accounts, trade, and the labor market. The government is aware of these long-standing problems.
However, aside from the plan to help alleviate resource shortages on a temporary basis by the Central
Bank (CBTT), there are no concrete signs of implementing an action plan to resolve the problems at the
CSO, and there is therefore a critical and urgent need to provide the CSO the resources needed to fulfill
its mission.
Real Sector Statistics: The extreme resource constraints under which the CSO now operates have led to

severe lags for GDP, trade, and labor data. GDP data at constant prices for 2012 is still only provisionally
projected and without detailed sector breakdowns. The last expenditure-side GDP data is from 2008.
Quarterly national accounts are not compiled. Labor market data are available only up to the first quarter
of 2013, and significant gaps remain in tourism statistics.
Price Statistics: Recently, the methodology to estimate the Retail Price Index (RPI) was revised with

technical assistance from CARTAC. The new method corrects flaws that created a significant upward bias,
primarily in the food component. Implementation of the improved methodology commenced in mid2012. However, the RPI basket (presently compiled with January 2003 = 100) needs to be updated to
reflect the results of the latest household survey done in 2008. The producer price index needs to be
revised to meet international standards and its weights (from 1978) should be updated.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) compiles fiscal data using a national
classification system for government transactions and debt of the central government. The compilation
follows the GFSM 1986 methodology. Data on public enterprises and statutory bodies are compiled and
published once a year. These data are compiled by three different divisions of the MoF and are subject to
differences among them, particularly with respect to transfers.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The monthly monetary accounts currently cover the CBTT and other

depository corporations (ODCs), that is, commercial banks and nonbank financial institutions (finance
houses, merchant banks, trusts, and mortgage companies), which report to the CBTT on a monthly basis.
No data are reported by income funds, which act like money market funds and should be included as
part of the ODCs sector. Since mutual funds are not regulated by the CBTT, an agreement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission of Trinidad and Tobago is needed to obtain their data on a regular
basis. Following two monetary and financial statistics (MFS) missions that visited the country in 2012,
Trinidad and Tobago migrated to the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the submission of CBTT and
ODCs data to STA.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

In May 2014, an MFS mission supported the CBTT in developing SRFs for the other financial corporations
(OFCs) sector, covering insurance corporations, pension funds, the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF),
the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), and the Mortgage Finance Company (TTMF). The CBTT needs
to expand the coverage to, at least, the National Insurance Board (NIB), the Unit Trust Corporation (UTC),
the Home Mortgage Bank (HMB), and the credit unions.
External sector statistics: Official trade data from the CSO are only available up to February 2012, while

data for the rest of 2012 and up to September 2013 are CBTT estimates, using trade partner data. The
CSO recently provided some unaudited trade data but warned that these are not yet reliable. The CBTT’s
estimates for trade data are flawed due to methodological weaknesses. Quarterly aggregate balance of
payments estimates and annual balance of payments data are disseminated by the CBTT in its national
publications although with some lag. Generally, compilation of balance of payments statistics is heavily
based on administrative records and survey data. Recent TA missions assisted the authorities in
identifying a number of significant shortcomings, such as under-coverage and misclassifications in the
goods and services account, particularly in the valuation of imports at c.i.f., missing insurance services
provided to nonresidents, and in services provided by nonresident companies to local oil and gas
corporations. Data on external assets and liabilities of mutual funds are not yet available. Incomplete
coverage and lack of detail on external assets and liabilities is reflected in a large and unexplained private
capital outflow, equivalent to 11 percent of GDP in 2013. TA missions provided assistance on the
compilation of the International Investment Position (IIP), the proper classification of dividend flows by
energy sector companies, other required improvements for subscription to the SDDS, and
implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual sixth edition. The CBTT is enhancing its BOP
compilation system following the recommendations of the TA missions. In collaboration with the Ministry
of Finance, the CBTT plans to expand its current debt reporting system to include comprehensive
coverage of external loans and domestic debt of the entire public sector, as well as publicly guaranteed
debt, through the migration to the CS-DRMS system.
II. Data Standards and Quality

No data ROSC is available.

(GDDS) since 2004
III. Reporting to STA

Only partial fiscal data are reported to STA, covering above and below the line transactions with a
significant time lag, for inclusion in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics database. Since mid-2013,
the CBTT reports monetary data to STA using the SRFs. Annual balance of payments data are also sent to
STA, although with considerable delay. IIP data for the International Financial Statistics have been
provided for 2011 and earlier years.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On June 16, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with Trinidad and Tobago.
Trinidad and Tobago’s economy is embarking on a sustainable growth path. Maintenance-related
slowdowns in the energy sector are ending, while non-energy growth is robust, with economic
slack being used up. Headline inflation is trending down (in part for statistical reasons), while
core inflation remains contained at about 2–3 percent. The unemployment rate has fallen to only
3¾ percent, although this masks sizable underemployment in government “make-work”
programs. The fiscal balance is likely to improve in fiscal year 2013/14, with the deficit falling to
only 1½ percent of GDP, but largely for ad hoc reasons rather than durable improvements in
revenues or expenditures. The external current account surplus has rebounded to over 10 percent
of GDP and reserves are at 12 months of imports. However, the foreign exchange allocation
system, although it had generally worked well for several years, led to fairly widespread and
persistent foreign exchange shortages, as supply and demand imbalances grew from late 2013. A
recent series of actions by the central bank has improved the supply of foreign exchange to the
market.
The time is drawing near for policy tightening. The main external risk is from a sustained decline
in energy prices. The domestic medium-term challenges are to boost long-run growth through
structural reforms and reorienting fiscal policy, with measures to save more of the nation’s
nonrenewable energy wealth, and limiting current expenditures while increasing growthenhancing capital spending. Such policies would likely pose near-term headwinds, but enhance
competitiveness and boost potential growth in the non-energy sector. However, significant
reforms are likely to be delayed by the electoral calendar. A greater degree of flexibility is
needed in the foreign exchange system to avoid further shortages.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the improved growth outlook, and noted the strong external
position and limited fiscal vulnerabilities. They agreed, however, that the reduction in economic
slack and the need for a durable consolidation of the fiscal position suggest that a tightening of
macroeconomic policies may be necessary in the near future. Over the medium term, Trinidad
and Tobago remains vulnerable to a decline in energy prices, which calls for structural reforms to
diversify the economy and improve its growth potential.
Directors concurred that the authorities should stand ready to start tightening monetary policy in
view of the reduced labor market slack and high consumer credit growth, and to prepare for the
spillovers from the normalization of monetary policy in the United States. Implementing this
tightening, however, could be complicated by banks’ excess liquidity and the weak monetary
transmission mechanism. Against this background, Directors concurred that tighter prudential
regulations could be considered.
Directors welcomed recent measures to improve the budget outturn for the current fiscal year.
They underscored the importance of moving toward fiscal surpluses as soon as feasible, using
more durable improvements in revenues and expenditures, in order to make better use of the
country’s nonrenewable energy endowment. Spending should be reoriented away from current
expenditure toward growth-enhancing capital projects, including by better targeting social
benefits and reducing energy subsidies. Broadening the non-energy tax base remains key to
strengthening revenues.
Executive Directors welcomed continued progress in financial sector reform, including
improvements to the legislative framework for financial regulation. They also supported the
actions taken to bring systemically important non-bank financial institutions into the regulatory
perimeter and looked forward to a comprehensive assessment of Trinidad and Tobago’s regime
against money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors took note of recurring shortages in the foreign exchange market. They encouraged the
authorities to allow for sufficient flexibility in the operation of the market to ensure that it clears,
especially given the ample foreign reserve position.
Directors expressed concerns about the lack of reliable and timely economic statistics, which
severely limits the ability to conduct surveillance. They recommended prompt action to provide
adequate resources to the statistical office.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors emphasized the benefits of further structural reforms to boost competitiveness and lay
the foundation for sustainable and diversified growth. They welcomed recent measures taken to
reduce business impediments, but noted that action remains necessary in several areas. In
particular, inefficiencies in the public sector and distortions in the functioning of labor markets
hinder private investment and should be addressed decisively.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director
and Kevin Finch, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 16, 2014
1.
The authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff mission for the fruitful
dialogue on the economy of Trinidad and Tobago. Framing discussions in a medium-long run
context – a shift which occurred in the 2013 consultations – continues to be viewed by the
authorities as a more productive approach.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
Real GDP growth is showing signs of enhanced durability. In 2013, economic growth
was estimated at 1.6 percent, driven by a revival of energy production during the fourth
quarter of 2013. Much of the drag on growth imposed by the prolonged period of
maintenance in the energy sector has dissipated. The non-energy sector continued to perform
creditably. Economic activity was driven by execution of the government’s public sector
investment program, the financial services sector, wholesale and retail and resurgent
construction activity. The authorities note staff’s concern about the increase in private
consumption and are of the view that more resources, particularly from the private sector,
should be directed towards investment.
3.
Inflationary pressures have subsided tremendously. On a year-on-year basis, headline
inflation rose by 3.3 percent in April 2014 compared with double-digit levels almost two
years ago. The containment of food prices, the main driver of inflation, was supported by the
expansion of agricultural output. Core inflation has also been well contained at below 3
percent. Pursuant to Fund technical assistance (TA), the Central Statistical Office (CSO) is
planning to issue the new Index of Retail Prices (RPI) around mid-2014. The RPI was
rebased to September 2012 from January 2003 and utilizes a new basket of consumer items
derived from the 2008 Household Budgetary Survey.
4.
Thus far, tightening labor market conditions have not had an inflationary impact. The
rate of unemployment reached a historic low of 3.7 percent during the first quarter of 2013.
While the authorities acknowledge that the low rate may mask underemployment due to the
inclusion of workers engaged in government employment programs, the authorities are
taking steps to improve the training element of some of these programs in order to augment
the labor supply to the private sector. The authorities have also expressed interest in
receiving TA to conduct a comprehensive diagnostic of the labor market.
5.
Improved management of state-owned enterprises and favorable dividend returns may
contribute to a fiscal outturn near balance for the central government for FY2014 compared
with a budgeted deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP. The authorities continue to target overall
fiscal balance by FY2016 and plan to gradually normalize the fiscal stance towards the
generation of primary surpluses over the medium-term. While a comprehensive package of
measures has not yet been fully articulated, the authorities assure that reliance on what staff
characterizes as “ad-hoc” measures is not the intention. The strategy to contain sizeable
transfers and subsidies, especially fuel subsidies, remains broadly unchanged from the 2013

2
discussions. However, progress is being made with rationalizing and improving the
governance and transparency of social programs. With general elections scheduled for 2015,
the authorities also expressed a firm intention to exercise fiscal prudence.
6.
Monetary policy remained broadly accommodative, but the Central Bank of Trinidad
and Tobago (CBTT) is cognizant of emergent domestic and external factors which signal that
discussions surrounding unwinding the accommodative stance may have to commence in the
short-run. Private sector credit expanded by 5.8 percent in March 2014 (year-on-year), up
from 3.4 percent in December 2013. Credit growth was heavily influenced by higher demand
for consumer and real estate mortgage lending. Meanwhile, business credit is beginning to
show some signs of revival. After declining for fourteenth consecutive months, business
credit expanded by approximately 2 percent in February 2014 and further increased by
almost 3.5 percent in March.
7.
The repo rate, the main policy rate, has remained unchanged at 2.75 percent since
September 2012. However, monetary transmission is being adversely affected by a build-up
of excess liquidity in the banking system. Excess reserves at CBTT averaged TT$8.4 billion
per day in May 2014 compared with just over TT$6 billion in April. In December 2013,
Parliament approved an increase in borrowing limits under the Treasury Bills and Treasury
Notes Acts. As a result, CBTT is now in a better position to expand open market operations
to bring down excess liquidity to more manageable levels.
Short-term Outlook
8.
Heightened exploration activity in the energy sector concomitant with the use of
technological advancements has generated optimism among the international energy
companies operating domestically. Production from a 1 trillion cubic foot natural gas field is
projected to commence in June 2014 and gas output is estimated to increase further towards
the end of 2014 as new supplies are brought online by two key operators. The decline in oil
output appears to have bottomed-out, while prospects for increased oil production have
improved with the imminent signing of new licenses for land acreage with three small to
medium-sized companies. In this regard, energy GDP is projected to increase in 2014/15. In
the non-energy sector, growth is likely to average around 3 percent per annum.
The Foreign Exchange Market
9.
The foreign exchange market has been relatively tight since the beginning of 2014,
prompting CBTT to make significant adjustments to its foreign exchange management policy
– a policy which has remained broadly unchanged for more than two decades. Effective April
1, the new market-oriented measures are as follows: (i) Ninety percent of CBTT foreign
currency sales to the market will be channeled through the competitive auction system, with
10 percent being allocated on a non-competitive basis; (ii) The market share-based formula
used to allocate foreign currency inflows from three energy companies to the commercial
banks (the sharing arrangement) will be adjusted such that the originating bank will retain 25
percent of the inflows and the remainder will be shared equally among authorized dealers
(which now include an additional four entities) and; (iii)The second-tier arrangement, an

3
informal sharing agreement among the commercial banks, will be discontinued. These
changes were undertaken beneath an umbrella of strengthened governance practices which
seek to ensure that authorized dealers better understand underlying market demand, enabling
them to prioritize accordingly. CBTT expects these changes to improve the distribution of
foreign exchange in the market and foster the development of an interbank foreign currency
market.
10.
CBTT intended to review the new system in 6-9 months, at which time adjustments to
the pricing mechanism would have been considered, if necessary. However, persistent reports
in the press of tight foreign exchange availability caused an earlier than anticipated review. It
should be stated that there were no shortages to satisfy legitimate demands for foreign
exchange to make payments or transfers for current international transactions. Adjusting to
the new system posed a challenge for the market. At the same time, rumors of shortages
exacerbated excess demand conditions as economic agents sought to intensify their holdings
of precautionary balances. CBTT intervened in the market on May 27, selling US$200
million to clear the excess demand and the periodicity of interventions is expected to increase
going forward. In fact, CBTT sold an additional US$50 million in early June to alleviate any
potential pressures until significant conversions by the energy sector take place at end-June.
11.
Discussions with the authorized dealers resulted in a few modifications to the new
system surrounding the share of foreign exchange that would be auctioned competitively
versus on a non-competitive basis. In practice, the mix is now 50/50. With these
developments, reports of tightness in the market have dissipated and the authorities do not
anticipate any severe disruptions that could possibly give rise to exchange restrictions.
12.
The authorities do not share staff’s view that CBTT should provide an unconditional
commitment to supply foreign exchange. CBTT prefers to retain the current supply
mechanism where they set an intervention budget after consultations with market
participants. The consensus among market participants that a parallel market for foreign
currency does not exist allays concerns that recent supply issues are intractable. More
broadly, staff’s recommendation seems inconsistent with other policy advice. Staff
encourages the authorities to save and invest the proceeds from extracting the country’s nonrenewable resources. Given high excess liquidity, the attractiveness of financial investments
abroad and structural rigidities, manifested by a non-energy sector which is a net user of
foreign exchange, it would be imprudent to provide such a blanket commitment. An
unconditional commitment to meet all foreign exchange requirements risks eroding an
important buffer, leaving the country vulnerable to exogenous shocks. It can also fuel private
consumption and increase imports, eroding the healthy current account surplus – a surplus
which, according to the external stability assessment, needs to increase even further in order
to maintain a stable level of domestic absorption. The authorities see merit in giving serious
consideration to introducing more flexibility in the exchange rate, but acknowledge that a
national dialogue on foreign exchange policy, within a broader setting of structural
transformation, is necessary – given that conditions have changed significantly since the
market was liberalized in April 1993.

4
Financial Sector Developments
13.
The Insurance Bill is before a Joint Select Committee of Parliament for review. Upon
completion in June, the bill would be tabled for debate in Parliament in July 2014.
Legislation to bring credit unions under the regulatory ambit of the CBTT is under
consideration by the Legislative Review Committee (LRC), but progress has slowed because
the LRC is awaiting the findings of a commission of inquiry into the operations of CLICO
and the Hindu Credit Union in order to determine if there may be any legislative implications
for the credit union sector. A policy for private occupational pension was developed, but the
authorities are in the process of reforming the public pension plan and prefer both policy
documents be dovetailed before taking them to cabinet for approval.
14.
Five entities were designated systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).
These include; the Unit Trust Corporation, the Home Mortgage Bank (HMB), the Trinidad
and Tobago Mortgage Finance Company(TTMF), the National Insurance Board and the
Agriculture Development Bank. Appropriate steps to place these institutions under the
regulatory and supervisory control of CBTT are in progress. In the interim, CBTT is utilizing
moral suasion to discuss governance and risk management issues with the five SIFIs. There
are also plans to merge the HMB and the TTMF and list the new entity on the local stock
exchange. In March 2014, a TA mission on financial crisis preparedness examined the SIFI
framework and presented their findings to the authorities.
15.
The authorities are preparing for a comprehensive AML/CFT assessment by FATF in
January 2015. The majority of legislative amendments to secure full technical compliance
were completed by end-May 2014, while institutional capacity is being bolstered in order to
improve effectiveness. With the assistance of the World Bank, a National Risk Assessment
commenced in March 2014 in order to comply with Recommendation 1 of FATF’s revised
standards. While the timeline is challenging, the authorities are deeply committed to meeting
the new assessment standards. An inter-ministerial cabinet committee chaired by the
Attorney General was established to oversee the process. The committee is supported by a
12-member, multi-stakeholder National Anti-Money Laundering Committee.
Structural Reforms
Structural reforms would help lift private investment which is important to achieve potential
growth, estimated by the authorities at 3-5 percent. The authorities have undertaken the
following actions in this regard:
16.
Ease of Doing Business: The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Investment has made
significant strides towards addressing some of the shortcomings identified in the World Bank
Doing Business Reports. The time taken to start a business and to obtain a construction
permit has been significantly compressed.
17.
Public Sector Reform: The inefficiencies in the public service are well-known and
there are several initiatives underway to improve the functioning of the public service. The
Ministry of Public Administration is undertaking a public service transformation plan

5
entitled, “A Journey from Gold to Diamond”. The program revolves around a citizen-centric
design where citizens could access bundled government services in a “one-stop shop”
arrangement. There is also focus on rationalization of social services to eliminate duplication,
establishment of more cross-ministerial teams in order to devolve decision-making and to
improve hiring, staffing and promotion practices in the public service. The IDB is assisting
with some of these initiatives.
18.
Government Social Programs: The authorities agreed that there is need to rationalize
social programs both within the Ministry of the People and Social Development and across
ministries. A Central Beneficiary Registry using social enterprise management software was
launched in April 2014 in order to streamline the social safety net programs. The rollout of
biometric cards, which will contain comprehensive information on all the benefits applicable
to an individual, will track usage, aid fraud detection and prevent abuse.
Statistical Issues
19.
CBTT has intervened to assist the CSO to improve the availability of macro-critical
data. A Memorandum of Understanding will be signed between CBTT and the Ministry of
Planning and Sustainable Development – the line ministry with responsibility for the CSO.
The plan involves the provision of equipment and the employment of 15 persons
(professional and technical) by CBTT on contract for one-year and their subsequent
secondment to the CSO to work specifically on the trade statistics and the labor force
surveys. This short-term solution should assist with improving data availability until more
concrete measures can be implemented.
