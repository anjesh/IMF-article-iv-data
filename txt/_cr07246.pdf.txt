Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the
Policy Support Instrument
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with the Finance, Fiscal Affairs, Legal, Monetary and Capital Markets,
Policy Development and Review, and Statistics Departments)
Approved by David Nellor and Michael T. Hadjimichael
June 12, 2007
Main topics
• Article IV consultation. The report focuses on sustaining Tanzania’s recent strong economic
performance, broad-based growth and more rapid poverty reduction. This would require
maintaining the structural reforms momentum—through measures that (i) enhance public
resource mobilization and efficiency of spending; (ii) increase the financial sector’s
contribution to growth; and (iii) improve the business environment—while preserving
macroeconomic stability.
• Program review. Economic growth, inflation, and the external position are in line with
program objectives, and the program has remained broadly on track. All but one of the
quantitative assessment criteria for end-December 2006 and all indicative targets for endMarch 2007 were met, and structural policies are generally proceeding as envisaged. The
staff recommends completion of the first review under the Policy Support Instrument. The
government’s letter of intent relating to the PSI is presented in Appendix I.
Mission discussions
• Discussions were held in Dar es Salaam April 25–May 10, 2007. The staff team comprised
Messrs. Sharer (head), Abbas, Dunn, Sobolev (all AFR), Hobdari (PDR), Hajdenberg
(FAD), and Ms. Radzewicz-Bak (MCM). The mission met with the Minister of Finance,
Mrs. Meghji; the Permanent Secretary of Finance, Mr. Mgonja; the Governor of the Bank of
Tanzania (BoT), Mr. Ballali; and other official and private sector representatives.
Mr. Masawe (Executive Director’s Office) participated in the discussions. The mission was
assisted by Mr. Robinson, senior resident representative.

Executive Summary
Tanzania has sustained strong economic performance for several years, solidifying its
position as a mature stabilizer. With sound macroeconomic and market-oriented structural
policies backed by substantial donor assistance, Tanzania has realized high growth, low
inflation, a comfortable level of international reserves, and sustainable external debt.
Nevertheless, Tanzania remains very poor. It will need to sustain strong economic
performance for many years to come and will have to rely heavily on donor assistance,
particularly if a stepped-up effort is made to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).
Tanzania has begun a new phase in its relationship with the Fund. The three-year
program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) provides a streamlined framework for
core macroeconomic and structural policies, guided by Tanzania’s second-generation poverty
reduction strategy (MKUKUTA). The PSI also signals to donors that government policies
are sound.
The medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Real GDP growth is projected to pick
up further, while inflation would remain subdued. Rising government revenues, together with
substantial donor assistance, would allow for more government spending, particularly on
MKUKUTA priorities, with minimal need for domestic financing. Financial sector
deepening is expected to continue at a strong pace to support private sector growth.
Ongoing reforms aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector in
the areas of tax policy and administration, public financial management, and civil service
capacity building. Progress in these areas would also help to garner greater donor support.
The authorities are taking actions to address high and volatile T-bill yields, which are
costly to the government and reduce the financial sector’s incentive to extend credit to the
private sector. Greater reliance on foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes could
further ease pressure on T-bill yields.
The authorities are taking steps to alleviate key bottlenecks constraining economic
activity, notably by improving infrastructure and enhancing the business environment.
The report notes that Tanzania would seem to be a good case for possible scaling up of
donor assistance.
The staff recommends the completion of the first review under the PSI. Staff also
recommends that Executive Directors grant a waiver for the missed ceiling on reserve money
for end-December 2006, based on the relatively small excess and corrective actions taken.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Tanzania’s economic performance has been strong over the past decade,
supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and far-reaching structural reforms. In
particular, sound financing of government operations—including substantial assistance from
international donors—limited the government’s recourse to domestic borrowing, which
facilitated a monetary policy stance that reduced inflation while allowing for a rapid
expansion of credit to the private sector for productive purposes. The structural reform
agenda has focused on economic liberalization, improved public financial management and
revenue administration, and financial sector development. Together with infrastructure
investment and structural policies to enhance the business environment, this has contributed
to solid productivity growth.1 Moreover, thanks to the growing economy, increased
government revenues, and donor assistance, government spending expanded at a swift pace,
most notably on pro-poor initiatives outlined in MKUKUTA, which sets forth Tanzania’s
second-generation growth and poverty reduction strategies. Tanzania’s strong performance
has been characterized by
•

Strong growth and low inflation. Since 2000, real GDP has grown by 6.3 percent a
year on average. Growth has been broad based, and driven largely by productivity
gains; a sharp contrast from the long period of economic stagnation experienced
previously. Annual inflation, which had averaged some 30 percent in the past two
decades, fell to single digits in 1998 and has generally been around the 5 percent
mark since (Figure 1).

•

Increased government spending with only limited recourse to domestic borrowing.
Since 1999/2000, government revenues and donor support have risen by
4½ percentage points and 6½ percentage points of GDP, respectively, allowing
government spending to grow by some 10 percentage points of GDP, to slightly over
28 percent of GDP in 2006/07. Aside from sizable borrowing in 2005/06, government

definitions of priority spending.

Nevertheless, the banking system serves a narrow segment of the Tanzanian population. According to a recent
survey, only 11 percent of adults have bank accounts.

(to a projected 11.2 percent of GDP in 2006/07). Foreign direct investment and donor
project grants and concessional loans exceeded the current account deficit, which
allowed for a strong buildup of international reserves (Figure 4). Gross reserves were
then maintained at a comfortable level, as the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has increased
foreign exchange sales.
•

Low level of public debt. Extensive debt relief under the HIPC and Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiatives, as well as additional bilateral relief, have greatly reduced
Tanzania’s public debt burden (external and domestic), which was about 30 percent
of GDP in net present value (NPV) terms at the end of June 2006.

•

Tanzania remains very poor. Notwithstanding the progress of recent years, GDP per
capita is well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa and poverty is widespread.
Tanzania’s human development index also ranks below the average for sub-Saharan
Africa.4 In support of Tanzania’s strong efforts, donor grants and concessional loans
have risen to an expected 11.3 percent of GDP in this fiscal year (2006/07),
equivalent to about 40 percent of total government spending. However, Tanzania will
have very large needs for years to come, particularly in the areas of education, health,
and infrastructure, and will continue to depend on donor support.

2.
In light of its status as a mature stabilizer with comfortable international
reserves, Tanzania has entered a new phase in its long-term relationship with the Fund.
On February 16, 2007, the Executive Directors approved a three-year program under the
Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The government views the PSI as essential to reinforce
appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies, and signal the strength of government
policies to development partners.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PSI
3.
Overcoming the aftermath of drought in early 2006, the economy continued to
perform well in 2006/07. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by a robust 6.2 percent in
2006, slightly above the envisaged 5.9 percent, and inflation picked up only moderately,
peaking at 7.3 percent in February 2007. Notably, the recent return of good rainfalls has led
to an ongoing bumper harvest; also positively, hydro power supplies have been fully
restored, thus ending the power blackouts that threatened to undermine economic
performance. Pressure on food prices is easing, and inflation is on course to end the year
close to the 5 percent target.
4.
The authorities’ demand-management policies have been effectively
implemented; NDF is expected to be near zero in 2006/07, mainly because strong
revenues—which are expected to reach 15.7 percent of GDP, (1 percentage point above the
program target), driven largely by tax administration reforms and the strong economy—more
than offset delays in disbursement of donor support. On the spending side, higher than
budgeted domestic interest costs, arising mainly from increases in T-bill yields, were largely
offset by low primary expenditures.
5.
The trend toward greater financial sector deepening continued, though broad
money growth slowed markedly, as low NDF once again facilitated a rapid expansion of
bank credit to the nongovernment sector. Financial indicators show that banks’ balance
sheets have stayed sound during the credit expansion, notwithstanding a modest increase in
nonperforming loans. Gross official international reserves stood at nearly US$2.2 billion at
end-March 2007—the equivalent of 4.2 months of projected imports of goods and services
for the following year.
6.
Regarding performance under the PSI, all but one of the quantitative assessment
criteria for end-December 2006 and all indicative targets for end-March 2007 were met,
and most structural policies are proceeding as envisaged. The targets for NDF and NIR
were met by wide margins; the latter partly reflects delays in MDRI-financed expenditures.
Average reserve money slightly exceeded the ceiling for the end-December 2006 test date,
but was soon brought back on track. With regard to structural policies, a Cash Management
Unit was established and the joint Ministry of Finance-BoT Cash Management Committee is
expected to formulate its first three-month cash flow forecast by end-June 2007. However,
the integration of ASYCUDA and TISCAN systems at customs has been delayed by
technical factors. The Financial Recovery Plan for TANESCO was approved as envisaged.
The Anti-Corruption Bill was submitted to parliament in February and subsequently passed

12
in April.5 The government has continued to publish the list of recipients of tax exemptions.
The Cabinet’s approval of the second-generation Financial Sector Reform Action Plan in
April will facilitate creation of a unified legal and regulatory framework for pension funds.
However, the submission to government of the proposal has been delayed (until September
2007) for reasons outside the government’s control.
III. KEY CHALLENGES: STEPPING UP SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
7.
The discussions focused on policies aimed at achieving and sustaining a higher
rate of economic growth and poverty reduction. There was broad agreement that the
MKUKUTA provides an appropriate framework for macroeconomic and structural policies,
and that enhanced implementation and increased resources are key to achieving higher
growth and more poverty reduction. The discussions covered the following issues:
•

Macroeconomic stability and growth. The authorities continue to view maintaining
macroeconomic stability, anchored by sound financing of governmental operations,
as a key to sustainable growth. They are firmly committed to maintaining low
inflation, which they view as a key achievement of their reform efforts. Effective
implementation of the structural reform agenda is also viewed as essential to further
increase both public and private sector productivity, as is investment in infrastructure,
particularly in the energy and transportation sectors.

•

Public sector efficiency and effectiveness. Ongoing reforms in tax policy and
administration, public financial management, and the civil service will continue to
aim at increasing public resources and allocating them more efficiently. To achieve
higher quality spending and build donor support, better monitoring and reporting of
spending on MKUKUTA priorities should be a priority.

•

Financial intermediation. Continued sound expansion of financial sector
intermediation is central to strong and sustained private sector growth. Currently, the
highly volatile yields on government securities reduce the financial sector’s incentive
to broaden the provision of credit to the private sector. To ease pressure on yields and
enhance stability, the authorities are taking steps to improve monetary policy
operations and the functioning of the money market.

•

Exchange rate policy. The authorities recognize that the large donor inflows have led
to liquidity management issues and put upward pressure on the exchange rate, raising

inter alia, expanding the definition of corruption.

13
concerns about competitiveness. In this context, the BoT will continue to maintain a
flexible exchange rate policy while smoothing its implementation of monetary policy.
•

Debt management. The authorities reiterated their commitment to preserve recent
gains in debt sustainability. Accordingly, they intend to avoid any future government
contracts for or guarantees of nonconcessional debt and envisage strict curtailment of
domestic borrowing.

•

Governance. The authorities recognize the importance of efforts to fight corruption
and institute good governance practices, including through greater transparency.

•

Regional integration. The authorities view regional integration as an important
supplement to their efforts to sustain sound economic policies and boost growth. As
noted in Box 1, they view the East African Community (EAC) as the primary vehicle
to strengthen their regional integration efforts.

•

Poverty reduction. Sustaining high rates of broad-based growth that encompasses
agricultural and rural development would have the greatest impact on reducing
poverty, which is indeed the focus of the MKUKUTA. Rapid expansion in the
coverage and quality of education and health services is similarly essential. Efforts to
strengthen information and control systems to link MKUKUTA goals to the annual
budget and medium-term expenditure framework are intended to strengthen poverty
reduction.

14
Box 1: Moving Toward Greater Regional Integration Within the East African Community
The authorities view Tanzania’s economic future as being closely tied to the EAC. Efforts under way
within the EAC to achieve greater regional economic and political integration include establishing a single
market, harmonizing policies to promote cross-border trade and investment, developing regional
infrastructure, and enhancing technological and human resource development. A key achievement, since the
creation of the EAC in 2000, has been the establishment of the Customs Union (effective 2005) with a
Common External Tariff (CET), which is expected to enhance intraregional trade (Table 1).

Policy discussions on deepening regional integration focused on harmonizing investment incentives
and further trade liberalization. Discussions drew on the joint Selected Issues Paper prepared for Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda.
•

Investment incentives. The authorities recognized the potential benefits of a coordinated approach
to providing investment incentives in the EAC, possibly through a code of conduct that would set
out rules for managing investment incentives and help avoid a mutually damaging “race to the
bottom.”

•

Trade liberalization. The authorities agreed that Tanzania could benefit from lowering the CET top
band and bringing “sensitive” products into the CET; they are committed to working with the
Partner States to fully implement the EAC Customs Union Protocol, including the review of the
CET by 2010.

The authorities are working with EAC Partner States to address the issue of overlapping
memberships in regional trade arrangements. Tanzania is also a member of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) (Kenya and Uganda are members of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA)). Through the EAC Secretariat, consultations with COMESA and SADC are
underway on how the three regional integration blocks can work together to avoid potentially conflicting
obligations.

15

IV. THE PSI PROGRAM: POLICIES FOR THE MEDIUM TERM
A. Medium-Term Economic Outlook
8.
The authorities’ demand-management policies will be geared to maintaining
macroeconomic stability. Productivity trends are projected to drive high real GDP growth
over the medium term. Real GDP is projected to grow by 7–8 percent a year, with
particularly strong growth in the construction, manufacturing, mining, and tourism sectors.6
Given agriculture’s large share in the economy, and its direct role in reducing poverty, it will
be essential to effectively implement policies to enhance the growth of agriculture—a
primary focus of MKUKUTA programs. Structural reforms and investment in infrastructure,
particularly in the transport and energy sectors, will also be critical. Sound and prudent
monetary policies would contain inflation. In line with the MKUKUTA, the authorities will
continue to target inflation to about 5 percent in the medium term.
9.
Macroeconomic stability would be underpinned by sound fiscal policies. In
particular, the authorities stressed their continued commitment to contain NDF to near zero
in the medium term to avoid crowding out resources for productive private sector activity.
Sustained tax and customs administration reforms, supplemented by possible tax policy
measures, target revenue of over 17 percent of GDP by 2009/10. With sustained donor
support, this would permit the government to maintain high levels of spending on
MKUKUTA priorities. Monetary aggregates are projected to expand at a strong pace,
reflecting current trends in financial sector deepening, but the authorities stand ready to curb
such growth if inflationary pressures emerge. External prospects remain broadly favorable.
Driven by strong economic growth, both exports and imports would continue to rise, with the
current account deficit falling slightly to about 14.5 percent of GDP. Gross official
international reserves are projected to rise modestly to about $2.3 billion, or 3.5 months of
the following year’s imports.
B. Enhancing Public Resource Mobilization and Efficiency of Spending
10.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen tax and customs administration will continue to be
a high priority. In addition to providing increased resources for high priority MKUKUTArelated spending, raising the revenue-to-GDP ratio would reduce Tanzania’s long-term
reliance on donor support. Reforms in customs administration aim to enhance trade
facilitation and strengthen compliance. On domestic taxation, efforts will focus on continued
strengthening of auditing and enforcement capacity, with a particular emphasis on increasing
6

The medium-term growth projection is predicated on the continuation of the trend in total factor productivity
observed over the past decade (see Box 2 in Country Report 07/138).

16
collections from sophisticated taxpayers and extending applicable procedures developed for
large taxpayer enforcement to medium taxpayers. Over the medium term, the authorities may
consider additional tax policy measures to help attain their medium-term revenue targets. In
addition, the authorities plan to improve collection of nontax revenues, including by
improving procedures for the licensing of natural resources.
11.
The authorities recognize the critical importance of further strengthening public
financial management (PFM). Substantial improvements in the budget preparation process,
as well as in its execution and monitoring, are key to ensure that public resources are
allocated efficiently and to put the objectives of MKUKUTA within reach. In addition,
achieving greater budget flexibility through increased donor aid in the form of budget
support is directly related to the quality of PFM. The authorities will assign top priority to
enhance the credibility of the MTEF, with a view to strengthen the links between
MKUKUTA and the budget. In this regard, the authorities plan to improve the integration of
the Strategic Budget Allocation System (SBAS) and the Integrated Financial Management
System (IFMS). The authorities also expressed their intention to implement most
recommendations of the external review of the donor-financed public financial management
reform program (PFMRP), particularly broadening the scope of the PFMRP to include line
ministries and improved coordination with the Local Government Reform Program.
Moreover, as noted below, important efforts are underway to strengthen cash management.
12.
Addressing capacity constraints in all areas of the government is essential for
stepping up policy implementation. The public service reform program (PSRP) and revised
medium-term pay strategy (MTPS) are aimed at attracting and retaining high-quality staff
through adequate remuneration. The authorities will soon launch phase II of the PSRP, which
will incorporate forthcoming recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Public
Service. The objective is to enhance accountability and coordination across government
sectors to facilitate a stronger pro-growth and poverty reduction approach.
C. Increasing the Financial Sector’s Contribution to Growth and Enhancing Monetary
Policy
13.
The authorities are progressively implementing changes in monetary policy
operations, in line with recommendations by technical assistance from the Fund aimed
at providing a more stable setting for domestic markets. These changes are also designed
to help curb high yields on Treasury Bills and reduce volatility (Box 2). The BoT—armed
with better projections of the government’s cash flow needs, provided by the new Cash
Management Committee—will aim to position reserve money on a continuous basis to avoid
the need for sharp end-quarter contractions. In addition, the authorities will seek to reduce
issuances of government securities; this will be achieved through fiscal policies to limit
NDF,

Box 2. Tanzania: High and Volatile Government Securities Yields
Tanzania’s T-bill yields have risen steadily
since late-2002, to more than 600 basis
points above the average in other EAC
countries in real terms. Since mid-2004,
yields have become progressively more
volatile, with peaks and troughs almost 9
percentage points apart. Moreover, yields
appear to have demonstrated downward
stickiness, so that volatility itself may have
contributed to the rising trend (Figure 1).

The authorities are taking steps to ease pressure on
yields: (i) consistent with Fund advice, the BoT now
targets the daily average of reserve money, instead of
end-quarter point targets, thus spreading out liquidity
management; (ii) the Cash Management Committee has
been set up to provide weekly and monthly forecasts of
government revenues and expenditures so monetary
policy can be implemented in a more timely manner; (iii)
the BoT conducts a larger share of sterilization
operations through sales of foreign exchange. In addition,
dollarization pressures have eased in line with a firming
up of the exchange rate.

29-Sep-04

Jun 02

Sep 02

Demand and supply factors have been
driving these results. On the supply side,
the volume of T-bill sales—used mostly for
mopping up liquidity—began rising steadily in 2002, before increasing sharply in 2005, when the government
incurred large domestic financing needs (Figure 2). In addition, sales of T-bills by the BoT were concentrated
toward the end of the quarter (Figure 3). This concentration was intensified by the need to roll over maturing
issues, resulting in predictable “pressure points” in the market. On the demand side, T-bills competed with
strong private sector demand for credit in Tanzania’s robust economy, including occasional but large syndicated
loans and initial public offerings. Further complicating
Figure 2: Gross T-bill sales by purpose (Tsh bn)
matters, demand is concentrated among a few large

Looking ahead, additional measures could be
considered to reduce volatility of yields and enhance
competition in the T-bill market: (i) the use of repo
operations for fine-tuning purposes could be increased, and spread across each quarter; (ii) the central government
could transfer its deposits in commercial banks to the BoT; (iii) auctions and instruments could be rationalized
around a few key benchmark maturities suited to the current stage of financial market development; (iv) retail
participation in T-bill auctions could be encouraged; (v) Actions to encourage activity in the secondary market—
such as, less frequent T-bill auctions and market-maker
requirements for primary dealers—could facilitate price discovery and enhance efficiency in the primary market.

18
and by scaling back their use for sterilization operations through increasing foreign exchange
sales for liquidity management purposes. Reflecting the authorities’ broad agreement with
staff’s advice, the monetary program for 2007/08 calls for a net reduction in liquidity paper
and a moderate increase in foreign exchange sales by the BoT.7 Steps will also be taken to
elevate competition in the T-bill/bond market and to develop the secondary market for these
instruments over time.
14.
Notwithstanding significant progress in recent years, Tanzania’s financial sector
remains relatively small, and access to bank credit is limited. The second-generation
Financial Sector Reform Action Plan approved by Cabinet, encompasses a number of
initiatives to address this problem, notably (i) a unified legal and regulatory framework and
investment guidelines for pension funds; (ii) legal and regulatory framework for a credit
information system; (iii) a survey of existing microfinance operations; and (iv) regulations to
fully operationalize the recently approved BoT and Banking and Financial Institutions Acts.
15.
The government is continuing to implement limited direct initiatives to facilitate
medium-term lending. These are based on best practices for offering private sector credit
promotion by partial government guarantee of commercial lending to the private sector.
Amounts guaranteed under these facilities for loans to small and medium-size enterprises
remain modest and consistent with the authorities’ commitment to limit fiscal risks.
D. Exchange Rate Policies and Competitiveness
16.
The authorities stressed their intention to maintain the flexibility of their
exchange rate policy. Recognizing the pressures on liquidity emanating from substantial
donor inflows, in addition to occasional interventions to maintain market order, the BoT
intends to undertake increased foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes. The
authorities agreed with staff suggestions that the operation of the foreign exchange market
could benefit from more frequent small sales of foreign exchange. They cautioned, however,
that the market’s thinness and seasonal volatility complicate their intervention operations.
17.
The staff believes that Tanzania has maintained its international competitiveness
(Box 3). The staff continued to emphasize that structural factors leading to a high cost of
doing business are the major barriers to enhanced competitiveness. The authorities agreed
that, going forward, there is great scope to boost productivity and improve infrastructure to
further strengthen competitiveness. However, they also expressed some concern that upward

7

The BoT is further studying operational issues regarding the planned foreign exchange sales.

19
Box 3. Competitiveness in Tanzania
Recent developments suggest that, on balance, Tanzania’s
external competitiveness remains robust.
Following a rapid depreciation in 2001–04, the real exchange
rate has stabilized in recent years (Text Figure 1). Supporting
the findings of a 2004 staff study (Country Report 04/284),
two recent studies by staffs of the Fund (WP/07/90) and the
World Bank (forthcoming) suggest that Tanzania’s real
exchange rate has fluctuated around its equilibrium value
since the early 1990s, and remains broadly in line with
fundamentals.

gold and other nontraditional exports have continued to
expand at a very rapid pace, with annual growth averaging about 26 percent and 14 percent, respectively, over the last five
years (Text Figure 2). However, traditional exports—including cotton, coffee, tea, tobacco, and cashew nuts—have
remained virtually flat in nominal U.S. dollar terms, hovering between US$250–350 million per year over the last decade.
This seems to reflect mainly weak supporting financial and transport infrastructure for subsistence and small-scale farming,
which continue to dominate Tanzania’s agricultural production. Overall, Tanzania has maintained its share in global world
export markets in recent years (Text Figure 3). The current account deficit has widened from 9½ percent of GDP in
2001/02 to an expected 15½ percent of GDP in 2006/07, but remains fully financed by growing external assistance (11½
percent of GDP) and FDI (4 percent of GDP)

Institutional indicators suggest a continued improvement in the business environment and competitiveness,
although from a low base (Table 1). Significant progress continues in improving investor protection, removing informal
barriers to trade, reducing corruption, and strengthening governance. However, weaknesses remain in a number of areas,
including restrictions in obtaining licenses, rigid regulation in the hiring and firing of workers, and ease of property
registration. Weak energy and transport infrastructure also continues to hamper Tanzania’s competitiveness.

pressure on the exchange rate could affect traditional exports, which have stagnated for many
years. The staff noted that, unlike other exports that have grown strongly in recent years,
traditional exports did not respond to the shilling’s depreciation since 2001.8 This suggests
that their disappointing performance reflects mainly weak supporting financial services and
transport infrastructure for subsistence and small-scale farming, which continue to dominate
Tanzania’s agricultural production. Indeed, the staff views the level of the exchange rate as
broadly appropriate and noted that lower-than-programmed foreign exchange sales could
exacerbate the problem. of high interest rates, raise domestic debt service costs to the
government, or lead to higher inflation.
E. Scaling Up Donor Assistance and Debt Sustainability
18.
Staff views Tanzania as a strong candidate for possible scaling up of aid (Box 4).
This view is based on Tanzania’s strong economic performance together with extensive and
pressing social and economic needs. Moreover, the reforms noted above and in the attached
MEFP are designed to enhance the PFM reforms and capacity building to ensure that
additional assistance would be used effectively. However, while donors view Tanzania’s
reform efforts favorably and will likely continue supporting the country, they do not appear
to have plans to scale up assistance.
19.
At the authorities’ request the staff prepared a scaling up scenario (Table 10).
The scenario assumes that annual disbursements of donor assistance will increase by
US$1 billion over the current level over a three-year period (from US$1.7 billion in 2007/08
to US$2.7 billion in 2010/11).9 Staff calculations indicate that the macroeconomic
implications of such an additional increase in aid are manageable. The higher aid, all of
which is assumed to be in the form of grants, is likely to have a modest stimulative effect,
with annual real GDP growth projected to increase by about 0.2 percentage points over the
medium term, and additional positive supply-side effects to materialize beyond 2010/11. The
impact on the real exchange rate is also likely to be moderate. Relative to the size of the
market, the additional sales of foreign exchange would be modest (about 2–3 percent of
annual trading volumes) and would result in a real appreciation on the order of 1½–
2½ percent a year. Correspondingly, export growth would likely be dampened slightly, while
imports would grow at a slightly stronger pace, resulting in a commensurate widening of the
external current account deficit. In keeping with the authorities’ objectives to maintain
annual
8

Following a strong appreciation in the second half of the 1990s, the shilling has steadily depreciated since
2001, largely because of deteriorating terms of trade, although the pace of depreciation has slowed recently.

9

The increase to US$2.7 billion is a lower bound of estimated additional assistance needed to reach MDGs by
2015 (see Box 4), however, an updated estimate is not yet available. Achieving this level of annual
disbursements by 2010/11 represents a US$0.4 billion increase over projected aid in 2010/11 in the program’s
baseline scenario. Going forward, the increase in aid relative to the baseline would then be maintained.

21

Box 4. Tanzania: Reaching the MDGs—A Case for Scaling Up
Tanzania has benefited from a significant increase in donor aid. In 2005 official development assistance to
Tanzania was 12.5 percent of GNI, up nearly 50 percent in U.S. dollar terms relative to 2000 (Table 1). Despite
this surge, aid to Tanzania, at US$39 per capita, remained below comparable sub-Saharan African countries.

Increased aid has contributed to progress toward the MDGs; but at current trends Tanzania will not
achieve all the MDGs by 2015. Through prudent macroeconomic policy implementation, the authorities have
generally used the increase in aid effectively, as evidenced by accelerated growth and sharply higher pro-poor
spending in recent years. Significant progress has been made in achieving universal primary education and
lowering the child mortality, but progress has been mixed with respect to reducing poverty and hunger,
increasing access to water, and reversing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS (Table 2).

Tanzania appears relatively well prepared to absorb scaled-up aid. The increase in aid seen since 2000 has
been used effectively while preserving competitiveness (Box 3), and despite higher T-bill yields arising partly
from issuances for sterilization operations, credit to the private sector has grown at a rapid pace. Fiscal
institutions are relatively strong: among SSA countries that are PRGF eligible, Tanzania has the highest rating in
key public sector management indicators prepared by the World Bank, and a joint review conducted by Fund
and World Bank staff in 2004 found that Tanzania had the highest ranking regarding the quality of public
expenditure management systems among 26 HIPC countries. Public financial management is being further
strengthened.

According to the United Nations Millennium Project and preliminary World Bank estimates, additional
resources of at least US$1 billion over the current level of aid will be needed over the medium term to
achieve the MDGs by 2015. However, there is no evidence that donors will scale up aid to Tanzania by the
required amount during this period.

22

inflation at 5 percent or below, the stance on monetary policy was left essentially unchanged.
Increased foreign exchange sales by the BoT would be used to mop up most of the additional
liquidity injections arising from the non-import component of government spending,
although a small amount of government securities may need to be issued to accommodate
some buildup of gross international reserves so that import coverage is maintained.
20.
Following extensive debt relief, Tanzania’s debt position has greatly improved.
As shown in Appendix II, Tanzania’s external debt will remain sustainable under
standardized shocks, assuming its current account deficit is financed at highly concessional
terms. Tanzania’s domestic debt remains relatively moderate (15 percent of GDP), and is
expected to decline gradually relative to GDP in view of the authorities’ commitment to limit
NDF over the medium term. As noted above, the authorities will continue to refrain from
nonconcessional funding. Moreover, improvements in debt management will aim to lower
debt service costs to the government, optimize the maturity profile, and facilitate financial
market development.
F. Supporting Private Sector Development and Other Structural Issues
21.
The authorities are taking steps to alleviate key bottlenecks constraining
economic activity in Tanzania. In addition to the measures outlined in the MEFP, notably
policies aimed at improving energy and transport infrastructure and enhancing the legal
environment, the authorities are working on further removing impediments to bank lending
through land titling and formalization of the informal sector through implementing measures
to separate the information function of business registration from the taxation function.
22.
The authorities are also continuing efforts to strengthen institutions of economic
governance to minimize resource leakages and strengthen accountability. This will be
carried out through effective implementation of the recently enacted National AntiCorruption Strategy Plan (NACSP II), reinforced by improved and transparent public
expenditure management. The implementation strategy will focus on creating an institutional
framework to facilitate the participation of local governments, civil society, media and the
private sector entities through the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Forum.

V. THE PSI PROGRAM: POLICIES FOR 2007/08
23.
The policy direction for 2007/08 envisaged in the three-year PSI program
remains appropriate.10 Reflecting the underlying medium-term growth trend, real GDP is
projected to grow by 7.1 percent in 2007. In addition, prudent fiscal and monetary policies
will aim to hold inflation to around 5 percent. Potential increases in electricity tariffs, as
envisaged under the program, would create some modest pressure on inflation, but progress
with reforms in the energy sector and TANESCO’s financial viability should help expand the
energy supply and sustain growth.
24.
The government’s budget for 2007/08 directs more resources to pro-growth and
social objectives (MEFP, ¶ 20–28). Government revenues and spending are projected to
increase to 16.1 percent and 28.4 percent of GDP, respectively, with donor grants and
concessional lending providing sufficient financing to cover the difference. More than half of
donor assistance will be delivered in the form of direct budget support (6.3 percent of GDP),
including basket grants and loans directed to MKUKUTA priorities. Following a sharp
increase last year, the wage bill in 2007/08 is expected to hold steady at about 5.8 percent of
GDP, which includes the hiring of up to 11,000 new staff, mainly in education and health. In
line with the authorities’ objectives to ease pressure on T-bill yields, NDF would be zero.
25.
The continued strong performance of revenues in 2007/08 is based on sustained
vigorous implementation of tax and customs administration reforms. In particular,
integration of the system-based procedures of the Customs and Excise Department and the
Destination Inspection (TISCAN) will be finalized and implementation of risk management
procedures will be given priority (structural benchmarks—MEFP ¶ 21). On domestic
taxation, the Large Taxpayers Department (LTD) of the Tanzania Revenue Authority will
continue to strengthen its audit capacity and, using techniques developed by the LTC,
dedicated units will be established to cover medium taxpayers using techniques. Modest tax
policy measures—including higher excise taxes on selected products and fuel levy and other
road usage charges—being introduced in 2007/08 will reinforce the revenue target.
26.
The authorities will continue to improve cash management to strengthen both
budget execution and the implementation of monetary policy. The Cash Management
Unit set up in the office of the Accountant General is expected to produce its first cash plan
shortly. In addition, the Cash Management Committee, with representatives from the
Ministry of Finance and BoT, initiated meetings in May. It will mainly prepare a liquidity
10

With the 2006/07 program broadly on track, the authorities did not seek any modifications to the quantitative
assessment criteria for June 2007.

24
management plan for the fiscal year to optimize government resources and communicate
imminent revenue and spending operations to inform the BoT’s monetary policy operations.
In addition, the Committee will oversee the closure of government accounts in commercial
banks, or their linkage to the Treasury Single Account (TSA), as sub-accounts. This will
reduce idle government balances in commercial banks and further facilitate the conduct of
monetary policy (MEFP, ¶ 23).
27.
The BoT will maintain a cautious monetary stance aimed at ensuring that
inflation remains subdued without constraining current trends in financial sector
deepening (MEFP, ¶s 29–31). Both reserve and broad money are targeted to grow by
21 percent 2007/08—a strong pace, but below the average in recent years.11 Reflecting the
slowdown in dollarization tendencies since early 2007, the ratio of foreign currency deposits
to shilling deposits is expected to be largely unchanged in 2007/08. At the same time, much
of the sterilization operations needed to mop up liquidity will be achieved through sales of
foreign exchange, which will ease the need to issue government securities for this purpose
and alleviate pressure on interest rates. The government’s zero domestic financing will allow
credit to the private sector to continue growing at a rapid pace (40 percent). While soundness
indicators reflect a healthy position for the banking sector as a whole, the BoT’s banking
supervision department will remain vigilant, including a greater emphasis on risk-based
assessment of bank balance sheets.12
28.
To further encourage financial sector deepening, the authorities intend to
implement the new second-generation Financial Sector Reform Action Plan in 2007/08.
In particular, the BoT will make the preparations needed to create a credit reference database
to facilitate lending operations by financial institutions; a unified legal and regulatory
framework and investment guidelines for pension funds will also be developed and submitted
to government (structural benchmarks—MEFP, ¶ 31 and Table 3).
29.
The external current account deficit before grants is projected to be unchanged
relative to GDP in 2007/08. In U.S. dollar terms, however, import growth is projected to be
stronger than originally envisaged—driven mainly by capital goods imports—and would
outpace the solid expansion in goods and services exports. The current account deficit is
expected to be largely financed by positive capital account developments, notably increased
foreign direct investment, but while donor support will continue to be substantial, it is
11

Given the uncertainties of money demand during a period of significant financial deepening and structural
change, the program’s monetary targets will need be kept under close review.
12

Anecdotal evidence suggests there may be some foreign participation in the T-bill market through local
subsidiaries of foreign banks. Going forward, such developments should be studied closely to ensure that the
regulatory environment remains appropriate.

25
expected to fall short of earlier projections. As a result a modest overall balance of payments
deficit is projected for 2007/08, in contrast to the small surplus that had been envisaged.
Gross international reserves would decline slightly, to just under US$2 billion by the end of
June 2008. While this is lower than the original program projection (US$2.2 billion), reserve
coverage would remain comfortable at about 3.5 months of imports of goods and services
projected for the following year.
30.
Strengthening the operations and finances of the energy sector will continue to
be a major focus of structural reforms, and the authorities remain committed to
moving rapidly to full commercial viability for TANESCO. TANESCO’s performance
and finances have been significantly strengthened by the restoration of hydro capacity due to
favorable rains. Nevertheless, further tariff increases and continued close monitoring will be
essential. To this end, TANESCO will submit an application to the regulatory authority for
an increase in electricity tariffs in July 2007 (structural assessment criterion, MEFP, ¶ 34)).
In line with the new regulatory framework for the sector, the requested increase must be
supported by detailed cost data. To comply with this requirement, TANESCO has contracted
two experts to prepare cost-of-service and financial analyses. The submission will reflect the
full cost recovery principle, including all current operations, system maintenance,
depreciation, and commercial financing costs. EWURA is required to rule on the tariff
request within 12 weeks.
31.
The authorities are moving forward expeditiously with the launching of the
special audit of the government EPA account managed by the BoT (MEFP, ¶ 36). The
Terms of Reference have been finalized, in consultation with Fund staff, and the Controller
and Auditor General (CAG) has initiated the tendering process. An auditor will be selected
promptly, and it is expected that the audit will be completed by October 2007 (structural
benchmark). Upon completion, the special audit will be made available to Fund staff and the
staff will discuss possible next steps, including any remedial measures that may be
appropriate, in the context of reviews of the PSI.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING
32.
The PSI-supported program would be monitored through the quantitative and
structural assessment criteria, indicative targets, and benchmarks specified in Tables 1
and 3 of Appendix I. The second review will be based on quantitative assessment criteria
for the end-June 2007 test date and the structural assessment criterion for end-July 2007. The
third and fourth reviews will be based on quantitative assessment criteria for the endDecember 2007 and end-June 2008 test dates, respectively. Quantitative indicative targets
were also set for end-September 2007 and end-March 2008. Conditionality in key areas of
the structural reform agenda include progress on the special audit noted above, revenue
mobilization and public expenditure management, financial sector reform, and the energy
sector.

26

33.
The authorities’ economic program faces some policy risks, notably with regard to
effective implementation of energy reforms, possible pressure for more direct government
interventions to accelerate growth and reduce poverty, and government implementation and
monitoring capacity constraints. Tanzania is also vulnerable to climate and terms of trade
shocks. While Tanzania depends heavily on donor aid, the ample stock of international
reserves shields the economy and government operations from temporary shortfalls in
disbursements. Steps have also been taken, such as enhanced donor coordination under the
Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania, to ensure more predictable longer-term commitments
of aid.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Tanzania has sustained strong economic performance for several years; the
approval of the PSI program in February 2007 solidifies its status as a mature
stabilizer. Relative to the region as well as to its own record, real economic growth has been
high, inflation low, and the external position much improved during this period. This
performance was underpinned by a good record of sound government financing, prudent
monetary and exchange rate policies, and steady implementation of a market-oriented
structural reform agenda. Moreover, the outlook is good for sustained strong economic
performance in the medium term.
Despite these developments, Tanzania remains a very poor country with many
pressing social needs and significant capacity constraints. The authorities will need to
sustain for many years sound policies and structural reforms that will mobilize and
efficiently use resources if they are to achieve their economic and social goals.
35.

Structural reforms to enhance public sector effectiveness and efficiency—critical
factors in Tanzania’s success—are expected to continue. Improvements in revenue
administration have translated directly into increased government revenues, which together
with high economic growth and substantial donor support, have enabled government
spending to expand at a very strong pace, with minimal recourse to costly domestic
financing. Staff welcomes the authorities’ resolve to continue their efforts in revenue
administration. On the spending side, while there has been much progress with public
financial management reforms (notably, the extended coverage of IFMS), more is needed. In
particular, the MTEF process has yet to become an integral part of the annual budget
formulation process and better tracking of MKUKUTA spending needs to be established.
These improvements would not only provide more effective information to government
policymakers, but also give the donor community a much better sense of how their assistance
is being used, encouraging them to provide additional resources in the form of budget
support.

36.

27
37.
High and volatile yields on T-bills are costly to the government and could
impair the financial intermediation that supports private sector growth. The authorities
are taking steps to reduce this volatility by minimizing the need to issue new T-bills at the
time of heightened pressure points in the market, which occur mainly at the end of the
quarter. Having shifted to targeting average reserve money, the BoT aims to position the
daily reserve money stock early on, such that program ceilings can be met without resorting
to intensive sales of T-bills at the very end of the period. In addition, to enable the BoT to
better assess short-term liquidity management needs, the Cash Management Committee
(CMC) formed in May 2007 should immediately begin to provide near-term forecasts of
liquidity generated by government operations. Staff also encourages the CMC to make rapid
progress with moving government deposits at commercial banks to the BoT, which will help
absorb liquidity. Greater reliance on foreign exchange sales for sterilization operations and
spreading maturities of debt rollovers across the yield curve, together with the government’s
target of zero NDF, should further ease pressure on T-bill yields. Looking ahead, steps would
be needed to strengthen competition in the primary market and create an environment for
secondary market trading.
38.
The authorities’ flexible exchange rate policy—whereby the BoT generally
enters the market only to meet potentially disruptive demand for or supply of foreign
exchange—has served Tanzania well. As a result, the shilling has depreciated in recent
years, mainly as the terms of trade have deteriorated, which has helped to preserve
Tanzania’s international competitiveness in times of adverse shocks. In light of the need for
large sterilization operations to mop up liquidity from donor-funded government spending,
however, staff encourages the authorities to take a more proactive approach to sterilization,
particularly through more systematic sales of foreign exchange by the BoT.
39.
Despite the banking sector’s remarkable expansion of financial intermediation
in recent years, a majority of Tanzanians still have little or no access to financial
services. With cabinet’s approval of the second-generation Financial Sector Reform Action
Plan, staff anticipates that progress in deepening and broadening financial services will be
stepped up, notably by establishing the credit reference database and a unified legal and
regulatory framework and investment guidelines for pension funds. Staff would caution the
authorities, however, to ensure that proper incentives are upheld in credit guarantee schemes
offered by the BoT and government to minimize contingent liabilities.
40.
While the outlook for Tanzania’s public debt sustainability is benign, staff
supports the authorities’ cautious stance toward external borrowing on commercial
terms. In particular, the government should continue to refrain from guaranteeing
commercial borrowing by public enterprises.
41.
Staff welcomes the efforts of the electricity utility TANESCO to vigorously
implement its financial recovery program by seeking a full cost recovery tariff increase in

28
the months ahead. With this measure, and in light of more favorable operating conditions,
staff encourages the authorities to make rapid progress towards TANESCO’s commercial
viability. Sufficient revenues and sound financing are essential for necessary maintenance
and expansion of the electricity network and supplies, whose shortcomings have been a
serious impediment to doing business.
42.
Improvements in governance and transparency have supported Tanzania’s
recent economic development and helped to attract donor support. In this regard, staff is
encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the Prevention of Corruption Bureau
through the recently approved Anti-Corruption Act. Staff also welcomes the authorities’
expeditious tendering for the special audit of the government’s external payment arrears
account managed by the BoT in line with the terms of reference agreed with Fund staff. Staff
will continue to follow progress with the special audit.
43.
Tanzania has set targets to implement the Anti-Money Laundering Act (2006)
and create a Financial Intelligence Unit by mid 2007. Staff welcomes these developments
and will follow the progress of these measures. Tanzania will also undergo a technical
assistance needs assessment (TANA) by the ESAAMLG, the FATF-style regional body for
Eastern and Southern Africa, in 2007.
44.
The PSI program is broadly on track. The small deviation from the envisaged
reserve money path has been redressed, and the ambitious and broad-based structural reform
program is proceeding as envisaged, notwithstanding modest delays in some areas, generally
owing to technical factors. Tanzania’s performance warrants the continued strong support of
the international community. Staff thus recommends completion of the first review.
45.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Tanzania take place within
24 months, subject to the provision of the Decision on Consultation Cycles in program
countries.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
June 12, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
LETTER OF INTENT AND MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC
AND FINANCIAL POLICIES

1.
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania is implementing a financial and
economic programme with support from the Fund through its Policy Support Instrument
(PSI). We recently held discussions with the Fund staff on the first review of the new
programme approved by the Executive Board of the Fund on 16th February, 2007. On behalf
of the Government, I hereby transmit the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP), which reviews recent economic developments, progress in the
implementation of our 2006/07 programme, and sets out the policies that the Government
intends to pursue in 2007/08.
2.
Implementation of the 2006/07 programme has been satisfactory, with all but one of
the quantitative assessment criteria for end-December 2006 and most structural benchmarks
observed. The end-December target for reserve money was missed by a narrow margin, but
the financial programme has been brought back into line with the PSI framework, as
evidenced by all end-March indicative targets being observed. The submission of a proposed
unified legal framework and investment guidelines for pension funds, a structural benchmark
for end-June 2007, has been delayed due to factors outside the Government’s control and is
now anticipated to be completed by end-September 2007. In this regard, we request the
completion of the first scheduled review under the PSI.
3.
The Government will continue to pursue appropriate fiscal and monetary policies and
implement the necessary structural reforms, especially the Second Generation Reforms of the
Financial Sector, tax and customs policy and administration reforms, and improvement of the
business environment to promote investment, as the prerequisites for accelerated and
sustainable growth in a stable macroeconomic environment. We also intend to aggressively
pursue the growth agenda through investment in productive infrastructure in order to
sustainably protect gains made in the provision of social services, reduce aid dependency,

43
and ensure progress towards attaining our poverty reduction objectives as specified in the
MKUKUTA.
4.
Although the power situation has improved following the recovery of hydrogeneration capacity, we will continue with implementation of the various measures outlined
in TANESCO’s Financial Recovery Plan in order to address the energy crisis. The 2007/08
programme aims at continuing the fiscal and financial sector reforms currently underway.
The programme also provides for continued strengthening of public expenditure planning
and budgeting, and hiring of additional staff in the education and health sectors.
5.
In the context of the PSI framework, we will keep the IMF regularly updated on
economic and policy developments, and provide the data needed for the monitoring of the
programme. We would request that the second review of performance under the programme
take place before end-December 2007 and that the third and fourth reviews take place by
April 30, 2008 and October 31, 2008, respectively. The Government will also consult
regularly with the Fund on any relevant developments at the initiative of the Government, or
whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a consultation.
6.
The Government of Tanzania intends to make this letter and the attached MEFP,
together with Fund staff reports related to the Article IV Consultation and the first review
under the PSI, available to the public and authorises publication on the IMF website once the
review is completed by the Executive Board.
Yours sincerely,

/s/

ATTACHMENT I
TANZANIA: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
I. RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS UNDER THE PROGRAMME
Introduction
1.
Tanzania continues to enjoy strong overall macroeconomic performance, after
sustained economic reforms over the last ten years. However, 2006 was characterised by a
slow down in economic activity on account of persistent drought which adversely affected
agricultural production and hydro-power generation, and the high oil prices on the world
markets. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is now estimated to have grown by 6.2 percent
compared to 6.8 percent recorded in 2005. The trade and tourism, manufacturing, mining,
construction, and communication sectors continued to register strong growth.
2.
Inflation was maintained at a single digit level, albeit with a rising trend mainly on
account of food and oil prices. From 5.4 percent at the beginning of 2006, inflation peaked at
7.7 percent in May 2006 before declining to 7.2 percent in March 2007 and further to 6.1
percent in April 2007. Inflation is expected to decline further in the coming months as food
prices decline reflecting an expected good harvest with the return of favourable weather
conditions.
Fiscal policy and public resource management
3.
The Government’s fiscal programme for 2006/07 (July–June) has been implemented
successfully, with outcomes broadly in line with programme targets. Despite the energy
crisis, domestic revenue collections have been well in excess of programme estimates and are
projected to reach 15.7 percent of GDP, a full 1 percent of GDP above the programme target,
mainly due to better than expected performance of import duties, corporation tax, and
domestic excises. The good performance witnessed in recent years is premised on robust
economic performance and recent policy and administration reforms, whereby the Tanzania
Revenue Authority (TRA) is benefiting from the integration of its operations and increased
use of technology.
4.
The tax and customs administration reforms progressed well on the basis of TRA’s
Second Corporate Plan, as evidenced by improved revenue performance and taxpayer
service. TRA’s Large Taxpayer Department (LTD) achieved International Standards
Organization (ISO) certification during 2006/07. The Customs Department rolled out
ASYCUDA++ to seven more stations including Tunduma, Kasumulu, and Zanzibar, and
started implementation of a time bound action plan for integrating ASYCUDA++ with the
destination inspection programme. TRA also finalized the Facilitated Client Scheme, under

45
which importers with a good track record can make use of expedited import clearing
procedures.
5.
Government expenditure was on track too, and is projected at 28.1 percent of GDP,
marginally below the programmed forecast. The Government continued to exercise a
cautious stance in budget execution, observing the evolving impact of drought, oil prices, and
increasing domestic interest payments. Foreign financing is likely to be below expectation
mainly due to non-disbursement because of delays in the implementation of some legislative
reforms. Nevertheless, expenditure for priority social services linked to the achievement of
the MDGs was implemented as budgeted. The overall budget deficit has been contained and
is projected at 12.5 percent of GDP, 1 percent of GDP lower than the programme projection,
with domestic financing of the budget within the programme target.
6.
Following the substantial increase of the wage bill in the 2006/07 budget,
implementation was monitored closely, and results were in line with projections at
5.9 percent of GDP. The Presidential Commission on Public Service Pay submitted its report
in December, 2006 as envisaged, focusing on a medium term policy to relate Government
employment levels and their budgetary implications. The Government is currently reviewing
the Commission’s recommendations against MKUKUTA implementation priorities and
budgetary feasibility, with a view to developing an updated medium term pay policy.
7.
The focus of our expenditure management strengthening programme continues to be
promoting transparency and accountability in public expenditure, consistent with the
objectives of the MKUKUTA. The Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) has
now been rolled out to 85 of the 122 Local Government Authorities (LGAs). In view of the
observations of the Controller and Auditor General expressed in the National Audit Office’s
(NAO) audits of the 2005/06 public accounts (the reports are posted on the NAO’s website)
in relation to the capacity of accounting staff, and following a major recruitment exercise
during the year, the Government continued to train accounting staff at both central and local
Government levels. The objective is to ensure that all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies
(MDAs) and LGAs have appropriately qualified accounting and internal audit staff.
8.
The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) and the Public Procurement
Appeals Authority (PPAA) are now fully staffed and operational. The PPRA has developed a
capacity building plan covering all public institutions, including Parliament, as well as civil
society organisations. It has also commenced procurement audits in line with its mandate
under the Public Procurement Act, 2004. The Government continues to set aside sufficient
resources to ensure effective implementation of the institutions’ functions. The National
Audit Office has continued to strengthen itself, with the 2005/06 reports released on a timely
basis for a second consecutive year.

46
9.
In order to improve the effectiveness of the BoT’s liquidity management, a Cash
Management Unit (CMU) was established in the office of the Accountant General. The unit
supports the functions of a Joint Treasury – Bank of Tanzania Cash Management Committee
(CMC), including forecasting of liquidity injection from Government operations and
developing recommendations for both Government expenditure and monetary operations
programming.
Monetary policy
10.
Against a backdrop of the drought and oil price related inflationary pressure, the
Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has geared monetary policy to contain inflation at single digit level.
The rate of growth of broad money supply has been reduced from 32 percent at end-June
2006 to a projected 21 percent at end-June 2007.
11.
The financial system continued to portray signs of a thin market, with high interest
rate spreads. The BoT’s decision to substantially reduce the minimum bid amount from TZS
50 million to TZS 5 million (aimed at widening the circle of direct participation) resulted in
an increase in non-bank private participation in the treasury bills market. Demand for
Treasury Bills has remained strong, as investors responded to the upward trend in yields. The
Treasury bond market remained active during the year, with concentration of preference on
2-year and 5-year bonds.
Financial sector reforms
12.
The Government is implementing the second generation financial sector reforms in
the context of its Financial Sector Reform Implementation Action Plan (FSIAP). The plan
and its action matrix, which identifies key actions and the corresponding development
partner support in each of the nine major areas of reform,1 have been formally adopted by the
Government in March 2007, which has also signed funding instruments with development
partners for implementation of some of the plan’s key components. Proposals for draft
leasing and mortgage laws are currently being discussed by stakeholders, with the intention
of presenting them to Parliament in the course of 2007/08. Commercial banks’ lending to
SMEs has also improved, with some banks introducing specific desks and products for this
purpose. The use of the Government’s SME Credit Guarantee Scheme has improved too, and
the inter-agency committee on financial sector reform is finalising a proposed unified legal
1

The nine areas are: (1) monetary policy reform; (2) strengthening the banking sector; (3) developing
financial markets; (4) reforming the pension sector; (5) strengthening the insurance industry;
(6) facilitating the provision of long term development finance; (7) strengthening micro and rural
finance; (8) legal and judicial reform; and (9) land administration.

47
and regulatory framework and investment guidelines for pension funds for submission to
Government for adoption and implementation. An anti-money Laundering legislation was
approved by Parliament, and implementation will commence earnestly in the coming year.
External sector developments
13.
The external sector performance has been positive, although the export sector remains
vulnerable to exogenous factors such as climatic conditions and terms of trade shocks.
During 2006/07, developments in the external sector were highly influenced by changes in
global oil prices and drought related requirements at home. A sharp increase in international
oil prices, coupled with increased demand for oil in the energy sector resulted in a higher
import bill which erased the gains from exports, with consequent widening of the current
account deficit. Nonetheless, the overall balance of payments position remained positive due
to continued strong inflows of donor assistance and debt relief received under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.
14.
Foreign currency reserves have been maintained at around USD 2 billion, equivalent
to about 4 months of next year’s import cover. The BoT’s interventions in the foreign
exchange market, aside from sales for sterilisation purposes, have therefore been limited to
periods of erratic market movements not in line with economic fundamentals. The foreign
exchange market was characterised by a general depreciation trend of the shilling vis-à-vis
the USD.
Energy
15.
Tanzania suffered major drought during the last three years, leading to loss of a
substantial portion of its power generation capacity. Aggravated by a long non-investment
period and high world oil prices, this precipitated an energy crisis in Tanzania, and a
financial crisis in TANESCO. To mitigate the impact of these developments on the economy,
the Government adopted a Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) for TANESCO, including the
acquisition of leased gas and diesel fired generation, improvement of hydrology management
procedures in the dams’ catchment areas, a tariff adjustment and an investment programme
of about USD 1.3 billion. While there has been a significant recovery of hydro generation
capacity recently, the leased capacity (140MW of gas-fired and 40MW of diesel-fired)
contracted on an emergency basis in line with the FRP, is being drawn upon to cover any
supply deficits. Government action in dealing with the energy crisis is premised on the
recognition that, unless the problems in the sector are adequately addressed, the economic
growth rates envisaged in the MKUKUTA cannot be attained, with substantial implications
for our poverty reduction effort. In line with the FRP, a 6 percent tariff increase was
implemented in February 2007, following approval by the Energy and Water Utilities
Regulatory Authority (EWURA).

48
Infrastructure
16.
The Government has prepared a draft Medium Term Transportation Infrastructure
Investment Plan (TSIP) covering all sub-sectors and reforms in the sector, including Local
Government and cross-cutting issues. The preparation process was highly consultative. Upon
finalisation, the TSIP will be prioritised and aligned with the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework. TANROADS has continued to improve its performance, as reflected by its
improved absorptive capacity, maintenance performance, and road conditions. The
Government is committed to the maintenance of the existing road network and will, through
the Roads Fund and increases in the fuel levy to generate greater yield, explore financing
options for increasing the resource envelope for this purpose.
Poverty reduction
17.
The 2006 status report on progress towards achieving the MKUKUTA goals shows
progress in most areas. In education, primary school enrolment has reached 96 percent—
compared to just 59 percent in 2000—secondary school enrolment has also increased, and
pupil:teacher ratios are falling. However, many indicators remain substantially below the
MKUKUTA targets and there are significant regional disparities. Data on other priority areas
are not readily available, so the Government is developing additional data sources to enable
more effective monitoring of progress under the MKUKUTA.
18.
The report, in recognition of the centrality of faster and broad based growth for
sustainable poverty reduction, recommends implementation of clear growth strategy in order
to focus investment in the productive sectors of the economy. As regards the energy sector,
the report calls for the diversification and expansion of energy supplies in order to counter
the cyclic shortfalls in hydro power generation and meet the growing demand. As
implementation of decentralisation by devolution policy progresses into its next phase, it is
also recognised that financing of activities and spending at the LGAs’ level will need special
monitoring. The government appreciates these and other challenges in the effort to eradicate
poverty, and in linking resources with MKUKUTA targets.
II. PROGRAMME FOR 2007/08
19.
The economy is expected to recover during 2007/08 as improved weather leads to
good agricultural harvest and alleviates recent difficulties with the power supply. Economic
growth is projected at 7.1 percent in 2007 and 7.5 percent in 2008, and 7.9 percent in 2009.
Pressure on prices is expected to moderate in the coming months following the harvest, with
inflation anticipated to stabilise at around our medium term objective of 5 percent.

49
Fiscal Programme
20.
For 2007/08, the programme cautiously envisages that domestic revenue could reach
TZS 3,103 billion, or 16.1 percent of GDP, reflecting the impact of continued tax and
customs administration reforms and tax policy measures to be implemented in the 2007/08
budget. The measures include indexation of the specific excise duty rates for non-petroleum
products, including alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, soft drinks, and an upward
adjustment of the fuel levy and charges on road usage to raise resources for maintenance of
the expanded road network (expected to yield about 0.7 percent of GDP). Taking into
account projected foreign financing, it is expected that net domestic financing of the budget
will be eliminated. The 2007/08 budget has been formulated assuming more revenue than in
the program. However, consistent with the commitment not to resort to domestic financing of
the budget, implementation of the budget will keep expenditures aligned with the resources
available, while protecting high priority spending.
21.
The Government will continue to implement tax administration reforms based on the
TRA’s Second Corporate Plan and the Tax Modernisation Project. The programme for
2007/08 prioritises further Customs reform, especially (i) rolling out ASYCUDA++ to the
remaining stations, (ii) completing the integration of customs’ and TISCAN’s import
clearance processes by end-March 2008 (structural benchmark); (iii) continuing developing
risk management and selectivity principles, with an action plan to be completed to this effect
by end-September 2007 (structural benchmark) and its subsequent implementation;
(iv) strengthening post-clearance auditing; and (v) starting to interconnect the information
systems of EAC countries to strengthen control of transit goods. Other actions include new
customer service centres, and further integration of TRA’s operations, and the establishment
of dedicated units within six TRA offices to serve medium-sized taxpayers. The LTD, which
assumed responsibility for qualifying taxpayers outside Dar es Salaam and increased the
number of cases under its jurisdiction to 370 taxpayers with effect from 1st July, 2006, will
continue to strengthen its audit capacity. The Government will also continue to publish the
list of tax exemption beneficiaries each quarter.
22.
Improving public expenditure management will remain a key priority in the coming
year. In this sense, the Government will strengthen the link between budgetary resource
allocation and MKUKUTA priorities, in particular by achieving greater integration of the
Strategic Budget Allocation System (SBAS) and the IFMS, and emphasizing the role of the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework in the budget formulation process. In addition, a
Planning & Reporting System (PlanRep) similar to the SBAS has been introduced in all
Local Government Authorities (LGAs) for preparation of their budgetary requirements for
2007/08. The allocations for direct MKUKUTA interventions in the 2007/08 framework
account for 65% of the total budget, compared to 46 percent and 43 percent in 2005/06 and
2006/07 respectively. In view of increased expenditure on education, the allocation for
Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Well-being (Cluster II) interventions increased

50
from 36 percent in 2006/07 to 47 percent of the resources allocated for direct MKUKUTA
interventions, with 37 percent allocated for Growth and Reduction of Income Poverty
(Cluster I); and 16 percent for Governance and Accountability (Cluster III). The Government
will continue to build capacity to monitor budget implementation against these targets, in
addition to the broader MKUKUTA Monitoring System (PMS) which monitors the impact of
interventions by all stakeholders on the status of poverty in the country. In addition, the
Expenditure Tracking and Monitoring Unit established at the Ministry of Finance is
monitoring budget implementations by MDAs in order to improve further the efficiency in
resource utilisation. To enhance budget reporting, with technical assistance from East
AFRITAC, the Government is examining options for tracking budget execution along the
MKUKUTA clusters with a view to putting in place a functional classification capable of
supporting such reporting for the next budget cycle.
23.
Further improvements in cash management are planned during 2007/08. The CMC
has already identified all Government accounts with commercial banks and is currently
preparing a plan to complete their transfer to the BoT. The CMU is developing a cash plan
for 2007/08 together with three month cash flow forecasts, and the CMC will monitor its
implementation through the year. The cash flow forecast will be updated every quarter
(structural benchmark).
24.
The budget for 2007/08 envisages a slight decline of the wage bill as a percentage of
GDP, achieved through a slow down of the nominal increase of the allocation for salaries and
wages relative to GDP growth. The Government is reviewing the recommendations of the
Presidential Commission on Public Service Pay as a basis for updating the Medium Term
Pay Policy (MTPP). The Government is aware of the need for additional staff, especially in
frontline services, against the broadly recognised fact that without a motivated and better
performing public service the efforts to reduce poverty can be frustrated. Implementation of
the updated MTPP, however, will continue to reflect the MKUKUTA priorities, and overall
sustainability of the fiscal and macroeconomic frameworks.
25.
Development expenditure is projected at 9.1 percent of GDP, compared to an
expected 8.6 percent in 2006/07, with the increase coming from higher foreign financing.
Other expenditures are projected to increase modestly, with total expenditure at 28.4 percent
of GDP compared to 28.2 percent under the 2006/07 programme. Notable increases relative
to the 2006/07 programme are expected in domestic interest payments (from 0.7 percent of
GDP to 1.2 percent of GDP) and foreign financed development expenditure (from 4.7
percent of GDP to 5.4 percent of GDP). Public debt management continues to receive the
attention of the Government, to avoid a slide back to unsustainable debt.
26.
In the medium term, there is expected to be a growing increase of expenditures on
infrastructure relative to increases in social service expenditure, in part to implement a faster

51
growth strategy and reduce liquidity pressures arising from use of aid for public domestic
procurement of non tradable goods and services.
27.
Donor coordination is an important and integral element in the Government’s effort
to strengthen planning and budgeting. In December, 2006, the Joint Assistance Strategy for
Tanzania (JAST), or Mkakati wa Pamoja wa Misaada Tanzania (MPAMITA) in Swahili, was
adopted. The JAST is a result of a broad Government–led consultative process with
development partners and non-state actors, and reflects the Government position on
rationalization and harmonization of donor support. The overriding objective of this initiative
is to reduce further the transaction costs associated with different strategies and enhance
national ownership and Government leadership of the development process. Based on the
JAST, the 19 participating development partners have, in close consultations with the
Government, prepared a Joint Programming Document (JPD) fully aligned to the
MKUKUTA objectives.
28.
Building on the JAST and JPD, the Government will address the problem of
inadequate predictability of external assistance by leading joint analysis with development
partners on alternative scenarios for expenditure and external financing, aiming at a clearer
consensus on medium term strategies and expenditure plans prior to the 2008/09 budget
cycle. It is envisaged that this will facilitate scaling up of aid in line with the international
community’s commitments in pursuit of faster growth and poverty reduction.
Monetary policy
29.
Monetary policy during 2007/08 will continue to focus on achieving the inflation
target of 5 percent. Controlling the growth of reserve money will remain central in the
implementation of monetary policy, and the BoT views the programmed deceleration of the
annual growth rate of reserve money to 21 percent by end-June 2008 as consistent with the
targeted reduction in inflation.
30.
The BoT and the Government will enhance the coordination between monetary and
fiscal policies in order to avoid undue volatility in financial markets. The regular projections
of the Government’s cashflow will be produced by the Cash Management Committee will
contribute to more accurate projections of liquidity conditions. In addition, with the move to
targeting monthly average reserve money, the BoT will continue to strengthen the
mechanisms for positioning the stock of reserve money early each month to avoid the need
for sharp adjustments at the end of the month to meet the reserve money targets. The
continued strengthening of a more even application of monetary policy and flexibility in the
use of an appropriate mix of instruments for sterilisation purposes, coupled with the policy of
no domestic financing of the budget deficit, should help ease pressure on interest rates. While
the implementation of monetary policy will continue to be refined in response to market
developments, it is expected that, given the current comfortable level of international

52
reserves, sales of foreign exchange by the BoT will continue to play an important role in
sterilisation operations. In order to enhance the predictability of the BoT’s policy stance, the
BoT will, subject to market conditions, seek to move to a more regular pattern of sales of a
small amount of foreign exchange for sterilisation purposes. The BoT will continue to inform
market players on the objective and rationale of this approach.
31.
The financial programme is consistent with continued strong growth in credit to the
private sector. Small and medium sized enterprises, exporters and other investors in the
productive sectors of the economy are also poised to benefit from financial sector reforms
underway, including the already established credit guarantee schemes and the envisaged
Development Finance Guarantee Facility (DFGF). The Government and the BoT will
continue to carefully monitor the usage of these credit guarantee schemes in order to
maximize their effectiveness in a transparent manner, while minimizing fiscal risks. In
accordance with the financial sector reform programme, the BoT is working to establish a
credit reference database for the collection of information on payment records of borrowers
in banks, other financial institutions and entities. The database and its operating guidelines
are expected to be operational by end-June 2008 (structural benchmark).
Energy:
32.
The Government will continue implementing reforms in the energy sector in order to
improve performance of the sector. The Government strategy in this regard is guided by the
following objectives:
(a)

Ensure the sector makes an appropriate contribution to the country’s growth
agenda through better quantity, quality, and pricing of energy;

(b)

Support TANESCO in achieving financial sustainability in the medium term,
and operational financial viability as soon as possible;

(c)

Finance capital expenditures, with support from development partners, as
required by TANESCO to improve its power generation and service delivery to consumers,
and to diversify the electricity generation resource base;

(d)

Support interventions to expand access to modern energy services, particularly
to the peri-urban and rural population; and

(e)

Support enabling conditions to attract more private investment in the sector,
notably for the addition of new generation, to promote competition, and lower operational
costs.

53
33.
Improved weather conditions have led to an early recovery of the hydro generation
capacity, and improved finances for TANESCO. The Government intends to use this
favourable development to move more rapidly to commercial viability for TANESCO.
However, implementing a tariff increase by July 2007 (a structural benchmark) is not
feasible—consistent with the recently introduced regulatory environment for public utilities,
all tariff requests must now be submitted to a newly instituted independent regulator
(EWURA). In approving the February 2007 increase, EWURA requested that future tariff
requests be based on a detailed cost analysis (including audited accounts and other
information). To help prepare the tariff submission in line with EWURA requirements,
TANESCO has procured the services of financial and tariff experts who are expected to
complete their work by July 2007.
34.
It is intended that by end-July 2007 TANESCO will submit to EWURA a request for
a tariff increase to return TANESCO to full cost recovery on operational basis, including the
full cost of current operations, maintenance and depreciation, and the cost of servicing its
commercial borrowing (structural assessment criterion). This would exclude the cost of
capital investment projects to expand generation, transmission, and distribution capacity. The
next tariff increase would be subject to review by the regulator (up to 90 days), following
which the approved tariff would be implemented. TANESCO is committed to seek to
implement future increases to maintain tariffs at the level sufficient to recover the full
commercial cost of its operations. Implementation of the FRP will continue to be monitored
through monthly meetings of a special Government – Development Partners Task Force on
Energy. The government appreciates the Fund’s continued support in dealing with the energy
crisis, including agreeing to the use of MDRI resources for procurement of emergency leased
generators and rehabilitation of the power infrastructure, and joining the government effort to
mobilise donor support for implementing the five year investment plan.
Governance
35.
In addition to deepening reforms to address the remaining structural constraints to
faster economic growth, the Government is committed to strengthening institutions of
economic and political governance and fighting corruption to minimise resource leakages
and strengthen accountability as outlined in the MKUKUTA. In this regard, the second
National Anti-Corruption Strategy Action Plan (NACSAP II) was launched in December
2006 and a new Anti-Corruption law was submitted to Parliament for first reading in
February 2007 (structural benchmark) and approved in April 2007. The law integrates all
anti-corruption conventions ratified by Tanzania, and contains measures to strengthen the
capacity and effectiveness of the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB) and the prosecution
of corrupt practices. With the support of development partners, the Government is also
scaling up its efforts to implement its comprehensive Legal Sector Reform Programme
(LSRP). Other measures in this area include the continued strengthening of the NAO, and
capacity building for public expenditure tracking by local communities.

54

36.
The Government will continue working closely with the Fund in relation to the
planned special audit of the external payment arrears (EPA) account operated by the BoT on
behalf of the Government. As detailed in our supplementary Letter of Intent dated February
8, 2007, the Controller and Auditor General has launched, at the request of the Government,
a competitive bidding process for a special audit of the transactions related to the account.
The special audit will be conducted by an international audit firm compliant with
International Standards of Auditing (ISA) and experienced in International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Terms of Reference for the special audit were agreed with
Fund staff and are drawn to cover all the transactions from the EPA account during 2005/06,
as well as the verification, monitoring, and control procedures related to the account. It is
intended that the special audit be completed by end-October 2007 (structural benchmark) and
the results of the audit will be shared with Fund staff. Following the completion of the audit,
the Government is committed to the adoption and implementation of appropriate remedial
measures as may be necessary. These will be discussed with Fund staff in the context of the
reviews under the PSI. The Government has suspended all payments from the account until
finalisation of the audit. Thereafter, any outstanding obligations and planned payments will
be integrated in the fiscal framework of the Government.
Conclusion:
37.
The economic and financial programme to be implemented by the Government
during 2007/08 will be monitored by the quantitative assessment criteria and indicative
targets set forth in Table 1 and the structural assessment criterion and benchmarks shown in
Table 3. The programme seeks to promote high and sustainable growth as a basis for more
rapid poverty reduction. This primary objective will be pursued on the basis of sustained
macroeconomic stability, enhanced public resource mobilisation, efficiency in public
spending, increasing the contribution of the financial sector to economic growth, and
continuously improving the business climate to increase investment. The Government is
confident that the development partners, including the Fund, will maintain and increase their
support through financing and policy advice, especially in view of the large investment
requirements in communication infrastructure, energy, water, and education.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
June 12, 2007
Tanzania’s debt sustainability has strengthened further following completion of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and additional debt relief provided recently by
bilateral donors. While Tanzania’s risk of debt distress is low, this hinges on continued
substantial financing of government spending by donors at highly concessional terms.
1.
The baseline scenario assumes that Tanzania’s performance during the recent
past will be sustained. In particular, it assumes that real GDP growth will increase to
8 percent in 2010, compared to an average of 6½ percent during 2001-06, predicated on the
continuation of trends in total factor productivity observed over the past decade (see Box 2 in
Country Report 07/138). Growth is projected to decline gradually thereafter to 6 percent by 2015
and remain unchanged through 2026. Foreign direct investment is also projected to be slightly
higher relative to the average of the past 10 years, reflecting strong overall ratings of
Tanzania’s macroeconomic policies, as well as ongoing structural reforms in key areas.
Donor assistance is assumed to remain unchanged as a ratio to GDP over the medium term,
and start to gradually decline after 2011, with the grant element assumed to remain at about
50 percent throughout the forecast period. In addition, the baseline scenario reflects
government’s commitment of continued zero net domestic financing over the medium term,
and no external foreign borrowing at commercial terms throughout the projection period.
External Debt Sustainability
2.
Tanzania’s external debt sustainability has strengthened further. Following
completion of the MDRI in 2006 by the IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank,
Tanzania has received additional debt relief in recent months from bilateral donors.1 As a
result, Tanzania total external debt as of end-February 2007 declined to about US$4.5 billion,

In January 2007, Japan canceled US$523 million of its outstanding debt to Tanzania, and Russia announced a
debt swap scheme of its remaining external debt to Tanzania (US$21 million).

M

or 34 percent of GDP.2 The NPV of public external debt now stands at about 16½ percent of
GDP and 63 percent of exports, whereas public external debt service is around 2 percent of
exports of goods and services (Table 1). All these indicators are significantly below the
indicative debt-burden thresholds that apply to Tanzania, indicating low risk of debt distress.3
3.
The bound tests indicate that Tanzania’s external debt will remain sustainable
under the individual standardized shocks and their combination (Table 2 and Figure 1).
Given that Tanzania does not breach any of the indicative thresholds for low-income country
DSA in any scenario or bound test, the IMF and World Bank staffs classify Tanzania as “low
risk” according to the Fund-Bank guidance for debt distress assessments.
4.
However, Tanzania’s external debt sustainability hinges on continued financing
of its large current account deficit at highly concessional terms. Currently, total donor
assistance is about 11½ of GDP, of which about 7 percent of GDP is in the form of grants,
and the remainder has a grant element of about 50 percent. As shown in Table 2, for
example, even a 2 percentage point increase in the interest rate on new borrowing, while
leaving unchanged the long grace and maturity periods and the significant amount of external
grants under the baseline, would gradually increase Tanzania’s NPV-to-GDP ratio to about
22 percent of GDP by 2026. Furthermore, if the share of grants to GDP were to decline by
only 3 percentage points, with the gap having to be financed at commercial terms, Tanzania
will breach the indicative external debt thresholds towards the end of the projection period.
Fiscal Sustainability
5.
The public DSA is based on the assumption of continued expansion of domestic
revenue mobilization to finance increased priority spending. Specifically, based on
sustained revenue administration improvement and policy measures, domestic revenues are
assumed to increase gradually to about 19 percent of GDP, as external grants decline
moderately from 7 percent of GDP in FY 2006/07 to about 6 percent of GDP in FY 2025/26.
Primary expenditures would increase to around 29 percent of GDP. In this context, the
primary fiscal deficit is projected to expand slightly, to 4 percent of GDP. External financing
is assumed to remain concessional and broadly constant at about 4 percent of GDP. Moderate
domestic borrowing is projected to resume over the medium term, and stabilize at ½ a
percent of GDP.

2
3

This external debt stock includes the estimated amount of interest arrears of about US$1.2 billion.

Based on the 3-year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index,
Tanzania is classified as a “strong performer”. Its thresholds therefore are: 50 percent of NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratio, 200 percent of NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 300 percent of debt-to-revenue ratio, 25 percent of debt
service-to-exports ratio, and 35 percent of debt service-to-revenue ratio.

3
6.
Under the baseline fiscal DSA scenario, the NPV of public debt is projected to
decline gradually. Domestic debt, including securities issued for financing and sterilization
purposes, accounts for almost half of Tanzania’s public debt NPV. The projected
improvement in the debt profile is driven by the decline of domestic debt, which will fall
from about 15 percent of GDP at end 2005/06 to around 5 percent of GDP at the end of the
DSA period, on the back of limited net domestic financing and declining bond issuances for
sterilization purposes. A lower stock of domestic debt would reduce the risk of crowding out
private investment and would lower the interest bill. From about 30 percent of GDP at end
FY2005/06, total public debt will reach 20 percent of GDP in FY20025/26 (Table 3). Debt
service indicators also show favorable trends, with debt-service-to-revenue declining to about
5 percent in 2025/26.
7.
Tanzania’s public debt remains sustainable under alternative scenarios.
However, lower GDP growth would pose moderate risks (Table 4). In this sense, the least
favorable case is represented by a decline of one standard deviation in real GDP growth
during 2007/08 and 2008/09 relative to historical values. Under this scenario, the NPV of
debt would climb to 39 percent of GDP in 2025/26 and debt service would rise gradually to
11 percent of revenue in 2025/26 (Figure 2).

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, an additional disbursement
is made at the completion point that corresponds to interest income earned on amounts committed but
not disbursed during the interim, calculated using the average return (during the interim period) on
the investment of resources held by or for the benefit of the PRGF-HIPC Trust.

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member
countries that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.
The MDRI is financed by bilateral contributions and the Fund’s own resources, as well as the
resources already disbursed to the member under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Bank of Tanzania (BoT) was subjected to an
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on August 16, 2003. A
safeguards assessment of the BoT was completed on December 05, 2003 and concluded that
whereas the bank had a relatively strong internal control environment, some vulnerabilities
existed, notably in the external audit and financial reporting areas. Staff proposed
recommendations are reported in Country Report 07/138. The BoT has implemented most of the
recommendations of the safeguards assessment.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzania shilling. The official exchange rate is determined
in relation to the rate established in the interbank market for foreign exchange. The middle
rate in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, was T Sh 1,239 per U.S. dollar as
of end-March, 2007. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.

TANZANIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP

Partnership in Tanzania’s Development Strategy
Tanzania’s development strategy is set forth in the MKUKUTA (2005-2010). It is a successor to
the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that covered 2000-2004. The MKUKUTA
addresses three clusters of outcomes: (i) growth and the reduction of income poverty,
(ii) improving the quality of life and social well-being, and (iii) strengthening governance and
accountability.
Bank Group Strategy
The Bank’s Board discussed a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tanzania on April 24,
2007. The Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST) comprises four parts, which
collectively will serve as the World Bank Group CAS for FY07 to FY10. Part I is the national
medium-term framework established by Government for managing development co-operation
with its Development Partners (DPs) so as to improve the collaboration in achieving national
development and poverty reduction goals. In discussion of the draft JAST, Government and DPs
agreed on the need for further joint work on parts II-IV below, engaging the entire DP
community and focusing on the Government’s own planning process, the MTEF in particular.
The appropriate balance of roles between Government and DPs in the JAST and wider planning
process has been a fruitful area of dialogue, under continuing review through the Government-led
JAST Working Group. Part II and Part III are the Joint Program Document (JPD) developed in
consultation with Government by the Development Partners Group (DPG) as a response to
Tanzania poverty reduction strategies (MKUKUTA for mainland Tanzania; MKUZA for
Zanzibar) and the JAST. Part II is a joint country analysis describing Tanzania’s development
achievements and challenges. Part III is the joint program part, reflecting DPG planned support
and aid effectiveness commitments to Tanzania over the 4 remaining years of MKUKUTA,
FY07-10. The World Bank Group (WBG) Part IV describes the WBG’s strategic approach and
proposed program over support over the FY07-10 period (advice, analytic work and financing,
both ongoing and planned). Based on the Results Matrix for all DPs in Part III, Part IV also
includes a WBG specific results matrix with milestones that facilitate monitoring of progress
during the FY07-10 period.
The Bank is supporting implementation of the MKUKUTA through its full range of instruments,
including general and sectoral budget support, project support, analytic and advisory activities,
guarantees, and equity investments by IFC.
General budget support is provided in the form of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs),
jointly with a group of 13 other donors. There is joint performance assessment and a common
review process. Tanzania’s first PRSP was supported through a series of three PRSCs (20032005). After the finalization of Tanzania’s second PRSP, the Bank together with the other
budget support donors developed a new Performance Assessment Framework based on
Tanzania’s new PRSP. Its implementation is expected to be supported by the Bank through a

7
series of five PRSCs, the first and second of which (PRSC-4 and PRSC-5) were approved by the
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on May 9, 2006 and April 24, 2007. It covers six focus
areas. These are the three clusters of the MKUKUTA (i.e., growth and the reduction of income
poverty, improvements of quality of life and social well being, and governance and
accountability), macroeconomic stability, resource allocation and budget consistency, and public
financial management. The most recent annual review of general budget support to Tanzania was
held in October 2006.
In the social sectors, the Bank provides support through a sectoral development policy credit and
grant for secondary education (US$150 million each), the third and last tranche (US$50million)
of which is expected to be disbursed in FY07. The objectives are to improve education, expand
school access, and increase retention at both primary and secondary levels. Bank support has
already facilitated a significant increase in school enrollments. In April 2007, the Board
approved a credit for US$42 million to support the education improvement project for Zanzibar.
The objectives of the program are to improve completion on lower secondary education including
achieving better examination results. This will be facilitated through construction of secondary
schools, laboratories and facilities for teacher training, by providing in-service mathematics and
science training to teachers, and making text books in core subjects available to all primary
secondary schools in Zanzibar. After the focus on primary and secondary education, in FY08 the
Bank will also support reforms of higher education and science and technology in Tanzania
through a proposed credit in the amount of US$150 million. The Bank contributes to the health
sector multidonor “basket fund,” which supports sector reforms and funds nonwage expenditures.
A multisector HIV/AIDS project supports Tanzania’s efforts to reduce HIV transmission and
mitigate the adverse consequences of AIDS. In the water sector, one project supports technical,
commercial, and financial rehabilitation of the water supply and sanitation services in Dar es
Salaam. Another supports access to improved and sustained water and sanitation services in rural
communities. A new Water Sector Support Program project (US$200 million) was approved by
the Board in February 2007. It supports GoT’s strategy for improving governance of water
resources management and sustainable delivery of water supply and sanitation services. The
objective of the IDA-funded Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) is to enhance the capacities
of communities and other stakeholders to prioritize, implement, and manage sustainable
development initiatives and in the process improve socioeconomic services and opportunities.
The Bank’s Board approved the Tanzania Second Social Action Fund (US$150 million) on
November 30, 2004, to continue the successful outcomes from TASAF-1.
In the agriculture sector, the Bank’s Board approved in FY06 a project to support Tanzania’s
Agriculture Sector Development Program. In addition, the Participatory Agricultural
Development and Empowerment Project Credit supports investments in technologies to reduce
soil fertility decline.
A Forest Conservation and Management Project helps the government implement policy,
particularly by building a framework for long-term sustainable management and conservation of
Tanzania's forests. The Marine and Coastal Environment Management Project, aims to
strengthen the management of the marine and coastal environment. In FY08, the Bank is

8
expected to approve the multi-country (Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi) Lake
Victoria Environmental Project II which aims to support reagional efforts to improve
management of the Lake Victoria ecosystem.
Efforts to improve Tanzania’s infrastructure are supported by road and railway projects. In April
2004, the Bank’s Board approved a credit of US$122 million to (1) upgrade strategic road links,
(2) enhance road management capacity, and (3) improve the operations of Tanzanian Railways
(TRC and TAZARA). In FY08, Bank support to this project is expected to be increased by a
supplementary credit of US$100 million. The policy dialogue is now helping prepare a new Road
Act, which will be the basis for strengthening the policy and institutional framework for road
building and maintenance.
The Bank has also helped the government implement the Power Sector Restructuring Program. It
has encouraged the government to build the domestic gas market and generate lower-cost power
through the Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project, and is currently
assisting the government in implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan for TANESCO and
the development of a medium to long term strategy for the energy sector, which will provide the
basis for further investment support. A credit to support rural electrification and access to ICT in
the amount of US$105 million is under preparation for presentation to the Board in FY08.
The Local Government Support Project (US$150 million) is designed to strengthen fiscal
decentralization, improving accountability in the use of local government resources, and
improving management of intergovernmental transfers. Other project objectives are to increase
access to infrastructure and services in unplanned areas of Dar es Salaam and improve revenue
performance for sustainable operations and maintenance.
In December 2005, the Board approved a private sector competitiveness project to support
Tanzania’s efforts to create an enabling environment for its private sector and enhance its
competitiveness; the focus is on micro-, small, and medium enterprises. The project will support
Tanzania’s Business Environment Strengthening (BEST) program, help set up computerized land
and business registries, support judicial reform, and develop the financial sector.
An accountability, transparency, and integrity project was approved by the Board in May 2006.
The project contributes to improved access to judicial and legal services and the accountable and
transparent use of public financial resources. This will be achieved by improving the skills and
systems to deliver judicial/legal services and public financial management, and strengthening the
capacity of oversight institutions to perform their role.
The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) strategic focus in Tanzania is on the financial,
agribusiness, tourism, infrastructure and SME sectors. Recent activities include a US$10 million
investment in Bonite Bottlers, a carbonated soft drinks manufacturer, a US$5 million Exim Bank
trade facility, and a US$5 million Tier II facility to Stanbic Tanzania. At present, the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has no exposure in Tanzania and no projects planned.

9
Tanzania joined the World Bank Group in 1962. Beginning with an IDA credit for education in
1963, it has received a total of US$6.2 billion (US$6 billion from IDA) in credits, loans and
grants from the World Bank. Total disbursements amounted to US$5.2 billion as of April 30,
2007 (US$4.7 billion from IDA, US$356 million from the IBRD, and US$214 million in IDA
grants). Currently, the portfolio comprises 23 active projects, with commitments of US$1.9
billion, in all major sectors; the undisbursed balance is US$1.1 billion.

Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
The IMF and World Bank staffs collaborate closely in supporting Tanzania’s structural reforms.
As part of its assistance—through lending, country analytic work, and technical assistance—the
Bank, in collaboration with the Fund, supports policy reforms in the following areas:
•

Public expenditure management. Improvements in public expenditure management have
been a top priority of the Tanzanian government since 1995. The Bank, the Fund, and other
donors have worked closely to give the government needed support for institutional and
policy reforms. The Fund is leading the dialogue on fiscal policy; the Bank concerns itself
with strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency of public expenditures. To
enhance strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency, the Bank is supporting a
government-led, participatory public expenditure review/medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF) process. This effort has helped to strengthen and open up the budget
process and the allocation of resources to pro-poor priority areas. The Bank is also involved
in the fiscal decentralization process through analytical work and the Local Government
Support Project. The Bank and the Fund work together to support institutional budget and
expenditure management reforms. The annual Bank-led Public Expenditure and Financial
Assessment Report (PEFAR) - the most recent one was issued in May 2006 - is the main
instrument for the donor community to assess progress in these areas. It also integrates the
assessment of Tanzania’s financial management and procurement systems, which
previously had been assessed through separate Country Financial Accountability
Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment Reports.

10

•

Tax policy and administration reform. The Bank and the Fund have, over the past few
years, cooperated closely to support the government’s efforts to modernize the tax system
and enhance domestic revenue collection. The Fund has taken the lead in reforms of tax
policy; the Bank has taken the lead in reforms to strengthen tax administration.

•

Financial sector reforms. Tanzania has instituted far-reaching reforms in the financial
sector with strong support from both the Bank and the Fund. Besides contributing to the
policy dialogue, the Bank has provided significant technical assistance for financial
sector reforms, primarily through two financial institution development projects that
support government withdrawal from banking and nonbanking financial institutions
while strengthening financial sector supervision. Among successful outcomes of these
reforms are the privatization of Tanzania’s largest bank and the entry of a fairly large
number of international banks into the Tanzanian market. The Bank has also been
involved in reform of the capital and securities authority, reform of pension systems, and
liberalization of capital accounts. Through a separate project, the Bank supports the
development of rural and microfinance services. A joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in June 2003. The recommendations of the
FSAP have been incorporated into a reform strategy document for the financial sector. The
Bank and the Fund have been allocated specific donor responsibilities in implementing the
strategy document and have been active in coordination of the implementation process,
including donor coordination.

•

Public service reform and improved service delivery. In recent years, the government of
Tanzania, with support from the Bank and other donors, has launched a number of major
initiatives to improve performance and increase accountability, transparency, and integrity in
the public sector. Among them are (i) the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP); (ii) the
Local Government Reform Program; (iii) the Public Finance Management Reform Program;
(iv) the National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plans for Tanzania; (v) the National
Framework on Good Governance, delineating a comprehensive approach to improving
governance; (vi) the establishment of a Good Governance Coordination Unit in the
president’s office; and (vii) the launch of the Legal Sector Reform Program. The PSRP has
been central to these reforms because its objective is to improve the accountability,
transparency, and resource management of service delivery. The reforms are closely linked
with other major reforms in public finance and decentralization. The PSRP aims to transform
public service into a service that has the capacity, systems, and culture for client orientation
and continuous improvement. Cooperation between the Bank and the Fund covers those areas
where public sector reform directly affects fiscal stability and public sector financial
management.

•

Energy sector. The Bank and the Fund are working closely to find ways to address the crisis
in the energy sector. The Bank takes the lead in assisting the authorities with developing
emergency power generation plans to alleviate power supply shortages.

11

•

Trade reforms. The Bank and the Fund are working closely to help Tanzania establish a progrowth trade program. Within the context of the Integrated Framework, the Bank led the
preparation of a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study that was issued in July 2005. The Bank
will carry out follow up trade and competitiveness analytical work in the coming years,
possibly through the soon—to –be-established Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Mainstreaming
Trade The Bank is working toward trade expansion though its regional trade facilitation
project. It is also active at the regional level in the dialogue on trade reforms within the East
African Community.

Tanzania: Statistical Issues

Economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring
purposes, but remain weak despite progress in some areas and considerable technical
assistance. There are few statistical publications and no fully articulated publication policy.
Only limited data are reported for Zanzibar. The authorities are committed to improving the
production and dissemination of macroeconomic and socio-demographic statistics through
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). GDDS metadata were posted on the IMF’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in July 2001 and were last updated in
November 2005. A mission to prepare the data module for the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (data ROSC) was completed in October 2002, and the report was
published in March 2004.
National accounts
National accounts statistics for mainland Tanzania are prepared by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) on the basis of data collected by its regional offices and by other
government entities. Separate accounts for Zanzibar are compiled by the Office of the Chief
Government Statistician for Zanzibar. The data sources for compiling the estimates for
Tanzania by expenditure category, the external sector data, and the indicators used to
extrapolate benchmark production levels suffer from deficiencies that complicate estimation
of savings-investment. The accounts are largely based on the 1968 System of National
Accounts (1968 SNA), but also include certain elements of the 1993 SNA, such as the
inclusion of elements of government expenditure (health and education) as household
consumption, and the valuation of imports of goods at free-on-board (fob) prices. Annual
national accounts are published at current and constant (1992) prices. Annual GDP estimates
are also compiled at current prices for 21 regions of Tanzania. To improve the quality of the
national accounts, the authorities, with help from donors, are changing the base year of the
national accounts from 1992 to 2001. The revised series will be based on the Household
Budget Survey (HBS) 2000/01, Integrated Labour Force Survey (ILFS) 2000/01 and Annual
Survey of Industrial Production 1999/2000. An East AFRITAC mission in April 2006
provided training and assistance in the compilation of quarterly national accounts (QNA),
which have been compiled at current prices since 2001 but have not been yet released. The
series have some methodological shortcomings, and in particular suffer from poor source
data in the retail and wholesale sector. Recommendations have been made for improvements
and for the compilation of constant (2001) price quarterly national accounts, pending also the
production of annual accounts using the new base year.
Prices
The NBS compiles a monthly consumer price index (CPI) for mainland Tanzania based on
consumer expenditure in 20 urban centers, and a separate price index (urban) is compiled for

13

Zanzibar. The CPI has, since September 2004, been compiled (retroactively to January 2003)
using weights based on the 2000/01 HBS data. Key changes were a reduction in the weight
given to food from 71 percent to 56 percent and an expansion of the number of products. The
index excludes imputations for the price changes of owner-occupied housing. However,
methodological problems that may have understated inflation led to the release of a revised
CPI from September 2006, though this has not been backdated. The NBS has plans for a new
HBS to be conducted in 2006/07, which should eventually lead to revision of the CPI
weights.
Government finance statistics
The authorities provide Fund missions with monthly data on central government revenue,
expenditure, and financing on a timely basis. Although the underlying concepts broadly
follow the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986, the reporting differs from
international standards in coverage and the treatment of lending minus repayments, and
transfer payments. Coverage of data on the operations of the central government refers to
Tanzania mainland only – recently the Ministry of Finance of Zanzibar established a unit
tasked with developing a fiscal reporting framework for Zanzibar. The data also exclude the
operations of extra-budgetary units and funds. Data for general government are not available
as no information is yet provided on the financial position of local governments, although the
authorities have stated their intention to produce such reports.
Despite improvements in the recording of government transactions, discrepancies remain
between revenue and expenditure data, on the one hand, and financing data. The
discrepancies are related to the lack of a fully integrated set of accounts and the delineation
of the public sector and its sub-sectors, differing source data, and timing differences.
The Ministry of Finance created a database of donor-funded projects in 2001/02 (July-June),
with donor assistance. Since then, the number of foreign-financed projects reported by and
channeled through the budget has increased significantly.
The government has completed the computerization of its accounting system for budgetary
units. Although the authorities indicated that it would allow resumption of reporting in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), no data were reported for the 2006 GFSY.
The computerized accounting system does not yet provide details about donor funded
development expenditure and has not yet been extended to cover the extra-budgetary units.
The authorities regularly report fiscal data for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics
The monetary statistics are broadly adequate for policy and analysis purposes. Nevertheless,
a November-December 2006 mission confirmed earlier findings of methodological problems,
such as (a) exclusion of some deposit-taking financial institutions from the institutional

14

coverage of monetary survey, (b) arbitrary application of the residency criterion by the
commercial banks, (c) inadequate subdivision of the resident sector data, (d)
misclassification of certain accounting data among statistical aggregates, (e) discrepancies
between reported interbank positions, (f) non-transparent treatment of repurchase
agreements, and (g) key information gaps in the bank reporting system. It was also found that
international reserves data included certain assets that did not qualify as reserve assets.
To address these problems, recommendations were made to improve the following
definitions: net international reserves, foreign assets, foreign liabilities, loans to other
resident sectors, claims on the central government, government deposits, central bank
liabilities to commercial banks, and deposits included in broad money. The mission also
(a) introduced the standardized report form─1SR for reporting central bank data to the IMF;
(b) recommended that some additional schedules for reporting of data by commercial banks
be introduced to fully satisfy compilation needs, in particular with respect to the sectoral
breakdown of financial instruments used by commercial banks in their activities; and
(c) recommended the expansion of the depository corporations to include other deposittaking financial institutions, such as the savings and credit cooperatives, Pride Tanzania
L.M.T., Presidential Trust Fund (PTF), Small Enterprises Development Agency, Tanzania
Investment Bank, Tanzania Postal Bank, Twinga Bancorp Limited, Mufindi Community
Bank, and Mwanga Community Bank. A follow-up mission in FY2008 will assist the
authorities in developing the standardized report form for other depository corporations.
Balance of payments statistics
Foreign trade data are prepared by Fund staff missions on the basis of customs data provided
by the Bank of Tanzania, which in turn are compiled by the Tanzania Revenue Authority
(TRA) based on customs records. A balance of payments statistics mission in May 2002
found continued and significant under-recording of trade and a dearth of information on
services. The authorities acknowledged these problems in their response to the data ROSC
report published in March 2004 and indicated that the Bank of Tanzania plans to commission
a joint study by the NBS and the TRA to determine the magnitude of underrecorded trade
and design an appropriate method of estimation. Re-exports are now included in trade data.
Balance of payments statistics are reported annually to STA for publication in the IFS, along
with the annual International Investment Position (IIP).
Tourism revenues are now estimated using the model that was developed from the
International Visitor’s Exit Survey conducted in 2001. Using the model and subsequent
annual surveys, estimates have been made for 2001 through 2005.
Information on official grant and loan receipts is prepared by Fund staff based on contacts
with official agencies. The data on current and capital transfers (grants) are estimates, based
on data provided by the Ministry of Finance and United Nations Development Program

15

projections. Disaggregation of the data has improved, but more work is needed including on
the coverage and periodicity of data.
Data on private capital flows are presently minimal. While some information on private
banking sector flows can be derived from the monetary survey, other private capital flows are
not adequately captured through the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) and
are largely reflected in “errors and omissions.” However, the authorities have made
commendable progress in collecting information on certain components. The results of the
Private Capital Flows Survey for 2000 and 2004 have now been incorporated into the balance
of payments and IIP accounts, which improved estimates of foreign direct investment inflows
as well as dividend payments and distributed branch profits. The Private Capital Flows
Survey is designed to capture information on foreign direct investment and also asks
investors to report committed and projected (for the near future) direct investment flows.
Data on the gross and net official reserves of the Bank of Tanzania are provided monthly
with a short lag, and are available to the Fund with higher frequency on request. Similarly,
data on the foreign assets and liabilities of the banking system are provided with relatively
short lags.
Significant improvements in the quality of external debt data have been made in the context
of the creditor reconciliation exercise under the HIPC Initiative. At present, all multilateral
and Paris Club debts (accounting for about 80 percent of total external debt) have been fully
reconciled. However, less progress has been made in reconciling debt owed to other bilateral
and commercial creditors. Information on external debt not guaranteed by the public sector,
mostly private sector debt, is also limited and not captured in a timely manner.
East AFRITAC has provided assistance in international investment position statistics, most
recently in March 2007. The missions have worked on training, questionnaires, and revised
guidelines for international transaction dealers.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
United Republic of Tanzania
On June 27, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Republic of Tanzania.1
Background
Tanzania’s economic performance has been strong over the past decade, supported by prudent
macroeconomic policies and far reaching structural reforms. In particular, sound financing of
government operations—including substantial assistance from international donors—facilitated
a monetary policy stance that reduced inflation while allowing for a rapid expansion of credit to
the private sector for productive purposes.
The structural reform agenda has focused on economic liberalization, improved public financial
management and tax and customs administration, and financial sector development. Together
with infrastructure investment and structural policies to enhance the business environment, this
has contributed to solid productivity growth. The growing economy, together with increasing
government revenues and donor assistance, has enabled government spending to expand at a
swift pace, most notably on pro-poor initiatives outlined in MKUKUTA (Tanzania’s second
generation growth and poverty reduction strategy). Nevertheless, with a GDP per capita of less
than US$340 and widespread poverty, Tanzania still has a long way to go to reach its

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will therefore require continued donor financing for
many years to come, particularly, in the areas of education, health, and infrastructure.
Since 2000, real GDP growth has averaged 6.3 percent per annum, one of the highest in subSaharan Africa. Growth has been broad-based, led by the mining, construction, retail/trade and
manufacturing sectors. Agricultural growth has been affected however by recurrent droughts.
The most recent of these, in 2005-06, also coincided with poor hydrology to markedly reduce
Tanzania’s hydropower-generating capacity, forcing many businesses and consumers to rely on
high-cost thermal generators. With world fuel prices trebling over the same period, the high cost
of electricity squeezed business profits, and placed upward pressure on the import bill and
inflation. Thus, real GDP growth slowed down to 6.2 percent in 2006—0.5 percentage points
slower than in the previous two years—while inflation accelerated slightly to 6.7 percent. Going
forward, strong rains and full recovery in hydropower production are expected to help boost
growth and dampen inflation.
Exceptional improvements in tax and customs administration and public expenditure
management have both reinforced development partner confidence in the authorities’
commitment to reform, and increased the effectiveness of government expenditures. Since
1999/2000, government revenues and donor support have, respectively, risen by 4½ and 6½
percentage points of GDP, allowing government spending to grow by some 10 percentage
points of GDP, to slightly over 28 percent of GDP in 2006/07. Moreover, the increased spending
has focused on MKUKUTA priorities, with allocations rising to 13.6 percent of GDP for 2006/07,
up from 12.8 percent the previous year.
Monetary aggregates have grown at a robust but prudent pace since 2000, reflecting rapid
financing deepening, albeit starting from a very low base. Bank lending to productive
nongovernment sectors has expanded sharply—at an average rate of 32 percent per annum—
while the spread between lending and deposit rates has continued to narrow, indicating more
efficient intermediation by banks.
The sharp increase in private sector lending coupled with higher issuance of treasury bills—
mainly, for liquidity absorption purposes—have put upward pressure on government securities
yields, with rates peaking at 18 percent in March 2007. The rates have also become
increasingly volatile since 2005, reflecting a combination of challenges in liquidity forecasting
and smooth implementation of reserve money targets. Going forward, pressure on nominal
yields should subside with reduced reliance on domestic sterilization of aid inflows, near zero
net domestic financing of the budget, improved liquidity forecasting system, and more even
implementation of monetary policy.
The recent widening of the trade deficit reflects the rise in capital-goods and energy-related
imports over the last two years. The exchange rate, which had depreciated in line with the terms
of trade deterioration, has stabilized of late due to higher foreign exchange sales by the central
bank and a reduction in the need for energy-related imports. The external position has also
benefited from debt relief provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC)

3
and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, as well as additional bilateral relief. Tanzania’s external
debt burden, in net present value terms, was reduced to about 16 percent of GDP at end-2006.
In light of its status as a mature stabilizer with comfortable international reserves, Tanzania has
entered a new phase in its long-term relationship with the Fund. On February 16, 2007
Executive Directors approved a three-year program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI).
The government views the PSI as essential to reinforce appropriate macroeconomic and
structural policies, and signal the strength of government policies to development partners.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Tanzania’s strong overall economic performance in recent
years, which has been grounded on a sound macroeconomic policy framework, progress on
structural reforms, and substantial donor assistance. However, Directors noted that major
challenges remain, including the high and pervasive poverty, significant capacity constraints in
the public sector, and insufficient infrastructure and human capital. They emphasized the need
to maintain prudent market-oriented policies and steadfastly pursue structural reforms,
particularly in the agricultural sector, as the basis for attracting additional donor inflows and
achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy remains appropriately focused on minimizing domestic
borrowing while raising spending on poverty reducing activities. They commended the strong
revenue performance in recent years, observing that revenue growth is essential to reducing
dependence on donor financing, and welcomed plans to further strengthen tax and customs
administration. They also encouraged the authorities to press forward with reforms to improve
public financial management to ensure that public resources are allocated efficiently and in line
with the priorities of the poverty reduction strategy. Directors considered Tanzania to be a good
candidate for a significant increase in donor support, but noted the importance of further work to
assess the macroeconomic effects of aid.
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent monetary policy stance that has kept inflation
comparatively low. They noted the challenge of properly managing bank liquidity in the context
of substantial donor inflows and under-developed financial markets. They supported increased
reliance on foreign exchange sales to contain liquidity, noting that this will help to ease pressure
on treasury bill yields. However, they stressed that appropriate balance will need to be struck in
the use of liquidity management instruments. Directors also supported the authorities’ other
efforts to improve liquidity management to reduce the level and volatility of treasury bill yields,
including domestic bond market development, better liquidity forecasting through improved
coordination between monetary and fiscal policy, daily targeting of average reserve money, and
transfer of government deposits from commercial banks to the central bank.
Directors considered the real exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals. They were
of the view that the flexible exchange rate policy has helped to preserve Tanzania’s
international competitiveness in the face of several adverse shocks. Nevertheless, they

4
underlined the need to remove structural impediments to competitiveness. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue to avoid non-concessional borrowing in order to preserve
external debt sustainability.
Directors noted that ongoing financial sector reforms have contributed to a rapid expansion of
financial intermediation, although small- and medium-sized enterprises and the rural sector
have not benefited much. They welcomed the second-generation Financial Sector Reform
Action Plan, which is intended to address this gap. Directors, however, stressed the importance
of minimizing contingent liabilities in connection with the partial guarantee of commercial lending
to small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Directors emphasized the importance of the authorities’ commitment to improving governance
and transparency. They welcomed efforts to address the allegations of improprieties in the
management of the external payment arrears account at the Bank of Tanzania, and looked
forward to timely completion of the special audit of this account. They recommended that
another safeguards assessment of the Bank of Tanzania be undertaken to complement the
audit. Directors encouraged the rapid implementation of the recently approved Anti Money
Laundering Act, and welcomed the adoption of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy Action
Plan and the approval of the Anti-Corruption Act.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to remove key bottlenecks to economic activity in
Tanzania, particularly those to upgrade the energy and transport infrastructure and to further
modernize and simplify the legal framework governing business activity. They encouraged
vigorous implementation of the financial recovery program for the energy parastatal to ensure
its commercial viability and reduce the potential drain on the budget.
Directors considered that Tanzania has much to gain from deeper regional cooperation and
integration. They supported a coordinated approach to providing regional investment incentives,
full implementation of the East African Community’s Customs Union Protocol, and further trade
liberalization to deepen the regional integration process.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review under the Policy Support Instrument
for Tanzania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review under a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Tanzania. The PSI was
approved on February 16, 2007 (see Press Release 07/26).
In completing the review, the Executive Board agreed to waive the missed ceiling on reserve
money for end-December 2006, based on the relatively small excess and corrective actions
taken.
The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF
financial assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in preparation and
endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported programs are based on countryowned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society
and development partners. This is intended to ensure that PSI-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social
policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. Members' performance under a PSI is reviewed
semi-annually, irrespective of the status of the program (see Public Information Notice No.
05/145).
Following the Board’s discussion on Tanzania, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“For several years, Tanzania has sustained strong economic performance through marketoriented policies within an appropriate macroeconomic framework. Nevertheless, Tanzania
remains a poor country, and the authorities will need to maintain sound policies and pursue
structural reforms diligently in order to remove impediments to growth and achieve their
long-term economic and social objectives.
“Tanzania’s macroeconomic framework and structural reform agenda under the Policy
Support Instrument remain a good basis for raising economic growth and reducing poverty.
Fiscal policy will continue to anchor a stable macroeconomic environment by maintaining
near-zero net domestic financing, while strong revenue growth and substantial donor support
would allow for high levels of spending on economic and social priorities.

2

“The monetary stance remains appropriate. An important challenge for the authorities is to
contain liquidity arising from donor-funded government spending while avoiding high and
volatile short-term interest rates. In this context, greater reliance on foreign exchange sales is
necessary, along with efforts to better coordinate monetary and fiscal policy and to develop
the domestic bond market.
“A reliable and ample energy supply is key to economic growth. In this regard, rapid
progress towards the commercial viability of the energy parastatal, TANESCO, is critical.
The authorities should vigorously support TANESCO’s financial recovery program,
including its forthcoming application for an electricity tariff increase that would enable full
recovery of operating costs.
“The Tanzanian authorities are undertaking appropriate actions and commitments to improve
governance and transparency. They are making good efforts to strengthen the Prevention of
Corruption Bureau and to address the allegations of improprieties in the management of the
government’s external payment arrears account at the Bank of Tanzania. The forthcoming
special audit of this account should be conducted in a timely manner and in line with best
international standards,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for United Republic of Tanzania
and Joseph L. Masawe, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 27, 2007
Over the review period, the Tanzanian authorities remained committed to the objectives of
the program, which has resulted in continued robust performance of the economy. They
thank management and staff for the constructive dialogue, and the Board for its support and
guidance. The authorities reaffirm their commitment to pursuing prudent polices as agreed
under the PSI and request the completion of the first review. The Tanzanian authorities are in
general agreement with the assessment by staff on the economic developments and program
implementation during the review period.
1.0

Program Performance

The implementation of the PSI has been satisfactory, with all structural benchmarks and all
but one of the quantitative assessment criteria for end-December 2006 being achieved. The
reserve money target for end-December 2006 was narrowly missed, but the financial
program has been brought back to the PSI targets, with all end-March 2007 indicative targets
observed. However, a structural benchmark for end-June 2007 pertaining to the submission
of a proposed unified legal framework and investment guidelines for pension funds was
delayed due to reasons beyond the authorities’ control. This will now be completed by endSeptember 2007.
The year 2007/08 is expected to witness stronger economic performance, arising mainly from
improvements in hydrological conditions that would normalize electricity generation and
contribute to good harvests. GDP growth is projected to reach 7.1 percent in 2007, rising
further to 7.5 percent and 7.9 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively. This is expected to
relieve pressure on food prices, which constitute over 55 percent of the CPI, allowing
inflation to stabilize at around 5 percent.
2.0

Recent Developments and Medium Term Outlook

2.1

Macroeconomic performance

Tanzania has continued to grow strongly over the past decade, with real GDP growth
averaging 6.3 percent over the past six years. During 2006/07, the economy continued to
perform outstandingly well, with real GDP growth estimated to reach 6.2 percent, above a
projected level of 5.9 percent. This robust growth has been achieved despite a severe drought
which hit the country in early 2006, adversely affecting agriculture and energy production.
Similarly, against the odds, inflation was maintained at a single digit level, albeit with a
rising trend mainly on account of food and oil prices. Inflation is however projected to
decline in the coming months, to reflect the impact of declining food prices and improved
power generation arising from good weather.

2
2.2

Fiscal Performance

The outcomes of the 2006/07 fiscal program are broadly in line with targets. This was
achieved despite the energy crisis which could have caused major disruption in revenue
collection. Revenue performance is above program target, and is expected to reach 15.7
percent by end-June 2007, compared to the projected level of 14.7 percent of GDP. This was
as a result of the strong economic performance and ongoing reforms at the Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA) to improve its operations.
Expenditure is projected to be below programmed level, due to prudent fiscal approach
adopted by the government, despite the pressure, to avoid possible breach of targets which
could arise from larger than projected domestic payments resulting from the impact of the
drought and rising fuel prices. Expenditures for priority sectors, which are linked to the
achievement of the MDGs, remained protected.
Consistent with the objectives of MKUKUTA, the Tanzanian authorities continued to
strengthen expenditure management by promoting transparency and accountability in public
expenditure and training accounting staff at all levels. The Integrated Financial Management
System (IFMS) now covers 85 percent of the Local Government Authorities (LGAs). The
government continues to train accounting staff, with the objective of ensuring that the
government is served with qualified accounting officers at all levels. A Cash Management
Unit (CMU) has been established at the Ministry of Finance to support the joint functions of
expenditure management of the office of the Accountant General and liquidity management
of the Bank of Tanzania.
Revenue collection is further projected to reach 16.1 percent of GDP in 2007/08, driven by
the ongoing customs and tax reforms, including the integration of ASYCUDA and TISCAN
systems in customs. The authorities will continue to improve public expenditure
management, to ensure that expenditures remain aligned with resources available. In this
regard, the link between budgetary resources and MKUKUTA priorities will be strengthened,
through the integration of the Strategic Budget Allocation System (SBAS) and the IFMS at
all levels of government.
In the medium term, the government projects a gradual increase in infrastructure spending, in
part to implement the growth strategy, while at the same time reduce liquidity pressures in
the economy, arising from increased donor inflows. In the meantime, the government will
strengthen donor coordination through the Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST)
which should facilitate scaling up of aid, in line with the international community’s
commitment.
2.3

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies

The monetary policy of the Bank of Tanzania is geared towards the containment of
inflationary pressures, arising from the impact of the drought as well as the rising fuel prices.
However, interest rates remained high with a wide spread between deposit and lending rates,
reflecting the thinness of the markets. Nevertheless, the demand for government securities

3
remained strong following the widening of the circle of primary market participation by the
Bank of Tanzania.
The authorities remain committed to financial sector reforms continued to be implemented in
line with the Financial Sector Reform Implementation Action Plan (FSIAP) whose objectives
include putting in place leasing and mortgage laws and modalities for the introduction of
specific products for commercial banks’ lending to small and medium scale enterprises
(SMEs).
Monetary policy during 2007/08 policy will continue to focus on the primary objective of
price stability. This will be achieved through the control of reserve money, consistent with
the growth and inflation objectives of the government. At the same time coordination
between fiscal and monetary policies will be strengthened to avoid undue volatility in the
market. The BOT will seek to attain a proper mix of its available monetary instruments to
ensure orderly developments in the markets. The BOT will therefore, step up its foreign
exchange sales in the market, especially given the comfortable level of official reserves.
Continued credit growth will be given priority, in line with the financial program. At the
same time, measures to enhance the flow of credit to SMEs through existing credit guarantee
schemes, including the Development Finance Guarantee Facility (DFGF), will be
strengthened.
2.4

External Sector Developments

The export sector in Tanzania remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, especially those
associated with weather and terms of trade. During the review period, developments in the
external sector were highly influenced by the sharp increase in international prices of oil,
which considerably raised the oil import bill and imports in general. Nevertheless, over the
review period, the overall performance of the external sector was positive due to continued
strong inflows of donor assistance and debt relief received under the MDRI.
The Tanzanian authorities recognize that regional cooperation will continue to play an
important role towards sustaining sound macroeconomic policies and enhancing growth. The
government will continue to participate actively in regional efforts to strengthen the existing
regional trading arrangements, especially within the East African Community (EAC). The
authorities recognize that the EAC will continue to be the primary vehicle in its efforts to
strengthen regional cooperation. The Tanzanian authorities will work closely with other EAC
partner states, to formulate a coordinated approach to investment and trade liberalization in
the region. Meanwhile, efforts will continue to be taken to address the issue of overlapping
membership in regional cooperation arrangements, including Tanzania’s membership in
SADC and Kenya and Uganda’s membership in COMESA.
2.5

Improving Energy Supply and Infrastructure

A major drought that hit the country during the last three years led to substantial loss in
power generation capacity and a financial crisis to the state-owned power utility company,

TANESCO. A financial recovery plan (FRP) for TANESCO has been adopted by the
government and additional gas based generation capacity to supplement the current hydrobased generation has been acquired by TANESCO. With a view to bringing the utility
company back to profitability, some tariff increases through full cost recovery have been
implemented and will continue to be implemented by the company.
On infrastructure, a draft medium term transportation infrastructure investment plan (TSIP),
to be aligned with the medium term expenditure framework (MTEF), has been prepared by
the government to facilitate a planned investment in the sector.
The Tanzanian authorities recognize that faster and broader based growth will be necessary
for Tanzania to succeed in its efforts to reduce poverty. The government is fully aware that
progress towards achievement of the objectives of MKUKUTA remains slow and is
committed to accelerate its efforts in this endeavor.
To this end, reforms in the energy sector will be deepened to enhance the contribution of the
sector to growth. In line with the FRP, TANESCO will, implement gradual electricity tariff
increases to match the rising cost of power generation and thereby ensure its financial
sustainability. Measures are also underway to attract more private sector investors into the
energy sector to complement TANESCO’s efforts.

Improving Governance

The Tanzanian authorities remain committed to strengthening institutions of economic and
political governance in the fight against corruption, while it combats corruption. The
government launched the second National Anti-Corruption Strategy Action Plan (NACSAP
II) in December 2006 and parliament approved a new Anti-Corruption Law in April 2007.
The law will go a long way towards strengthening the fight against corruption in Tanzania,
through among other means, strengthening the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB). My
government is working closely with the Fund on the special audit of the BOT accounts
related to external payment arrears (EPA), as detailed in its supplementary letter of intent of
February 8, 2007. The government, through the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) has
launched a competitive bidding process for a special audit of the transactions related to the
account, by an audit firm compliant with International Standards of Auditing (ISA) and
experienced in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The special audit is
expected to be completed in October 2007. The authorities will take the appropriate remedial
measures in consultation with the Fund. Meanwhile, all outstanding obligations and planned
payments from the account have been suspended.

Conclusion

The Tanzanian authorities remain committed to the continued implementation of prudent
policies and deepening of the reform agenda. This will be achieved through effective
implementation of the Fund supported PSI as spelt out by the national growth strategy,
MKUKUTA, which seeks to attain sustained macroeconomic stability, enhanced public
resource mobilization, efficiency in spending and enhanced contribution of the financial

5
sector to growth. The authorities will continue to take measures to improve the business
environment and fight corruption. Consistent with the PSI, the government will particularly
continue to limit domestic financing to reduce inflation, while facilitating further expansion
of private sector credit for productive purposes. My authorities are grateful for the support
they continue to enjoy from the Fund and from the international community as a whole and
count on their continued future support.
