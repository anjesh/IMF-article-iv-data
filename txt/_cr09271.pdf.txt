

Mission. A staff team comprising Messrs. Cerisola (head), Chan-Lau and Di Bella (all
WHD), and Gracia (FAD) conducted the 2009 Article IV consultation discussions during
May 26–June 5. Staff met with Central Bank Governor De Gregorio, Minister of Finance
Velasco, Budget Director Arenas, other key senior officials, and representatives of the
private sector. Mr. Rojas-Olmedo (OED) participated in several meetings.



Previous consultations. There has been broad agreement between the authorities and staff
on macroeconomic policies in recent years. At the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultation
on July 11, 2008, Directors commended Chile’s adherence to a prudent, rules-based
macroeconomic policy framework, which had been instrumental for managing the copper
boom and several adverse shocks. They also noted the economy’s remarkable resilience to
the impact of global food and fuel price shocks, which have been exacerbated by domestic
energy shortfalls and a severe drought, and considered that monetary policy had been
appropriately geared to returning inflation toward the 3-percent target. Directors also
commended the government’s strict adherence to the structural fiscal surplus rule, the focus
on improving the already high quality of public spending, and the ongoing efforts to
strengthen further the management of Sovereign Wealth Funds.



Analytical work. Topics for selected issues papers were discussed with the authorities early
in the process and preliminary results were presented in a seminar hosted by the Central
Bank of Chile during the mission. The Selected Issues paper includes work on: (i) the global
financial crisis and risks in the domestic banking system; (ii) a longer-term approach to fiscal
policy; (iii) the role of new investment in machinery and equipment, and its implications for
productivity.



Exchange System. Chile has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains a free
floating exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.



Statistical Issues. Chile is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS).

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Chile’s economy is in a significantly better position than most economies to face
the global crisis. This owes much to its policy framework and track record of exemplary
policies. Large fiscal savings over the past several years have been critical to preserve
stability and cover financing needs. The imbalances in the financial and corporate sectors
witnessed elsewhere have been absent—the banking system is well-capitalized, the
supervisory framework is strong, and domestic capital markets are well-developed.
2.
The policy response also played a critical role in buffering the impact of
unprecedented global headwinds. The response has been vigorous, well balanced, and
coordinated. Macroeconomic conditions have begun to stabilize in the second quarter of
2009, and bode well for early recovery prospects. Nevertheless, economic growth
performance is expected to be less favorable than prior to the crisis, as global uncertainty still
remains high, the global recovery could be sluggish, and global trend growth prospects have
been marked down. All these factors could drag real GDP growth down in Chile in 2009–10.
Risks to inflation appear balanced and highly dependent on external developments.
3.
The global crisis may present additional challenges to the macroeconomic policy
outlook. Chile’s skillful handling of the global crisis has been reflected in a marked
appreciation of the peso in real effective terms during recent months, following the sharp
depreciation in late 2008. Nonetheless, staff estimates the real exchange rate to be broadly in
line with fundamentals. Were downside risks to materialize, further countercyclical measures
would be required—a task to be led by monetary policy, given that the scope for further
fiscal measures in 2009 is exhausted and potential challenges facing fiscal policy in 2010.
4.
Alternative means of monetary policy easing may have to be carefully
contemplated. With inflation expectations anchored around the 3 percent target, the
reduction in policy interest rates, along with measures to facilitate access to credit and
promote competition, should take increasing hold, support demand ahead and thus bring
inflation back to the target. Imparting monetary policy with more countercyclical impulse
could involve announcing a more explicit contingent commitment to maintain a low policy
interest rate for an extended period; and extending the tenor of new liquidity instruments.
Any “quantitative easing” should be limited to operations involving central bank securities.
Other forms of easing, including those involving private instruments, would entail significant
departures from the policy framework and could add credit risks to the central bank’s weak
capitalization levels.
5.
The effectiveness of additional large fiscal stimulus will need to be balanced
against the economy’s high degree of openness. Staff recognizes the extraordinary
circumstances that have contributed to a structural deficit in 2009. With global downside
risks still clouding the outlook, staff is of the view that the fiscal stimulus should not be
withdrawn too soon. The authorities could consider extending several of the measures

4
implemented in 2009 through end-2010, while also ensuring that a balanced structural target
is reinstated. Once the recovery is well entrenched, most of those measures should be
unwound and consideration should be given to specifying a structural target. While Chile is
in a privileged position to implement a strong countercyclical fiscal response, it is also
essential that this does not compromise the structural rule framework.
6.
Bringing more of a longer-term view to short-term fiscal policy formulation
would help in this regard. The structural rule has embedded fiscal policy with a mediumterm perspective, high predictability, transparency, and credibility, and should be preserved.
However, this would benefit from bringing more of a long-term view to the existing 2–3 year
fiscal policy formulation, as is done in many advanced economies.
7.
Building on the significant progress made in recent years, staff sees further
scope to deal with contingent liabilities. Staff welcomes the commitment to conduct longterm assessments of pension-related and central bank-related liabilities. Prospective budget
deficits would limit the likelihood of fully recapitalizing the BCCh. The financial condition
of some companies providing public services has deteriorated recently, and risks a potential
call on public finances. Staff commends the authorities for the strengthening of governance
and transparency in these companies and encourages them to persevere with such efforts.
8.
Within a long-term approach to fiscal policy, there is a need to continue
advancing reforms to boost per capita income growth. The cost of doing business in Chile
compares unfavorably with the average for OECD countries and there is some scope to
improve the balance between security and flexibility in the labor market.
9.
The large presence of foreign-owned banks does not pose systemic risks. A new
round of severe distress in global and some regional financial institutions—given the
interconnectedness of their exposures—could affect domestic banks’ creditworthiness. Such
risks, while manageable, could merit keeping some of the new liquidity instruments that have
helped preserve orderly conditions. By contrast, the need to implement the recommendation
of the Financial Advisory Committee to permanently expand the menu of SWF investments
to deposits in the domestic financial system seems less urgent.
10.
Credit risks to the banking system suggest contemplating some reforms,
including broadening the perimeter of regulation. Staff commends the authorities for their
sound prudential and supervisory framework. Staff’s stress tests confirm the authorities’
assessment that capital levels are adequate to withstand potential credit losses. With the full
adoption of IFRS accounting standards in January 2009, some banks that appear to have
lower provisioning levels relative to nonperforming loans are somewhat more dependent on
external financing and could be more exposed to credit risks. Given the intrinsic uncertainty
in the different models banks use to estimate provisions, it would be important to
continuously assess the effectiveness of those models and provisioning levels, while
exploring options to reduce procyclicality. It would be important to further solidify and
broaden the perimeter of regulation to nonbank entities outside the Superintendency of Banks

5
and Financial Institutions’ direct purview. Staff also commends the authorities for the
progress in advancing capital market reforms.
11.
It is expected that the next Article IV Consultation with Chile will take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.
II. THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND THE POLICY RESPONSE
12.
The 2009 Article IV Consultation provided an opportunity to take stock of the
policies implemented to safeguard the economy from the global crisis and to ensure
sustained economic success. Chile’s economic policies over the past several years have
been instrumental to face with relative more ease an exceptionally complex global
environment. This owes much to a

(Figure 1). With Presidential and
congressional elections scheduled for December 2009, there is broad recognition among
different sectors that prudent policies will be preserved and that the next administration (to
take office in March 2010) will need to advance important reforms, including to enhance the
business environment and productivity over the medium term.
The Impact of the Global Crisis: A Severe and Synchronized Contraction
13.
Being highly-integrated to the global economy, the Chilean economy was
severely affected by global trends. Chile is the most open economy in Latin America,
comparing favorably with OECD members.1 With domestic financial and capital markets
among the deepest in Latin America, the global financial turmoil manifested quickly, mostly
following the demise of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008, but the impact was less
than in other emerging markets.

The OECD Council began accession discussions with Chile in May 2007.



The external current account shifted from a surplus of 4½ percent of GDP in 2007
to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2008. This shift was led by the sharp decline in
copper prices and buoyant growth in imports, which reduced the trade balance in
2008 to roughly one-third of the US$23½ billion surplus in 2007 (Figure 2 and Table
1). The balance of payments posted a US$6½ billion surplus in 2008, as a result of
continued strong net foreign direct investment. Following a trade deficit of about
US$600 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 (driven by a 21 percent decline in the
value of exports), the trade and current account balances shifted to surpluses in the
first quarter of 2009, consistent with the sharp contraction in domestic demand.



The uncertain external environment prompted a sharp tightening in banks’ lending
conditions. Banks’ credit conditions tightened severely, partly as their funding had
become more reliant—at the margin—on external and domestic wholesale markets.
In fact, over the past two years, private pension funds’ had shifted part of their
investment portfolio to foreign assets, inducing banks to increase their external
borrowing. Banks’ default probabilities also increased, reflecting partly the domestic
presence of foreign-owned institutions, the rise in cross-border claims of creditor
countries, and an expected rise in non-performing loans due to the economic
slowdown. Bank credit growth to the private sector, particularly consumers, slowed
markedly in real terms by April 2009.

The global asset price correction led to a sharp unwinding of the past gains of
Chile’s international investment position.
The value of the assets held by institutional
investors (mostly private pension funds)
declined by about 50 percent during 2008,
mostly reflecting lower equity prices.
Private banks and corporations also faced a
deterioration in their net debtor position,
while the public sector’s (including the
central bank) creditor status improved to
US$50 billion, about 30 percent of GDP.
As a result, Chile’s net international investment position shifted to a debtor status of
US$33½ billion by end-2008, equivalent to 20 percent of GDP.

Against this backdrop, the economy experienced a sharp shift in growth
momentum. After growing at 4¼ percent on average (year-on-year) during the first three
quarters of 2008, real GDP slowed sharply to 0.2 percent (y/y) in the fourth quarter of 2008
and declined by 2.1 percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2009, led by an abrupt decline in
inventories and private fixed investment (Figure 3).
15.
Global disinflation pressures spilled rapidly onto domestic inflation. After
peaking at 9.9 percent in October, 12-month inflation decelerated to 1.9 percent by June
2009 (Figure 4).2 The disinflationary impulse associated with the global crisis was assisted by

In January 2009, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) introduced several methodological changes to the
consumer price index. These include an updated basket (based on the 2007 Household survey) that reflects a
shift in consumption toward services. The index will continue to report prices in the Santiago Metropolitan
region; however, INE expects to include regional capitals in 2010.

At the same time, the authorities adopted several countercyclical measures to
support domestic demand.


Front-loaded monetary policy easing. The BCCh shifted the stance of monetary
policy from an “easing bias” in the fourth quarter of 2008 to slashing its policy
interest rate from 8¼ percent in January 2009 to a historic low of ¾ percent by
June 2009.



Sizable fiscal stimulus. In January 2009, the government announced a stimulus
package of US$4 billion, with measures

for 2009. The measures also included the recapitalizations of state-owned Banco
Estado (announced in 2008) and Copper Corporation (CODELCO), as well as an
increase in the operational capital of Chile’s Development Agency (CORFO) and the
Insurance Fund for Small Enterprises (FOGAPE) (all amounting to about 1 percent of

GDP), to support credit to exporters and small corporations, through guarantees.
Since March, the government announced a series of initiatives to stimulate credit and
competition in the financial system, employment, and further direct support to lowincome groups (Table 9).


Fiscal savings for deficit financing. In mid-June, the authorities updated the 2009
Budget, projecting an overall deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP by end-year (compared
with a deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP expected in January). The authorities also
announced that a structural fiscal deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP would be expected in
2009, with staff estimating a fiscal impulse of about 5 percent of nonmining GDP.5
About US$10.7 billion in gross financing needs would be covered by US$8 billion
from past savings under the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (FEES) and
from issuing bonds domestically.



Policy coordination to support the
countercyclical response. To limit
the impact of the government’s
additional financing needs on longterm interest rates, the BCCh
suspended the issuance of long-term
securities (5-year and up maturities)
for the remainder of 2009 (about
US$0.7 billion are due) and would
buyback up to US$1 billion of similar
securities currently outstanding. The
BCCh would also conduct open
market operations to compensate the
monetary impact of these measures.

Domestic financial market conditions have improved considerably, with
incipient signs that the economy is bottoming out. Market interest rates have declined,
liquidity conditions—particularly in U.S. dollars—have eased and the yield curve has
steepened (Box 1). Chilean banks and corporates have been able to rollover most of their
maturing external debt with domestic debt, with the issuance of fixed-income instruments by
highly-rated corporates in domestic markets increasing markedly since October 2008, as
institutional investors have provided a stabilizing source of financing. With credit risk
diminishing, Moody’s upgraded the sovereign’s long-term foreign currency rating by one

The fiscal impulse is defined as the change in the nonmining structural balance as percent of nonmining GDP.
The nonmining structural balance is defined as nonmining structural revenues minus expenditures; nonstructural
revenues exclude all mining-related revenues and are cyclically adjusted.

III. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
19.
The short-term outlook remains uncertain, with risks largely external. Having
reached an all-time high in 2008, the share of private investment to GDP (in real terms) is
unlikely to sustain in the current global environment. Nevertheless, the current account
deficit would deteriorate to around 3 percent of GDP in 2009, owing to lower copper exports
and a sharp contraction in trading partner demand, which is particularly skewed toward the
United States, the EU, and China. Net foreign direct investment would decline from recent
highs but would still represent a high share of the current account deficit. The government’s
decision to finance the bulk of its fiscal deficit with FEES assets, along with a decline in
Chile’s risk premia relative to other economies, also bode well for financing large external
needs in 2009–10. Institutional investors have played a stabilizing role by repatriating
portfolio investment and would be expected to return to global markets gradually. Were
global financial conditions to deteriorate, the high external rollover needs of banks and
corporates (about US$30 billion) in 2009, could bring renewed pressures on credit, balance
sheets, and investment. Public and private financial assets provide a significant buffer.

20.
The economy is well placed for an early recovery, but economic growth is
expected be less favorable than previous to the crisis. Economic activity would be
expected to recover starting in the second half of 2009, reflecting the strong countercyclical
measures adopted by the authorities and the expected recovery in Chile’s main trading
partners. Staff expects real GDP growth within a -0.5 to -1 percent range for 2009 and within
a 3–4 percent range in 2010. 12-month inflation has declined sharply and is expected to
remain below the lower bound of the target range in 2009. Nevertheless, the outlook for
2009–10 remains highly dependent on the strength and speed of the global recovery, and how
this affects asset and commodity prices.
21.
Medium-term prospects remain favorable and warrant sustaining the reform
momentum. Significant private investment in recent years has enhanced potential output.
However, global trend growth prospects have been marked down considerably, which would
likely constrain investment and potential growth in the next few years (Box 2).
Notwithstanding the impact of energy shortages on overall productivity growth in recent
years, productivity has been lackluster since 1998. Therefore, it is imperative to advance
reforms to enhance the business environment and flexibilize labor markets, to improve the
contribution of productivity to medium-term per capita growth.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
22.

Discussions focused on two broad areas:



The role for macroeconomic policies in the current juncture and the risks from the
global financial deleveraging and economic contraction.



Reforms to solidify the policy framework, the financial system, and capital markets.

18
Box 2: The Global Crisis and Potential Output in Chile
The global crisis has negatively affected copper prices, as well as investment and export
prospects. These factors have been viewed as important for the determination of potential growth,
and in consequence, for estimating the output gap in Chile.
The output gap was estimated using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR). The model
includes three variables: real GDP growth, the unemployment rate and real copper prices. Potential
output, and thus the output gap, are recovered from the data using an identification procedure
similar to that used by Blanchard and Quah (1989). As output gap levels resulting from the SVAR
are sensitive to the period chosen as the base, it was assumed that the levels of effective and
potential output were similar to each other during 1994Q1, an assumption also used by the BCCh.1
The main results are as follows:

The positive output gap
(output above potential) that
had opened in 2006 seems to
have closed during 2008Q4. In
contrast, applying the HodrickPrescott filter results in a
negative output gap at end2008. With the economy
growing below potential in
2009–10, this would suggest a
negative output gap in the next
couple of years.

87Q3





The estimated potential growth rate was 4 percent, on average, since 1998. This is
consistent with a structural break that may have occurred during this year. However, recent
estimates by the BCCh using a production-function approach suggest potential growth
rates at 41 2 –5 percent prior to the crisis. Based on these estimations, staff assumes a
potential growth of 4 percent for the medium term.



Real copper prices appear to only affect the potential growth rate marginally. This is
consistent with the structural fiscal rule, which has insulated the economy from copper
price shocks. The effect of demand shocks are mostly felt during the year after impact, with
is impact lasting for about 3 years. In addition, the variance of output forecast errors is
mainly explained by domestic factors.

A. The Role for Macroeconomic Policies
Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate: Facing a Sudden and Sharp Reversal of Risks
23.
Monetary policy responded swiftly to a rapidly changing inflation outlook. With
evidence that inflation expectations were well-anchored around the target and a widening
output gap, the authorities saw plenty of scope to front-load the policy response and bring the
policy interest rate to below-neutral-levels swiftly. This was also justified by the sharp
tightening of bank lending conditions, reflecting heightened risk aversion (Box 3). The
authorities were encouraged that the transmission from the policy rate and other
“nonmonetary measures” to stabilize inflation, promote competition, and stimulate credit
were taking increasing hold on market rates and lending standards, and expected these trends
to intensify and credit growth to pick up ahead.

Box 3: Bank Lending Conditions and Monetary Policy
The tightening of global financial conditions has been reflected in a higher bank lending
spread (BLS) in Chile. This resulted in a marked increase in the cost of funding, with
implications for aggregate demand and inflation.
The Global Projection Model (GPM) was used to assess the impact of the BLS on
macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy decisions. The GPM was extended to
incorporate the BLS as a variable that provides information on factors affecting the output gap. In
general, models that incorporate the BLS tend to have better accuracy of forecasts.
The results show that:


By incorporating the BLS, monetary policy decisions could anticipate and buffer the
impact of shocks on inflation and output. The simulations confirm that in response to a
negative demand shock, expected inflation tend to decline more pronouncedly when the
BLS is factored into the model than otherwise. As a result, the central bank could
anticipate and respond more actively so as to reduce output and employment losses.



As the economy recovers and slack vanishes, risks on inflation may intensify. This
seems particularly to be the case when the changes to the policy interest rate are
proportional to the BLS shock. Adjusting the policy rate proportionately could bias the
direction of the adjustment in favor of demand shocks relative to supply shocks induced
by the higher BLS.

The authorities agreed with the assessment that the real exchange rate was close
to “equilibrium”. They recognized that such assessment was difficult to make in light of the
nature of the global shock and the potential adjustment of exchange rates for advanced
economies and commodity prices over the medium term.

26.
Going forward, the authorities were concerned about the risks of sustained
strong disinflationary pressures. They expect sustained disinflation to continue for the next
six months—with 12-month inflation envisaged to approach zero by end-year. With the
policy rate close to its effective lower bound and continued external risks, they felt that
ensuring that inflation would return to the 3 percent target over the 24-month horizon could
prove potentially challenging, as additional budgetary financing needs could impart further
disinflationary pressures, including through an exchange rate appreciation. The authorities
were confident that a well-functioning credit market, the strong and preemptive policy
response thus far and the credibility of the inflation target would be conducive towards to
ensuring a return to the 3 percent inflation target over the 2-year horizon.
27.
While the policy framework has worked well in stabilizing the economy, the
authorities and staff agreed that some alternative means of easing may be needed in the
event disinflationary pressures were more severe and protracted. The authorities noted
that one possibility would be to announce a more explicit contingent commitment to maintain
a path for the policy interest rate for an extended period, and staff pointed out that other
options could be to extend the tenor of new liquidity instruments and to incorporate them to
the policy framework permanently. The authorities noted that these measures could be
supported by additional buybacks involving BCCh securities to affect long-term interest
rates. Staff noted that other forms of easing, including by broadening the instruments that
qualify for outright purchase, would entail a significant departure from the policy framework
and could add credit risks to the BCCh’s weak capitalization levels.6 The authorities agreed
but noted that in light of the extraordinary circumstances and lingering risks, they would not
rule out any options.

6

The BCCh Organic Law (article 36) allows for the purchase of banks’ loans or investments for up to 90 days;
which could be extended with full majority of the BCCh Board and subject to a previous assessment of the
banks made by the SBIF.

22
Fiscal Policy: Imparting a Stronger Countercyclical Stance
28.
The authorities stressed that fiscal policy had to take a leading role in stabilizing
the economy in 2009. They felt it was important for the countercyclical fiscal measures to be
large enough to signal Chile’s strong capacity to buffer the impact of the global shock on the
economy and to be readily implemented. The authorities also noted that public spending
would rise by 14½ percent in real terms in 2009 and stressed that the stimulus was comprised
of transitory measures, which minimized long-term fiscal costs. With low public sector debt,
a broad-mix of spending and tax measures, and the financing provided by past savings under
the FEES, they were confident about the effectiveness of countercyclical fiscal policy in
stabilizing the economy and supporting an early recovery in activity.
29.
The need to impart fiscal policy with more countercyclical impulse and a largerthan-expected decline in nonmining tax revenue is expected to bring the structural
balance into deficit. The authorities

that the fiscal impulse in train was quite significant and that its effectiveness had to be
balanced against the economy’s high openness. Mindful of the limits to active stabilization
policies, the authorities did not envisage further fiscal measures, as many had been calibrated
to be effectively implemented later this year and even through 2010.
30.
Potential challenges to fiscal policy in 2010 limit the scope for sustaining a large
fiscal impulse. Structural revenues could be constrained by a lower long-term price of
copper, which together with the temporary tax reductions made in 2009, could constrain
public spending and force a more permanent reduction in the structural surplus target. The
authorities recognized the uncertainties and challenges facing fiscal policy in 2010,
particularly for copper prices and had yet to assess the outlook for the 2010 Budget.
Nonetheless, they emphasized the importance of preserving the structural rule as an anchor,
7

The authorities have updated the elasticities of nonmining tax revenues to GDP to better reflect structural
changes in the economy and tax reforms since 2001, the year in which these elasticities were based. These
changes provide an additional ½ percent of GDP in structural revenues for 2009. Other methodological changes,
including to add a cyclical component to public spending, are likely to be introduced with the 2010 budget.

23
particularly when its credibility and acceptance have been strengthened with the downturn.
They also noted the broad recognition that there would be no scope for sustaining the high
public spending growth of recent years. Staff noted that in light of the risks facing the
economy, it would also be important to consider not withdrawing the fiscal stimulus too
soon. Several of the transitory measures implemented in 2009 could be extended—most
notably the reduction in the stamp tax, while also bringing the structural target back to
balance. Staff stressed the importance that the 2010 Budget be presented with a balanced
target and that the merits of reinstating the ½ percent of GDP surplus target be reassessed, as
global economic and domestic conditions normalize.
B. The Reforms to Solidify the Policy Framework, the Financial System
and Capital Markets
Fiscal Framework: Extending the Horizon of Policy Formulation
31.
There is a good opportunity to bring more of a medium-term view to fiscal
policy formulation, in line with best international practice. The authorities and staff
agreed that the structural surplus rule has been critical in embedding fiscal policy with a
medium-term perspective—based on assumptions for the

the existing 2–3 year horizon for planning and executing
fiscal policy. Staff noted that such approach would strengthen the emphasis on demographic
and productivity factors, by assessing the growth in public per capita spending relative to
income per capita, and its implications for net public assets.
32.
Such an approach would help better integrate the target for the structural rule
and the net asset position, with the path of contingent and other fiscal liabilities. The
authorities noted that significant progress has been made in identifying and quantifying
contingent fiscal liabilities and some medium- and long-term social spending commitments,
and viewed their outlook as manageable. They agreed that there was scope to extend the

24
framework; indeed they have recently established a division in the Budget Planning
Department (DIPRES) to look into medium and long-term fiscal pressures on health,
education, and pension-related spending. Staff agreed that the outlook for contingent
liabilities appeared manageable, but noted that under certain plausible long-term scenarios,
the path for public spending could significantly exceed those associated with different targets
for the structural rule and entail a significant deterioration in the government’s net asset
position. Staff noted that it would be important to continue advancing reforms to minimize
the following risks:


Despite significant progress in recent years, the BCCh remains undercapitalized.
By end-2008, the government has retired all its outstanding debt with the BCCh and
has made three capital injections totaling US$2.1 billion during 2006–08. This, along
with the depreciation of the peso in

a permanent basis, and with budget
deficits envisaged for 2009-10, the prospect for further capital injections were
unlikely to be met.9 The authorities emphasized that the recent crisis confirmed the
BCCh’s ability to deal with difficult conditions despite its lack of capital, but
acknowledged the importance of full recapitalization and have begun preparations for
an analysis of the impact of recapitalization transfers on the BCCh’s balance sheet
over a 20-year period, in line with commitments under the Fiscal Responsibility Law
(FRL), results which they expected to have before end-2009.10

policy framework has been important in effectively managing market-related risks,
investment, and indebtedness by PSEs, most of which are supervised by the System of

Under the FRL, enacted in 2006, annual transfers to the BCCh cannot exceed ½ percent of the previous year
GDP (after subtracting from the budget surplus the contribution to the Pension Reserve Fund, which should be
no less than 0.2 percent of the previous year GDP and up to ½ percent of the previous year GDP).
Recapitalization transfers to the BCCh can be done for five years.
10

An October 2008 working paper by BCCh staff suggests that, based on stochastic simulations for key
macroeconomic variables, there is a high probability that its net worth would continue to deteriorate over the
next 25 years. The probability of further deterioration would be lower conditioned on a slowdown in reserves
accumulation, on capital set in real rather than nominal terms, and accrued exchange-rate related profits not
distributed.

25
Public Enterprises (SEP). The authorities submitted to Congress in 2008 proposals to
strengthen the corporate governance of CODELCO and other PSEs. While PSEs net
public debt stood at only 6¼ percent of GDP at end-2008, several large PSEs have
recently faced deteriorating financial conditions, risking a potential call on public
finances for recapitalization or debt guarantees. In addition, the authorities explained
that the privately-run public bus system (TranSantiago) has continued to experience
losses and could require direct and permanent budget support from 2010 on. Staff
encouraged the authorities to evaluate options for improving their financial condition;
including by presenting their current and projected balances in the Informe Anual de
Finanzas Publicas. The authorities explained that several of these PSEs have been
subject to restructuring plans, including the replacement of their management, and
that the recent enactment of the Transparency Law would support efforts to
strengthen their governance. They also noted that efforts would remain geared toward
strengthening their governance in line with the proposed framework for CODELCO
and a recent proposal to broaden the scope of companies under the SEP.
33.
A longer-term approach to fiscal policy would also help sustain the focus on
reforms to boost per capita income growth. Certain indicators—such as for starting and
closing businesses—suggest that the

focused on simplifying regulatory

the balance between security and flexibility in the labor market. The authorities explained
that several reform proposals by the Meller Commission had been implemented, including to
improve in-work benefits, child benefits, and job-related training; as well as to extend the
coverage and benefits of the unemployment insurance scheme. The authorities and staff
agreed that future efforts could focus on further promoting formal employment, by
introducing reforms to the unemployment insurance system that help lower severance
payments, as well as by easing some restrictions on contracts.

The global financial turmoil and fiscal risks also underscore the need to continue
strengthening the framework for Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). Chile’s SWFs
continue to rank among the most transparent, and significant progress has been made in
establishing generally accepted principles and practices (the “Santiago principles”) and in
designing a long-term strategic asset allocation, with technical assistance from MCM. The
authorities explained that the decision to postpone the shift in the portfolio structure toward
equities and corporate fixed-income securities was justified by current global conditions and

35.
With prospective budget deficits for 2009–10, staff noted that government assets
could diminish in the years ahead. The authorities stressed that using FEES assets to
finance deficits was critical to legitimize the structural rule framework and felt that there
would be plenty of room to finance deficits comfortably, including through debt issuance. It
was agreed that there was a good opportunity to continue to work toward embedding
investment objectives and projected path for the FEES within a long-term fiscal framework.

The Banking System: Solid but Facing Credit Risks

change in funding associated with pension funds’ reallocation of investments abroad, banks
have been gradually increasing their share of foreign borrowing, including long-term and for
financing external trade operations.
37.
The authorities viewed the presence of foreign-owned banks posing no systemic
risks. Senior officials from the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF)
noted that while foreign banks represented more than half of the banking system’s assets and
liabilities, several risks were contained by the prudent regulatory and supervisory
framework.11 For example, most foreign banks are subsidiaries and the largest (foreignowned) bank was required to keep a capital-to-asset ratio in excess of 11 percent (instead of
8 percent, as most other banks). Most banks had a long-standing presence in Chile and a
stable deposit base. They also noted that the share of external funding was, on average, less
than 10 percent of liabilities, and banks’ faced limited currency-related risk.

11

Long-term debt ratings of Chilean banks range from BBB+ to A+, according to FitchRatings; and foreign
currency deposits are rated A1 by Moody’s. Fitch’s October 2008 Bank Systemic Risk Report, assessed the
system’s vulnerability to macroeconomic risk as low, with its intrinsic quality—which is derived from Fitch’s
individual bank ratings—also low and similar to Canada.

28

traditionally provided liquidity in
foreign currency and market-making capabilities for derivatives, stressing that several of the
measures recently implemented had successfully contained such risks. The SBIF had been
actively monitoring potentially exposed domestic institutions closely, including through the
provisions provided by memoranda of understanding with foreign supervisors.
39.
The authorities foresaw rising credit risks for the banking system. Credit risk
indicators for households and corporates were expected to continue deteriorating, partly
reflecting rising unemployment and weaker profitability. Stress tests conducted by the BCCh
show the banking system would face losses associated with credit risk in the range of
1-8 percent of capital, and of 2 percent of capital for market risk.12 With the full adoption of
IFRS in 2009, some domestic banks have lower provisioning levels relative to their
nonperforming loans, which also tend to be more dependent on external financing and could
be more exposed to credit risks, with adverse implications for capital requirements.13 The
authorities viewed these risks as minimal—there was no evidence of segmentation in the
domestic market and some external borrowing was long-term in nature. They also noted that
the state-owned Banco Estado was recently recapitalized, that many private banks had

12

These estimates were published in the January 2009 Financial Stability Report, based on end-September 2008
data and assuming alternative macroeconomic scenarios to those published in the January 2009 Monetary
Policy Report. In the July 2009 Financial Stability Report, the authorities presented new estimates, which
disentangle the losses due to increased provisions from the lower earnings associated with lower bank credit
levels as a result of the crisis. As a resut, the sum of these losses remain within a 2¾-8¼ percent of capital.

13

Provisions are determined based on expected credit losses, with banks relying on their own models that are
approved by the SBIF. Expected losses tend to be low for loans with guarantees, such as mortgages, for which
required provisions tend to be less. Nonperforming loans, as defined by IFRS standards, do not account for the
existence of guarantees or loan-recovery mechanisms.

There has been continued progress in strengthening the prudential and
supervisory framework.


Adoption of IFRS and progress toward Basel II. Starting in January 2009, IFRS
accounting standards are in full force for banks, particularly regarding the valuation
of assets and liabilities, and the definition of nonperforming loans. On Basel II, the
authorities have finalized the draft amendment to the General Banking Law and
expect to proceed with such reform during 2009-10. With the intrinsic uncertainty in
the different models bank use to estimate provisions, staff encouraged the authorities
to continue assessing provisioning levels and the effectiveness of their underlying
models, while exploring options to reduce procyclicality, such as by introducing
“dynamic provisioning.”



Improved coordination among supervisory agencies. The Committee of
Superintendents has agreed to prepare a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen
coordination, as well as risk-based and consolidated supervision, particularly for
domestic conglomerates. The Committee has begun to discuss implications from
work undertaken by the regulatory agencies (such as the Superintendency of
Securities, SVS) to better understand ownership and financial linkages among
domestic conglomerates. In this regard, the SVS has finalized a draft framework to
implement a risk-based supervision framework for the insurance sector.



Perimeter of regulation. SBIF senior officials agreed with the importance of
broadening the perimeter of regulation to bring several nonbank entities that have
been expanding their lending operations under the direct purview of the SBIF in order
to minimize systemic risks. It was agreed that this could be an area to assess during
an FSAP update in 2010.

30
Capital Markets: Promoting Competition and Accountability
41.
The authorities stressed that the ongoing implementation of the pension reform
had been timely in dealing with the risks posed by the global turmoil. Pension fund
reform gives more flexibility to pension funds’ and contributors’ investment decisions, while
strengthening oversight and accountability. Investment limits have been relaxed, including
for investable securities. Pension funds are required to submit investment guidelines to the
Superintendency of Pensions, which will be overseen by the newly established Technical
Investment Board (CIT). Similarly, contributors can now switch investment funds provided
they acknowledge the risks embedded in their chosen fund. To that end, pension funds need
to provide additional information about the funds’ risks.
42.
The authorities advanced important capital market reforms envisaged under the
MKIII reform that help support the countercyclical policy response. New tax rules
facilitate foreign investor participation in local fixed-income markets. Credit to SMEs could
benefit from measures allowing high-yield investments by pension funds and the extension of
CORFO’s partial guarantees for SME-related securitization. Insurance companies are now
allowed to lend to individuals or corporations, as well as to participate in non-related
syndicated bank lending up to certain specified limits. The authorities continued to work
toward increasing domestic liquidity by allowing the participation of pension funds in repo
operations.

ANNEX CHILE—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Chile improved its net public creditor position in 2008. Gross public sector debt fell to
5 percent of GDP in 2008, and public sector assets held in the wealth funds increased to
16 percent of GDP.
Due to Chile’s large public sector assets, the sustainability of public sector debt is not an
issue. Notwithstanding the current financial crises, the structural surplus rule has resulted in
large fiscal savings over the past several years of high copper prices that have helped build
important buffers, thus ensuring financing needs. Additional financing needs stemming from
a worse macroeconomic outlook could be covered by the country’s Fund for Economic and
Social Stabilization as these extrapolate measures that are transitory in nature (like one-off
direct transfers and subsidies to low-income families, and housing) or that accelerate the
implementation of reforms (like pension reform). Public debt would be sensitive to a large
depreciation of the peso but is projected level would still remain low.
The dynamics of Chile’s external debt are relatively stable to shocks. Total external debt
increased to 38 percent in 2008 from 34 percent in 2007. FDI flows and substantial
withdrawals from the country’s sovereign wealth fund are expected to account for a
substantial proportion of necessary financing of the projected current account deficits in
2009. Debt levels are not unduly responsive to growth or interest-rate shocks, but are
somewhat sensitive to a depreciation of the peso, as all of Chile’s external debt is
denominated in foreign currency.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Chile
July 22, 2009
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
In its July 9 policy meeting, the Central Bank of Chile (BCCh) lowered its policy
interest rate and adopted alternative means of monetary policy easing. The BCCh
reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points, to ½ percent, and noted that it would leave the
policy rate at this level for a prolonged period of time to support inflation returning to the
3 percent target over the policy horizon. The BCCh also announced complementary measures
to better align market rates with the policy rate; including the establishment of a short-term
liquidity facility to allow borrowing by banks at the policy rate for 90-180 days; the
adjustment of the issuance of short-term bank notes to preserve its consistency with the new
liquidity facility, and the suspension of the previously planned issuances of 1-year notes and
2-year nominal bonds for the remainder of 2009. As a result of these measures, interbank
interest rates for up to 180 days have converged to the policy interest rate and yields for
BCCh bonds have declined.
3.
There has been progress in advancing the agenda for strengthening corporate
governance in public sector enterprises and for improving coordination among
supervisory agencies. The reform project for improving CODELCO’s corporate governance
is in its final stages of approval by the Senate. On July 7, the Superintendency of Banks and
Financial Institutions announced that the Committee of Superintendents had signed an MOU
to strengthen coordination among the supervisory agencies overseeing financial institutions,
pension funds, and securities markets.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On July 22, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
1
Article IV consultation with Chile.

Background
The Chilean economy has proved resilient in the face of the global financial crisis. The sound
policy framework, underpinned by an inflation target regime, a structural budget rule, and a flexible
exchange rate, allowed the economy to enter the crisis with a fundamentally robust position. Large
fiscal savings accumulated in past years have been critical to preserve stability and cover financing
needs, while the imbalances in the financial and corporate sectors witnessed elsewhere have been
absent.
Being highly integrated to the global economy, the global crisis transmitted quickly through trade
and financial linkages. Real GDP slowed markedly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and contracted in
the first quarter of 2009. Inflationary pressures eased considerably due to the weak domestic
demand and the decline in food and energy prices, with the 12-month inflation rate falling from
9.9 percent in October 2008 to 2 percent by June 2009. Weak demand from main trading partners
and lower copper prices resulted in an external current account deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2008.
However, the sharp compression of imports that accompanied the decline in domestic demand,
shifted the current account into a projected surplus in 2009.
The policy response to the crisis has been sizable, well balanced and coordinated. Liquidity
support measures have helped preserve financial stability. Since early 2009, the Central Bank of
Chile cut the policy rate by 775 basis points, to an historic low of ½ percent, and the government

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

announced a stimulus package of 2.9 percent of GDP comprising higher public investment,
transitory tax reductions and direct transfers and subsidies to low income households. In July, the
Central Bank of Chile announced complementary measures to better align market rates with the
policy rate; including the establishment of a liquidity facility at the monetary policy rate with tenors
of up to six months; adjustments to the issuance of short-term central bank notes to ensure
consistency with the new liquidity facility; and the suspension for the remainder of 2009 of the
previously-planned issuances of 1-year notes and 2-year nominal bonds.
The government also adopted additional measures to foster employment and credit, and promote
competition in the financial system. Fiscal measures are to be financed through the issuance of
new government debt and with resources from the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund. The
central bank has adjusted its debt management program for 2009 to offset any impact of the
government’s additional financing needs. The government also has advanced structural reforms in
the financial sector and domestic capital markets to strengthen the supervisory framework, as well
as to bring forward the implementation of the reform of the pension system.
The 2009-10 outlook remains highly dependent on the external environment, in particular the
speed of the global recovery and its impact on commodity prices. A further deterioration of global
conditions would impinge on the pace of the domestic recovery and affect expectations on growth
and income prospects in the near term. Nevertheless, the Chilean economy is well placed for an
early return to sustained growth on the heels of the strong countercylical measures adopted by the
authorities and the expected recovery of its main trading partners.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Chilean authorities for their sound policy framework
underpinned by an inflation target regime, a structural budget rule, and a flexible exchange rate
regime. As a result of this strong framework and the authorities’ track record of exemplary policies,
Chile’s economy is well placed to face the global crisis, which has caused a sharp deterioration in
economic performance since the last quarter of 2008. Directors welcomed the authorities’ vigorous,
well balanced, and coordinated policy response, which they viewed as critical for preserving
financial and macroeconomic stability. While macroeconomic conditions have begun to stabilize in
the second quarter of 2009, Directors noted that Chile’s near-term growth prospects are affected
by the high uncertainty surrounding the timing and pace of the global recovery.
Directors endorsed the Central Bank of Chile’s decision to implement alternative means of
monetary easing to support activity and a return of inflation to the target, noting the staff’s
assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Directors welcomed the countercyclical fiscal stimulus, and recommended caution when deciding
to withdraw such stimulus, encouraging the authorities to consider extending several revenue
measures through end-2010, if needed. Once the recovery is well entrenched, Directors saw scope
for unwinding those measures and specifying a structural target to preserve fiscal credibility and
address long-term fiscal pressures.

3
Directors encouraged the authorities to consider extending the horizon for fiscal policy formulation
and focusing on the level and growth in public per capita spending relative to income per capita,
and its implications for net public assets. They commended the authorities for the significant
progress in dealing with contingent liabilities, and welcomed their commitment to assess the fiscal
impact of long-term liabilities related to pensions and central bank recapitalization, as prescribed
by the Fiscal Responsibility Law. Directors encouraged the authorities to sustain reforms to lower
the cost of doing business and to further promote formal employment.
Directors praised the authorities for their sound prudential and supervisory framework and for the
progress in advancing reforms to deepen domestic capital markets. They noted that Chile’s capital
markets have been a resilient source of corporate financing during the global crisis, and welcomed
efforts aimed at facilitating foreign participation and market access for small and medium-sized
firms. Directors suggested that the authorities consider keeping some new liquidity instruments and
facilities even after the turbulence subsides. With credit risks expected to rise, Directors
recommended that the authorities continue assessing the effectiveness of the models banks use to
determine provisioning levels, and explore options to reduce their procyclicality. They also
encouraged the authorities to consider broadening the perimeter of regulation to non-bank
institutions outside the direct purview of the supervisory authorities.

Statement by Pablo Pereira, Executive Director for Chile and
Alvaro Rojas, Advisor to Executive Director
July 22, 2009
1.
Our authorities would like to thank the staff for the Staff Report and Selected Issues
papers and for the thorough discussions on the impact of the international crisis on the
Chilean economy, as well as on the policy responses to mitigate its impact on domestic and
external stability. Such discussions were undertaken in a collaborative dialogue with the
Fund, which became even more relevant given the current global crisis, and reflect the
permanent dialogue on policy issues that has characterized the relationship between Chile
and the Fund. Given the high degree of integration of the Chilean economy with the world,
the marked global downturn of the last quarter of 2008 had a direct impact, changing rapidly
the outlook on domestic economic activity, employment, and inflation. However, given the
changes in the outlook stemming from these shocks, Chile’s rules-based policy framework
has been instrumental. It has provided high flexibility in terms of the significant policy
responses undertaken by our authorities to mitigate the impact of the global crisis, so as to
secure domestic and external stability under exceptionally uncertain times.
Impact of the Global Crisis
2.
In 2008, Chile’s output grew 3.2 percent, below potential output. The pace over the
year showed the sharp impact on confidence of the changing global conditions. During the
fourth quarter of 2008, the economy showed a sharp slump, driven by the impact on
expectations and confidence of the drastic worsening of the global scenario. Thus, inventory
accumulation, house sales, and imports of durables all fell sharply. The tightening of credit
conditions and postponements of investment projects affected industrial output and
construction (although this sector has been less affected by the crisis than in previous
episodes), while lower oil prices and improved hydrological conditions provided some cost
relief in terms of energy costs. During the first quarter of 2009, economic activity remained
contracting, and preliminary data on the second quarter confirms a moderate contraction in
output for the first half of 2009. In line with these developments, unemployment has recently
risen slightly above 10 percent due mostly to a significant contraction in employment since
the fourth quarter of 2008.
3.
In light of these developments, the Banco Central de Chile’s (BCC) output growth
forecast for 2009 was recently decreased to a range between -0.75 to 0.25 percent, with the
balance of risks tilted to the downside. Thus, this downward revision shows the
materialization of downside risks, due to a worsening external environment stemming from
the recession in the world economy as well as the unresolved complications from the
financial crisis and the remaining uncertainties associated with it. The main downside risks
are related to the contraction in global growth and how it will impact emerging economies,
which include the size and extension of the recession in the U.S. and other trading partners,

the possibility of new, unfavorable, shifts in the prices of copper and/or oil, as well as
protracted global uncertainty and lack of confidence.
4.
Over most of 2008, annual CPI inflation increased steadily, reaching a peak of 9.9
percent in October. However, the marked and synchronized downturn in the world economy
during the fourth quarter triggered a significant shift in the inflation path, characterized by a
rapid and steady decline. As a result, inflation decelerated rapidly, and it reached the 3
percent target much earlier than initially envisaged. Given that the output gap is expected to
remain negative for some time as potential output is estimated by the Central Bank to be in a
range of 4.5 to 5 percent, CPI inflation is expected to remain below the target range in the
second half of 2009, converging back to 3 percent by 2010. In line with these developments,
the BCC revised downward its inflation forecast to 0.6 percent for year on year inflation by
end December 2009, and to 2.3 percent for average inflation in 2009.
5.
Given the impact of the global crisis on the Chilean economy as described above, our
authorities have undertaken significant and decisive policy responses in terms of monetary
policy, fiscal policy, as well as policies to sustain the flow of credit to businesses and
individuals in the downturn of the cycle, in order to mitigate as much as possible the direct
impact of the global downturn. These policy responses have been possible due to the
prevailing sound policy frameworks, which have been instrumental in providing the adequate
setup to implement monetary and fiscal stimulus when needed in order to confront the worst
global downturn in decades.
Monetary Policy
6.
The change in the expected path for inflation, with a much faster convergence
towards the target, warranted a shift in monetary policy towards an easing of the monetary
policy stance. Therefore, since January of 2009, the Central Bank has aggressively lowered
the monetary policy interest rate, with marked reductions in January (100 basis points),
February and March (250 basis points each month), and more gradual reductions since April.
In the latest meeting of the BCC’s Monetary Policy Meeting in July, the BCC lowered the
monetary policy rate by an additional 25 basis points, thus lowering the policy rate by a
cumulative 775 basis points, bringing it to a level of 0.5 percent in July of 2009. Such
aggressive monetary stimulus is unprecedented under the existing inflation targeting
framework in terms of both the speed of adjustment and the level of the policy rates. It also
reflects the authorities’ views that a sizeable monetary stimulus was needed to secure the
attainment of the inflation target over the policy horizon.
7.
During its Monetary Policy Meeting in July, the BCC also noted in its communiqué
that the level of 0.5 percent for the monetary policy rate should be considered the lower
bound for the policy rate, and highlighted that given the inflation forecast and the need to
maintain monetary stimulus for some time, the policy rate will remain at this lower bound for
an extended period of time. In order to reinforce this decision, and to enhance the alignment

of the prices of financial assets with the current monetary policy stance, the BCC announced
the introduction a new liquidity facility, the Term Liquidity Facility (TLF) to provide
liquidity to banks at the current policy rate for terms of 90 and 180 days. The purpose of this
new facility is to effectively extend the current monetary stance throughout the yield curve
up to 6 months. The collateral required for this type of operations is the same as those used
for the use of the overnight liquidity facility. In addition to the TLF, the BCC also
announced an adjustment to the issuance of its short-term notes with a maturity of less than 1
year, and to suspend the issuance of bonds with a maturity of 1 year or more. The BCC also
noted that these measures will remain in place as long as needed, and will remain vigilant by
evaluating on a permanent basis the need of other complementary measures.
Fiscal Policy
8.
In line with the implementation of the structural budget rule and due to continuing
high copper prices during most of 2008, the Chilean central government posted an overall
surplus of 5.2 percent of GDP in 2008, with a real decrease of 8.1 percent in revenues, while
public expenditure grew 7.8 percent in real terms in the same period. In order to manage
windfall revenues prudently and in consistence with the Fiscal Responsibility Law, the
Chilean government continued saving the surpluses into the Economic and Social
Stabilization Fund (ESSF), which as of December 2008 had accumulated USD 20.2 billion.
Surpluses have also been saved into the Pension Reserve Fund, in the amount of USD 2.5
billion. The government initially submitted the 2009 budget to Congress, which provided for
public expenditure growth of 5.7 percent in real terms, a slower pace relative to recent years,
but effectively increasing social spending in health, education, innovation, and social
housing, strongly focusing on the execution and quality of public expenditure.
9.
Nevertheless, given the significant change in the macroeconomic conditions in the
fourth quarter of 2008, the government implemented decisive countercyclical policy
responses involving fiscal policy in three fronts: a Fiscal Stimulus Plan to support economic
activity and employment; a Pro-Credit Plan to secure the flow of credit to businesses and
individuals in the lower phase of the economic cycle; and, the Pro-employment Employment
Accord to mitigate the impact of the cycle on employment. The Fiscal Stimulus Plan was
announced in early January, with a size equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP (USD 4 billion)
with the purpose of supporting economic activity and employment. The plan included direct
transfers to families and individuals, an increase in public investment of up to USD 700
million, recapitalization of Codelco by USD 1 billion to support its investment plan, tax
reductions and other incentives for private investment, strengthening small and medium
enterprise access to funding, and measures to protect employment. Such increase in
spending stems from larger structural income, derived from the exchange depreciation
relative to the level envisaged originally in the Budget and from a reduction on a temporary
basis in the structural surplus target from 0.5 percent of GDP to 0 percent of GDP.

10.
The Pro-Credit Plan was announced in March of 2009. It included twenty measures
to stimulate the provision of credit by banks as well as non-banking financial institutions, to
promote competition in the financial system, and to widen the scope of available funding
alternatives. The pro-credit plan involves three broad dimensions: support to microentrepreneurs; measures to facilitate access to bank funding, and measures to facilitate access
to non-bank funding. The overall impact of the pro-credit plan was to generate an additional
USD 3.6 billion in new credit to the private sector. This plan complements the fiscal
stimulus plan announced in early January. This plan also complements other previous
measures taken by the government to secure the flow of credit given the downturn in the
cycle. In order to enhance access to credit for businesses and individuals, in December of
2008, the government increased the capital of Banco Estado, the state-owned bank, with a
USD 500 million injection to spur lending to small and medium sized enterprises by up to
USD 2.6 billion, and also increased the Small Enterprise Guarantee Fund by USD 130
million, to a total of USD 200 million.
11.
The Pro-Employment Accord is a tri-partite temporary agreement between
employers, employees and the government which translates into six specific measures that
would benefit a total of 130.000 workers. The first measure is a transitory tax incentive for
the retention of workers and for the improvement of their work skills; the second is the
establishment of a leave of absence for up to 5 months for the improvement of work skills,
where the employee would receive 50 percent of his salary during the leave of absence, and
be rehired with a greater set of skills; the third measure consists of an increase in the subsidy
for the improvement of working skills for those businesses that are actively increasing hiring
of new personnel; the fourth measure includes the establishment of a scholarship for working
women who are heads of a household with the purpose of stimulating self-employment
through small and micro enterprises; the fifth measure consists of the establishment of
program of previous learning recognition which would certify the level of skill of a worker
through a standardized and common evaluation; and the final measure protects family
income, if the head of the household losses his or her job by enhancing the access to the
Unemployment Solidarity Fund for employees with temporary contracts. This program
benefits the employers as it increases the productivity of its employees, alleviates the cost of
firing and the adjustment cost once the recovery is in place, and also the employees, as they
increase their human capital, allowing for better expectations in terms of wages and better
skills to improve the chances of finding a job. All the measures included in the Accord were
approved by Congress in record time.
12.
In addition to the measures described above, in her annual address to Congress on
May 21, President Bachelet announced an additional transfer to four million low-income
households, bringing forward the benefits of the Pension Reform, the establishment of an
insurance plan to cover the mortgage payments of those families whose heads of household
loses his or her job, and the expansion of the New Millennium Scholarship Program. All of
these measures implied an additional government spending of USD 330 million in 2009.

13.
Given the size and scope of the countercyclical fiscal policy measures, public
expenditure is expected to grow 14.5 percent in real terms. This represents an increase with
respect to what was initially projected in the Budget Law (5.7 percent), and 5.0 percent is due
to increased spending committed in the Fiscal Plan of January; 0.9 percent corresponds to
additional spending committed in the Pro-Credit Plan, the Pro-Employment Accord and May
21 announcements; 2.9 percent is due to the drop in average 2009 inflation projected for
2009, which was estimated at 5.2 percent in January and is now only expected to reach to 2.3
percent. Therefore, a fiscal deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP is projected for 2009. This is 1.2
percentage points higher than what was projected in January. The difference in projection is
broken down into 0.2 percent of GDP of increased spending and 1.0 percent of GDP of lower
revenues. Such deficit is the natural outcome of the decisive countercyclical fiscal policy,
whose very own definition is to incur deficits during years of contraction of the global
economy and to accumulate surpluses in years of boom.
14.
Having saved the surpluses derived from the windfall gains in the price of copper of
previous years, the Sovereign Wealth Funds has provided plenty of fiscal room for the
government to implement countercyclical fiscal policy under current circumstances, as
funding of the fiscal stimulus plan will come from the Economic and Social Stabilization
Fund. Therefore, the government announced initially that it would withdraw an equivalent of
USD 4 billion from the ESSF, of which USD 1 billion will finance investment and
expenditure directly in USD, while the other USD 3 billion will finance investment and
expenditure in local currency (pesos). In order to conduct the foreign exchange operation,
the Ministry of Finance instructed the Central Bank, as a Fiscal Agent, to conduct a program
of competitive bids for the sale of USD 50 million on a daily basis since March 27, 2009. By
mid-June, the government announced its financing strategy for the rest of 2009, which would
include and additional withdrawal of USD 4 billion from the ESSF, to be sold through the
Fiscal Agent through competitive bids for the sale of USD 40 million on a daily basis starting
in July 1, 2009, and the issuance of USD 1.7 billion in the 5-year and 10-year domestic bond
markets. We highlight that the issuance of the bond markets was coordinated directly with
the Central Bank, so as to avoid any disruption in the 5 and 10-year segments of the yield
curve.
15.
Our authorities would like to reiterate that the significant fiscal stimulus undertaken
for this year has been possible due to the existence of the structural fiscal rule which has been
instrumental in providing plenty of fiscal space to the authorities to conduct countercyclical
fiscal policy, while also providing a clear and credible anchor for fiscal policy over the
medium term. As such, Chile’s fiscal rule has proven to be a fundamental pillar of the
existing macroeconomic framework to secure domestic and external stability. In fact, the
financial position of the government will remain sound even after factoring in the significant
fiscal stimulus undertaken in 2009, and such strong fiscal financial position will be the
legacy of this administration based on the implementation of the fiscal rule.

Financial Sector
16.
Chile’s sound regulatory framework has contributed to securing the stability of the
financial system, and, therefore, insulating the domestic market from the global turmoil. The
financial sector has continued to perform well during the crisis, with the banks adequately
capitalized so as to withstand potential credit losses stemming from the downturn. The latest
available survey of the Central Bank on the overall situation of banking credit up to June
2009 indicates that the number of banks reporting more restrictive credit conditions has been
reduced for two consecutive quarters, thus suggesting a sustained improvement in the supply
of credit to the economy. In line with this development, the survey shows a marked rebound
in the demand of credit by businesses and individuals. Therefore, the flow of credit is on its
way to the pre-crisis levels.
17.
Our authorities’ views are that Chile’s regulatory framework has proven to be
effective in securing financial stability against the backdrop of the global financial turmoil
and the global downturn resulting from it. Therefore, improvements to the framework should
be considered as enhancements to an already sound regulatory framework, in line with what
could be considered best practice in terms of regulation. In particular, the issue of expanding
the perimeter of regulation is an issue that our authorities might consider as potentially
relevant for the FSAP Update which will be conducted in 2010, and should not be considered
as a necessary modification to the framework to enhance the framework’s capacity to deal
with potential credit risks, as suggested by the staff. Moreover, steps in the improvement of
coordination among regulators have already been taken, as a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) was signed in late June by the members of the Committee of Superintendents, which
includes the banking, pensions, and securities supervisors, in order to formalize the
cooperation and coordination channels between them.
Conclusion
18.
In light of the unprecedented external shocks stemming from the global downturn,
coupled with financial turmoil, our Chilean authorities took decisive and unprecedented
policy measures in order to mitigate as much as possible the impact of the crisis on Chile’s
domestic and external stability, as growth is expected to resume in the second half of 2009 in
response to the stimulus already underway. Chile’s sound rules-based policy framework has
provided enough flexibility in terms of monetary and fiscal policy to respond to these shocks,
as it has been recognized by the credit rating agencies, as Chile was recently upgraded by
Moody’s to A1 from A2, based on the solid fundamentals of its fiscal budget, low debt, and
strong macroeconomic management.
