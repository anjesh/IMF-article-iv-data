EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
India’s dream run of strong growth and macroeconomic stability is a tribute to its
sound macroeconomic policies and past structural reforms. The economy expanded at an
average rate of about 8½ percent for four years running, on the back of rising productivity
and investment. After rising sharply in early 2007, inflation has ebbed, and the current
account deficit is moderate. India’s bright prospects have attracted record capital inflows
amidst heightened global uncertainties and slowing U.S. growth.
Swelling capital inflows have highlighted the key policy challenges: managing financial
globalization and tackling the supply constraints to growth.
•

Large capital inflows are exacerbating tensions in the monetary policy framework among
exchange rate management, monetary independence, and financial openness. The RBI’s
stance of accommodating increased exchange rate volatility, actively managing liquidity,
and liberalizing outflows is appropriate. However, the use of capital controls could
dampen investment, raise doubts about the government’s commitment to fuller capital
account convertibility, and pose questions about the exit strategy from new controls.
Strengthened monetary operations and communications along with greater exchange rate
flexibility could be a better way to increase monetary policy effectiveness and deal with
uncertainty in global financial markets.

•

Sizeable cross-border movements of capital require broader and deeper financial markets
to channel capital to its most productive use, accommodate higher exchange rate
volatility, and support financial stability. In this regard, a domestic corporate bond market
will provide an important alternative source of funds, while better-developed onshore
derivatives markets will enable corporations to better manage the risks associated with
India’s financial integration.

•

Further fiscal consolidation is important for sustaining growth as well as managing
financial globalization. Despite impressive revenue performance, fiscal consolidation has
stalled and public debt remains high, squeezing the fiscal space needed for public
investment in physical and social infrastructure. Both expenditure and revenue measures
are needed, including rationalizing subsidies, cutting tax exemptions, enhancing tax
administration, and broadening the tax base. A tighter fiscal stance could also limit the
inflationary impact of capital inflows.

•

Structural reforms can ease real sector rigidities, boost competitiveness, and ensure that
the benefits of growth are widely shared. The government’s “inclusive growth” agenda
has rightly identified as top priorities: bridging infrastructure gaps (through active private
sector participation), ensuring access to social services, and promoting a competitive
environment that supports private sector investment and job creation.

However, capital inflows are raising
the tensions of the “impossible trinity.”
Inflows have put upward pressure on the
exchange rate. Concerns about competitiveness
have arisen, and the authorities have intervened
in the foreign exchange market. The expansion
in domestic liquidity required monetary
tightening, which in turn has maintained a wide
interest-rate differential.

Sources: Reserve Bank of India; and Fund staff calculations.

3.
Supply constraints are the critical challenge to sustained growth with stability.
Rapid growth is worsening already serious shortages of infrastructure (especially electricity)
and skilled labor. Pressures on skilled wages are widening income inequality, potentially
eroding support for growth-oriented reforms (Box 1).1 Reforms are needed to spur jobintensive growth, further alleviate poverty, absorb the growing working-age population, and
sustain the reduction in public debt, as well as to manage appreciation pressures by bolstering
productivity.
4.
The authorities have been successful at maintaining macroeconomic stability but
critical structural reforms have lagged. Fiscal consolidation and monetary stability are
cornerstones of macroeconomic policy. In recent years, the budget deficit has fallen, thanks
to strong growth and the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA), and
price stability has been maintained. To cope with capital inflows, the authorities have

The shift in consumption growth is
particularly notable and suggests that
growth has become less inclusive. From
1983 to 1993/94, growth in per capita
consumption at the bottom of the income
distribution outpaced growth at the top.
During the 1990s, the shape of the growth
incidence curve reversed, with much faster
growth at the top—particularly in urban India,
reflecting the pickup in manufacturing and
services compared with agriculture. In the
1990s, despite faster growth, the bottom
50 percent of India’s population, experienced
slower consumption growth than in the
previous decade.

Annual Growth in Consumption per Capita (%)

Rapid growth has reduced poverty, but
inequality has risen although it is still low
by international standards. The share of the
population living below the poverty line fell
from 45 percent in 1983, to 36 percent in
1993/94, and then to 27½ percent in 2004/05.1/
However, inequality began to rise in the
1990s. Between 1993/94 and 2004/05, the gap
between average monthly per capita
consumption in rural and urban India widened.
The increase in income and wealth inequality
is potentially much larger, as the prices of
major sources of wealth, held by a small
segment of the population, have risen sharply.

allowed greater flexibility in the rupee, enhanced prudential measures, tightened selected
capital controls, and hiked reserve requirements. The 11th Plan envisions significant hikes in
infrastructure and education spending, along with labor market reforms. However, coalition
politics complicate reforms, with initiatives by the coalition-leader Congress Party resisted
by its partners on the left.

The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions focused on policies needed to
manage financial globalization and tackle supply constraints to sustained growth.
Discussions centered on macroeconomic policies (monetary, exchange rate, fiscal), capital
account policy, financial stability, and structural reform.
II. ECONOMIC BACKDROP
6.
Growth remains strong, led by
investment and productivity (Figure 1).
During July-September 2007, real GDP rose by
8.9 percent y/y. Capacity utilization and business
confidence remain high. Total factor
productivity growth has averaged about
3⅓ percent in recent years, within Asia exceeded
only by China. High-frequency data point to a
recent deceleration in consumption, but
investment indicators remain strong, fed by
robust corporate profits.

7.
Headline WPI inflation has ebbed from about 6¾ percent y/y earlier this year to
about 3½ percent y/y partly due to decelerating food and manufacturing prices and
appropriate monetary tightening. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) has eased to
about 4¾ percent y/y. CPI inflation exceeds WPI inflation by over 2 percentage points,
reflecting the CPI’s higher weight on food.
8.
Capital inflows are swelling (Figure 2). Capital inflows reached a record $45 billion
in 2006/07, and (as in other emerging markets) accelerated this fiscal year (Box 2). Portfolio
inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) rose appreciably but accounted for less
than a quarter of inflows. Capital inflows more than finance the current account deficit
(projected at about 1½ percent of GDP in 2007/08, versus a capital account surplus of
9½ percent of GDP). Export growth remains robust at over 20 percent y/y in U.S. dollar
value, but buoyant imports (led by raw materials and capital goods) have pushed up the trade
deficit.
9.
Capital inflows have lifted financial markets. Overseas investors bought a net
$18.8 billion of stocks and bonds during January-November 2007, compared to the previous
record of $9.5 billion in the same period in 2006. Equity markets recovered quickly from the

Box 2. Comparing BRICs: Exchange Rate, Capital Flows,
and Macroeconomic Policy
Rising capital inflows have put upward pressure on currencies in Brazil, Russia, India and China (the
BRICs). This box discusses the experience in the BRICs, including how policies have adapted.
Since the start of 2007, the BRICs (Brazil,
Russia, India, and China) have experienced
significant REER appreciation. Most of the
real appreciation in 2007 for India and Brazil
came from nominal appreciation, whereas China
and Russia had inflation-led appreciation. In
China and India, the appreciation is a recent
phenomenon, while in Brazil and Russia, the
exchange rate appreciation in 2007 comes on
top of sharp rises in 2005–06.

inflows in percent of GDP, followed by India.
Net portfolio inflows were smaller in both China
and Russia, partly reflecting outward investment. The Indian corporate sector and Russian banks and
corporations increased overseas borrowing. In the second half of 2007, the pace of capital inflows
appears to have picked up more in India than the in other countries, as suggested by the more rapid
reserve accumulation (chart).

The BRICs’ policy responses put different emphases on inflation, exchange rates, and the
capital account.
•

Intervention: Regardless of their exchange rate regimes, all of the BRICs intervened heavily
in foreign exchange markets: Brazil is an independent floater, India and Russia are managed
floaters with no predetermined path, and China maintains a crawling peg.

•

Sterilization: Both India and China partially sterilize their foreign exchange intervention, but
India does so at a higher rate than China. In Brazil, intervention is fully sterilized consistent
with its inflation target. In Russia, sterilization is limited to the oil-fund related inflows.

8
Box 2. Comparing BRICs: Exchange Rate, Capital Flows,
and Macroeconomic Policy (concluded)
•

Monetary policy: India and Brazil put greater emphasis on containing inflation, as indicated
by larger contributions of NEER changes to real appreciation. Russia’s monetary policy is
accommodative with base money growth accelerating to about 40 percent. China has
attempted to absorb liquidity mainly through increases in reserve requirements and
administrative measures to curb credit growth.

•

Capital account: India has liberalized outflows, and selectively restricted inflows. In recent
years (mostly through mid-2006), Brazil increased outflows by expediting external debt
repayments, and then liberalized some outflows. China restricts capital inflows other than
FDI, but has also liberalized outflows.

•

Supporting the export sector: Brazil and India provided some incentives to selected sectors,
including through import tariff exemptions and subsidized credit (India).

•

Fiscal policy: In India, staff expect higher revenues to be fully spent, while Brazil and China
are taking advantage of revenue over-performance to achieve better-than-budgeted fiscal
balances. In Russia, the government has spent more of its oil-revenues since 2005, with a
decline in the non-oil fiscal balance.

intervention picked up amid growing concerns about competitiveness after the sharp rise in
the rupee. Rupee flexibility is roughly comparable to that of other large emerging-markets
currencies and the yen (see Figure 3).

In addition to the exchange rate appreciation, several steps were taken since
October 2006 to tighten monetary conditions. The cash reserve ratio has risen 200 bps,
while the repo (lending) rate was hiked twice by 25 bps (the last time in April). With WPI
inflation ebbing and real estate prices and credit growth slowing, the RBI left policy rates on
hold at its October 2007 policy meeting, but raised the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis

Banks are profitable and liquid (Table 8). At end-March 2007, the aggregate capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 12.4 percent, remaining stable above the regulatory rate of
9.0 percent (Box 3). Amid strong credit growth, the ratio of scheduled commercial banks’
gross non-performing loans (NPLs) to advances has fallen to 2.7 percent from 10.4 percent at
March 2002, even as prudential norms have been tightened, in part because rising real estate
prices have facilitated repayment of problem loans. However, NPL provisioning averaged
56 percent over the last year–well below the 150 percent and higher in comparable emerging
market countries. At the same time, there are concerns about the sharp past rise in real-estate
prices and sub-standard loans. In addition, delinquencies on unsecured retail loans (which
account for about 10 percent of all loans, and which require 100 percent provisioning) are
rising for some banks.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
14.
Staff expects growth to moderate toward potential in the near term. Weaker
external demand will moderate exports. Consumption growth may slow due to the past rise in
real interest rates, but investment should remain brisk—supported by robust business
confidence, high capacity utilization in the capital goods sector, and buoyant corporate
profits. A favorable monsoon should deliver above-average agricultural growth. GDP growth
would moderate to 8¾ percent in FY2007/08 and further to 8¼ percent in FY2008/09, with
inflationary pressures contained. The current account deficit should register around 2 percent
of GDP, as growing services and remittances offset a widening trade deficit.
15.
•

Near-term risks are on both sides:
Risks to growth are broadly balanced. A sharper-than-expected slowdown in developed
economies could dampen exports, although increasing export diversification to fastgrowing Asian and Gulf economies limits this risk. Moreover, investment could surprise
on the upside, given strong corporate profits and domestic savings.

11
Box 3. Sensitivity Analysis of Banking System Credit Risk
Sensitivity analysis of the ten largest banks reveals modest credit risk exposure at current
capital levels. The impact of higher default rates on capital adequacy ratios (CAR) is estimated by
assuming that impaired loans are fully provisioned, and reducing risk-weighted assets and capital at a
rate equivalent to the increase of the NPL ratio. The effects of various increases in NPLs are assessed.
A sizeable increase in NPLs would be needed to reduce the weakest bank’s capital adequacy
below the regulatory threshold (figure below). The capitalization of the lowest quartile of banks
drops below the regulatory CAR threshold of nine percent (the solid black line) if impaired loans rise
to more than twice the current gross NPL ratio. Thus the least capitalized bank, representing eight
percent of total loans, can withstand more than a doubling of current NPLs before breaching statutory
capital requirements. Similarly, the average and median capitalization of the banking system remains
well above the existing CAR even if NPLs double in magnitude. However, once Basel II takes effect,
the regulatory threshold for capital would rise to 10 percent, and a 75 percent increase in NPLs would
push the weakest bank below that threshold.

•

Inflation risks are to the upside. Domestic liquidity remains ample (owing in part to
intervention), capacity remains constrained, skilled wages are rising sharply, and
continued rapid growth could increasingly expose the infrastructure deficit. Also, soaring
international food and fuel prices could stoke domestic price pressures.3

•

On financial risks, reflecting the past boom in retail credit, some increase in NPLs may
be in prospect. However, banks’ sizeable capital buffers indicate that the credit cycle is
likely to be manageable, and risk measures have improved (Box 3)4. Corporate leverage
is rising but remains low.

•

Fiscal consolidation is subject to downside risks. Soaring global commodity prices will
boost food, fuel, and fertilizer subsidies, while public compensation may rise
significantly during FY 2008/09. In addition, tax collections may slow as growth eases.

Any volatility in flows is unlikely to
generate external instability: external debt is low; external commercial borrowings
(ECBs) are subject to restrictions on end-use, maturity, and amount; and the projected
medium-term current account is consistent with debt sustainability. Reserves are ample,
exceeding total external debt.

Medium-term prospects are for sustained growth, contained inflation, and
continued economic and financial stability. GDP growth would moderate to 8 percent,
staff’s estimated potential growth.5 Inflation should range around 4 percent. The current
account deficit would remain around 2 percent of GDP, comfortably financed by private
capital inflows, and at a level consistent with a broadly unchanged net external debt position.
Strong growth would help reduce the general government deficit to about 4½ percent of GDP.

Fuel prices are administered. Full oil-price pass-through would add 3⅓ percentage points to WPI inflation.

NPLs would have to roughly double to push the capital adequacy ratio of the weakest banks below the
statutory level of 9 percent (Box 3).

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Discussions focused on how the policy framework should evolve to maintain India’s
impressive macroeconomic performance and stability in the face of sustained inflows:
•

Monetary and exchange rate policy calibrated to increasing financial openness;

•

Deepening and broadening capital markets—while maintaining financial stability—to
intermediate capital inflows smoothly and finance infrastructure;

•

Fiscal consolidation to facilitate inclusive growth and cope with appreciation pressures;
and

•

Structural reforms to enhance economic flexibility and productivity.

18.
The mission outlined the preferred approach to dealing with capital inflows in
the current favorable growth conjecture. This included a package of measures comprising
consistent monetary policy actions to address the impossible trinity, more ambitious fiscal
consolidation, continued liberalization of outflows, financial sector reforms to prepare for a
more open capital account, and structural reforms to increase the absorptive capacity of the
economy (each described in detail in the sections below). The authorities generally agreed on
the broad objectives of policies. However, given uncertainties in the global economic and
financial environment and the constraints on reforms imposed by coalition politics, staff’s
view is that the current eclectic approach was likely to continue.

The mission assessed the rupee as in line with fundamentals (Box 4). So far, the
rupee’s rise has not broadly hampered competitiveness, with the level of the rupee
appropriate from a medium-term perspective, and exports and profits remaining strong.
While selected industries are affected, the appropriate response could be targeted, timebound support—e.g., offering affected workers training and temporary financial assistance—
to facilitate adjustment. In addition, enhanced labor market flexibility, improvements in
power and transport infrastructure, and removal of small scale reservations would reduce
business costs and increase economic flexibility. Benefits of appreciation (e.g., lower
inflation and cheaper imports) also need to be better communicated.

Large capital inflows are complicating the conduct of monetary policy, creating
excess liquidity and pressuring the rupee. Partially sterilized intervention to smooth volatility
has maintained a wide interest differential, which in turn has aggravated inflows, thereby
placing further pressure on the exchange rate. More generally, inflows are exacerbating
tensions in the policy framework among

At the same time, the September 2007 CGER
exercise puts the rupee “close to
equilibrium.”1/ India’s cyclically adjusted
medium-term current account deficit is close to
its fundamental level (3 percent of GDP), as
downward pressure on the deficit from
favorable demographic trends are broadly offset
by fiscal deficits and strong growth. Strong
growth also supports a sustainable net foreign
liabilities position, allowing India to
comfortably run current account deficits.

Real Effective Exchange Rate and Exports

The recent rupee appreciation has fueled
concerns about competitiveness. During
January-November 2007, the rupee rose over
11 percent against the U.S. dollar. On a REER
basis, the rupee is now outside of the ±5 percent
range observed since the early 1990s. Sharp
appreciation has led to strong calls to support
the export sector.

significant protection over the years and have faced little incentive to become efficient and to raise
productivity. In contrast, services exports and more capital intensive manufacturing exports have been
expanding more briskly, and gaining market share globally. The key is to pursue labor market reforms and
upgrade infrastructure to bolster productivity and lower costs for labor intensive sectors so that they too
can adjust to the stronger currency.

framework and in light of the large net inflows faced by India and other large emerging
markets, the mission noted that avoiding large and prolonged foreign currency purchases
would reduce the need for costly sterilization and limit the potential buildup of speculative
inflows.6 Moreover, a more flexible rupee, along with better-developed derivatives markets,
would encourage private entities to hedge.7
23.
The mission welcomed steps taken to liberalize capital outflows in 2006 and 2007
(Box 2 discusses international experiences with capital flows). Continuing to liberalize
outflows―including by large domestic institutional investors―would signal the commitment
to fuller capital account convertibility. While local investors may not initially take full
advantage of broader opportunities to invest overseas, over time outflows will rise as part of
portfolio diversification, reducing net inflows.
24.
However, using capital controls for macroeconomic management could affect
investment and growth adversely. These risks were demonstrated by the recent experience
with tightening restrictions on external commercial borrowings, which have not curbed
overall flows, but have raised concerns about investment financing. Such restrictions are
likely to be effective only temporarily. Moreover, further restrictions on capital inflows could
foster uncertainty about the government’s commitment to fuller capital account convertibility
and about the authorities’ “exit strategy.”
25.
The temporary space provided by existing controls should be used to prepare for
a more open capital account. In particular, the flexibility and effectiveness of monetary
policy would be enhanced by strengthening the monetary framework.8
•

On monetary operations, the mission welcomed the heightened use of market sterilization
instruments in 2007 and urged further reliance on open market operations (OMOs), with
a broad range of maturities, rather than the CRR—which taxes banks.

•

On communications, the mission welcomed improvements—such as the 2005 shift from
annual to quarterly reviews and the increasingly forward-looking analysis in policy
documents. Further increasing the frequency of policy meetings would reduce the need
for inter-meeting measures. Monetary policy reviews could elaborate further on the
inflation and demand-supply outlook, including through eventual publication of the

inflation expectations survey, to guide expectations. 9 In addition, focusing policy on a
broad-based CPI would orient policy around a clearer measure of the cost of living.
Authorities’ Plans and Views
26.
The authorities saw the current conjuncture and outlook as favorable. While
demand pressures remained strong, the supply response had helped allay concerns about
overheating and credit growth to sectors such as real estate had moderated, owing to the
prudential measures taken in 2006/07. However, they remain vigilant, given abundant
liquidity and high international oil and wheat prices. They also reiterated their preference for
a multiple-indicators approach to formulating monetary policy, in light of ongoing structural
change in the economy and the RBI’s mandate for financial stability as well as price stability.
On inflation measures, officials noted that given India’s economic diversity, it is not possible
to construct a meaningful single CPI. The survey of inflation expectations is in the pilottesting stage, with no timetable for its release.
27.
The stance of monetary policy remains unchanged and focused on domestic
concerns. The RBI reiterated its policy of withdrawing monetary accommodation through
active liquidity management. They noted that their approach of using varied instruments to
sterilize was aimed at distributing costs among the RBI, the banking system (through the
CRR) and the budget (interest on the stabilization bonds). The authorities agreed that, with
inflation signals mixed, cutting policy rates would be premature.
28.
On the approach to exchange rate management, the RBI reiterated that
intervention aims at smoothing volatility. The focus was not on the real effective exchange
rate, but on maintaining orderly conditions in the bilateral U.S. dollar/rupee market,
particularly in response to externally-induced volatility. Over the past year, intervention had
been one-way (purchases of foreign exchange) because there had been no net capital
outflows since May 2006. With risks to capital flows on both the upside and downside, the
rupee could weaken as well as strengthen; in this connection, they stressed that the rupee had
been on a weakening trend as recently as 2006. For the medium term, the authorities agreed
that higher exchange rate flexibility could help India adjust to increasingly globalized
financial markets.
29.
The authorities did not dispute the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate
appears to be in line with its medium-term equilibrium value but noted that it is too
early to assess the effects of the recent appreciation. Notwithstanding the small current

assistance to the sectors worst affected by appreciation, the authorities have publicly stressed
the need for Indian companies to adapt to a stronger rupee, by strengthening productivity.
30.
The authorities stressed that formulating a response to rapid capital inflows was
difficult given the present global environment. The authorities saw the current monetary
framework and communications as adequate to maintain price and financial stability. They
noted that costs of sterilized intervention had to be weighed against the benefits of financial
stability and smoothing exchange rate volatility given limited real-sector flexibility. On
communications, the RBI viewed its approach as well understood in markets, and noted its
efforts to increase transparency. The authorities also considered the current frequency of
policy meetings, with the Committee of the Central Board meeting weekly, alongside its
quarterly reviews, to be adequate. On capital flows, the RBI considered that excessive
inflows had resulted from the “unusual heightened global uncertainties” surrounding the
disruption in global credit markets, and in particular, the policy response by major-country
central banks to the credit turbulence. They saw the surge in FII inflows since September in
the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis as temporary, with India (among other countries)
becoming a haven for capital flows. These massive capital inflows—far in excess of the
economy’s absorptive capacity—were complicating monetary management. Continued
inflows could create financial sector vulnerabilities, and restrictions on selected capital
inflows had helped to preserve a favorable macroeconomic environment. They did not
consider liberalizing outflows as an adequate solution as such steps would only attract more
inflows while not resulting in significant balancing outflows. In light of these risks, they
stated that all possible options for maintaining stability would be considered, including nonmonetary measures such as active capital account management (capital controls).
31.
In the medium term, the government’s intent remains to move toward fuller
capital account convertibility. The approach would remain gradual, with a hierarchy of
preferences according to stability of flows (with FDI and equity first), and, as noted above,
some role for existing controls to preserve financial stability. At the same time, the
government shared staff’s doubts about the long-term effectiveness of controls and concerns
about the impact of ECB restrictions on investment. On outflows, they noted that ceilings on
overseas investments of corporates, mutual funds, and individuals had been increased, but so
far these measures had not resulted in significant outflows.
B. Strengthening the Financial System
Background and Staff Views
32.
India’s financial globalization necessitates development of broader and deeper
financial markets, as well as increased efficiency and continued stability in the financial
system. Better developed financial markets would help to intermediate capital inflows,
expand risk management toolkits, and finance India’s large investment needs. In the financial

20
system, continued deregulation, with appropriate strengthening of prudential rules, can
improve the efficiency of intermediation while preserving stability.10
Financial markets
33.
The priorities are developing India’s government debt, corporate bond, and
derivatives markets. A more liquid government debt market would provide a better
foundation for pricing financial instruments (and would strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism). A robust, rupee-denominated corporate debt market would allow corporations
to avoid currency mismatches while providing a venue for infrastructure finance (the banking
system lacks the balance-sheet capacity to provide it). Well-developed derivatives markets
would provide financial institutions and corporations with tools needed to manage risks
accompanying financial globalization.
34.
The government yield curve is illiquid, undercutting its role as a pricing
benchmark. The turnover ratio of government debt is about 70 percent—lower than in
Indonesia and Vietnam, and about half that in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Only
four issues are traded more than four times a week. Reasons include (i) a narrow investor
base; (ii) stringent short selling rules (positions may remain open for no more than five days;
failure to deliver faces harsh penalties, including banning from trading); and (iii) the
Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requires banks to maintain in cash, gold, or government and
other approved securities at least 25 percent of demand and time deposits.11
35.
The corporate debt market is underdeveloped, amounting to less than 5 percent of
GDP, compared with over 20 percent of GDP in Thailand, Chile and Mexico, and

Augmented exchange-traded interest-rate and foreign-exchange derivatives
would complement growing OTC markets.13 While OTC markets turnover has risen
threefold during 2004–2007 to over $8 billion per day, OTC markets lack the centralized risk
management and inherent transparency of exchanges. In addition, legal uncertainty exists
about settlement in OTC markets, particularly closeout netting (which limits the risk that a
defaulting counterparty will demand payment on contracts that are in his favor while refusing
to pay those on which he owes money). However, attempts to introduce exchange-traded
interest-rate contracts had limited success, partly due to imperfect contract design and
restricted participation, while currency futures are presently disallowed.

Pension funds are allowed to invest up to ten percent of annual accruals in corporate bonds, while total FII

22
Financial efficiency and stability
37.
The main risks to financial stability—rapid growth in credit and strong capital
inflows—appear to be manageable at present, but warrant close monitoring. Financial
soundness indicators are in prudent ranges, and overall credit growth is decelerating.
However, growth in credit to real estate remains elevated, at almost 70 percent y/y, and is
concentrated in new private sector banks (accounting for more than 30 percent of their loan
books). Also, the rapidly growing retail segment is relatively new to Indian banks. In
addition, Indian corporates’ foreign currency borrowing has risen, and data on the extent of
hedging are unavailable but anecdotes suggest that it is far from complete. In this
environment, close supervisory attention would be needed to banks’ careful management of
retail credit portfolios, and to their exposure to corporates that have unhedged foreign
exchange exposures.14 Going forward, stress tests of banks’ exposures, and strengthened
supervision under Basel II, will help to maintain the stability of the banking system.
38.
There is also scope to improve the efficiency of the banking system. Public
ownership accounts for about 70 percent of scheduled commercial bank assets. The banking
system is fragmented, including 82 commercial banks. Return on assets of domestic banks is
low compared with other emerging and developed markets. Impediments to greater
efficiency include credit targets to “priority sectors” (including agriculture, small scale
industries, self employed); these loans tend to be small (thus costly to administer), with
higher default rates than other loans.15 Rates on savings deposits and small loans, short-term
agricultural loans, and export credits are regulated. In addition, the CRR taxes banks. Foreign
ownership, which could boost competition and introduce new products and technologies, is
subject to limits (to be reviewed in 2009).
Authorities’ Plans and Views
Financial market development
39.
The authorities agree on the need for a more liquid government securities yield
curve. They have been gradually consolidating benchmark issues to reduce fragmentation,
through swaps and buybacks, and by concentrating issues on benchmark maturities. In
addition, the Government Securities Act of 2006, which came into force on December 1,
2007, allows inter alia stripping and reconstitution of government securities.
40.
Steps are underway to develop corporate bond markets. The fixed-income
industry group (FIMMDA) has developed a trade-reporting platform to improve price
transparency. In addition, the RBI would introduce corporate bond repos once an efficient

23
and safe settlement system based on delivery versus payment and electronic straight-through
processing is implemented. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has
introduced smaller lot sizes for trading, and in December 2007 reduced the number of
required ratings to one and allowed sub-investment grade debt.16
41.
The RBI has clarified the regulatory environment for derivatives. Comprehensive
guidelines on derivatives (April 2007) stipulated eligibility criteria for participation as either
market-maker or end-user, broad principles (including sound risk management), permissible
instruments, documentation, and prudential limits. Draft guidelines on credit default swaps
(May 2007) specified permitted structures, eligible counterparties, prudential norms, and risk
management, accounting, and reporting requirements.
42.
Work is underway to expand derivatives markets. On currency derivatives, the
RBI’s October 2007 mid-term policy review proposed to permit authorized dealers to run
options books and allow corporates to buy and write covered options. A November 2007
report of the RBI’s Internal Working Group on Currency Futures recommended creation of a
dedicated exchange, with participation initially limited to residents. Meanwhile, a sub-group
of the RBI Technical Advisory Committee on Markets is considering how to reactivate the
interest rate futures market, and whether to expand foreign participation.
Financial efficiency and stability
43.
The RBI made the following points in response to staff comments. They noted
that bank efficiency had improved over time, including for the public banks, while NPLs
have fallen over time. Going forward, however, banks would need to raise capital,
particularly to meet the enhanced demands of Basel II (for foreign banks and Indian banks
with foreign activities from March 2008), which would require an increase in capital
equivalent to about one percent of risk-weighted assets. Foreign ownership of banks would
be reviewed in 2009 as earlier planned; one option being considered could be to grant
subsidiaries of foreign banks the same treatment as Indian banks. The RBI’s roadmap for
foreign bank participation is consistent with India’s WTO commitments, and it has proposed
that foreign participation go beyond the existing WTO commitment of 12 branches per year.
Regulations on priority-sector lending were defined broadly, and formulated to promote
financial inclusion.
44.
The RBI is carefully monitoring bank risk exposures. Including in the context of
its Supervisory Review Process, in which banks with substantial exposures to sensitive
sectors are subject to special scrutiny, it frequently inspects banks’ credit and market risk
books, cognizant that banks have not experienced a full retail credit cycle. It has found no
basis for concern, with rising income levels supporting retail credit quality; in the real estate
16

24
sector, rapid growth has partly reflected the low initial base. In addition, banks have been
advised to monitor the unhedged currency exposures of their corporate clients, and the RBI is
working to put in place a supervisory process for globally-active bank-led conglomerates.
More generally, the pending move to Basel II will provide an opportunity to further
strengthen risks management and the supervisory review process. The RBI has also worked
with banks to strengthen stress testing, including credit risk in derivatives books, and closely
watches banks’ derivatives exposures.
45.
A Committee on Financial Sector Assessment is undertaking a self-assessment of
financial stability and development. Four advisory panels are addressing financial stability
and stress testing; financial regulation and supervision; institutions and market structure; and
transparency standards, and will issue separate reports. The first group will conduct macroprudential surveillance, including system-wide stress tests, and make recommendations for
strengthening the financial system. The other groups will undertake assessments of relevant
standards and codes and suggest measures to bridge identified gaps. The Committee is
expected to complete its work by March 2008.

but expenditure is also expected to overshoot due to above-budget subsidy and interest costs.
Including off-budget quasi-fiscal expenditure, staff projects the augmented deficit at 4½
percent of GDP, about the same as last year.17 Looking to 2008/09, the FRBMA sets the
challenging objective of revenue balance (and reduction of the overall deficit to 3 percent of
GDP). Based on the staff’s augmented definition of the budget deficit, achieving revenue
balance would require consolidation of 2¾ percentage points of GDP (and about
1½ percentage points of GDP to achieve an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP).18 As
discussed in Annex I, the staff baseline assumes that off-budget subsidy-related bond
issuance will be phased out gradually, suggesting that achievement of current balance will be
delayed by a few years.
48.
Given the rapid growth in revenue, fiscal consolidation could have been more
ambitious. This would not only have accelerated debt reduction, but also increased the
contribution of fiscal policy to absorbing the inflationary impact of capital inflows, a burden
which has been borne disproportionately by monetary policy (given the positive fiscal
impulse).19

There are risks to this baseline. Spending risks include the persistence of high
fertilizer and fuel subsidy costs (given the global commodity price outlook) and increased
government wages and pensions from the Sixth Pay Commission (SPC) award.20 Recent
wage hikes and past cost of living increases would limit the rise in salary costs and phasing
in pay increases would ease the fiscal burden. On

(over 5 percent of GDP) absorb fiscal space needed for priority social and infrastructure
projects. Consolidation would also reduce the risks of crowding out and set the stage for
further financial openness.
51.
Bold expenditure reforms are needed to make space for social spending.
Revamping subsidies is a key priority: they are expensive and poorly targeted.21 A phased realignment of domestic fuel prices to international levels, paired with a shift to a rule-based
pricing and burden-sharing mechanism for petrol and diesel, would reduce the fiscal burden
and improve transparency. Staff welcomed the government’s plans to improve targeting and
reduce diversion of food and fuel subsidies and other social assistance, as well as efforts to
broaden the social safety net (including extending social insurance to informal-sector
workers and old-age pensions to the poor).22
52.
Revenue reforms are needed as well. In 2006/07, foregone revenue from
exemptions amounted to 5.7 percent of GDP (roughly half of actual tax collections). The
authorities’ GST (planned for April 2010) would streamline the tax structure and bolster
revenue in the medium term. Early announcement of a roadmap—including a timetable for
merging VAT-like taxes and broadening the services tax—would help taxpayers prepare. A
single point of collection (as in most federal OECD countries) would be easier to administer
than a dual-tier system. On non-tax revenue, there is considerable potential to raise
collections from user fees, but this will require significantly improved service delivery.
53.
The FRBMA should be supplemented
by an explicit framework for medium-term
debt reduction. The Act implicitly targets
further debt reduction beyond March 2009,
which staff sees as achievable (staff projects
general government debt to fall to 62 percent of
GDP by 2012, a decline of almost 20 percentage
points (see Annex I)). Adoption of an explicit,
ambitious medium-term debt reduction target
could bolster the government’s commitment to

27
debt reduction, guide public expectations about fiscal policy, and relieve appreciation
pressures.23 The target should encompass the consolidated government, including nonfinancial public enterprises.
54.
Aggregate state finances are sound.24 Thanks to fiscal responsibility legislation
(adopted in all but two states), as well as high transfers and debt forgiveness by the central
government, fiscal consolidation targets set out under the 12th Finance Commission are likely
to be met ahead of schedule. Going forward, however, several risks exist:
•

The anticipated slowdown in central government tax collections (which are shared with
the states) requires states to enhance revenues, particularly given potential SPC costs.

•

With education and health spending (primarily a state responsibility) expected to rise,
constraints on implementation and ensuring the quality of spending could become more
acute. Monitoring and evaluation need improvement.

•

State liquidity management could be improved further; cash-rich states could use excess
revenue to consolidate debt more quickly.

Authorities’ Plans and Views
55.
The authorities remain committed to FRBMA targets. This year, significant
revenue overperformance (especially by corporate taxes) was expected to offset higher-thanbudgeted interest payments and subsidies, thus allowing the central government deficit target
to be met.25 The authorities acknowledged that achieving revenue balance by March 2009
would be challenging, given persistent expenditure pressures.
56.
At the same time, the government plans to ramp up priority spending
significantly in coming years, with a particular focus on the social sector. Under the
11th Plan (2007–2012), spending on education and health is set to triple to 6 percent and
9 percent of GDP, respectively, mostly coming from the public sector. Total infrastructure
investment is targeted to rise from about 5¾ percent of GDP to 9 percent of GDP, with an
increased private-sector share. To avoid undermining fiscal consolidation, the government
aims to contain non-priority spending growth. Relatedly, Planning Commission officials

23

The FRBM Rules (2004) set out annual reductions in the revenue and overall deficits. While the aim of the
FRBMA is to achieve revenue balance (and an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP) by March 2009, the annual
deficit reduction targets are set in perpetuity.
24
25

The fiscal condition of some states remains worrisome, however.

In this connection, they acknowledged that the official deficit was understated, though they noted that
subsidy-related bonds are considered extra-budgetary because India’s fiscal accounts are on a cash basis.

28
expressed concern that pushing for revenue balance by March 2009 would constrain priority
spending, thereby jeopardizing inclusive growth objectives.26
57.
The Ministry of Finance shared the staff’s view that reforms are needed to
secure lasting fiscal consolidation. The government is committed to reducing the subsidy
bill and is evaluating reform options; but the timing of these politically-difficult reforms is
unclear. On revenues, they agreed that tax buoyancy would moderate as growth eased, but
noted the contribution of ongoing compliance improvements and base-broadening.
58.
The authorities were cautiously optimistic about the outlook for state finances.
While recognizing the significant recent improvement in states’ fiscal balances, they
highlighted the large role of central government transfers and the need for states to strengthen
their own revenue-raising capabilities. Expenditure may have been consolidated too quickly
in some cases, with critical labor shortages in education and health resulting from across-theboard hiring freezes. Looking forward, improving service delivery at state and local levels
will be critical for inclusive growth.
59.

On medium-term fiscal issues:

•

The recently appointed 13th Finance Commission is preparing a road map for GST
introduction (a dual-tier system with a common tax base would be the likely outcome)
and will make recommendations for medium-term fiscal policy.

•

The authorities downplayed concerns about SPC expenditure risks, noting that the award
was unlikely to be as high as in 1997 because cost-of-living hikes have been granted
more frequently in recent years. Increases would likely be phased in, and the states’
improved fiscal positions would help them absorb the costs.

•

On financing infrastructure, the government plans to increase significantly the role of
public-private partnerships.
D. Addressing Supply Constraints to Sustain Growth

Background and Staff Views
60.
Strong and more inclusive growth is the basis for India’s economic stability.
Productivity needs to be bolstered in order to maintain competitiveness in the face of
appreciation pressures. Strong growth is also needed to support fiscal sustainability, currently
riding on buoyant revenues. Inclusive growth will also be essential to build political

unemployment rates among the young rise steeply with educational achievement, suggesting
serious mismatches between education provision and market needs.27 More flexible labor
regulations could increase formal sector employment, which has stagnated even as
employment in the informal sector grows. The reallocation of labor from weaker performing
to stronger sectors in the economy could generate substantial productivity gains, while
allowing a larger share of the population to enjoy the benefits of growth.

The mission encouraged the authorities to continue with gradual trade
liberalization. The overall average tariff has come down from 32.3 percent in 2002 to
15.8 percent in 2006, although average agricultural tariffs stand at 40.8 percent. In the

30
2007/08 budget, the government announced a further reduction of the peak nonagricultural
rate from 12.5 percent to 10 percent (subject to certain exemptions).
Authorities’ Plans and Views
64.
“Faster and more inclusive growth” is the guiding objective of the 11th Plan.
Priorities include ensuring access to social services, augmenting physical infrastructure, and
promoting a competitive environment that supports private sector investment and job
creation, including in agriculture.
65.
The Plan envisions enhanced education and labor market flexibility. In particular,
a stronger focus on secondary, higher and technical education would better align the skills of
graduates with market needs, and limit widening income disparities. The 11th Plan envisages
a tripling of public spending on education to 6 percent of GDP, with further private sector
involvement. The government is well aware of the need for a greater emphasis on quality of
services provision, with enhanced monitoring, evaluation and accountability. Allowing FDI
in the education sector is under consideration. The authorities recognize that rigid labor
regulations stifle organized-sector employment, and the 11th Plan includes, for the first time,
recommendations to make labor regulations more flexible, though their political feasibility
remains unclear.
66.
The government is relying on public-private partnerships (PPPs) to help bridge
infrastructure gaps. So far, progress in PPPs has varied across sectors, with telecom, ports
and road sectors attracting the bulk of private investment. In the power sector, regulatory
hurdles regarding payment mechanisms remain the biggest obstacle. Model concession
agreements in key infrastructure sectors are moving towards allocating a greater share of the
risk to the public sector. The authorities also plan to increase public investment significantly.
67.
The authorities remain committed to multilateral trade liberalization. Tariff
reductions have lowered the costs of key capital goods and raw materials, and in tandem with
complementary structural reforms, have spurred domestic competition, pushing firms in India
to align their cost structures with firms globally. While the government plans to reduce tariffs
to ASEAN levels by 2009, domestic concerns and corresponding tariffs and non-tariff
barriers of major trading partners may influence the degree of reductions. The authorities
were hopeful for progress in the Doha Development round, though they expressed concern
that the focus on development was fading. In the meantime, India is pursuing further trade
liberalization through FTAs with key nations.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
68.
India’s impressive macroeconomic performance pays tribute to its sound
macroeconomic policies and steady structural reforms over the past 16 years. Growth

31
has brought further reductions in poverty while prudent macroeconomic policies have
supported financial and economic stability.
69.
Sustaining this performance requires tackling two challenges. First, rapid capital
inflows are bringing out tensions in the policy framework associated with the “impossible
trinity.” Resolving these tensions will require an evolution of monetary policy, further
exchange rate flexibility, and deeper and broader capital markets. Second, sustained,
inclusive growth is needed to maintain economic stability. The necessary structural reforms
will both underpin growth and increase economic flexibility and competitiveness.
70.
Monetary operations and communications are adapting to financial
globalization, and this process can usefully be stepped up. The RBI has managed liquidity
more actively, improved communication, and accommodated increased exchange rate
volatility. Greater use of open market operations would enhance the flexibility and
effectiveness of monetary policy and decrease reliance on the tax of the CRR. Meanwhile,
further elaboration on the inflation outlook in more frequent monetary policy reviews would
help guide expectations.
71.
Staff judge rupee appreciation as an equilibrium phenomenon, reflecting strong
economic fundamentals. The rupee is appropriately valued from a medium-term
perspective. A market-determined rupee, and the policy of a managed float with some
intervention to curb volatility but no target or preannounced path, remain appropriate.
Looking ahead, further exchange rate flexibility will give monetary policy greater room to
focus on containing inflation, and reduce the costs of exchange rate management. In
combination with better-developed derivatives markets, a more flexible rupee would
encourage hedging and avoid a buildup of speculative inflows.
72.
The use of capital controls for macroeconomic management should be avoided,
as they could affect investment adversely. These risks are demonstrated by the recent
experience with tightening ECBs restrictions, which have not curbed overall flows but have
raised concerns about investment financing. Moreover, while the government remains
committed to fuller capital account convertibility, imposing further restrictions on inflows
may create confusion about that commitment and about the authorities’ “exit strategy.” A
preferable strategy would be to make capital account liberalization a deliberate process. The
temporary space provided by existing restrictions should be used to prepare for a more open
capital account. Steps taken to liberalize capital outflows in 2006 and 2007 are welcome, and
further bolder steps would be warranted, to reduce net inflows over time.
73.
Broader and deeper financial markets could better intermediate capital inflows,
accommodate adjustments in the exchange rate, and finance India’s large investment
requirements. Developing the corporate bond and derivatives markets onshore will be
crucial to funding massive infrastructure investment needs and providing corporations with
the tools they need to manage the risks associated with India’s financial globalization.

32
Another priority is developing exchange-traded currency and interest rate derivatives markets
to complement the growing OTC markets.
74.
The efficiency of financial institutions can be enhanced. Key steps would include
opening up further to foreign banks, phasing out directed lending, further loosening interest
rate restrictions, and reducing the CRR. In addition, further liberalizing FDI in financial
services would spur competition and bring innovation and advanced financial technologies.
75.
The RBI appropriately maintains a strong focus on preserving financial stability.
Thanks to the RBI’s close scrutiny of banks’ credit portfolios and its efforts to improve bank
risk management, the risks posed by a turn in the credit cycle are likely to be manageable. In
addition, the pending adoption of Basel II will further strengthen bank risk management. The
ongoing review of financial stability and development appropriately emphasizes macroprudential surveillance, including system-level stress testing, and staff looks forward to
publication of the report in March 2008.
76.
Further fiscal consolidation is essential to sustain inclusive growth and cope with
financial globalization. The interest costs of high public debt absorb fiscal space needed for
priority social and infrastructure spending. Consolidation would also reduce the risks of
crowding out and set the stage for further financial openness. Finally, a tight fiscal stance can
shoulder some of the burden of adjusting to the inflationary impact of capital inflows.
77.
Measures are needed on both spending and revenues. On spending, the authorities
are rightly concerned about the growing fuel subsidy burden. A phased reduction in fuel
subsidies and a gradual alignment of domestic prices to international levels is warranted, and
a more rule-based pricing and burden-sharing mechanism would improve transparency.
Meanwhile, food and fertilizer subsidies can be better targeted. On revenues, cutting
exemptions would substantially boost the tax take. Plans to introduce the GST are welcome;
early announcement of a roadmap would help taxpayers to prepare. Collections from user
fees could be raised, but will require significantly improved service delivery.
78.
State’s aggregate fiscal performance remains impressive, providing fiscal space
to raise social spending. Fiscal responsibility laws, large central government transfers, and
introduction of the VAT have spurred rapid deficit reduction. However, liquidity
management could be improved further. Looking ahead, a priority is to improve the quality
and quantity of state social spending.
79.
The FRBMA could be augmented to provide an explicit framework for future
debt reduction. An explicit medium-term debt reduction target for consolidated government
could bolster the commitment to further debt reduction.
80.
Structural reforms to make the economy more flexible will be key to
competitiveness and inclusive growth. Sustained productivity growth will be essential to

33
maintain competitiveness. Meanwhile, widening disparities reflect rapid growth in skilled
wages owing to skills shortages, which in turn reflect gaps in education. In addition,
infrastructure gaps and labor market rigidities will increasingly constrain growth. In the
power sector, a more predictable regulatory environment is warranted to mobilize private
sector funding. Higher—and more effective—public spending on education is also essential.
FDI in education could play a supportive role, with a clearer regulatory regime. More flexible
labor regulations can facilitate the reallocation of labor to stronger sectors.
81.
Further trade liberalization can facilitate growth. Tariff reductions have reduced
the costs of key capital goods and raw materials, and in tandem with complementary
structural reforms, have spurred domestic competition. Accordingly, staff supports the aim to
reduce tariffs to ASEAN levels and welcomes the authorities’ commitment to multilateral
trade liberalization.

1/ The index is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of exchange rate movements by an index of exchange market pressure
(the sum of exchange rate volatility and volatility in reserves, normalized by lagged base money). It takes values from zero to one. A
lower value signifies relative inflexibility, with zero indicating a peg or a high commitment to inflation targeting.
2/ Positive number implies markets assigning a greater probability (or premium) to INR depreciating than to appreciating against U.S.

Sources: Data provided by the Indian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ In 2007/08, includes a special dividend payment from the RBI amounting to 0.7 percent of GDP. The authorities include this item
under "other capital receipts" rather than non-tax revenue.
2/ Includes the surcharge on Union duties transferred to the National Calamity Contingency Fund.
3/ Excludes off-budget subsidy-related bond issuance.
4/ Authorities' treatment of state debt swap scheme (DSS) in 2002-05 shows the prepayment by States of on-lent funds to the center as
net lending. The Center's prepayment of its debt to the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) is treated as a capital expenditure.
5/ In 2007/08, includes roughly 0.7 percent of GDP for the government's purchase of SBI shares from the RBI.
6/ Authorities' definition treats divestment as a revenue item until 2005/06 (included); excludes off-budget subsidy related bond issuance.
7/ Staff's definition treats divestment receipts as a below-the-line financing item and includes off-budget subsidy-related bond issuance.
8/ In 2007/08, the authorities' definition of the current deficit (which classifies the special dividend from the RBI as "other capital receipts"),
the budget target for the current deficit is 1.5 percent of GDP. Staff includes this item under non-tax revenue.
9/ External debt measured at historical exchange rates.
10/ Issued by the central government to FCI, fertilizer producers, and the state-owned oil refining/distribution companies as compensation
for losses incurred from the subsidized provision of commodities.

ANNEX I: INDIA—MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Macroeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario. Economic growth is forecast to
ease to potential (8 percent), and real interest rates to rise modestly (see Table 7). Fiscal
consolidation will remain on hold following achievement of the FRBMA target for an overall
fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP (see further discussion below). These policies, combined
with progress in structural areas, are expected to support growth and help contain inflation.
Other working assumptions for fiscal policy include:
•

Revenue. Medium-term projections assume continued healthy growth in tax revenue,
though with some slowdown in line with the turn in the profit cycle. The baseline
does not assume any significant reduction in tax exemptions; policy reforms in this
direction could raise revenue by a few percentage points of GDP. Similarly, the
baseline does not assume any significant reforms in nontax revenue (e.g., on user
fees); thus, government receipts from this source fall as a share of GDP.

•

Expenditure. Staff projections are based in large part on official projections published
in the 11th Plan Approach Paper (December 2006).1 These include raising expenditure
on education, health, and infrastructure, and reining in spending on nonpriority items
(including subsidies). Military expenditure is forecast to remain constant in real
terms. With regards to wages and salaries (for which the Sixth Pay Commission will
make a recommendation by April 2008), staff assume an increase of 30 percent,
phased in over two years. Because government spending on wages and salaries has
been falling in real terms, this award is not projected to have a major impact on the
budget deficit.

•

Off-budget bond issuance. Staff’s baseline assumption is that issuance of such bonds
will diminish after 2007/08, in line with the government’s commitment to reduce
expenditure on subsidies. For fuel subsidies, the baseline assumes a gradual increase
in administered prices in 2008/09 (such that one-third of the additional subsidy cost is
borne by consumers, as was the case in 2006/07), and a return to market-based
pricing of diesel, gasoline, and LPG in 2009/10. The price of kerosene, which is
primarily consumed by the poor, would not be adjusted. For fertilizer subsidies, the
baseline assumption is that off-budget subsidies will be cut in half in 2008/09, and
eliminated in 2009/10.

FRBMA targets. Using the authorities’ definition of the budget, the central government is
on track to meet its overall deficit target for 2008/09 (3 percent of GDP), but may find it
1

Updated projections for the 11th Plan are being finalized, but are not expected to show significant changes.

more difficult to reach the target of central government revenue balance by 2008/09.
However, there are upside risks to tax revenue that would accelerate fiscal consolidation.
Based on provisional fiscal data for the states, the overall borrowing requirement of the
general government—for which the FRBMA set a target of 6 percent of GDP for 2008/09—
is projected to be met in 2007/08, a year ahead of schedule.
Using an augmented definition of the budget deficit, which includes off-budget, subsidyrelated bond issuance that staff consider quasi-fiscal expenditure, attainment of the FRBMA
targets would be more difficult. Under the assumptions for subsidies described above, staff’s
baseline projection for the augmented central government balance in 2008/09 is 3.9 percent
of GDP, suggesting that measures of about 1¼ percent of GDP would be needed to meet the
deficit target. Achieving revenue balance would require measures of 2½ percent of GDP.2
Debt path. Under the baseline scenario, which projects an augmented general government
deficit of 7 percent of GDP in 2007/08 and a 0.3 percentage point of GDP average annual
adjustment thereafter, gross public debt would decline over five years to 62 percent of GDP.
Sensitivity analysis. A gradual decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio would still occur under
various shocks, including in a scenario where the growth-interest-differential returns to its
historical average (Figure I.1 and Table I.1). Only in the case of a return to historical
averages for the primary balance, real GDP growth, and real interest rates would the debt
ratio rise over the medium term.

2

In 2007/08, a special (non-recurring) dividend received from the RBI, which staff include under nontax
revenue (and the authorities include under capital receipts), lowers the revenue deficit by 0.7 percent of GDP.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since March 1, 1993, the Indian rupee has floated against other currencies, although the
Reserve Bank of India intervenes in the market periodically. As per the Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the exchange rate in India is
classified as managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. On
August 20, 1994, India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
IMF Articles of Agreement. India maintains the following restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, which are subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): restrictions related to the non-transferability of
balances under the India-Russia debt agreement; restrictions arising from unsettled balances
under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with two Eastern European countries; and
a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans by non-resident relatives. The
Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.

ANNEX III: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In (Indian) FY2006–07 (April 1-March 31), Bank lending to India reached $2.45 billion, up
from $1.89 billion in FY05-06.3 World Bank support to India in Bank FY2008 is expected to
increase and again reach its targeted level consistent with the CAS. IFC also recorded a
strong commitment in Bank FY2007 of $1.047 billion. The World Bank Group’s program of
support combines policy dialogue with diversified IBRD/IDA lending, IFC investments and
analytical and advisory activities in the sectors that are important to reducing poverty and
sustaining growth.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors discussed a new Country Strategy (CAS) for India on
August 26, 2004. The CAS jointly covers the programs of IBRD/IDA and IFC for the period
of FY05–08. An update to the Strategy was presented to the Board on May 9, 2007. With
over one-quarter of the world’s poor in India, the overarching challenge is how to scale up
the impact of Bank Group assistance in order to help India move closer to achieving its
development goals—including the goal of halving poverty by 2015.
Scaling up assistance will entail a strengthened Bank Group program at the Center, as well as
more lending to the states compared to recent years. For state level lending, the strategy is to
retain an essentially reform and performance-based approach to the states, but also seek new
opportunities for engagement with the largest and poorest states in India in order to help
strengthen the environment for reform. The expansion in lending will primarily be for
investment in infrastructure development, human development and rural livelihoods.
Through adjustment lending, continued emphasis is also being placed on support to fiscal
and governance reforms at the state level.
Adjustment lending to finance state level reforms will be limited to 15 percent of total
IBRD/IDA lending for the CAS period. Overall lending levels will fall within an upper
bound of $2.15 billion per year for IBRD, on average for the four years of the CAS, and the
IDA limits for India established by the IDA Deputies. Financial operations since 1998/99 are
summarized below.

In Bank FY2007 (July 1–June 30), Bank lending totaled $3.75 billion, up from $1.42 billion in FY2006.

ANNEX IV: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public
sector loan commitments totaled $17.13 billion as of December 5, 2007 for 98 loans. With an
additional $0.8 billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total
loan commitments amounted to $17.93 billion. These funds have been provided from the
Bank’s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments
amounting to $0.2 billion. AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

AsDB’s is currently preparing its Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008–12. Core
operational strategy in India will continue to focus on poverty reduction through
infrastructure-led growth. More than 75 percent of its ongoing and proposed assistance
focuses on transport (national highways, state roads, and rural roads), urban (water and
sanitation, waste management, urban transport, city planning, and municipal reforms), and
energy (power sector reforms, investments for upgrading transmission and distribution
systems, hydropower generation, and improvement in energy efficiency) sector operations.

ANNEX V: INDIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an elaborate system for
compiling economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering
virtually all sectors of the economy. India subscribed to the SDDS on December 27, 1996
and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility
options for timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and
timeliness of labor market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF
Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data
dissemination practices against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six
datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) has recently reduced
the dissemination lag for quarterly releases from three to two months and released a new
series of national accounts, with base year 1999–2000 in February 2006.
4.
Price statistics: The consumer price indices (CPIs) are based on weights that are over
ten years old and do not fully capture price developments in the economy. However, since
January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a revised CPI for industrial workers with a
2001 base year and a Working Group is engaged in the revision of the current producer price
index to a new base. Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of
a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual
employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of
about one month. A wholesale price index (1993/94=100) is published weekly with a lag of
two weeks and is subject to large revisions, especially in periods of rising inflation. In
addition, the representativeness of the index may be undermined by the collection of prices
from a relatively small sample of products and the infrequent updating of weights.
5.
External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile
balance of payments statistics are broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5), the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) presentation does not strictly
follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage
problems, and data on trade prices, volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a
timely basis. Bilateral data on services exports to the United States and other developed
countries are manifold higher than counterpart services imports published by these same
countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag.
Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original
maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only
available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident
Indian accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors
prescribed in the BPM5 and these data are disseminated within six months of the reference

11
period in respect of annual data. Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by
the absence of appropriate legal or institutional authority. India began disseminating the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the
SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date information on certain variables, such as total
foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis
and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement on the RBI website.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI website and the RBI Bulletin publish a
wide array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components,
RBI’s survey, monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates,
exchange rates, foreign reserves, and results of government securities auctions. The
frequency and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM). Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM.
First, the resident sector data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral
distribution of domestic credit. Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the
authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data by (i) central government, (ii) state
government, and (iii) the commercial sector (including other financial corporations, public
and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors). Second, commercial banks
add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis only (instead of the
prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the
RBI has initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement
from the previous paper-based reporting which were prone to errors and delays. India has
also submitted to STA test data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs) that have been developed to implement the methodology outlined in
the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities in resolving the outstanding data issues on
the development of the SRFs.
9.
Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) posts selected central government
monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data on its website. However, no monthly data on
fiscal performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an
eight- to ten-month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government
operations. In addition, data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures
are available with considerable lag. There is also scope to improve the analytical usefulness
of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example, classification of government
expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures the
economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central government data (on a
cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) (latest
reported data correspond to 2006). Some limited general government data has been reported
for 2002.

Statement by the Staff Representative on India
January 23, 2008

1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board on December 27, 2007. This information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
While some recent data suggest that the Indian economy is slowing as
anticipated, the overall growth momentum remains intact. Industrial production growth
eased to 5⅓ percent y/y in November, partly owing to seasonal effects. While goods exports
have held up well, services export growth slowed sharply to 5½ percent during AprilSeptember 2007. Looking ahead, exports are expected to soften given the global slowdown,
but domestic demand should remain strong. Accordingly, staff have maintained a GDP
growth projection of 8¾ percent for 2007/08 and 8¼ percent for 2008/09. On the inflation
front, the WPI edged up to 3½ percent y/y in late December, as non-administered fuel prices
picked up. Staff has revised its annual inflation projection to 3.9 percent for 2007/08.
3.
Financial markets and capital inflows remain buoyant, despite deepening global
turbulence. The rupee has remained close to a nine-year high since late September, while the
Sensex has set new records. However, with reserve accumulation slowing in December (to
$3.5 billion, compared to a monthly average of $9.1 billion between April and November),
capital inflows may have eased recently. As of January 4, reserves stand at $276 billion.
Monetary conditions remain accommodative. In December, M3 grew by 23 percent and nonfood credit by 24 percent, while reserve money growth rose to 30 percent (all y/y). Shortterm rates have fallen 150 basis points over the last month (and are now at the bottom of the
policy rate corridor), reflecting expectations of a rate cut at the RBI’s January 29 meeting.
4.
Tax revenues have been stronger than expected. Corporate taxes have continued to
grow at an annual rate of about 40 percent in recent months, and personal incomes taxes at
about 35 percent. The central government’s fiscal deficit may come in below the budget
target. Better-than-budgeted fiscal performance is also likely at the state level. With its
introduction in Uttar Pradesh on January 1, 2008, all Indian states now have the VAT, an
important prerequisite for the introduction of the GST.
5.
Additional steps are in train to further develop financial markets. Beginning on
February 1, institutional investors (including foreign ones), in addition to retail investors, will
be allowed to short sell equities. In the corporate debt market, proposed regulatory changes
would simplify the primary issuance process for publicly listed firms and require the
exchange listing of private placements.

Statement by Adarsh Kishore, Executive Director for India
and Deepak Mohanty, Advisor to Executive Director
January 23, 2008
1.
We thank staff for their assessment of the recent performance of the Indian economy
and their suggestions to sustain the growth momentum while addressing the challenges
arising out of increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy. The
staff report captures the views of our authorities on a number of important issues that came
up for discussion in the course of Article IV consultations. There, however, appears to be
some difference of perception, particularly on management of the capital account and
exchange rate. We briefly highlight the macroeconomic outlook for 2007-08 in the context
of various risks and focus on some medium-term challenges.
Recent Performance and Outlook for 2007-08
2.
In the current decade there has been a noticeable acceleration in economic
growth. During the five years of the Tenth Plan period (2002-07) real GDP growth averaged
7.6 percent per annum. In the last two years (2005-07), real GDP growth accelerated even
further averaging 9.2 percent. In the first half of 2007-08, real GDP has increased by
9.1 percent over the corresponding period of the previous year. Growth has been more broadbased with a near double digit growth in industrial production and a pick up in agricultural
growth. It is expected that the current momentum would be sustained through the year as a
whole.
3.
Growth acceleration is well supported by increase in investment demand. At
1999-2000 market prices, the share of investment in GDP is estimated to have increased
from 30.7 percent in 2005-06 to 32.2 percent in 2006-07 and further to 34.6 percent in the
first half of 2007-08. As the current account deficit remains modest, the bulk of the
investment demand is financed by increase in domestic saving. The steady increase in
investment gives the cause for optimism that the economy may be moving into a high growth
trajectory.
4.
Inflation remains contained. During 2006-07 a major concern was possible
overheating and risks of a build up of inflationary pressures. India, being a net importer of
crude oil and a major consumer of foodgrains, remains vulnerable to both domestic and
international supply shocks. Despite the sharp increase in international oil prices and high
food prices, the headline inflation, as measured by year-on-year variation in the wholesale
price index (WPI), has come down to 3.5 percent by December 2007 as compared with
5.9 percent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Even the consumer price index
for industrial workers (CPI-IW), which has a larger share of food items, has come down from
6.3 percent in November 2006 to 5.5 percent by November 2007. The moderation in the
inflation outlook reflects liquidity management, and the effect of fiscal measures such as
import duty reductions, and administrative measures including import of essential
commodities. The policy endeavour is to contain headline inflation close to 5 percent in
2007-08, which is likely to be achieved if there are no major supply and liquidity shocks.

2
5.
Fiscal performance is expected to show further improvement. In 2006-07 both
the gross fiscal deficit and revenue deficit of the Central Government turned out to be lower
than budgeted. During 2007-08 so far revenue receipts have maintained their trend. Despite
some front loading of expenditure, in absolute terms, fiscal deficit decreased by 11 percent
and revenue deficit decreased by 17.2 percent during April-November 2007 compared with
the corresponding period of the previous year. It is expected that the end-year fiscal and
revenue deficit targets would be met and would be consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility
and Budget Management (FRBM) road map. Most state governments have adopted rule
based fiscal regime by enacting fiscal responsibility legislations. The combined gross fiscal
deficit of state governments is budgeted to moderate from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2006-07 to
2.3 percent in 2007-08. More importantly, the state governments are expected to generate a
revenue surplus during 2007-08. While the outlook for the combined fiscal position of the
Centre and States for 2007-08 seems positive, our authorities are aware that the risk of
overrun of expenditures remains.
6.
The balance of payments remain manageable though trade deficit continues to
expand. In 2006-07 merchandise exports, in US dollar terms, increased by 22.6 percent
while imports expanded by 24.5 percent resulting in a trade deficit of over US $ 59 billion.
This was largely offset by services exports and private remittances. Consequently, the
current account deficit was moderate at US $ 9.8 billion, 1.1 percent of GDP. During the
first eight months of 2007-08, both export and import growth rates have moderated over the
corresponding period of the previous year. Consequently, the trade deficit continues to
expand. Despite widening of the trade deficit, the current account deficit remained contained
at US $10.7 billion during the first half of 2007-08, almost at the same level of the
corresponding period of the previous year. For the year as a whole, the current account
deficit is expected to remain moderate. However, deceleration of export growth rate and
widening of trade deficit have raised concerns about the competitiveness of exports arising
out of the appreciation of the Indian Rupee.
7.
There has been a surge in capital inflows. Capital inflows nearly doubled from US
$ 25 billion in 2005-06 to US $ 46 billion in 2006-07. In fact net capital inflows have
crossed the US $ 50 billion mark during the first half of 2007-08 and staff projections show
that such inflows would reach US $ 110 billion during 2007-08. Thus it is important to
recognize that net capital inflows have more than quadrupled in a span of two years.
Undoubtedly the fundamentals of the Indian economy have strengthened but at this stage it is
not clear as to how much of capital inflows reflect the spillover of extraordinary liquidity
injection in advanced markets. Given the uncertainties associated with the current context of
global financial markets, our authorities prefer to exercise prudence before concluding that
there is a substantial structural shift in the trend of capital inflows. Large capital inflows,
however, have provided the opportunity to enhance the transparency of the source of
portfolio inflows into the economy. Moreover, the pace of liberalisation of capital outflow
has also been hastened. Actual capital flows (gross) due to external commercial borrowings
(ECB) were much higher at US $ 13.7 billion during the first half of 2007-08 as compared
with US $ 7.5 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year, despite the change in
ECB norms. Thus, the ECB measures need to be viewed in the context of modulating debtcreating flows, depending on the domestic investment requirement, rather than an exercise to
stopping such flows. Moreover, active management of capital inflows has not restrained

3
investment activity. The overall investment rate remains high which is largely financed by
domestic saving, with only about a quarter of net capital inflows during the last three years
being absorbed.
8.
Capital inflows have complicated monetary and exchange rate management. At
the current juncture, the major policy challenge is the management of capital flows and the
attendant implication for liquidity and overall stability. Sharp increase in capital inflows has
had three primary effects. Firstly, the exchange rate has appreciated. For example, the rupee
has already appreciated by around 10 percent against the US dollar between March 2007 and
January 2008. The exchange rate policy has been guided by broad principles of careful
monitoring and management of exchange rates with flexibility without any predetermined
target. Secondly, capital inflows in excess of the immediate absorptive capacity of the
economy have translated into an increase in reserves. During 2007-08 so far, foreign
exchange reserves increased by US $ 76.1 billion, to reach US $ 275.3 billion by endDecember 2007. It is important to recognize that India runs trade and current account deficits
in its balance of payments. The reserve accumulation has taken place despite significant
deficits. Given the current uncertainties in global financial markets and the spillover of
liquidity into emerging markets, it is a matter of judgment as to how much of the capital
inflows are of enduring nature. In absence of a reasonable answer to the determination of
nature of liquidity, it is also a matter of judgment how greater an exchange rate flexibility
will actually aid the process of easing the tensions of impossible trinity without damaging the
competitive efficiency of the economy. Finally, reserve accumulation has had a liquidity
impact. The expansionary monetary impact has, however, been largely sterilized by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) through deployment of multiple instruments – issuance of
bonds under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), increase in cash reserve ratio (CRR)
and daily open market operations (OMO). Despite the sterilization operations, growth of
money supply remains relatively high. However, credit growth has decelerated and currently
remains within the projected trajectory of the RBI. With the moderation of credit growth, it is
expected that aggregate demand would remain contained during 2007-08.
9.
Costs of sterilization need to be weighed against the imperatives of stability. The
determination of costs and benefits of sterilization is a complex issue. In the Indian context,
the financial costs of sterilization through issuance of MSS have been transparently set out in
the Government Budget. CRR and OMO being monetary instruments would in any case be
used to maintain appropriate liquidity to retain monetary control. While different objectives
of policy would have associated tradeoffs, on balance, reasonable stability has been
maintained in the domestic real and financial sectors, thus contributing to global growth and
stability. In the present context, given the multiple objectives, monetary policy retains the
flexibility to respond to events on a continuous basis. This has been made clear in the
periodic detailed quarterly reviews and is well understood by market participants.
10.
Financial market conditions are generally stable. The overnight interest rate
showed some volatility in the early part of 2007-08 reflecting excess liquidity conditions and
global developments. With appropriate policy measures, it has reverted to the interest rate
corridor set by the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) since August 2007. The yields on
long-term government bonds have edged down reflecting stable inflationary expectations.
While the sub-prime crisis in the US so far has had no major impact in the Indian financial

4
markets, the RBI has sensitized the market participants with an emphasis on vigilance and
preparedness in the context of global uncertainties. The buoyant conditions in the Indian
capital markets witnessed over the last few years continue to be supported with large
investment by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs).
Medium-term Challenges and Outlook
11.
Reforms remain imperative. While the recent performance of the Indian economy
has been impressive, our authorities are deeply conscious of the developmental challenges.
There is a clear recognition in the Approach to Eleventh Plan (2007-12) that without
significant new policy initiatives the current growth momentum cannot be sustained. There
is, therefore, a need to persevere with reforms to attain faster and more inclusive growth.
Inclusive Growth
12.
The growth acceleration has had a favourable impact on the living standard of
people. The percentage of persons below poverty line has declined from 36 percent of the
population in 1993-94 to 28 percent in 2004-05. About 47 million additional work
opportunities were created during 1999-2000 to 2004-05. Notwithstanding these positive
developments, far too many people still lack access to basic services such as health,
education, clean drinking water and sanitation facilities. Accordingly, the Eleventh Plan
(2007-12) sets out the vision to restructure policies to make economic growth more broadbased and inclusive while maintaining the pace of growth. The average GDP growth is
projected at 9 percent with acceleration through the plan period to end with a rate of around
10 percent. This would imply that with population growing at 1.5 percent per year, real per
capita income could double in 10 years.
Agriculture
13.
There is considerable emphasis on reinvigorating the agricultural sector which
provides employment to nearly 60 percent of the labour force. Agricultural growth has been
sluggish reflecting declining investment and absence of major technological breakthrough.
The Eleventh Plan envisages a doubling of agricultural growth rate to 4 percent per annum
through a step up in investment, expansion in irrigated areas, diversion into high value
products, easy access to credit, improvement in incentive structure and functioning of
markets. The Government is committed to an expenditure of Rs. 250 billion through public
investment in agricultural sector in the next four years. The Government has targeted a
disbursal of institutional agricultural credit of Rs. 2,250 billion during 2007-08. The reform
of the cooperative sector which is under way would further increase the flow of credit to the
agricultural sector on a sustainable basis. The challenges of providing rural infrastructure are
being addressed through a flagship government programme (Bharat Nirman).
Industry and Infrastructure
14.
The recent buoyancy in industrial performance reflects the competitiveness and
productivity of industry in an increasingly open economy amidst significant reduction in
tariffs. There is need for continued high growth of industry to absorb the disguised labour
force dependent on the agricultural sector. The demographic dividend could be realized only

5
if the labour force is provided with gainful employment. The Government recognizes the
shortage of skilled manpower and inadequate infrastructure as the most critical
barriers to the growth of the manufacturing sector. Accordingly, the Eleventh Plan
envisages raising public spending in education to 6 percent of GDP and ensuring elementary
education to all children by 2010. There is emphasis on significantly expanding vocational
education and skill developments both through public investment and public private
partnership (ppp).
15.
Given the large infrastructure requirement of the country, development of
infrastructure has been accorded high priority. Planning Commission have estimated the
investment required for infrastructure at Rs.20 trillion or US $ 500 billon. Preliminary
exercises suggest that investment in infrastructure would need to increase from the
current level of 5 percent of GDP to 9 percent. These investments are to be achieved
through a combination of public investment, ppp and exclusive private investment.
Achieving Fiscal Sustainability
16.
The Government is committed to achieving the FRBM targets on schedule. With
a buoyancy in tax revenues, the Government has comfortably met the half yearly target of
total non-debt receipts for 2007-08. With the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent in 2007-08 in
sight, the FRBM target of 3 percent by 2008-09 appears feasible. Despite pressure on
resources, the Government has remained committed to the path of fiscal prudence and
discipline.
17.
The Government recognizes the need to contain subsidies in order to achieve the
revenue deficit target. Apart from explicit subsidies, the issuance of bonds to oil companies,
Food Corporation of India and fertilizer units have fiscal implications though these are
considered cash neutral as there is no immediate cash outgo. The main objective of reform of
the subsidy regime is to make them explicit, transparent and work for the poor. Policy
options in the subsidy regime are aimed at improving the delivery with better targeting.
18.
The approach to direct tax reforms has been towards creating an increasingly
efficient, liberal and equitable tax system through reasonable tax rates, fewer exemptions
and wider tax base. In the case of indirect taxes, the policy has been to over time reduce
customs duty rates to ASEAN levels with significant reductions from year to year. The
strategy with regard to excise duty has been to continue the policy of expanding the tax base
rather than raise rates with an eventual move towards a single CENVAT rate. The tax base
has been broadened by bringing several new services into the tax net. As regards state
governments, the introduction of VAT has been a success. The reforms have resulted in
steady increase in tax to GDP ratio. The next major step in the reform of indirect taxation is
to move towards a national level Goods and Services Tax (GST) integrating the national
Excise Duties and Service Tax with state VAT by 2010.
19.
The tax administration has been strengthened through creation of new large
taxpayers units, expansion of mandatory electronic filing of returns, extension of e-payment
facility and making the permanent account number (PAN) as the sole identification number

6
for all participants in the securities market. These measures have resulted in a large increase
in income-tax assessees.
20.
As regards the expenditure policy, emphasis has shifted from outlays to
outcomes so as to ensure that the budgetary provisions are not only spent within the year but
the intended outcomes are actually achieved. There is a proposal to consolidate outcome
budgets of various ministries of the Government for transparency and better accountability.
Further, a set of austerity measures such as ban on creation of new posts has been
implemented. While the focus is on moderation of non-developmental expenditure, in view
of the growing need for expenditure on social sector and physical infrastructure, the approach
to fiscal consolidation continues to be revenue driven.
Ensuring Financial Stability
21.
As regards financial sector policy, the emphasis has been to develop a sound,
efficient and diversified financial system to facilitate a smooth transmission of monetary
policy with financial inclusion. The RBI has consistently emphasized the importance of
developing financial markets as well as operational flexibility of market participants in
various segments secured by effective regulation and oversight. Keeping in view the
increasing complexities and innovations in the organizational structures and processes in the
Indian banking system, the cross-border mergers and acquisitions by the Indian banks and
corporates and financial globalization, the RBI has taken several initiatives to provide greater
sophistication and refinement to its supervisory and regulatory processes. Some of those
initiatives are strengthening of the monitoring mechanism for the financial conglomerates in
coordination with the other peer regulators, reviewing the supervisory policy for the banks
which are the holding companies for the subsidiary entities in the Financial Conglomerates,
issues of discussion paper on an appropriate conglomerate structure in the Indian financial
system etc. There are also moves to put in place appropriate institutional arrangements for
cross-border supervision and supervisory cooperation.
22.
The emphasis in financial market has been to facilitate the ongoing integration
of various segments through expansion of instruments and focus on the underlying legal
framework. The recent initiatives include extension of short sales in government securities,
introduction of ‘When Issued’ market in central government securities and expansion of
hedging facilities in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of India Act has been
amended to strengthen the legal framework for regulation of OTC derivatives including
credit derivatives. Simultaneously, the credit delivery mechanism has been augmented with a
focus on agriculture, small and medium enterprises and inclusive growth.
23.
The banking system remains sound and well capitalized. In March 2007, the
capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.3 percent, well above the international norm. Indian banks
with international presence and foreign banks operating in India would be switching over to
Basel II in March 2008 followed by other banks by March 2009. Even with a migration to
Basel II, the present level of capital is considered comfortable as the additional capital
requirement is estimated at 1 percent. Despite strong credit growth for three years in
succession, the asset quality of banks continues to improve. The ratio of net NPAs to net
assets ratio stood at 1 percent in March 2007. However, the RBI has exercised great caution

7
and raised risk weights and provisioning requirements for real estate sector. The assets of the
banks in India continue to expand with an increase in the share of private sector and foreign
banks. Government ownership has not compromised the commercial character of functioning
of public sector banks. The return on total assets (RoA) of banks has improved over the
years to reach 0.9 percent in March 2007. The efficiency parameters of the Indian banking
system are comparable to many advanced countries. As on December 2007, 29 foreign banks
were operating in India with 273 branches besides 35 banks with representative offices. The
extent of presence of foreign banks exceeds the commitment made under the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). Moreover, both the public sector and private sector banks have
significant foreign share holdings.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 4, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with India
On January 23, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India’s economy continues to expand at a robust pace, with the growth rate averaging about
8½ percent in the four years through 2006/07 (April 2006-March 2007). Growth is fueled by
strong momentum in investment reflecting high capacity utilization, buoyant corporate profits
and business confidence, and a rise in productivity, within Asia surpassed only by China. A
favorable monsoon should deliver above average agricultural growth. Staff projects growth of
8¾ percent in 2007/08, moderating toward potential in the near term as external demand
weakens and past increases in interest rates dampen consumption growth.
After rising sharply in early 2007, Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation has ebbed to 3¼
percent due to decelerating food and manufacturing prices. While core inflation (excluding food
and energy) is also contained, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation exceeds WPI inflation by
over 2 percentage points. Staff projects WPI inflation to remain in the 3½−4 percent range in the
near term, though inflation risks are to the upside due to rising international food and fuel prices,
ample domestic liquidity, tight capacity utilizations, and rising skill premia.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

1

2
Export growth remains robust at over 20 percent year-on-year in U.S. dollar value, but buoyant
imports boosted by strong investment growth are projected to widen the trade deficit and raise
the current account deficit to 1½ percent of GDP in 2007/08.
Swelling capital inflows more than finance the current account deficit. Capital inflows reached a
record US$45 billion in 2006/07, and (as in other emerging markets) accelerated appreciably
this fiscal year, pushing the capital account into a projected surplus of 9½ percent of GDP in
2007/08. Given India’s vibrant growth outlook and sizeable capital demands, inflows will likely
remain strong. Nevertheless, with low levels of external debt, ample reserves and limits on the
amount and end-use of foreign debt financing, India’s external position is sustainable and robust
to significant shocks.
Capital inflows have lifted financial markets. Equity markets recovered quickly from the effects
of the U.S. subprime crisis. The real estate market in India has been buoyant, although lending
to this sector has been cooling recently reflecting past prudential measures by the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) to curb speculative pressures.
Strong capital inflows have put upward pressure on the rupee. After remaining roughly stable
since 2000, the rupee appreciated by 7 percent in real effective terms between December 2006
and August 2007, with most of the appreciation occurring in the first half of the year. The RBI
has accrued US$73 billion in reserves between end-March and end-November 2007,
intervening (purchasing foreign currency) to smooth volatility under the managed float. Rupee
flexibility is around a level comparable to other large emerging-markets currencies and the level
of the rupee remains in line with fundamentals.
Large capital inflows are complicating the conduct of monetary policy, creating excess liquidity
and pressuring the rupee. In addition to the exchange rate appreciation, several steps were
taken to tighten monetary conditions. Since October 2006, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) has
risen 200 basis points, while the repo (lending) rate was hiked twice by 25 basis points in the 12
months prior to the October 2007 policy meeting. With WPI inflation ebbing and real estate
prices and credit growth slowing, the RBI left policy rates on hold at its October 2007 policy
meeting, but raised the CRR by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent. As capital inflows swell, tensions
in the monetary policy framework between exchange rate stability, monetary independence and
financial openness are beginning to emerge.
Fiscal consolidation has been mixed, and slowed in 2006/07. Including off-budget bond
issuance, the general government deficit held steady at about 7¼ percent of GDP. The central
government deficit remained at 4½ percent of GDP, with buoyant tax revenue offset by higher
expenditure. The states’ aggregate fiscal deficit rose marginally to 2¾ percent of GDP.
Revenues performed well, though expenditure rose faster on the back of rising public
investment. Public debt remains high, at nearly 80 percent of GDP in March 2007.
Banks’ balance sheets remain healthy according to standard indicators of financial soundness.
While retail and real estate credit have grown significantly, risk measures have improved and
banks’ sizeable capital buffers indicate that the credit cycle is likely to be manageable.
Corporate leverage is rising but remains low.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended India’s outstanding economic performance and its success in
reducing poverty, a tribute to the authorities’ sound macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms. India’s economy has been resilient in the face of heightened global uncertainties,
slowing U.S. growth, and high world oil prices, and is expected to expand by 8¾ percent this
fiscal year as a result of rising productivity and investment. India’s favorable outlook has
attracted record capital inflows, which help finance investment but also present challenges to
managing capital markets integration.
The key challenge facing the authorities is to sustain rapid and inclusive growth, foster job
creation, and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability in the context of large capital
inflows. Directors endorsed the authorities’ policy priorities, which are to manage financial
globalization and tackle supply constraints through an enhanced monetary framework, financial
sector development, fiscal consolidation, and removal of structural bottlenecks.
Directors commended the authorities’ success in containing inflation and maintaining domestic
financial stability. They observed that large capital inflows have exacerbated tensions among
exchange rate stability, monetary independence, and financial openness. They supported the
central bank’s active management of liquidity and accommodation of increased exchange rate
volatility, while noting the appreciation pressures on the rupee. Directors concurred that rupee
appreciation reflected strong fundamentals and increasing productivity, and saw the policy of a
managed float as remaining appropriate. A number of Directors, however, expressed concern
that rupee appreciation has adversely affected India’s external competitiveness in certain laborintensive sectors. These Directors supported the authorities’ cautious and pragmatic approach
to managing capital flows, including through temporary capital controls, while commending the
authorities’ intention to move to fuller capital account convertibility gradually over the medium
term. Some Directors cautioned against restrictions on capital inflows, emphasizing that
increased exchange rate flexibility, strengthened monetary operations, and more effective
communication with markets could be a better way to increase monetary policy effectiveness in
a more financially open environment.
Directors emphasized that broader and deeper financial markets could better intermediate
capital inflows, accommodate exchange rate volatility, and support financial stability and
economic growth. They encouraged the authorities to press ahead with developing domestic
corporate bond and derivatives markets, and to implement more market-based monetary
operations. Enhancing banks’ efficiency can also improve financial intermediation.
Directors welcomed the Reserve Bank of India’s focus on preserving financial stability through
close scrutiny of banks and efforts to improve banks’ risk management. While they commended
the overall soundness of the financial system, Directors called for continued vigilance,
particularly in light of the rapid growth of real estate credit. Directors welcomed the forthcoming
implementation of the Basel II supervisory framework, and looked forward to the publication of
the authorities’ self-assessment of financial stability and development.
On the fiscal front, Directors welcomed the continued buoyancy of tax revenues, but noted that
with public expenditure and debt still relatively high, more rapid fiscal consolidation is warranted.

4
A tighter fiscal stance could also help offset the liquidity impact of buoyant capital inflows and
thus relieve appreciation pressures. Directors stressed that expenditure reforms are needed to
create space for priority spending. In this connection, they noted the growing fuel subsidy
burden and the need to adapt to higher international oil prices through a phased reduction in
subsidies for most fuel products, while ensuring that adequate and well-targeted safety nets are
in place to protect the poor. Directors welcomed plans for a national goods and services tax,
and noted that cutting tax exemptions, increasing user fees and further improving tax
administration would improve the tax base.
Directors urged greater progress in structural reforms to ease real sector rigidities, boost
productivity and competitiveness, and ensure that the benefits of growth are widely shared.
They concurred with the priorities identified in the government’s “inclusive growth” agenda:
bridging infrastructure gaps with private sector participation, ensuring access to social services,
and promoting a competitive environment that supports private sector investment and job
creation. Toward these goals, Directors emphasized that more flexible labor regulations can
facilitate the reallocation of labor to stronger sectors, while higher and more effective public
spending on education is needed to address the skills gap.
