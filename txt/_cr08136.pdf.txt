EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Lesotho made further progress toward macroeconomic stability in 2006. After sluggish
economic activity in earlier years, real economic growth surged, reflecting accelerated
mining production and the recovery of the textile sector. High Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) revenue in 2006 contributed to a fiscal surplus, improved external accounts,
and a significant increase in international reserves. Inflation has increased in the last year,
driven by rising food and energy prices. The outlook is positive, but subject to risks arising
mostly from the external environment.
Key Policy Issues
Maintaining a strong medium-term fiscal position will be key for macroeconomic stability
and growth, given the fixed exchange rate and Lesotho’s vulnerability to external shocks.
Staff recommended prudent use of SACU revenues and urged the authorities to resist
pressures for higher public expenditure across the board. The authorities concurred with the
staff that the medium-term outlook is clouded by uncertainty about revenue sharing in
SACU, global trade in textiles, and remittances from workers in South Africa. A slowdown
in the U.S. poses short-term risks.
Sustained, rapid and broad-based growth is needed to reduce widespread poverty. Staff
encouraged the authorities to implement vigorously their agenda to promote private sector
development to unleash growth potential. Important measures include fostering financial
intermediation, improving the legal and judicial environment, and improving infrastructure.
Macroeconomic policies are consistent with external and domestic stability, and there is no
immediate threat to external stability.
Unlicensed deposit-taking entities pose risks to economic and social stability; the authorities
expressed their intention to address this issue. The rapid growth of insufficiently regulated
credit cooperatives gives cause for some concern; the authorities intend to strengthen the
regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial sector.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Lesotho is a small, low-income country, with limited natural resources and a
narrow production and export base, and with close economic linkages to South Africa.
A majority of the population lives on subsistence agriculture. The garment sector, which
relies on imported inputs, plays a critical role in employment, output, and exports. With
Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa, Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary
Area (CMA). The Lesotho loti is pegged at par to the South African rand, which is also
legal tender in Lesotho. CMA members and Botswana constitute the SACU. Economic
growth has been inconsistent, poverty has declined from 67 percent of households
in 1994/95 to a still high 57 percent in 2002/03, and HIV/AIDS prevalence is high.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Macroeconomic performance in 2006 was strong. After growing sluggishly in
earlier years, real GDP rose 7.2 percent, driven by booming diamond production, a recovery
of the garment industry, and good performance in the agriculture and services sectors.
Reflecting high transfers from SACU and exports of textiles and diamonds, the current
account balance registered a substantial surplus and gross international reserves increased to
six months of imports. 2 The recovery of the garment industry was facilitated by the
extension of the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)3, a cut in corporate tax
rates, and a depreciation of the rand. Inflation has increased since the last quarter of 2006
owing to rising food and energy prices, but remains in the single digits, broadly mirroring
trends in South Africa. In July 2007

2

Lesotho’s SACU receipts have risen sharply since 2003/04, repeatedly exceeding budget forecasts and
resulting in large “windfalls.” The very large transfers in recent years reflect buoyant SACU revenue (mostly
due to rapidly rising import duty and excise revenues collected by South Africa) and the transition from the old
to a new revenue-sharing formula agreed in 2002 (IMF Country Report 05/437).

3

At the time of the 2006 Article IV consultation, the prospects for the textile industry were unfavorable. The
multi fiber agreement (MFA) ended in 2005, and AGOA’s third-country provision was scheduled to lapse in
2007. However, this provision, allowing quota- and tariff-free entry to the U.S. of Lesotho’s garments produced
with third-country fabrics, has been extended through 2012.

4

In July 2007, the UN called on the international community to help Lesotho cope with food shortages and
drought. To date, $11.6 million has been provided by various donors, including the U.S., Canada, France, the
European Commission, various UN agencies and the African Development Bank.

3.
The fiscal position and public debt sustainability indicators have improved. The
overall balance registered a record surplus of 16 percent of GDP in 2006/07. This surplus
(the third in a row and well above budget projections) is largely the result of an increase in
SACU receipts and the limited execution of capital projects due to inadequate capacity in
line ministries and complex procurement procedures, as well as one-off gains in domestic
revenue that offset the decline in corporate tax rates. Most of the surplus was saved at the
Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL). The use of part of the SACU windfall to retire
nonconcessional debt helped improve debt indicators, with ratios of external debt to GDP
and debt service to exports of goods and nonfactor services falling, respectively, from
58 percent and 10 percent in 2003 to 43 percent and 6½ percent in 2006.

4.
Broad money grew by 35½ percent in 2006. Coupled with a decline in net
domestic assets reflecting the government surplus, among other factors, this resulted in a
strong increase in net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking system. NFA and money growth
also show the effect of rising workers’ remittances.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
5.
The discussions focused on preserving fiscal sustainability to ensure macroeconomic
stability given the fixed exchange rate; attaining sustainable and broad-based growth,

9
especially through private sector development; and strengthening external and internal
economic stability.
Box 1. Response to Previous Recommendations
Over the years staff and authorities have generally agreed on the main economic
challenges facing Lesotho. In 2006 staff recommended preserving fiscal sustainability,
improving public expenditure management, and accelerating reforms aimed at fostering
private-sector led growth. The government delivered a substantial fiscal surplus
in 2006/07, and has emphasized public financial management issues and private sector
development in its structural reform agenda. The pace of structural reform has been
slow mainly due to implementation constraints.

A. Economic Outlook
6.
Near-term economic prospects are favorable. Real GDP growth is projected at
about 5 percent in 2007 and could average nearly 5 ½ percent in the following years,
propelled by continued expansion in mining, moderate growth of the garment industry (the
recovery has taken place without new investments, and limited factory space is a
bottleneck), and a pick-up in construction driven by high public investment. Agriculture is
expected to make a negative contribution in 2007 due to the drought. The authorities project
somewhat faster growth, especially in the garment sector. Growth will require diligent
implementation of the investment projects included in the MCC compact. Staff agreed with
the authorities that SACU revenues are likely to remain high at least through 2009/10
because of high economic activity in South Africa. Remittances are anticipated to rise in
nominal terms—although diminishing as a ratio to GDP—as the increase in average pay
should more than offset the decline in the number of workers resulting from structural
changes in South African mines.

The main risk to the real economy is the deterioration of the external
environment. The evolution of the global regime for trade in textiles will affect Lesotho’s
export sector. In particular, there is

sector. Short run, the slowdown in the

11
U.S. economy could affect orders for garment producers. A steeper downward trend in
remittances from abroad would affect consumption.
8.
A significant medium-term risk, especially for the budget, concerns the
evolution of SACU revenues. SACU revenues could be affected by a slowdown in South
Africa and trade liberalization. More fundamentally, South Africa has called for a review of
SACU’s revenue-sharing arrangements, although it has not submitted a concrete proposal.
In addition, the call for SADC to evolve into a customs union raises uncertainty about the
durability of existing rules. The authorities believe that negotiations for a new revenuesharing formula might be prolonged and it could take a long time to reach a consensus.
Likewise, a SADC customs union would take time to materialize and the revenue
implications for Lesotho would need to be taken into account.
9.
Authorities and staff agreed also that unlicensed deposit-taking entities pose
significant risk to the financial system (see paragraph 25 below). The growth of a weakly
supervised credit cooperative sector is also worrisome.
B. Fiscal Policy and Reforms
10.
After the fiscal surpluses of recent years, the 2007/08 budget raises some
concerns. The high level of spending in the 2007/08 budget—an increase of 5 percentage
points of GDP in current expenditure and a more than doubling of capital expenditure to
16 percent of GDP—could undermine fiscal sustainability and spending quality. Even if it is
not expected that the budget will be fully executed, the amount of slack in the
appropriations reduces the budget’s usefulness as a programming instrument. The
authorities confirmed that, taking into account actual spending capacity (“outturn basis”),
they project a significantly better balance in 2007/08 than the approved budget suggests,
and stated that current budgeting procedures tend to generate excessively high
appropriations.

11.
Staff supported the medium-term fiscal stance represented in the authorities’
projections on an outturn basis and under unchanged policies, while noting that
implementing it will be challenging.5 Reflecting high SACU revenue, sustained nonSACU domestic revenue, and strict expenditure policies, the medium term fiscal framework
(MTFF) projects fiscal surpluses (excluding grants) through 2010/11, even though
government investment is substantially above its level of recent years. This projection
implies a significant reduction in current expenditure as a ratio to GDP, which will be
difficult to deliver; the projected revenue provides some margin of safety, but the risks to
revenue itself advise against using up such margin.
12.
Avoiding a generalized expenditure increase is key to preserve fiscal
sustainability, but spending pressures are significant. Staff cautioned against using the
SACU revenue windfall, temporary by definition, to raise recurrent spending. Specifically,
staff recommended adopting a cautious approach to the introduction of the pension reform
and the upcoming salary review, and limiting recruitment to priority areas. The authorities
agreed in principle, but felt that pension reform will likely be costly and that Lesotho is
losing qualified professionals such as nurses and teachers to South Africa and other
countries, which suggests that increasing salaries for certain categories of civil servants may
be justifiable.
13.
The envisaged increase in public investment poses challenges. The underspending of the capital budget in past years reveals weaknesses in the programming and
execution of projects. The government intends to increase flexibility in its procedures to
release resources to those projects moving fast. It is essential that the government redouble
its efforts to improve project execution, especially in view of the fact that the MCC funds
will be lost if they are not used within five years. To speed up the execution of some
domestically-financed investments, the authorities have started using public-private
partnerships (PPPs).6 Staff agreed that PPPs could supplement government’s
implementation capacity, but recommended that PPPs only be used when they deliver
higher value for money than traditional government investment. Moreover, managing PPPs
requires careful contract drafting and close monitoring. The authorities are aware of these
challenges, and indicated their intention to seek technical assistance from relevant agencies.
14.
Strengthening expenditure management will help ensure a good level and
quality of spending. Staff welcomed progress made in this area in the context of the Public
Sector Improvement and Reform Program (PSIRP), which includes the introduction of a
medium-term expenditure framework, strengthening budget planning and execution, and

13
public procurement reform. All line ministries are preparing budget framework papers for
the 2008/09 budget that will cover a three year period. However, due to capacity limitations
in line ministries, the full MTEF is being piloted in six ministries. Staff encouraged the
authorities to extend the MTEF to all ministries as soon as feasible, following the
recommendations of the PEMFAR assessment. Staff and authorities agreed that the use of
the MTEF would help further align the budget with development priorities.
15.
Debt and financial management needs to be reinforced. Staff welcomed the
decision to use part of the surplus to pay off expensive nonconcessional debt. Nevertheless,
the payment of substantial amounts (totaling nearly 5 percent of GDP in the last two years)
to retire debts accumulated outside the conventional budgetary framework underscores the
need for tight control of government’s obligations.7 The authorities expect their financial
management reforms to help prevent similar problems in the future.
16.
An updated DSA shows Lesotho’s external and public debts to be sustainable,
although there is a moderate risk of debt distress (see supplement 2). In the baseline
scenario debt should continue to decline over the medium term. However, in some adverse
scenarios some debt indicators might rise above levels that are considered sustainable for
low-income countries. The authorities generally agreed with this assessment.
C. Achieving Broad-based and Sustainable Economic Growth
17.
The authorities underlined their intention to continue to focus on pro-growth
policies to achieve poverty reduction. While the output growth observed in 2006 was
strong, it reflected in part the performance of sectors with limited linkages to the rest of the
economy and a favorable external environment. Reducing poverty, improving living
standards, and more generally making progress towards the MDGs depend on achieving
sustainable and broadly based growth. In this context, staff recommended looking beyond
the lapse of AGOA in 2015 and giving due priority to the challenges of the rural economy.
Authorities and staff agreed that attaining sustainable growth will require a major effort to
improve the quality of Lesotho’s institutions.
18.
The mission provided feedback on the authorities’ draft Growth Strategy
Paper (GSP). The GSP seeks to identify binding constraints on growth and to collate prior
development programs to derive policy recommendations, emphasizing the improvement of
the investment climate, especially in key sectors, and the enhancement of infrastructure and
skills. To be most useful, the GSP should be congruent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS), provide a strategic approach to the challenges and opportunities arising from the
proximity to South Africa, and outline a multi-year implementation agenda that may be

reflected in the MTEF. The authorities indicated that these are elements they intend to
incorporate in their growth strategy.
19.
Staff welcomed the inclusion of a Private Sector Development Component in
the compact signed with the MCC. Effective implementation of this program and of the
ongoing Private Sector Competitiveness Program should relieve some constraints on
growth, notably inadequate infrastructure and low access to credit. In this regard, to
improve the business environment and reduce “red tape,” the authorities have launched a
one-stop trade facilitation center for foreign investors, which is part of their private sector
development agenda (Box 2).
Box 2. Private Sector Development Agenda
The current reform strategy aims at:
•

mitigating structural constraints, such as high transport costs, availability of
water and electricity;

•

reducing the cost of doing business by improving the legal, judicial, and
regulatory framework;

•

raising labor productivity through improvements in education and health and
demand-driven skills development programs; and

•

increasing access to bank financing.

Many donors and international agencies are assisting the government in these reforms.

D. External Stability
20.
Economic policies have been
consistent with external stability.
Staff shared the authorities’ view that
the current exchange rate system
should be maintained. It promotes
price stability in Lesotho and
facilitates capital and current
transactions with South Africa,
Lesotho’s most important economic
partner. Prudent fiscal policies have
underpinned the continued viability
of this arrangement.

Standard assessments of the real exchange rate and the current account suggest
no immediate threat to external stability (Box 3 and Selected Issues Paper). While the
appreciation of the rand between 2002 and 2005 reduced some measures of cost
competitiveness in Lesotho, its depreciation in 2006 and so far in 2007 and recent
adjustments in corporate tax rates seem to have stemmed that trend. The projections for the
current account over the next few years are consistent with an improvement in Lesotho’s
NFA position. To the extent that it may be financed by capital transfers (such as some MCC
grants) and FDI, a reduction in the current account balance would not raise significant
concerns. Nevertheless, Lesotho’s external stability is subject to uncertainty in the medium
term (see paragraphs 7-8), which raises the margin of error of the methodologies used.
Box 3. Assessing the Real Exchange Rate
Lesotho pegs its currency to that of South Africa, from where most of its imports and inflation come, and
sends most of its exports outside SACU. Thus, Lesotho’s REER is essentially a smoothed version of
South Africa’s, and largely independent of its fundamentals. Conversely, Lesotho’s current account and
growth depend heavily on factors unrelated to its REER and outside the country’s control, such as
AGOA and SACU transfers. These factors are surrounded by a degree of uncertainty, especially in the
outer years of the medium term projections. This suggests taking the estimates of current account norms
shown below with caution. With these caveats, the various approaches used yielded no consistent
evidence of misalignment.
When Lesotho’s medium-term fundamentals are used, the macroeconomic balance approach, based on
the regression estimates of CGER (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110806.pdf, Table 1),
produces a current account norm that is 1¾ points of GDP weaker than projected for 2007. The
fundamentals used in this analysis are the medium term values of the fiscal balance (which incorporates
a projected reduction in SACU transfers as a ratio to GDP), the old-age dependency ratio, population
growth, oil balance and relative income.
The external sustainability approach indicates that the current account balance that would stabilize the
ratio of net foreign assets to GDP at the 2006 level would be 1 percent of GDP weaker than projected for
2011 (also including the decline in
800
1
SACU transfers mentioned above).

The absolute version of the purchasing
power parity (PPP) approach estimates
the deviation of the loti’s REER from
its “long-run level” based on an
international comparison of price levels
adjusted for productivity differentials.
Under this approach, the loti was
undervalued by 19 percent in 2006, but
the margin of error (at a 90 percent
confidence level) is larger than this.
On the other hand, Lesotho’s dollar
wage in the garment industry remains
relatively high by the standard of the
last decade, although below its 2005 peak.

Staff supported further gradual accumulation of international reserves. The
CBL’s net international reserves (NIR) target seeks to ensure the viability of the exchange
rate peg of the loti to the rand, and should be considered a floor. Currently, reserves exceed
the target, reflecting the saving of recent SACU revenue windfalls. The continuation of
Lesotho’s prudent fiscal stance should result in further accumulation of foreign assets in the
near to medium term, provided that SACU transfers remain elevated. This is to be
welcomed, in view of uncertainties that loom ahead. The authorities indicated that it might
not be optimal to accumulate international reserves at the CBL indefinitely. Staff agreed
that other options for managing the future accumulation of external assets should be
considered as long as they held to high standards of governance and transparency.
E. Financial Sector Issues
23.
The banking system is solid, but access to banking services for households and
SMEs remains limited. The banking system, dominated by three South African banks, is
profitable, well-capitalized, and liquid; nonperforming loans (NPLs) are moderate and well
provisioned. Possible vulnerabilities might result from a relatively high and increasing
concentration on the asset side of the banks’ balance sheets. A challenge going forward is to
increase the role, so far limited, of the banking system in financing domestic firms and
households. The authorities indicated that the ongoing strengthening of Lesotho Postbank
together with an ordered development of microfinance would increase population access to
financial services. It is also expected that efforts to formalize land titling, build the credit
bureau, and reform commercial courts will increase the availability and quality of bank
credit to the economy.

Since 2005, affected by the operations of two new banks.

24.
The rapid growth of the credit cooperative sector calls for better regulation and
supervision. Credit cooperatives have grown in response to the low access to bank credit.
Taking advantage of loopholes in regulations, they often engage in financial intermediation
with nonmembers without adequate supervision. The extent of the operations of these
cooperatives is not well known, and the quality of supervision is limited at present. The
authorities concurred with this assessment and stated that technical assistance is expected
from the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). The measures currently
contemplated include the revision of the regulation and supervision framework and a
strengthening of the role of the CBL, which at present has no jurisdiction in this area.
25.
The operation in Lesotho of unlicensed deposit-taking entities poses significant
risks to depositors and potentially to social stability. These vehicles have attracted
sizable deposits from the public by offering inordinately high rates of return (60 percent a
year in one case), accumulating large and fast-growing liabilities that will be exceptionally
difficult to meet. These vehicles face significant rollover risks, implying a high probability
of failure with possible social and macroeconomic repercussions, as many thousands of
savers could lose their investments. Their operation may create opportunities for money
laundering and could undermine deposit-taking activities of the banks, although an eventual
failure of those entities should not pose significant credit risk to banks. Staff noted that the
liabilities of the largest vehicles had become quite large (about 8 percent of GDP) and that
their unwinding might cause social tension. Staff encouraged the authorities to seek the
support of regulatory agencies in partner countries with relevant expertise and take early
action, and reiterated that the Fund is ready to help within the limits of its mandate and
expertise. The authorities said they intend to address this issue and would approach some of
their development partners for input should the need arise.
F. PRS Process
26.
The authorities are preparing a final report on the implementation of the
PRS 2003/04–2006/07. Staff noted that efforts made during that period were significant, but
capacity limitations prevented the full implementation of the actions envisioned in the PRS.
Staff observed that timely progress reports might have signaled implementation difficulties,
and encouraged the authorities to improve the collection of economic and social statistics in
support of monitoring the results of the PRS. The authorities intend to prepare a new PRS
that will include some of the elements still pending and reflect the growth strategy under
preparation and the results of the 2002 household budget survey. This PRS should be
finalized by April, 2008; meanwhile, the PRS 2003/04–2006/07 remains operative.
27.
HIV/AIDS is highlighted as a cross-cutting challenge in the PRS. Its impact on
society and the economy is high, but difficult to quantify. Donor and budget resources are
used to provide treatment and promote prevention, but implementation capacity is
insufficient.

18
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Lesotho has continued to make progress in macroeconomic stabilization.
External developments have supported the acceleration of growth and the improvement in
the balance of payments. Taking advantage of these trends, the maintenance of prudent
macroeconomic policies has resulted in significant improvements in the fiscal and external
balances and the buildup of international reserves, consolidating the exchange rate peg.
29.
Near-term economic prospects for Lesotho are positive, but there are a number
of areas of uncertainty. The major factors behind the surge in output in 2006 are likely to
continue, and investment prospects have been boosted by the MCC compact. However,
there are risks related to the worsening of the external environment, including a possible
slowdown in export markets. The medium-term outlook is subject to uncertainty about
SACU’s revenue sharing regime, global trade in textiles and its regime, and remittances
from workers in South Africa. These factors are largely beyond Lesotho’s control, and the
country should prepare for possible adverse developments. Consistent with this assessment,
the DSA indicates that external debt would decline in the baseline scenario, although there
is a moderate risk of debt distress.
30.
Large SACU revenue windfalls have been managed prudently so far, and
pressures for generalized expenditure increases should be resisted. The surge in
spending envisaged in the 2007/08 budget is problematic, even if it is unlikely to be fully
executed. As the DSA indicates, there seem to be limited immediate threats to fiscal
sustainability and there is room to increase productive public investment in the next few
years. Nevertheless, going forward it will be prudent to contain recurrent spending given the
uncertainty about SACU revenues in the medium term. In particular, the upcoming salary
review should be approached carefully, just as the pension reform. It is important to address
weaknesses in the budget process and extend the MTEF to all ministries.
31.
The government should continue to use grants and own resources to boost
public investment, especially in infrastructure. Executing the desired public investment
is a challenge that must be addressed to fully utilize MCC’s resources. While PPPs have a
role in public investment, the government needs to build up its capacity to manage them
effectively.
32.
The authorities’ effort to develop a growth strategy is welcome. The government
intention to draw up a strategy that may guide the formulation of medium term fiscal plans
and institutional reform initiatives is appropriate. It will be necessary to ensure that such
strategy is congruent with the PRS.
33.
Staff encourages the authorities to implement vigorously their structural
reforms. The Public Sector Improvement and Reform Program, the Private Sector
Development Component of the MCC compact, and the World Bank-supported Private

19
Sector Competitiveness Program aim to relieve important constraints on growth. These
programs target institution building, which is key to achieving sustainable growth.
34.
The monetary and exchange rate regime has been beneficial and should be
preserved, along with the prudent policy mix that makes it viable. Membership in the
CMA and the peg of the loti to the rand have ensured stable and low inflation and facilitated
capital and commercial exchanges with South Africa. Fiscal restraint in the face of strong
SACU revenues has ensured external stability by helping keep NIR at levels consistent with
the sustainability of the peg.
35.
The banking system appears solid, but access to banking services for
households and SMEs is limited, which has fostered the growth in weakly supervised
credit cooperatives. Current efforts to improve their regulation and supervision and to
increase access to banking services should be intensified.
36.
The operation of unlicensed deposit-taking entities gives cause for concern.
These vehicles have large and fast-growing liabilities, face constant rollover risks, and pose
significant risks of failure. The longer they continue to operate, the larger their liabilities
will grow and the higher the risk of social and financial repercussions. Staff urges the
authorities to take prompt action to address this issue.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Article IV Consultation:

The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on October 6, 2006
(EBM/06/85-1; 10/06/2006). Executive Directors commended the authorities for their
continued efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability under difficult circumstances. They
welcomed the continued improvement in the fiscal balance and the external current account
position, as well as the prudent use of the SACU revenue windfall. Directors considered that
finding the basis for consistent high growth over the medium term to help address poverty,
achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and confront the high incidence of HIV/AIDS,
will be the primary challenge for the authorities in the period ahead. Directors observed that
the further loss of trade preferences and declining revenues from the South African Customs
Union (SACU) were significant downside risks over the medium term. In that light, Directors
considered that the key policy challenges were to implement structural reforms aimed at
stimulating broad-based growth and to strengthen the medium term fiscal position.

II. LESOTHO: RELATIONS WITH
A.

THE WORLD BANK

Partnership in Lesotho’s Development Strategy

1.
The government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), was finalized in 2005
following an extensive nationwide participatory consultation process. The PRS builds on a
number of government documents and initiatives, including the I-PRSP, National Vision
2020, National Goals, and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The PRS has three
interconnected goals: (i) create jobs through the establishment of an environment that
facilitates private sector-led economic growth; (ii) empower the poor and the vulnerable and
improve their access to health care and education; and (iii) deepen democracy and improve
public sector performance to ensure that policies and legal frameworks facilitate the full
implementation of priorities.
2.
Several limitations and risks in the implementation of the PRS related to its
translation into actual work plans, possible further shocks to the economy, weak governance,
and a lack of political will were identified during the preparation of the Joint Staff
Assessment Note. It was suggested that the development of a comprehensive medium-term
macroeconomic framework, taking into account Lesotho’s external vulnerability and
competitiveness, and improving the monitoring and evaluation framework would facilitate
PRS implementation. The Government is currently reviewing progress made in the
implementation of the PRS, and plans to update the PRS based on further analysis from
newly available poverty and census data, in consultations with key stakeholders.
3.
Lesotho’s key Development Partners are working together to develop a common
framework of support around the PRS. They are currently engaged with the Government in
strengthening national systems and improving public sector institutions to pave the way for
providing joint budget support.
B.

Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas

4.
The World Bank and the IMF continue to cooperate closely in assisting the
Government of Lesotho to implement its poverty reduction and development strategy, with
each institution taking the lead in the policy dialogue in its areas of expertise. The IMF leads
on macroeconomic policy (fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies) and on the following
areas of structural reforms: fiscal management and tax administration reform. The Bank will
continue to lead the policy dialogue on sectoral reforms, including public expenditure
management, employment generation through private sector development, decentralization,
infrastructure development, education, health, combating HIV/AIDS, and poverty
assessment, monitoring and evaluation. Areas of close collaboration include the PRS, debt
sustainability analysis, public sector reform, financial sector reform and trade. The Bank and
Fund staff routinely exchange views on these and other issues.
The Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy
5.
The Bank Group’s assistance strategy (CAS) for Lesotho for FY 06-09 was approved
in April 2006 and is guided by the government’s PRS and the MDGs. The CAS proposes

7
four key strategic objectives which will frame the Bank Group’s assistance over the coming
years: (i) fighting HIV/AIDS; (ii) employment and income generation through higher
economic growth; (iii) improving human development outcomes; and (iv) decentralization,
public service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation. To achieve enhanced impact, the
CAS proposes a results framework that sets out desired outcomes and defines key
intermediate indicators. In terms of instruments, the Bank will continue to invest in high
quality analytic work to underpin a strategic IDA lending program. The proposed program
draws on the lessons of the last CAS and is designed to mitigate risks that could hinder the
effectiveness of Bank support.
Poverty Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation
6.
A Poverty, Gender and Social Assessment has being initiated with the objective of
providing an analysis of the key opportunities, constraints, and risks to sustainable poverty
reduction from the perspective of households, communities, the government and institutions
by analyzing the past and present and drawing lessons for the future. The assessment will
provide policy and program recommendations on how to achieve more inclusive and
accountable institutions and sustainable poverty reduction. A review of the Concept Note has
been undertaken and the draft shared with the Government and other Development Partners.
The assessment will draw on the data recently released on the Household Income and
Expenditure Survey and the preliminary Census data among other sources. The Report is
welcomed by all parties as current poverty analytics are weak and outdated. The findings
from the report will feed into the annual PRS progress report and the proposed Poverty
Reduction Support Credit.
7.
The Bank is also supporting government efforts at establishing a National Monitoring
and Evaluation system.
Public Sector Reform and Public Expenditure Management
8.
The government of Lesotho recognizes that strengthening public expenditure
management is critical to improving service delivery and make progress towards attaining its
development goals. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of public services, the
government has launched an ambitious public sector improvement reform program (PSIRP)
to be implemented over the next 3–5 years. The program is being supported by Lesotho’s key
development partners and its successful implementation is expected to provide a sound basis
for future budget support to Lesotho’s PRS.
9.
The Bank has finalized the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR), in close collaboration with the Government. The
PEMFAR aims to strengthen the analytical base for making decisions about the size and
composition of public expenditure to have maximum impact on growth and poverty
reduction. The PEMFAR also includes an assessment using the approach developed under
the multi-donor Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) program. The
PEFA assessment confirms that progress has been made in the planning and formulation
aspects of budgeting, but also confirms persistent problems relating to long-standing
weakness in internal control, accounting delays, audit backlogs and poor fiscal reporting.

8
Decentralization and Empowerment of Local Communities
10.
The Bank has finalized a report entitled, Decentralization and Demand Driven
Service Delivery in support of the ongoing decentralization process in Lesotho. It supports
Lesotho’s PRS and CAS Strategic Objective of “improving governance through
decentralization and empowerment of local communities.” The report has been prepared
jointly with the GOL and GTZ. The objectives were (1) to strengthen local governance and
the ability of communities and individuals to access services and hold service providers
accountable; (2) to strengthen the ability of service providers to effectively respond to the
demand and scale up their service and infrastructure provision; and (3) to assist the local
governments and other local actors to strengthen the management of natural resources and
improve agricultural and livestock productivity. Five components of the sector work were
identified: (i) Review the Status of Decentralization; (ii) Service Delivery, Community
Empowerment, and the Dynamics of Local Institutions through a Community Profiling
Study; (iii) Legal Harmonization; (iv) Fiscal decentralization, including a specific study on
Fiscal Grants and Revenue Raising Capacity of Local Governments; and (v) The
identification of promising agriculture and natural resource management practices. The
report briefly reviews the changing international context for local governance. It then
describes the Lesotho Local Government system. Each of the five components is the subject
of an individual chapter. A concluding chapter includes a policy matrix bringing the
recommendations of the report together.
Private Sector Development (PSD)

11.
To support the government’s efforts on the PSD front, the World Bank has prepared a
Private Sector Competitiveness project. The key objective of the project is to increase private
sector participation in the economy by increasing its productivity and competitiveness. The
project consists of three components aimed at: (i) improving the business environment
through reducing cost of doing business and strengthening legal framework; (ii) supporting
economic diversification through development of skills, institutions and market linkages; and
(iii) improving MSMEs’ access to finance. The Project was presented to the Bank’s Board in
March 2007.
Infrastructure
12.
Bank support to the infrastructure sector is directed to institutional strengthening as
well as physical works. The Bank contributed to the financing of the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project. In addition to its ongoing portfolio in the water and utilities sectors, the Bank
has prepared an Integrated Transport Project (ITP) in collaboration with other development
partners. In that context, the Bank will take a leadership role in supporting ongoing road
sector reforms, capacity building and commitments for developing the road network and
addressing isolation problems. In addition, the ITP will support the formulation of policies
and strategies for air, rail, and intermediate means of transport (IMT) and water transport

9
subsectors with a view towards more integrated and coordinated transport sector
management.
13.
The World Bank has been providing support to the GoL in defining the context for
long-term support to the water sector by supporting essential institutional reforms and
immediate infrastructure investments under Phase 1 of the Water Sector Improvement Project
(WSIP) APL. The APL includes provision for supporting the GoL in developing the
identified long-term solution for bulk water supply, indicating the availability of US$25
million under Phase 2 of the WSIP APL. A regional water supply master plan study of the
Lowlands and a full feasibility study have identified the next least-cost, long-term solution
for bulk supply to Maseru to be the Metolong Dam on the South Phuthiatsana River some 35
kms from Maseru. A detailed Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has shown no
unmanageable impacts. Once constructed, the Metolong Dam, along with the associated
treatment plant and infrastructure, will increase the water supply capacity of Maseru and
surrounding towns by 80ML/day. This will ensure a secure supply of 125 ML/day that will
enable Maseru to meet domestic and industrial requirements up to the year 2020 or beyond
through conjunctive use.
14.
The Government has approached the Bank to cover an estimated financing gap of
US$25.2 million for the construction of the Metolong Dam (total cost US$190 million) to
provide water for both domestic and industrial purposes. The Government has secured
US$83 million from the MCC, US$39 million from the Arab Fund and US$32.8 million from
own sources. In response to the Government’s request, the Bank is preparing an IDA project
for $5-10 million. The Bank is looking at other possible ways to fill the remaining financing
gap, including the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund and the possibility of lending on IBRD
terms for this particular project only (while Lesotho will remain an IDA country). Apart from
the World Bank, the Government is looking for other sources to fund the gap.
HIV/AIDS
In response to the high adult HIV prevalence rate in Lesotho (approx 24%), the
Government adopted the multi-sectoral National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan and the National
AIDS Policy Framework in 2000. Political commitment in the fight against HIV/AIDS has
increased and legislation to create a National AIDS Commission has been enacted. Several
other development partners and agencies are active in supporting the HIV/AIDS program,
including Development Corporation Ireland, the Clinton Foundation, and Bristol Myers
Squibb.
15.

To support the Government’s efforts in fighting HIV/AIDS and in effectively using
the resources made available by other donors, including the Global Fund, the Bank has been
providing a technical assistance grant to increase the capacity of government and
nongovernmental institutions responsible for the national response to HIV/AIDS. However,
while the Government has made some progress and Church leaders have committed to
support the program, the National Aids Commission (NAC) is not empowered enough to
coordinate the fight against the pandemic leading to a fragmented effort. The “Know your
Status” campaign appears not to be delivering the expected results, and HIV prevention and

16.

10
impact mitigation seem to be greatly underfunded. The Government relies on nearly 90% of
donor funding in its HIV response, but only half of those allocations are in fact spent.
Although the Government has declared HIV as a national emergency, the commitment,
leadership and oversight responsibility for monitoring is weak. The World Bank will start
preparing a new HIV/AIDS project this year for FY09 delivery (US$10.0 million).
Human Development
Health
17.
The Bank is supporting a Health Sector Reform Program with the objective of
achieving a sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative
health care services. The Bank’s support to the health sector is structured in three Phases of
an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). Currently in Phase II, the focus is on improving access
to quality health services through strengthening decentralized service delivery and improving
human resources management in the sector.
18.
Replacing the obsolete and collapsing Queen Elizabeth II national referral hospital is
one of the major activities under the country’s health sector reform. As the country also faces
primary and secondary health care challenges at lower levels and to ensure a wise and
effective use of the limited health resources, the Government decided to build and manage a
new national referral hospital using a PPP arrangement in order to take advantage of
resources and skills from the private sector. With the facilitation of the IDA health task team,
IFC was engaged by the Government to provide technical and advisory services on the PPP
over the past 18 months.
19.
Using a PPP arrangement to replace the obsolete and collapsing national referral
hospital is a major undertaking in the health sector. The Government has requested that IDA
fund a Partial Risk Guarantee that would support a planned PPP for a new national referral
hospital in Maseru. This would be the first PPP in Lesotho. IDA and IFC are working closely
on this PPP and feel that it constitutes a vital input into improving health care in Lesotho.
The Guarantee will amount to approximately US$10 million of which only 25% would need
to be underwritten, meaning that Lesotho would need to borrow only US$2.5 million.
Education
20.
The education sector is supported through an APL which began in 1999 and extends
to 2011. Its broad objective is to assist the Government of Lesotho in its efforts to increase
access to quality education and the efficiency of the education system. In that context, it aims
to: (a) increase enrollment in and completion of primary education; (b) improve learning
achievement in primary education; (c) increase enrollment in secondary education; (d) build
capacity in the education sector, including for early childhood care and development,
technical and vocational education and training, higher education, Non-Formal Education,
and Ministry of Education and Training core functions. The second phase is expected to
close in December 2007.

11
21.
In conjunction with the development partners, the MoET is planning a series of
analytic studies which will provide the underpinnings for the development of a sector
program in the education sector. This process has been assisted by 2 joint review meetings
(held in March and November 2006) and a National Dialogue on education (November
2006). These studies will include an overall sector analysis, a study of monitoring and
evaluation systems in the MoET, a study of the management structures within the MoET, and
a study of the cost and financing of the education sector. The development of the sector
program is intended to improve efficiency of external support and to assist in attracting
further funds.

Bank Group Assistance Summary

22.
The World Bank’s first operation in Lesotho was approved in February, 1966. As of
July 31, 2007, the Bank Group has disbursed US$396.3 million. IDA has approved 35
credits amounting to US$ 389.3 million, of which US$ 301.2 was disbursed; US$ 60.6
million was canceled; and US$ 38.6 million remains undisbursed. To date, the World Bank
has financed six projects in education; five in roads and road rehabilitation and maintenance;
four in agriculture; three in industry; three in water supply (including support to the Lesotho
Highlands Water Project); three in urban development; five in health, two in privatization;
and one in community development.
23.
The World Bank has seven ongoing IDA projects, as well as a Global Environment
Facility (GEF) project. Active projects include the Health Sector Reform Project, the
HIV/AIDS Capacity Building and Technical Assistance Project; Phase 2 of the Education
Sector Development Project, Utilities Reform Project, Water Sector Improvement Project,
Integrated Transport Project and Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic
Diversification Project.. In addition, the World Bank will be working with other donors over
the next several years to assess the possibility of and to prepare Government systems for
budget support for Lesotho’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.
24.
Currently, the IFC has no outstanding investments in Lesotho. However, IFC is
advising the Government of Lesotho on the structure and implementation of a public-private
partnership for the replacement of the Queen Elizabeth II hospital. The project has been
undertaken in cooperation with the World Bank’s ongoing health sector reform project. This
is a pioneering joint initiative by IDA and IFC in Sub-Saharan Africa.

III. LESOTHO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The statistical database is adequate for surveillance, although there are some deficiencies in
core surveillance data.
As one of twenty two countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Lesotho has undertaken the GDDS as
framework for the development of its national statistical system. The Anglophone Africa project
(funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)) aims to assist
participating countries to implement plans for improvement identified in the metadata to meet
GDDS recommended statistical practices. GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since August 2003. Since the original posting, the
metadata have not been updated by the authorities, except for the metadata on the fiscal sector,
which were updated in November 2004.
National accounts
GDP data may need to be revised on account of gaps in source data on manufacturing
activity and the accounting of the transfers received under the SACU agreement. First, there
are concerns that data on manufacturing activity from the Bureau of Statistics of Lesotho (BSL)
are underestimated, when compared to customs data on manufactured exports. Second, staff’s
understanding is that taxes on products included in the calculation of GDP on the production side
include the “duty element” (lagged by two years) of the transfer received by Lesotho under the
Common Revenue Pool transfer formula underpinning the SACU agreement. Further analysis is
needed to assess the methodology employed for calculating this duty element.
BSL is responsible for the national accounts and compiles annual current price estimates of
GDP, expenditure, and income. Annual estimates of GDP at constant (1995) prices are compiled
by economic activity and expenditure; a rebasing of national income at constant prices (2004) is
expected to be finalized by end-2007. Annual estimates are published on their web site for 1993
to 2005. Other macroeconomic indicators, such as industrial production indices, are used to
monitor developments during the year.
Since late 2003, a peripatetic national accounts expert has been assigned to Lesotho under
the DFID project for Anglophone Africa. The principal reason for limited progress has been
the lack of resources and issues with the quality of source data. In particular, the December 2003
mission noted that, except in the case of agriculture statistics, there was no regular annual survey
program for economic statistics. Particular note was made of the need for, and the resources to be
devoted to, an up-to-date business register. The absence of easily tapped administrative data
compounded the problem arising from the lack of survey data. A Household Budget Survey was
conducted in 2002/3 though the results are not available/used for compiling economic statistics.
A November 2004 mission reiterated the lack of timely and relevant source data to be the major

13
obstacle in implementing the System of National Accounts 1993. A September 2005 mission
reported continuing severe staffing problems in national accounts and problems with source data.
The mission also noted the need to re-benchmark and rebase GDP estimates, but emphasized that
shortcomings in source data may preclude this from being done effectively.
Prices
Since January 2001, BSL produces a monthly consumer price index (CPI) that covers
Maseru, the capital city, and six urban towns. With effect from December 2006 the coverage is to
be increased by three additional urban towns. While the index has a reference period of
April 1997 = 100, the weights are still based on the 1994/95 Household Budget Survey (HBS). In
addition, a separate CPI is compiled and published for Maseru City. A HBS was conducted for
2002/3 though the results have yet to be used to derive new weights.
Government finance statistics
Data on government revenue and grants, current and capital expenditure, and financing
are provided by the Ministry of Finance to AFR periodically, although timeliness of reports
remains problematic. There is scope for further improvement in the reporting of these data.
Current and capital expenditure would benefit from more disaggregated reporting, including for
health and education; revenues should be classified according to the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001); and the reporting lag of about one year for the production
of the functional breakdown of expenditure is problematic. Government finance statistics should
distinguish clearly between current and capital (project) grants and external loan disbursements.
A GDDS fiscal sector mission in December 2003 was followed by a technical assistance
mission in 2004, which assisted the authorities in implementing the reporting framework of
GFSM 2001. The mission identified several shortcomings in the data. Underreporting of
recurrent revenue and expenditure occurs as ministries net revenue against unreported
expenditure. Reporting of acquisition of nonfinancial assets is incomplete as ministries do not
fully report donor project outlays. These data are also insufficiently detailed to allow appropriate
economic classifications. The mission assisted the authorities in compiling a bridge table to
reclassify data according to GFSM 2001. The mission also established that the data coverage did
not include the activities of the National University of Lesotho, the Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Fund and the Petroleum Fund. The mission recommended that the university be
treated as an extra-budgetary fund and that the other funds be adequately sectorized and classified
to further enhance the coverage of the general government.
Another GFS mission visited Maseru in March 2006, and found that progress with the
implementation of the previous missions’ recommendations had been impeded by lack of
resources and high turnover of staff. More specifically, no progress has been observed in
implementing the recommendation to expand the coverage of fiscal statistics to include

14
extrabudgetary units of government, or in aligning the classification of transactions in the source
accounting systems with GFSM 2001 classifications. A revision of the chart of accounts was
envisaged with the introduction of the Integrated Financial Management Information System.
Annual cash data for fiscal year 2005/06 have been submitted for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook 2007. Some recommendations for improving the coverage and
classification of revenue and expenses were implemented. Follow up technical assistance in 2007
will work towards further improvements in both the annual and high frequency data. Currently,
no high frequency data are reported for publication in the International Finance Statistics.
Monetary statistics
Most TA recommendations have been adopted. Monthly reporting of data for IFS publication
is timely and has improved in terms of classification of instruments, sectorization of the domestic
economy, and compilation of the monetary aggregates. Lesotho started compiling monetary
statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which provide improved classification
and sectorization of the accounts, and reported these data to STA beginning in December 2004.
Monthly data following this new presentation are disseminated in the International Finance
Statistics Supplement .
Despite the progress achieved, the missions’ recommendations to expand the institutional
coverage of the other depository corporations sector and to value all financial instruments at
market value are yet to be implemented. The monetary and financial statistics mission that visited
Maseru in September 2007 found out that work had started on the inventory of all financial
corporations (deposit-taking and others), and that it was expected that credit cooperatives would
be fully covered in the other depository corporations survey by October 2008. The compilation of
the other financial corporations survey is targeted for February 2009.
Balance of payments and external debt
The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) compiles quarterly balance of payments statistics,
usually with a lag of three months. However, some timeliness issues remain in forwarding these
data to the Fund.
A STA mission in July-August 2002 found that the methodology underlying the compilation of
the balance of payments data suffers from the use of outdated benchmark surveys and
deterioration in the coverage and timeliness of some of data sources. The main recommendations
of the mission were as follows:
•

It is urgent to resolve both the inadequate coverage and the delayed reporting of data
on exports and imports of goods. The Department of Customs and Excise (DCE) does not
provide data in a timely fashion. The CBL, therefore, generates its own estimates and there
are significant differences between these estimates and DCE’s data. For example, CBL

15
believes that DCE is underreporting total imports and has been adjusting the level of imports
upward by 30 percent. There are also differences between the trade data compiled by the
CBL and the BSL.
•

Closer cooperation and new statistical surveys are needed to improve the quality of
data on exports and imports of services. Most of the data on exports of services are based
on outdated benchmark estimates adjusted for movements in the consumer price index. Data
available at the ministries and other organizations could also be of better use for estimates of
balance of payments variables. Government ministries and the CBL should cooperate more
and make better use of data sources in organizations like the Lesotho Highlands
Development Authority, the Lesotho National Development Corporation, the South African
Reserve Bank, and the Employment Bureau of South Africa.

In general, the authorities need to strengthen their institutional capacity. The CBL should be
given formal institutional responsibility for the compilation of balance of payments statistics.
This work is currently undertaken by the CBL but there is no legislation or official decree that
designates this responsibility. Together with other members of the Common Monetary Area,
Lesotho’s authorities also need to consider measures to harmonize concepts, methodology, and
data collection for regional balance of payments data.
Under the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa, Lesotho has participated in a series of regional
workshops to plan and implement surveys for the recording of private capital flows and stocks.
An exploratory balance of payments survey was conducted by the CBL in 2006.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Robert Sharer and Anthony Boote (IMF)
and Brian Pinto and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
October 30, 2007
This debt sustainability analysis is based on end-2006 data for external and domestic debt
provided by the Lesotho authorities, and World Bank and IMF staff estimates for debt
outstanding to multilateral creditors. The overall staff assessment is that Lesotho is at a
moderate risk of debt distress and remains vulnerable to exchange rate changes and other
shocks, although debt appears sustainable in a baseline scenario.
Introduction
This debt sustainability analysis has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank
staff. It comprises external and domestic debt, and is based on the framework for low-income
countries approved by the respective Executive Boards.1 The framework takes into account
indicative thresholds for debt burden indicators determined by the quality of the country’s
policies and institutions,2 and comprises baseline and alternative scenarios.
Lesotho’s nominal public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt declined from
89.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 51.4 percent of GDP (US $746.0 million) at the end
of 2006, reflecting in part, the early repayment of non concessional loans, limited new

2

The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) has ranked Lesotho for the last three
years as a “medium performer” in terms of policy and institutions with a rating of 3.5. The applicable indicative
thresholds for debt sustainability, proposed under the framework for low-income countries are: (i) 40 percent
for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, (ii) 150 percent for NPV of debt-to-exports ratio; (iii) 250 percent for the
NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenues ratio; (iv) 20 percent for the debt service to exports ratio; and (v) 30 percent for
the debt service to revenue ratio.

borrowing, and an exchange rate appreciation between 2003 and 2006. Of the total public
sector debt, US $626.3 million was externally owed, with about 89 percent of the total (US
$560.0 million) owed to multilateral creditors, mainly IDA and the African Development
Fund.3 Government also has domestic debt held by residents in the amount of US
$119.4 million. For private sector debt, only obligations toward countries outside the
Common Monetary Area are recorded. At end 2006, these obligations were estimated at US
$2.3 million.

The baseline, medium-, and long-term scenario
The baseline scenario is based on a number of macroeconomic projections and

average growth rates of 2.1 in the medium-term projected in the last DSA. The last two
DSAs assumed growth and current account balances somewhat under the historical average
in view of the end of the MFA and the expectation of the expiration of trade preferences
under AGOA in 2007.
However, major favorable developments have taken place since then. The positive
growth performance, especially strong in 2006 (7.2 percent), was driven by booming
diamond production (not fully anticipated in the previous DSAs), a recovery of the garment
industry helped in part by the extension of AGOA trade preferences through 2012, and good
performance in the agriculture and services sectors. In addition, the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) compact was signed in 2007. The government is expected to receive
large grants during the next five years, allowing it to undertake significant capital investment
in the development of the country’s health infrastructure and water supply, and is actively
promoting private sector development. In particular, the construction of Metolong dam with
support of MCC and other donors is expected to increase the potential for the location of
“wet industries” such as fabric production, which would allow Lesotho to take fuller
advantage of AGOA beyond 2012. These recent developments, which were not previously
considered, largely account for the change in growth projections for this year’s DSA.
The current account balance after recording a surplus of 5.4 percent of GDP in 2006 is
forecast to remain strong due to high diamond and garment exports, and continued large
South Africa Customs Union (SACU) revenues to 2010. Then it is projected to deteriorate
somewhat as SACU revenues revert back to more normal levels. In the baseline scenario,
Lesotho starts facing “IDA-hardened” terms in 2010 as a result of the growth in its GNI per
capita. Under the Atlas method, Lesotho’s GNI per capita stood at US $1,070 in 2006.

4
Taking into account the lags included in this methodology and the assumptions about growth,
Lesotho would no longer be able to borrow at standard IDA terms after 2010.4

Box 1. Main Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario

4

•

Real GDP growth is assumed to increase from 2.8 percent over the last ten years to
about 5.2 percent in 2007–12 and then from 2013 to stabilize at 4.5 percent.

•

Inflation (as measured by the implicit GDP deflator) is assumed to move from an
average of 4.4 over the last ten years, and then to stabilize slightly above 4 percent as
prices converge to that of South Africa’s.

•

Fiscal surpluses are projected to remain strong up to 2012 reflecting large SACU
revenues, and are assumed to weaken somewhat in subsequent years when SACU
revenues are assumed to decline.

•

Imports and exports of goods and services and transfers are assumed to grow in line
with GDP (in US dollar terms). FDI is assumed to grow slightly more rapidly, taking
into account the reduction of the corporate income tax rate in 2006 to attract foreign
investment.

•

The current account balance (including official transfers) is determined by the above
trends, declining gradually from a 4.4 percent of GDP surplus in 2006 to smaller
surpluses over the medium term and eventually reaching a deficit as SACU transfers
and diamond exports decline. Net income is also assumed to decrease gradually over
the long term as remittances from South Africa continue to grow less important over
time.

•

Net external public sector financing is assumed to rise to about 2.8 percent of GDP by
the end of the current decade and then to stabilize at this level. Foreign grants are
assumed to increase to about 4.6 percent of GDP in the medium term, reflecting the
MCC compact, and thereafter to decline. After 2010, it is assumed that borrowing from
IDA would be at hardened terms. The DSA assumes that new borrowing would be
contracted on highly concessional terms during the projection period.

•

Domestic debt is projected to fall in nominal terms gradually over time. Private sector
debt is projected to increase only marginally in terms of GDP, to 0.5 percent by 2027.

In the DSA, IDA-hardened terms are incorporated and substituted for standard IDA terms after 2010, and
implies a charge of 0.75 percent, grace period of 10 years and a maturity period of 20 years (including the grace
period), compared to the 40-year maturity of standard IDA terms.

5
At end-2006, the NPV of external debt stood at 31.7 percent of GDP (Table 1). Under the
baseline scenarios, Lesotho’s external debt indicators remain well below the thresholds
throughout the projection period. The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, which was fractionally
above the threshold in 2006, is expected to gradually decrease to 21 percent in 2017, below
the policy-based indicative threshold (40 percent); and the NPV of debt-to-export ratio would
also fall gradually to 41 percent by 2017, significantly below the 150 percent threshold. Both
ratios will however increase marginally in the later years of the projection period reflecting
harder financing terms as Lesotho would no longer have access to borrowing from IDA at
standard terms. Borrowing, however, is expected to still be on broadly concessional terms.
The highly concessional nature of the existing debt and new borrowing contributes to debt
service ratios below the indicative threshold throughout the projection period. The
Government undertook to repay early a significant amount of non concessional debt resulting
in lower scheduled interest payments and hence a declining effective interest on debt.
At end-2006 domestic debt contributed only marginally to the baseline scenarios for
Lesotho’s public debt ratios (Table 3). Lesotho has a low level of domestic debt, and so
public debt indicators are very closely aligned to those of public external debt. Domestic
debt, which was at 7.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2006, is expected to be gradually
reduced to about 3 percent of GDP by 2017. Domestic debt has been issued by government
mostly to provide an impetus to the formation of a money market. The proceeds from the sale
of T-bills are held in deposits at the Central Bank of Lesotho; therefore these bills have not
represented additions to net debt. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain largely externally
financed on concessional terms, and expenditure levels are assumed to be financed from
grants and tax revenue.
Sensitivity Analysis
External Public debt indicators
Sensitivity tests show that while Lesotho’s debt burden would worsen in the event of an
adverse macroeconomic shock or weaker economic performance, it would remain
below the indicative thresholds in most cases (Table 2 and Figure 1). In the event of key
macroeconomic variables reverting to their pre-2007 levels throughout the projection period,
the evolution of debt would be significantly affected. With output and export growth at their
historical averages, public debt ratios would fail to improve. The more stringent test of
current account balances at historical averages would cause external debt to breach the
indicative thresholds.
The debt indicators in the historical scenario (scenario A1) are more elevated than
under the baseline scenario, and the threshold of the NPV of debt-to-GDP is breached. The
real GDP growth in the ten-year period up to 2006 averaged 2.8 percent, about half that
assumed in the projection period. The noninterest current account was also significantly

6
weaker than that projected under the baseline scenario due to the lower level of earlier SACU
transfers. These combined effects projected through 2027 would yield significantly worse
debt indicators, compared to the baseline scenario.
Borrowing on less favorable terms (scenario A2) would lead to some deterioration of
the external debt indicators. The impact however would not be as severe as that under the
A1 scenario. Under this scenario, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 25 percent
in 2017, still well below the indicative thresholds. Similarly, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
while higher than under the baseline scenario remains below the indicative threshold.
The bound tests reveal that Lesotho would face the most distress if there were to be a
much lower rate of growth and a much lower level of nondebt creating inflows such as
FDI in 2007-2008 (scenario B5). Under this scenario, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio first
increases to 71 percent of GDP in 2009 before falling to 49 percent of GDP in 2017. There
are also underlying vulnerabilities with respect to export growth. A shock to exports would
lead to higher NPV of debt-to-GDP and NPV of debt-to- exports ratios.
Total Public Debt Indicators
Public debt appears robust in the standard sensitivity tests (Table 4 and Figure 2). The
indicators are most sensitive to deviations from the baseline growth path. In the scenario with
variables at historical averages ratios initially rise but eventually declines. A similar pattern is
observed with more extreme shocks of shorter duration. Although significant pressures
would be exerted on total public debt for a number of years, the indicators would remain on
trajectories that eventually decline later in the projection period. It should be noted that in the
analysis the public debt alternative scenarios are not defined the same way for those of the
external debt and are therefore not directly comparable.
The trajectory of gross debt understates somewhat the decline in Lesotho’s net
indebtedness especially in the next few years. This trajectory takes into account the
disbursement of loans in the pipeline even in periods when fiscal surpluses would permit a
net reduction of debt. It is also assumed that the authorities will stick to the original schedule
for the repayment of the highly concessional debt. This implies that the public sector will
accumulate some assets over the medium term. Alternatively, the analysis could be said to
show that somewhat lower primary surpluses would also be consistent with the reduction in
gross debt shown in Figure 2. However, because of limited implementation capacity, the
authorities are not expected to significantly increase their level of capital investment making
it more likely that they will accumulate assets rather than significantly increase their
investment levels.

7
Conclusion
Lesotho faces a moderate risk of debt distress although in the baseline scenario key debt
ratios are below the indicative thresholds for a country with Lesotho’s performance
rating. The risk would materialize if variables such as economic growth and the current
account deficit were to revert to their historical levels. The results therefore underscore the
need for the authorities to continue to pursue prudent debt policies combined with sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Policies should focus on growth enhancing
measures and investments, while continuing to seek grants and highly concessional loans in
order to mitigate the likelihood of debt distress.

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.

Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.

1

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
The full presentation of the alternative scenario is in Table 1c.

2

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

3

Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (imp
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

4

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 20, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with the Kingdom of Lesotho
On November 14, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Lesotho.1
Background
Lesotho made further progress toward macroeconomic stability in 2006. After sluggish
economic activity in recent years, real economic growth surged to about 7 percent, driven by
booming diamond production, a recovery of the garment industry, and good performance in the
agriculture and services sectors. Poverty has declined, but remains high, and Lesotho has a
high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The pace of structural reform has been slow.
Reflecting high transfers from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and exports of
textiles and diamonds, the external current account balance registered a substantial surplus and
international reserves rose to about six months of imports, even after significant external debt
repayments. The recovery of the garment industry was helped by the extension of the US
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a depreciation of the rand, and a cut in corporate
tax rates. Inflation has increased since the last quarter of 2006 owing to rising food and energy
prices, broadly mirroring trends in South Africa. In July 2007 Lesotho and the US Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a “compact” for US$363 million (23 percent of 2007 GDP)
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

to be implemented over the next five years and covering the areas of water, health, and private
sector development. A drought hit agriculture in 2007; the government has appealed to
development partners for assistance.
The fiscal position and public debt sustainability indicators have improved although the 2007/08
budget envisages a high level of spending. The overall fiscal balance registered a record
surplus in 2006/07, the third in a row. The surplus was the result of high SACU receipts, and the
continuing sub-execution of capital expenditure projects. Most of the surplus in 2006 was saved
at the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL). The use of part of the SACU windfall to retire
nonconcessional debt contributed to a decline in external debt-to-GDP ratio to 43 percent of
GDP in 2006. The 2007/08 budget envisages a surge in current spending and a more than
doubling of capita expenditure.
Broad money grew by 35½ percent in 2006, with net foreign assets of the banking system rising
strongly. NFA growth largely reflected high SACU receipts and workers’ remittances, as well as
the relatively good performance of the textile industry.
The outlook is broadly positive, but subject to risks arising mostly from the external environment
and emerging financial sector vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Lesotho authorities’ commitment to prudent
macroeconomic policies, which have contributed to the country’s strong economic performance.
In particular, Directors noted the marked acceleration in growth in 2006, the significant
improvements in the fiscal and external balances, and the build up of international reserves—
which have helped consolidate the country’s exchange rate peg.
Nevertheless, Directors stressed that the country faces the considerable challenge of sustaining
rapid and broad-based growth to reduce widespread poverty and make progress towards the
MDGs, and to help tackle the high incidence of HIV/AIDS. Achievement of these objectives will
call for an acceleration of the pace of structural reforms with a focus on promoting private sector
development, while ensuring strong medium-term fiscal and external positions.
Directors considered that the medium-term outlook for Lesotho is positive but subject to several
risks. These include a possible slowdown in markets for Lesotho’s exports as well as
uncertainty about the revenue-sharing regime of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU),
prospects for global trade in textiles, and the outlook for remittances from workers in South
Africa. While acknowledging that these factors are largely beyond Lesotho’s control, Directors
encouraged the authorities to prepare for possible adverse developments through strengthened
fiscal policy and public financial management, and prudent reserves policies.

3
Directors welcomed Lesotho’s prudent management of SACU windfalls so far, and urged the
authorities to resist the surge in spending envisaged in the 2007/08 budget. Looking forward,
they noted that containment of recurrent spending over the medium term would help keep fiscal
policy sustainable while allowing the use of available fiscal space for increasing productive
public investment. Directors also underscored the importance of approaching the upcoming
salary review and the possible pension reform with caution, and more generally, of addressing
existing weaknesses in the budget process and extending the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework to all ministries. Equally, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to pursue
prudent debt management policies.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to use grants as well as domestic resources to
boost public investment, especially in infrastructure. They called for efforts to improve project
execution and full utilization of external assistance, including the resources of the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC)—drawing on donor technical assistance. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ recognition that, while public-private partnerships have a role in public investment,
they need to build the necessary capacity to manage them effectively.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate the pace of structural reforms, and welcomed
the preparation of a Growth Strategy Paper (GSP). They noted that envisaged programs—
namely, the Public Sector Improvement and Reform Program, the Private Sector Development
Component of the MCC compact, and the World Bank-supported Private Sector
Competitiveness Program—would be key to relieving constraints on growth and enhancing
productivity. In particular, these programs aim at strengthening institution building, establishing
an appropriate legal and institutional framework, and improving the investment climate for
domestic and foreign investors. Consistency between the GSP and Lesotho’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy would be important.
Directors agreed that Lesotho’s monetary and exchange rate regime has been beneficial and
should be preserved, along with the prudent policy mix that makes it viable. In particular, they
underscored that membership in the Common Monetary Area and the peg of the loti to the rand
have ensured stable and low inflation, and facilitated capital and commercial exchanges with
South Africa. Fiscal restraint in the face of strong SACU revenues has ensured external stability
by helping keep net international reserves at levels consistent with the sustainability of the peg.
A few Directors advised that careful attention be paid to the risks associated with the volatility of
the rand, and the inflation differential between Lesotho and South Africa.
Directors noted that, while the banking system appears solid, the limited access to its services
by households and small businesses has fostered the growth of weakly supervised credit
cooperatives. In this respect, Directors called on the authorities to step up their current efforts to
improve the regulation and supervision of credit cooperatives and to increase access to banking
services.
Directors expressed concern over the operation of unlicensed deposit-taking entities promising

4
inordinately high rates of return. They observed that these vehicles have large and fast-growing
liabilities, face constant rollover risks, and pose significant risk of failure. The continued
operation of these entities would result in further growth in their liabilities and higher risk of
social and financial repercussions. Accordingly, Directors urged the authorities to take prompt
action to address this issue.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for the Kingdom of Lesotho
and Leonia Lephoto, Advisor to Executive Director
November 14, 2007
1. Introduction
On behalf of the Lesotho authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
dialogue during the last Article IV consultations, as well as the Board and management for
their continued support. The authorities value the advice provided by the Fund and are in
general agreement with the thrust of the staff reports.
The authorities' commitment to prudent macroeconomic management has contributed to the
consolidation of macroeconomic stability. Over the past year, the strong rebound in
economic growth is the result of policy measures taken by the authorities that were supported
by a favorable external economic climate. Fiscal and external stability was strengthened
through prudent use of fiscal surpluses to reduce public indebtedness and to augment
reserves. The surplus was mainly driven by the significant increase in SACU receipts as well
as growth in exports of textiles and clothing and diamonds. Near term macroeconomic
prospects also seem positive. These notwithstanding, macroeconomic management in
Lesotho remains challenging due to the country's continued vulnerability to exogenous
shocks. New developments in the textile trade regime could have grave implications for the
country's export sector, while the uncertainty surrounding SACU revenues poses a threat to
fiscal stability in the long term.
Achieving the sustainable, broad based economic growth necessary for the improvement of
the livelihoods of the majority of the Basotho people, remains a challenge. The authorities
are committed to implementing the policies and structural reforms needed to preserve
macroeconomic stability and promote sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Private
sector development will be a key element of this reform program. Further support from the
international community and understanding of the special circumstances of small emerging
developing countries like Lesotho, which is likely to face "IDA-hardened" terms in 2010 as
its GNI improves, could assist mitigate further challenges to the development agenda.
2. Recent Economic Developments
In 2006, Lesotho's economic performance was strong and broad based. Further
improvements to macroeconomic stability were realized. Real GDP Growth estimated at 7.2
percent in 2006, was supported by the recovery in manufacturing output, a flourishing
mining sector and improved performance in the agriculture and services sectors. In the
mining sector, increased output was facilitated by increased production in the diamond
mines. At the same time, in manufacturing, the negative impact of the expiry of the Multi
Fiber Agreement (MFA) on the textile and clothing sector was mitigated by the extension of

2
AGOA by the US, the depreciation of the loti and measures undertaken by Government.
Consumer inflation has been on the rise due to external factors including the general increase
in oil and cereal prices. Nevertheless inflation has remained in single digits. Meanwhile,
fiscal consolidation remained strong in 2006/07, with government budgetary operations
recording a surplus for the fourth consecutive year as a result of strong SACU and domestic
revenues, and measures taken to ensure moderate growth in expenditure. The fiscal surplus
for the year 2006/07 is estimated at around 16 per cent of GDP.
The balance of payments position remained positive in 2006 with the overall balance in
surplus. This facilitated the accumulation of foreign reserves to almost 7 months of import
cover. The improvement in the balance of payments position largely reflected the turnaround
in the current account balance from a deficit in 2005 to a surplus in 2006.
3. Macroeconomic Outlook and Policies
Macroeconomic prospects remain broadly favorable. Growth is expected to remain strong,
supported by the vibrant mining sector and manufacturing, as well as increased construction
activity due to scaled up public investments. Investment projects to be implemented under
the recently signed Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact are expected to
contribute significantly to growth. Fiscal and external stability will benefit from the expected
continuation of large inflows of SACU revenues, in the medium term.
Downside risks include the negative impact of the persistent drought on agriculture and
potential unfavorable developments in the external environment. Developments in the global
regime for textiles, such as the erosion of trade preferences, would have significant
consequences for Lesotho's export sector. In the short run, garment and mineral exports could
also be adversely affected by the slowdown in the US economy. The uncertainty of SACU
revenue poses a challenge to fiscal management as these receipts continue to account for the
bulk of government revenue; hence, the authorities' recognition of the need to continue
strengthening the domestic revenue effort while containing expenditures. Inflationary
pressures are expected to continue to rise in line with oil prices and increases in food prices
emanating from drought-induced food shortages, as well as the global cereal shortages
created by the increased use of biofuel.
Fiscal Policy
Lesotho's membership in the Common Monetary Area (CMA) dictates that fiscal policy be
the most important tool for macroeconomic management. The core objective of Lesotho's
fiscal strategy is to ensure the maintenance of a sustainable fiscal stance and maintenance of
external stability. The authorities' commitment to prudent fiscal policies and sustained fiscal
surpluses has facilitated their success in achieving these objectives. The authorities continue
to exercise prudence in the allocation of these surpluses towards improving the country's debt
sustainability and external stability.
In the medium-term, the projected exceptional SACU revenues will help to ensure favorable
fiscal outcomes. However, the authorities are cognizant of the fact that, if these revenues

3
decline in the future, sustainability will necessitate a substantial reduction in the share of
public expenditure relative to GDP as well as stronger domestic revenue performance. The
authorities will therefore endeavor to strengthen their domestic revenue effort through
continued implementation of measures to improve revenue administration of the Lesotho
Revenue Authority (LRA).
In an effort to strengthen public expenditure management and enhance the effectiveness of
public services the authorities have launched a public sector improvement and reform
program (PSIRP). Progress made under the PSIRP includes strengthening of budget planning
and execution, public procurement reform and the introduction of the medium term fiscal
framework. The principles underpinning the authorities' fiscal strategy are to: maintain the
real value of public expenditure by ensuring that the main categories of discretionary
ministerial expenditure increase by at least the annual rate of inflation; ensure that the current
increase in SACU revenues (and, hence, the ratio of revenue to GDP) does not give rise to an
unsustainable level of aggregate public expenditure and that the public sector does not
expand aggregate demand excessively; ensure that a primary surplus of revenue (including
grants) over expenditure (excluding interest) is achieved; minimize the amount of
commercial debt outstanding and to ensure that aggregate debt ratios do not exceed
sustainability indicators; maintain a surplus of current revenue over current expenditure; and
secure additional external finance on concessional terms. This should ensure that the overall
medium term fiscal framework remains within sustainable limits.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
Price stability in Lesotho has been facilitated by the country's membership in the CMA,
which provides for the loti to be pegged at par to the rand and for free movement of capital
within the CMA. Monetary policy in Lesotho continues to be aimed at maintaining a strong
external reserve position that is adequate to support the exchange rate parity with the South
African rand as well as to meet the country's external obligations. The viability of this
arrangement has also been supported by prudent fiscal policies.
The banking sector remains strong, with banks being profitable, well-capitalized and liquid
and with relatively moderate and well provisioned non-performing loans (NPLs). Downside
risks to the banking sector are posed by the relatively high and increasing concentration on
the asset side of the banks' balance sheets, and a rising trend in NPLs. However, these risks
are mitigated by the fact that most of the loans to the top twenty borrowers are fully
collateralized. The authorities continue to implement measures geared towards strengthening
prudential supervision including the review of the legal and regulatory framework as well as
their own supervisory practices and procedures.
Financial intermediation continues to be limited as banks remain risk averse. The low access
of financial services to the population has encouraged the rapid growth of credit
cooperatives. These often engage in financial intermediation with non-members, and pose a
challenge to the ability of the authorities to supervise and regulate them as they are not
covered by the current financial institutions laws. The extent of their operations is not well

4
known, and the quality of regulatory oversight is limited under existing arrangements. The
authorities are currently making efforts to strengthen this sector as well as to regulate and
supervise it. Technical assistance from the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) is expected to assist in this regard.
The strengthening of the Lesotho Postbank, which currently does not extend credit, and the
development of the microfinance sector, which are also to benefit from IFAD assistance, is
expected to increase access to financial services. Other efforts geared towards the
improvement of financial intermediation include the creation of the credit reference bureau
and reform of the commercial court. These measures will be supported by the World Bank
and MCC funded private sector development projects.
The operation of unlicensed financial entities, which have attracted sizable deposits from the
public by promising very high rates of return and accumulated large and growing liabilities
that could become very difficult to meet, poses a challenge to the authorities. These entities
also face significant rollover risks thus presenting substantial risks to depositors. Measures to
deal with these institutions and to minimize any adverse impact are already at an advanced
stage. The authorities have requested Fund advice and initiated a public education campaign
to raise public awareness of the dangers of such schemes and to discourage more people from
engaging in them.
The authorities have also submitted an Anti-Money Laundering Bill to parliament for
enactment.
Growth Policies
The authorities continue to place emphasis on the need for pro-growth policies aimed at
achieving sustainable broad-based growth that is required to reduce poverty, improve the
living standard of Basotho and more generally ensure progress towards achieving the MDGs.
The authorities are currently developing a Growth Strategy Paper (GSP). The GSP will
identify both opportunities and binding constraints to growth. The PRS will be compatible
with the GSP and together they will serve as a roadmap that guides work in support of the
long term goals presented in Vision 2020. The GSP would be linked to the budget, therefore
helping inform the formulation of medium term fiscal plans and institutional reform
initiatives, which in turn should guide annual budgets as well as the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework.
Private sector development is the key ingredient to growth and poverty reduction. Hence, the
authorities' plans to promote private sector led growth through measures aimed at improving
the investment climate and incentives as well as enhancing international competitiveness.
Measures already taken in this regard include the reduction of company tax rates during the
2006/07 fiscal year, and the establishment of the trade and investment facilitation centre to
serve as a one stop shop for potential investors and to reduce regulatory impediments and
facilitate investment.
Efforts to improve the investment climate will be reinforced by the World Bank supported

5
Private Sector Competitiveness Program as well as the private sector development
component of the compact signed with the MCC earlier this year. Key reforms would include
removing regulatory constraints posed by registration, licensing, immigration and tax
processes and improving private sector access to credit through the establishment of a
comprehensive property registry, development of a national identification system, reform of
the judiciary and administration of justice as well as the simplification of land transfer
procedures. To facilitate access to credit, parliament passed a Married Persons Act in 2007,
which allows for married women to access bank credit without their husbands' permission.
The authorities are also taking measures to improve labor productivity and economic
infrastructure, as well as to diversify the economy and markets in order to reduce the
country's vulnerability to shocks.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we would like to reiterate the authorities' commitment to macroeconomic
stability and the promotion of high and sustainable economic growth. They appreciate the
continued support of the Fund and the international community in general in addressing the
enormous challenges that they face. This support is particularly important for the country, if
it is to reduce poverty and make headway towards achieving the MDGs. Further support
from the international community to small emerging developing countries like Lesotho,
which is likely to face "IDA-hardened" terms in 2010 as its GNI improves, could assist
mitigate further challenges to the development agenda.
