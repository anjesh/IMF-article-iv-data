EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Though one of the best performing EU economies, Finland faces rapid population aging, sluggish
productivity in sheltered sectors, and supervisory problems associated with deepening international
financial integration. Thus, discussions focused on: (i) fiscal policies capable of ensuring
sustainability; (ii) labor and product market reforms to enhance human resource utilization and
stimulate productivity gains; and (iii) the maintenance of financial sector stability.
On current projections, the budget framework for 2008–11 implies a sizable fiscal deterioration.
Reflecting this and the costs of population aging, long-term fiscal sustainability requires improving
the primary balance. Fiscal restraint would be appropriate also from a cyclical perspective. The
authorities were confident that higher-than-expected actual and potential growth, sustained by not yet
identified structural reforms, could reduce greatly the fiscal loosening. Staff counseled greater
prudence.
Given already high taxation, fiscal restraint should focus on spending retrenchment, facilitated by
efficiency gains. Staff recommended greater recourse to user charges and outsourcing as well as more
stringent spending ceilings which could be extended to local governments. The authorities stressed
that consensual policymaking and strong local autonomies made changes difficult.
There was agreement that improved labor utilization, especially of older workers and the young, was
needed to ensure future growth. This might require more wage differentiation, reforming student
allowances, and tightening early retirement through disability or unemployment, with broader
recourse to activation. While broadly agreeing, the authorities emphasized the need to move
cautiously in these socially sensitive areas.
Financial system supervisors concurred that cooperation with market participants and foreign
supervisors must be enhanced to minimize systemic risks from cross-country activities.
Finland’s external competitiveness is strong, but imminent aging with a fast-rising dependency ratio,
declining terms of trade, and pressures on exporters’ profitability indicate that the current account
surplus is likely to shrink.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economic situation remains enviable. Growth has outpaced that in the euro
area since the early 1990s, inflation has remained among the lowest in the EU, and the
government budget and external current account are both comfortably in surplus. Finland is
also near the top of rankings for research and development, innovation, and competitiveness.
2.
Nevertheless, significant challenges loom. Exports are growing strongly, having
rebounded from a labor dispute-induced fall in 2005, but they remain comparatively
concentrated in two sectors: telecommunications and paper products. Demographic pressures
are soon to be felt, with the old-age dependency ratio set to rise the most rapidly in the EU.
Despite recent pension reforms, the authorities acknowledge in their latest Stability Program
that without additional steps the fiscal position is unsustainable. Fast-paced change and
increasing international integration in the financial sector open opportunities, but create risks
and test supervisory capabilities.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economy surged in 2006, the result of underlying strength and one-off
factors. Although the rebound following the 2005 labor dispute in the paper sector is
estimated to have added 1 percentage point to growth, underlying activity still expanded by
some 4½ percent—about 1 percent above

contributed 2½ percentage points to growth,
reflecting buoyant activity in the “neighborhood” (Sweden, Russia, and the Baltics), a

4.
The labor market is finally benefiting from the cyclical upswing, amid, however,
signs of mismatches and related tightening. After some delay, rising employer confidence
has boosted job growth, with over 125,000 net new jobs created in the last three years. The
unemployment rate mirrors the euro area level, but signs of labor shortages are appearing

5.
Inflation has remained muted, aided by exceptional factors now on the wane.
Relatively low inflation has been supported by wage moderation in the face of fast
productivity growth, as demonstrated by the latest tripartite agreement (for 2005–07)
between unions, employers, and the government—struck in part thanks to income tax cuts
offered by the government. Furthermore, the 4 percent decline in 2005–06 in the terms of
trade has lowered the equilibrium real exchange rate, which, in the absence of nominal
depreciation, exerts downward pressure on inflation. However, a number of one-off factors
have also contributed, including lower telecommunications tariffs and food prices—the
latter associated with increased competition from new foreign-owned retailers. With these
effects fading, HICP inflation is creeping up to 1½ percent.
6.
Finland’s external competitiveness is solid, but its export base is narrow. With a
current account surplus of about 6 percent of GDP and a barely negative net international
investment position (accounted entirely for by foreign holdings of volatile ICT shares—
mainly Nokia), standard indicators of external competitiveness are comforting (Table 2 and
Figure 2), with various real effective exchange rate (REER) estimates broadly unchanged
over the past decade (Figure 3 panel 1). The manufacturing unit-labor-cost-based measure
has shown the largest improvement. However, capital's share in this sector in Finland vis-àvis its trading partners is under greater pressure because of a relatively weaker export
deflator (Figure 3 panel 2). This is largely because Finland’s export composition is rather

18

6
heavily biased towards sectors whose prices are rapidly declining (ICT) or comparatively
stagnant (paper products) (Figure 4).
7.
The fiscal position improved significantly last year, underpinned by expenditure
restraint. The general government surplus of 3¾ percent of GDP—mostly in the pension
funds—is the second highest in the EU. With the output gap close to zero, the surplus is

III. OUTLOOK
8.
Economic expansion will continue in the near term, albeit at a slower pace.
During the mission, authorities and staff anticipated growth at about 3 percent in 2007 and
2¾ percent in 2008. However, data for the first quarter of 2007 and revised quarterly data for
2006 recently released suggest that the momentum of growth in 2007 is significantly higher
than expected. Accordingly, staff has raised its growth projection to 4 percent in 2007, still
less than in 2006. The bulk of the deceleration is due to the ebbing of an unusually strong
contribution from net exports in 2006 (including the rebound from the labor dispute). The
contribution of domestic demand is projected to increase by about ½ percent of GDP, with
private consumption boosted by strong consumer confidence and employment growth,
despite rising interest rates and household debt levels (the latter approaching 100 percent of
disposable income). Continuing fast employment growth is likely to tighten the labor market.
As the economy is expected to continue to operate somewhat above potential, inflation
should creep upwards, although rising interest rates and recent euro strength may have
cooling effects.
9.
Risks appear balanced for growth but risks that inflation may exceed its
projected level prevail. The “neighborhood effect” may not decline as projected, which
could sustain a larger contribution to growth from trading partners. Higher-than-anticipated
labor force participation rates could emerge and immigration—stimulated by a tightening

7
labor market—might accelerate,1 which would allow for greater growth without engendering
wage pressures. On the downside, excessive salary increases could harm external
competitiveness and stoke inflationary pressures (the latest authorities’ projection has raised
wage growth in 2008 from 3½ to 5 percent) . More important, if Russia—as recent reports
hint—were to impose a 10-fold increase over the next two years in export tariffs on
unprocessed wood, Finland’s paper sector (which accounts for one-fourth of all exports)
would suffer.
10.
For the medium term, the authorities’ official projections envisaged a further
slowdown in growth. The deceleration (to 2¾ percent on average) in 2008–11 would result
from lower employment expansion and a resumption of the modest trend decline in
productivity growth during 2000–04. Staff concurred with this assessment.
11.
Officials, however, thought that GDP could rise much faster if the government
implemented bold structural measures. In particular, reforms of labor and product markets
could substantially lift potential growth of the economy. While agreeing on the need to
deepen reforms, staff cautioned that time and size of any boost to growth from structural
measures were uncertain.
12.
The authorities regarded competitiveness of the economy as broadly adequate.
While wage growth in Finland has exceeded that in the euro area, so has productivity growth,
especially in the export-intensive electronics sector. However, the bulk of these gains are
shifted to foreign consumers through lower prices, limiting domestic income gains. The
terms of trade were anticipated to temporarily improve this year, before resuming their trend
worsening thereafter, and strengthening euro area growth was expected also to contribute to a
one-off improvement in the external accounts. However, capacity constraints and continued
shifting of production abroad were expected to limit export growth below that in foreign
markets.
13.
Staff concurred, while noting that some measures suggested a significant

with a mid-point of 17 percent2. These estimates should be taken with a larger than usual
dose of caution. In light of rapid population aging, Finland needs to build up substantial
assets in a short time to pre-fund the associated costs, requiring temporarily large fiscal and
current account surpluses. As aging unfolds, the domestic savings rate is expected to decline
and these surpluses are anticipated to diminish. The trend worsening of Finland’s terms of
trade is also expected to reduce the external surplus. Indeed, these forces may, to some
extent, already make their presence felt, as attested by pressures on exporter’s profitability.
On balance, therefore, staff felt that the real exchange rate was not significantly undervalued.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The overarching concern is the risk posed to longer-term growth by rapid aging
and the anticipated productivity slowdown. With the fastest population aging in the EU
and attendant fiscal costs, discussions focused mainly on medium-term and structural issues.
As working-age cohorts are expected to shrink from the end of this decade, increasing the

management and cross-country supervision.

Against this background, the discussions focused on three priorities:

•

craft tax and public expenditure policies that promote continued economic expansion
while ensuring fiscal sustainability,

•

reform the labor and product markets in order to enhance utilization of soon-to-be
shrinking human resources and contribute to greater competition in sheltered sectors,

10
17.
Officials did not dispute the staff’s view that under current policies the longterm fiscal position is unsustainable (Box 1). Taking into account the new government’s
plan reducing the overall surplus to about 2 percent of GDP by 2011, in an otherwise
“passive” projection the additional public spending associated with population aging
eventually generates ever-growing deficits and debt. Ministry of Finance officials recognized
that the general government primary balance in 2011 and beyond should be uniformly higher
by around 2 percent of GDP than in the passive-scenario path to maintain long-term fiscal
sustainability, at least through 2050.
18.
The authorities, however, were confident that higher growth associated with
structural reforms could avert the fiscal deterioration. Notably, the CG surplus of about
1 percent of GDP achieved in 2006 could be maintained through 2011 with GDP growth of
3½ percent, almost 1 percentage point above the average rate currently projected. Staff
warned against relying on optimistic revisions to growth projections to discount the fiscal
loosening, as the reforms had yet to be identified and implemented and their impact on
growth verified. The authorities vowed to implement flexibly planned spending hikes and tax
reductions, so as to limit risks to inflation and the fiscal position, if higher sustainable growth
were not achieved.
19.
Staff also saw a need for tighter fiscal policy for cyclical reasons. Continuing
strong growth—positive output gaps are expected in both 2007 and 2008 and labor markets
are tightening—points to the advisability of withdrawing some fiscal stimulus. The
authorities stated that the fiscal stance would be appropriately corrected should signs of
overheating arise.
20.
The authorities noted that reducing Finland’s relatively heavy tax burden could
lessen economic distortions. Taxation of earned income is particularly steep: the average
and marginal rates for the average wage earner exceed 40 and 50 percent, respectively. Such
large tax wedges introduce significant distortions in the labor market. Coupled with a high
effective minimum wage, they discourage employment of low-skilled workers and lead to
inefficient do-it-yourself practices. Thus, a lowering of income taxes was likely to boost
employment and output. Staff concurred but stressed that tax cuts, albeit justified, demanded
commensurate spending reductions not to undermine sustainability.
21.
It was acknowledged that adjustment efforts ought to concentrate on
expenditure restraint. The general government expenditure-to-GDP ratio is high—and
projected to increase further owing to population aging. The authorities noted that the
medium-term budget framework was already postponing several investment projects to limit

balance, with respect to the
“passive” scenario, needed to achieve the net assets targeted for 2050 by the authorities’ stability
program—46 percent of GDP. The staff’s “active” scenario assumes that measures are taken to fill
this gap.
Nevertheless, some further adjustment after 2050 is needed to stabilize debt fully. Staff
projections indicate that improving the primary balance by approximately 1 percent of GDP more
would be enough to stabilize net debt (alternatively the rate of return on gross assets could be raised
by 1 percentage point). Otherwise, even in the “active” scenario, net assets (although still higher than
now in 2050) would decline indefinitely.

spending growth. Nonetheless, they also deemed essential some increase in spending in the
short term, including to honor electoral promises of sizable pay increases for health workers.
22. The authorities viewed enhancing the efficiency of government as the best way to
restrain spending. Studies suggest that expenditure could be more efficient, particularly in
higher education and health care—with some indicating that Finnish combined expenditure
efficiency is somewhat below the OECD average (Figure 5). Thus, sizable spending savings
would be feasible without jeopardizing the quality of services. The authorities concurred,
but pointed out that the low

of scale. They also agreed that
recourse to domestic or international
benchmarking could help identify
best practices and stated that CG
employment was already planned to
be reduced through attrition. It was
noted that greater use of contracting
out, outsourcing, and well-designed
public-private partnerships could
stimulate efficiency and moderate
cost inflation. More frequent resort to—and a rebalancing of—user charges for local
services would also strengthen market incentives for consumers and suppliers.

23. Officials were open to improvements in the design of the multi-year spending
ceilings in order to contain expenditure growth. The government has committed to new
expenditure ceilings until its term expires in 2011, based on the same principles as in the
previous legislature, but with a larger contingency reserve and more flexible carry-over
rules. Although broadly effective in curbing CG expenditure growth, the limits have not
dented the high level of public spending. One problem lies in step increases in outlays
decided by incoming governments when setting the new ceilings. Others arise from the
generous cost deflator used in establishing the annual ceilings3 and the incomplete coverage
of the ceilings. Accordingly, staff recommended using the GDP deflator or the CPI, which
would impose more stringent ceilings, thereby providing incentives to increase productivity
and reduce costs. In addition, the spending rule could be extended to local governments
(LGs) (see below). It was understood that these technical measures could help reduce
expenditure growth, but a more substantive impact on spending trends required changes in
underlying policies.

3

The spending rule is defined in real terms, based on a public spending deflator, which tends to grow faster than
the CPI or the GDP deflator and accommodates increases in wages and other government costs.

13
24.
The authorities agreed that instilling greater budgetary discipline at the local
level was a key challenge. Municipalities—the main providers of education, health care,
old-age care, and other social services, with total outlays of about 17 percent of GDP and
three-quarters of public employment—
have experienced a rapid rise of
recurrent spending and employment as
well as worsening efficiency in recent
years. These pressures are expected to
mount with population aging. The
authorities expect to generate savings
from merging municipalities and
coordinating provision of services.
Staff recommended extending the
expenditure ceilings to LGs,
sanctioning their inclusion by a
“domestic stability pact” with CG transfers used as enforcement mechanism. In addition,
caps on LG income taxation (offset as needed by greater reliance on property taxation)
might place limits on the growth of revenues which to some extent is fueling LG spending.
The authorities explained that they were considering strengthening the existing agreement
with the association of LGs to harden budget constraints, but interfering with the
constitutionally protected autonomy of municipalities was politically difficult.

B. Structural Policies
Labor market
25.
There was consensus on the need to pursue several complementary strategies to
raise activity and employment rates. Specifically, the authorities:

2006

14
•

plan to increase substantially targeted wage subsidies, to boost employment at the
low end of the labor market. They also noted that the decision to forgo centralized
wage bargaining this year—which may presage its phasing out—could spur wage and
regulatory flexibility.

•

have recently created Labor Force Service Centers to reinforce activation of hard-toplace unemployment benefit recipients. To the same end, a 2006 reform made
municipalities financially responsible for half of the cost of unemployment assistance
and created obligations for beneficiaries. Furthermore, Public Employment Services
intend to sign action plans with all young unemployed within the first three months of
benefit recipiency to find active alternatives to passive entitlement. Finally, a
profiling system for job seekers will be phased-in.
Box 2. Labor Market Issues

Finland lags behind its peers in labor-market performance. While unemployment has been more
than halved since the recession of the early 1990s and the employment rate has risen to 68½ percent
at end-2006, the latter is still below other
Nonemployment and Unemployment Benefit Recipiency Rates

Furthermore, the shares of long-term

Problems are particularly acute for young

workers (Figures 7–9). Even after the 2005
reform, unemployment benefits can be
Incapacity / Invalidity Unemployment
Social Assistance / Lone parents
extended above the standard 500 days for
those aged 57 and over. And the disability scheme now allows to consider also “social grounds” when
claiming benefits. Thus the employment rate of older workers, at 53 percent, is below that of other
Nordic countries. The employment rate for young workers, at less than 40 percent in 2005, compares
unfavorably with rates above 60 percent in Denmark and the Netherlands, and is also below the
OECD average (43 percent). Part of the explanation lies in prolonged entitlement to generous student
allowances (up to €700 a month) supplemented by guaranteed loans and no tuition fees: with 9½
years of expected education for the 15-29 year old, Finland is an OECD outlier.
The wage-setting system, associated with generous benefits, has not helped price-in young and
elderly workers, nor the low-skilled. While the economy-wide wage agreements have served to
maintain overall wage moderation, they have also resulted in salary compression, with a high
effective minimum wage. Furthermore, the high replacement ratio of unemployment and other social
benefits often leads to high effective marginal tax rates which discourage work resumption.

15
Staff argued that, these valuable efforts notwithstanding, further scope for activation existed,
notably of recipients of unemployment and disability benefits. Tightening access to early
retirement, together with less generous student allowances, would also be useful (Box 2).
The stressed that state enterprises were generally run as private entities and thus government
ownership did not affect adversely efficiency. Nevertheless, it was not disputed that
competition could be enhanced through further selective privatization, restraining local
monopolies, and strengthening non-discriminatory third-party access to network industries.
In addition, liberalizing shop opening hours and more flexible zoning laws could boost
competition in wholesale and retail trade, while reforming agricultural support (which
exceeds CAP-based levels) should increase efficiency and lower food prices. The authorities
contended, though, that these measures were politically controversial and could only be
implemented gradually.
C. Financial Sector
26.
The financial system appears sound and well supervised. Banks are profitable and
well capitalized. Returns on equity are generally high, with low cost ratios. Capital adequacy
ratios are well in the double digits, with sizable financial “buffers,” albeit slowly decreasing
owing to the higher credit base. While lending margins have declined with increased
competition, bank profits have risen with growing fee income and the expansion of lending
portfolios—especially household mortgages. Bank of Finland (BoF) estimates of several
stability indicators also point to the good position of the banking sector (Table 4).
27.
Supervisors closely monitor mortgage lending practices, but were confident that
developments in the equity and housing markets were broadly benign. Although
household and corporate debt levels remain comparatively low, the authorities noted that
household debt is relatively concentrated among younger borrowers, raising concerns about
commercial banks’ regard for repayment ability and undue reliance on collateral.
Nevertheless, debt servicing expenses are historically low, as household net wealth and
disposable income have improved strongly in recent years. House prices, while also rising
rapidly, have grown less than in most advanced economies, with BoF analyses not detecting
bubbles, except possibly in some Helsinki neighborhoods. Equity prices have increased by
more than 50 percent since the beginning of 2003, creating some risk of reversal. However,
BoF estimates suggest that stock market valuations do not deviate from fundamentals.
28.
Supervisors confirmed that the system can withstand considerable disruptions.
New stress tests undertaken jointly by the BoF and bank supervisors (FSA)—assuming a
marked economic recession and a sizable drop in housing and equity prices—show that
banks’ profitability would be hard hit, but remain positive, and the impact on their capital
position would also be manageable. While the authorities’ stress tests are of high quality,
staff recommended to improve them further by assessing the impact on the balance sheets of
banks: (i) of the same shocks in different years; and (ii) of cross-border contagion, using
extreme observations in market-based indicators.

16
29.
The authorities agreed that regulation and supervision of cross-border
institutions pose considerable challenges. The recent sale of Sampo’s banking
operations—the country’s third largest—to the Danish Danske group has left Finland with
the second highest share in the EU15 of foreign-owned banking system assets—70 percent
compared to an average of 25 percent. In this connection, both BoF and FSA acknowledged
that, while regional supervisory cooperation through memoranda of understanding (MoUs) is
generally effective, it has not been tested under crisis conditions. Thus the authorities’ efforts
focus, at both the Nordic and European levels, on (i) harmonizing supervisory cooperation on
major cross-border groups4 (including the coordination of deposit guarantee schemes) and
(ii) defining ex-ante rules and intervention procedures, in particular to minimize conflicting
interests in case of financial crises (e.g., rules to determine when a subsidiary is of systemic
importance and for burden-sharing for intervention in systemic institutions). Supervisors also
confirmed their intention to work closely with market participants and foreign supervisors to
improve supervision of an increasingly cross-border “infrastructure” (e.g., merged stock
exchanges in the Nordic/Baltic area).
30.
Implementation of European directives is proceeding apace. The capital
requirements directive (based on Basel II) came into force in February 2007, but banks can
delay its application to 2008. To limit temporarily the possible acceleration of lending from
the capital “freed” by risk-based determination of capital, the FSA has required banks that
choose the internal-ratings-based approach not to reduce for 2008 and 2009 their capital to
less than 90 and 80 percent respectively of that prescribed under Basel I. The financial
markets directive (MiFID) will be enacted in November 2007. Finland is planning to merge
the FSA with the insurance supervisor in 2009, reflecting the growing bundling of activities
by financial institutions.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Finland’s recent economic performance is enviable. Finland has consistently
exhibited higher growth and lower inflation than most other EU countries, while the budget
and external current account have attained sizable surpluses. Finland also excels in
innovation and business environment rankings.
32.
Competitiveness of the Finnish economy is also broadly appropriate. Though
some measures suggest that the real effective exchange rate may be undervalued, the rising
old-age dependency ratio and declining terms of trade, as well as pressures on exporters’
profitability, probably mean that competitiveness margins are moderate. Moreover, the
4

In particular, concerning other Nordic countries, supervision of Nordea is conducted according to the
supervisory college model following an agreement with the Swedish authorities, which stipulates joint
inspection and complete information sharing. An agreement is under discussion with Denmark to supervise
jointly the activities of Sampo-Danske.

17
external current account surplus is expected to diminish over the medium to long term. The
relatively strong external position at present is also the result of fiscal and structural policies
that are generally desirable from a long-term perspective.
33.
The authorities nonetheless face considerable challenges. A tightening labor
market threatens a build-up of wage pressures. Owing to demographic pressures and sluggish
productivity in sheltered sectors, growth is likely to decline, while—despite substantial
reforms to the pension system in recent years—the fiscal position remains unsustainable
from a longer-term perspective. Increasing international integration, together with
technological and organizational changes in the financial sector, improve efficiency, but
complicate supervision.
34.
Fiscal tightening is advisable both to ensure long-term sustainability and from a
cyclical perspective. To maintain an adequate net asset position of the general government
at least through 2050, the noninterest balance must improve by about 2 percent of GDP
relative to the authorities’ projected path. Some withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is also called
for because economic activity is somewhat above potential and the labor market is tight.
Otherwise, excess demand could translate into inflationary pressures. A general government
surplus of about 4 percent of GDP, only slightly above the 2006 level, would be an
appropriate target in both 2007 and 2008.
35.
Therefore, the authorities’ recently adopted budget framework for 2008–11 is
insufficiently restrained. Indeed, current projections imply a large fiscal loosening. The
authorities are confident that stronger-than-projected growth, aided by as yet unspecified
structural measures, could help maintain fiscal surpluses approximately at the current level.
However, relying on the assumption of a sizable pick-up in growth is risky. Measures to
boost productivity and employment should be implemented promptly and their effects on
growth assessed before raising spending or cutting taxes.
36.
With taxes and expenditures high, fiscal adjustment should focus on spending
restraint, facilitated by enhancing its efficiency, particularly at the local level. Sizable
savings would then be feasible while maintaining the quality of services. This calls for:
benchmarking to identify best practices; redesigning the multi-year expenditure ceilings and
extending them to local governments; greater recourse to outsourcing, public-private
partnerships, and user charges; and reform of intergovernmental relations to tighten
municipal budget constraints.
37.
Improved utilization of labor resources, especially older workers and the young,
is fundamental for future growth. Increased wage differentiation to help “price-in” those
with low skills would be useful. Similarly, an increase in tertiary education fees (while
maintaining financial aid to the truly needy), limits to the amount and duration of grants, and
greater reliance on student loans could lower the time to graduation of students and
accelerate their entry into the labor force. For the elderly, consideration should be given to

18
reduce the scope of early retirement, increase use of activation requirements, and tighten
control on access to these benefits. Tax and benefit policies ought to be revised to increase
the relative returns from employment, thereby alleviating “poverty-trap” effects.
38.
Strengthening competition in product markets to spur productivity would
complement labor market reform. Productivity can be enhanced, especially in the
sheltered sectors, through further privatization, restraining local monopolies, and promoting
non-discriminatory third-party access to network industries. In addition, more regulatory
flexibility in the trade sector and reform of agricultural support should increase competition
and efficiency.
39.
The financial system is sound and well supervised, but enhanced cross-border
supervision of financial institutions and infrastructure is key to preserve stability.
Rising foreign ownership in the banking sector poses considerable challenges for regulation
and supervision, highlighting the urgency to nurture cooperation between home and host
supervisors, especially to prepare for financial crises. Moreover, supervisors have to step up
their cooperation with market participants and foreign supervisors to control the systemic
risks associated with the spread of new technologies or products and with cross-border
financial infrastructure.
40.

Finland’s data are adequate for surveillance.

41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle.

1/ / Production frontier analysis. Measured relative to the most efficient country (with a score of 1.0), the
input efficiency indicates how much less input a country could use to achieve its current output (e.g., 0.6
indicates that it could achieve the same output with only 60 percent of current inputs); the output
efficiency indicates how much less output a country is producing (e.g., 0.8 indicates that it is producing
only 80 percent of output with the same input as the most efficient country). Input is public expenditure
as a percent of GDP; output is a composite public sector performance indicator comprising seven public
goods and services.

APPENDIX I. FINLAND: FUND RELATIONS
(As of April 30, 2007)
•

A staff team comprising Messrs. Figliuoli (head), Lutz, Mottu (all EUR), and Carcillo (FAD)
visited Helsinki during May 22–31. They met Mr. Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of
Finland, Mr. Katainen newly appointed Minister of Finance, Mr. Hetemäki, permanent
Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Finance, other senior officials of the central bank,
economic ministries, and the Financial Supervisory Authority. Mr. Saarenheimo, the
Executive Director for the Nordic-Baltic region, participated in the discussions.

•

The mission consulted with many members of the Finnish policy community. Meetings were
held with the Finance Committee of the Parliament, representatives of the Finnish Trade
Unions (SAK), the Confederation of Industries (EK), the Association of Local Authorities
(Kuntalitto), and members of the business, academic, and private financial communities.

•

The mission’s concluding statement and press conference received wide coverage in the
Finnish media. The authorities intend to publish the staff report.

•

Parliamentary elections were held on March 18, and a center-right coalition government took
office, replacing a center-left coalition, both with the Centre Party as their pivot and
Mr. Matti Vanhanen as Prime Minister.

Exchange Arrangements:

Finland’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Finland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Sections 2, 3, and 4) and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, apart from those in accordance with (i) IMF
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51) and the relevant UN Security Council
resolutions—measures have been taken to freeze the accounts of the Taliban and of listed
individuals and organizations associated with terrorism; (ii) EU regulations and the relevant
UN Security Council resolutions. An updated and comprehensive list of all EU restrictions
can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/sanctions/measures.htm
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation were held in Helsinki during October 18–25, 2005
and the Executive Board concluded the consultation on January 30, 2006. Country Report No. 06/36
summarizing the views of the Executive Board, was published.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 1, 2007

1.
This statement provides an update on recent economic developments based on
information received after the staff report was issued. The new information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
There have been further revisions to the national accounts. Estimates published in
July indicate that annual growth in 2006 was lower than previously thought 5 rather than
5½ percent, as a result of more comprehensive data and the correction of a methodological
error in the preliminary data. Private consumption and imports were revised up, while public
investment is now thought to have shrunk. The contribution of net exports to growth has been
halved to 1¼ percent of GDP. As mentioned in the staff report, data issued in June for the
first quarter of 2007 and a revised quarterly pattern of GDP for 2006 suggested that the
momentum of growth in 2007 is stronger than expected during the mission.
3.
In response to the June data revisions, the authorities have tentatively raised
their GDP growth projections. Specifically, the Ministry of Finance has increased its 2007
projection to 4.3 percent for 2007 and to 3.2 percent for 2008. The Ministry of Finance and
the Bank of Finland will release their next official projections in September.
4.
The staff’s GDP growth projections remain as stated in the report, despite the
lower 2006 growth. Based on the data issued in June, staff had already revised upwards its
growth outlook for 2007 and 2008 in the
Selected Indicators
report. The downward adjustment of

The downward revision by some
1 percentage point reflects higher
imports of services and, to a lesser
degree, goods. This has also led staff to reduce its projections of a current account surplus by
broadly similar amounts in future years. Staff’s estimates of the competitiveness margins are
correspondingly somewhat smaller.

6.
Inflation in June was 1.4 percent, in line with the annual projection of
1.5 percent.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 3, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Finland
On August 1, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2007 Article IV consultation with Finland.1
Background
Economic developments in recent years have been enviable. Growth has outpaced the euro
area average, inflation is among the lowest in the European Union, and the external current
account and general government budget are both comfortably in surplus. Nevertheless, the
onset of population aging will be felt more rapidly in Finland than elsewhere in the EU (with the
working age population projected to begin declining at the end of the decade). Without fiscal
and structural reforms, this threatens long-term growth prospects and fiscal sustainability.
The economy is set to grow by about 4 percent in 2007, lower than the 5½ percent recorded in
2006, although the 2006 outcome was boosted by the rebound from a labor-dispute in the paper
sector that shaved off about 1 percentage point from 2005 growth. The decline is almost entirely
attributable to a smaller contribution from net exports (similarly influenced by the labor dispute),
with the contribution of domestic demand growth projected to increase by about ½ percent of
GDP. Consumption growth remains robust, despite rising interest rates and household debt
loads, boosted by strong employment growth, income tax cuts, and strong consumer
confidence. With the economy operating slightly above its potential, economic growth is
expected to cool somewhat in 2008 to about 2½ percent, with declining contributions from all

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

components—consumption, investment, and net exports. Risks to the growth outlook are
balanced.
The labor market has improved markedly since 2005, with rising participation rates and
comparatively strong employment growth. The unemployment rate has dipped below the euro
area average, and hovers near estimates of the structural unemployment rate. Labor shortages
are increasing, especially in the construction sector and in the capital region.
Inflation has remained tamed, largely from comparatively high productivity gains that have
limited unit labor cost growth, and a trend worsening in the terms of trade. However, other oneoff effects that have also dampened price growth are waning, and inflation is slowly nearing the
euro area average. Also, while the current multi-year, economy-wide wage compact (set to
expire in the fall) has helped contain labor costs, a shift to sectoral agreements in the coming
round may exacerbate wage and inflation pressures, though providing scope for useful pay
differentiation.
Various estimates point to a benign external competitiveness position for Finland. The current
account surplus has been in excess of 5 percent of GDP in recent years, contributing to a
improved net international investment position.
The fiscal position strengthened markedly last year, with the general government surplus
nearing 4 percent of GDP, a surplus expected to persist in 2007. The budget has benefited from
higher-than-expected growth combined with a determined implementation of the authorities’
multi-year spending limits on central government outlays. As a result, the debt ratio has fallen
below 40 percent of GDP and the pension systems’ assets now approach 70 percent of GDP.
However, on the basis of official macro projections, the new government’s program implies a
sharp deterioration of the fiscal position, with the surplus declining to about 2 percent of GDP by
the end of its mandate in 2011.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ stability-oriented macroeconomic policies that
have underpinned a prolonged economic expansion. Growth and inflation developments have
both outperformed euro area averages, and recent activity indicators suggest near-term growth
prospects are favorable. The general government has recorded sizable surpluses, and is
expected to do so again this year.
Directors concurred that the competitiveness of the Finnish economy is broadly appropriate.
The external current account surplus is sizable at present, and some measures indicate
comfortable competitiveness margins. However, rapid population aging, worsening terms of
trade, and pressures on exporters’ profitability suggest that the surplus is likely to decline over
the medium to long term.
Despite this favorable background, Directors cautioned that Finland faces considerable
challenges. They stressed that Finland’s exceptionally rapid population aging and sluggish

3
productivity in sheltered sectors raise concerns about long-term growth and soundness of its
public finances. In addition, from a short-run perspective, the economy is estimated to be
operating slightly above its growth potential, with rising geographic and skill-specific labor
market shortages, which, with growing mismatches, could stoke wage and inflationary
pressures. Indeed, the move from the traditional economy-wide wage agreement to sectoral,
union-level wage negotiations for 2008 heightens inflationary risks, though holding promise of
fostering much needed pay differentiation. Furthermore, the export base remains relatively
narrow, posing risks to growth prospects.
In this light, and notwithstanding the already sizable general government surplus, Directors
advised a somewhat tighter fiscal policy for both cyclical and sustainability reasons. They noted
that, given positive output gaps expected in 2007–08 and tightening labor markets, some
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus would be appropriate. Thus, Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to correct the fiscal stance envisaged for 2008–11, were signs of overheating to arise.
In the period beyond 2011, Directors saw the need to target a uniform improvement in the
primary surplus of about 2 percent of GDP, in order to prepare for the anticipated expenditure
pressures from population aging.
Given already high revenue and expenditure levels, Directors stressed that fiscal adjustment
efforts should concentrate on reducing the growth of public spending, preferably through
increased efficiency, especially at the local level. To achieve this, they supported benchmarking
to identify best practices, and redesigning and extending the system of expenditure ceilings.
They also saw merit in greater recourse to outsourcing and well-designed public private
partnerships, rebalancing user charges, and the reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations, to
tighten municipal budget constraints.
Executive Directors noted that longer-term growth prospects and fiscal sustainability, would be
bolstered by improvements in labor and product market performance. Greater utilization of
human resources and strengthened competition in product markets were seen as vital
components of boosting Finland’s growth potential and placing its public finances on a sounder
footing. Directors considered that efforts to increase employment rates by the young and older
workers would be most useful. Increased wage differentiation was deemed to help “price-in”
those with little labor market experience or low skills. Reducing the scope for early retirement
and increasing activation requirements, along with the elimination of “poverty traps” through
reform of tax and benefit schemes, could also foster greater employment, especially among
older workers. Policies responding to these issues will need to take political economy
considerations into account. Directors advocated measures to enhance competition, especially
in sheltered sectors, to complement labor market reforms and boost productivity growth.
Directors welcomed the soundness and stability of the financial sector, as well as its diligent
supervision. At the same time, they counseled vigilance, in light of rising international integration
and rapidly evolving infrastructure. Enhanced cross-border cooperation among supervisors is
crucial given the expanding foreign ownership of domestic banking operations. And heightened
cooperation with both market participants and foreign supervisors was desirable to control the
systemic risks arising from the adoption of new technologies or products.

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Finland
August 1, 2007
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
1.
The upswing of the Finnish economy since the beginning of 2006 is proven to be
stronger and longer lasting than anticipated. In the first quarter of this year, GDP growth
continued at the brisk rate of 5 percent. As consumer confidence and domestic demand
appear to be holding up well, the growth rate for the full year of 2007 is likely to come in at
slightly above 4 percent, somewhat short of the 2006 rate which was inflated by the rebound
from a major labor dispute a year earlier, but still above the potential rate of growth. In line
with staff’s projection, the authorities expect growth to decelerate further in the following
years, mainly due to capacity constraints and especially the shortage of skilled labor in
mechanical engineering industry and construction.
2.
Supported by the cyclical upswing, the good employment trend of the past couple of
years is continuing in 2007, with the employment rate approaching, or even surpassing, 70
percent. Labor demand remains high, as evidenced by the large number of vacancies. The
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has decreased steeply during the spring and stood at
6.7 percent in June, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from a year earlier. The supply
of labor is also increasing, as the average retirement age continues to increase and strong
labor demand is attracting people from outside the labor market. Despite these positive
developments in labor supply, labor markets are tightening, as reminded by staff, and the
unemployment rate is now below its estimated structural level of 7.2 percent.
3.
Although inflation remains modest, it is gradually moving closer to the euro area
levels. The EU harmonized measure of consumer inflation, at around 1.4 percent, stands now
half a percentage point below the euro area average. In the future, the authorities expect
inflation to slightly accelerate further, consistent with staff’s forecast. In addition to the high
energy prices, this is partially due to accelerating wage dynamics caused by the tightening
labor market conditions. While the annual average increase in the earnings is expected to
remain unchanged at around 3 percent in 2007, the projection for 2008 is two percentage
points higher, much due to the timing of the contractual pay increases at the end of the year.
From the last quarter of the previous year to the last quarter of 2007, the earnings index is
expected to increase by 4.5 percent, and the pace of rise seems to continue throughout 2008.
4.
While wage growth remains above the EU average, continuing productivity growth
has ensured that, in terms of external competitiveness, Finland’s situation remains
comfortable. In addition, Finland has greatly benefited – likely more than most other EU
countries – from the ongoing global investment boom, particularly through the rising export
prices in the metals industry, which has helped to offset the trend-like decline in the export

2
prices of telecommunication products. This pattern of export growth is expected to continue
in the near future, and will help to broaden the Finnish export base. In the period from
January to April 2007, the export share of the metals industry (16 percent) as well as the
combined share for the rapidly growing mechanical and electric machinery industries (17
percent) exceeded the declining shares for the traditionally strong paper industry (14.7
percent) and telecommunication products (13.9 percent). However, looking further ahead, the
authorities acknowledge a non-negligible risk of current account weakening, due to high and
increasing labor costs and the deteriorating trend in terms of trade, as mentioned by staff.
5.
Aided by the rise in economic activity and the strong growth in capital income, the
financing position of the general government will strengthen this year, with an anticipated
fiscal surplus of more than 4 percent of GDP. General government revenues will grow by 5.5
percent this year, while the growth in expenses will be 4.5 percent. Moreover, the recently
updated figures suggest that general government expenditure as a share of GDP will decline
by one percentage point to 44.6 percent this year.
Fiscal Policy
6.
As noted by the staff report, the Government Program for the years 2008-2011
includes some essential and long-promised, short-term increases in public expenditures. The
authorities acknowledge that this is likely to result in a deterioration of the fiscal position.
They also share staff’s view on the need to maintain tight fiscal policy in the current cyclical
upswing. Recognizing the risk of weakening industrial competitiveness towards the end of
the cyclical peak, due to growing cost and wage pressures, the central task of the
government’s economic policy is to safeguard economic stability. Accordingly, the
envisaged tax cuts, mostly intended to enhance economic efficiency, are to take place at the
end of the current term.
7.
Nonetheless, the greatest challenge for fiscal policy comes from the rapidly
proceeding population ageing, and the authorities fully share staff’s concerns in this respect.
The May 2007 update to the population forecast revises mortality projections downward and
life expectancy upwards, with the result that in 2040, the number of population over 65 years
is now expected to be some 120 000 larger than suggested by projections only three years
ago. While the longevity correction included in the pension system will partly neutralize the
effect of increases in life expectancy on pension expenditure, the consequences to health care
and elderly care expenditure will be tangible. At the same time, due to a higher fertility ratio,
the number of children will also exceed earlier estimates, resulting in an overall higher
dependency ratio. The increasing expenditure pressures from pension and welfare services
will coincide with declining growth in national income and the tax base, resulting in
significant challenges for the sustainable funding of the general government.

3
8.
The authorities agree that under current policies, the fiscal position of the general
government is unsustainable over the long term. Nonetheless, they believe that once the
envisaged reforms can contribute to a substantially faster growth rate than that underlying the
present economic forecasts, a view also supported by Finland’s outstanding track record in
recent years. The Government Programme aims to achieve a structural surplus of one percent
of GDP for the central government by the end of this parliamentary term. The Government
Programme also commits the new government to achieve the goals stated in Finland’s
Stability Programme submitted by the previous government. The surplus objective will be
supported by structural reforms, including an overhaul of the social security system, to
improve the functioning of the labor markets. In addition, as noted by staff, the risks to
inflation and the fiscal position can be alleviated by appropriate timing of the planned
spending hikes and tax reductions.
9.
The authorities recognize that adjustment of the fiscal situation to the challenges of
population ageing must take place also on the expenditure side. As mentioned in the staff
report, several investment projects have already been postponed in the medium-term budget
framework to limit growth in government spending. It is also worth pointing out that
envisaged cuts in income taxation will be postponed to cyclically more suitable times and
will thus be back-loaded.. Moreover, the authorities concur with the assessment that there is a
potential for savings from enhancing the efficiency of government service provision, without
any deterioration in the quality of services. To this end, continued implementation of the
Government productivity program and restructuring of public services remain key.
10.
At the local government level, while tax revenues and central government transfers
continue to rise rapidly, further savings can be gained from the government’s ongoing
municipalities and services reform. The aim of the reform is to improve productivity and
curb local government expenditure growth. Service structures will be strengthened by
consolidating individual services that require a population base larger than one municipality
to be viable, and closer cooperation between municipalities will be promoted. Appropriate
regrouping and merging of municipalities will further bolster the efficiency of local
government. Some outright mergers have already taken place, and tens of further mergers are
under preparation. The number of municipalities stands now at 416, down from 448 five
years ago. As recognized by staff, however, the low population density does set some natural
limits to the economies of scale from such development.
11.
As the Government Programme states, the authorities are committed to secure the
sustainability of public finances. According to the Government Programme, the government
will assess whether sufficient provisions have been made to meet the impending challenges
brought about by population ageing so that any necessary corrective actions can be
undertaken while the present government is still in office.

4
Labor Market Policies
12.
Despite the many positive developments in the Finnish labor market, staff correctly
highlights the remaining structural problems. The recent gains in employment rates and the
falling unemployment rate mask weaknesses in some parts of the labor market. Although the
employment rate of older workers has improved rapidly in recent years, it remains below that
of the Nordic peers, and the same applies to employment of the Finnish youth. These
concerns need to be addressed, particularly in light of the demographic changes and the
incipient downward turn in the overall labor force. The authorities, therefore, concur with
staff’s assessment on the need to improve labor market participation by shortening study
times and encouraging ageing workers to stay longer in working life. In line with this, labor
market issues are high on the government’s agenda.
13.
Changes are already taking place in the Finnish labor market. The recent
decentralized wage agreements take better into account the economy-wide differences in
productivity developments by enhancing the scope of local bargaining, thus providing more
flexibility in the wage-setting system. The government plans include a substantial increase in
wage subsidies for low-wage jobs, implementation of an action plan to activate young
unemployed, as well as to phase in a profiling system for job seekers. In addition, the merger
of the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, once implemented in 2008,
is expected to smooth the process of matching job seekers and vacancies by utilizing the
public employment services more effectively.
14.
To introduce more fundamental improvements to the functioning of the Finnish labor
market, the government is planning to review the entire social security system and has set up
a tripartite committee to consider different reform possibilities. The work of the committee
covers the areas of (i) basic social security, (ii) earnings-related security, (iii) financing and
incentives and (iv) governance and processes. The committee’s work will commence this fall
and is expected to be completed by the end of 2009, with the first legislative changes
anticipated in the fall of 2008. The timetable is intentionally cautious, as the policies and
benefit systems under scrutiny are socially sensitive, and rushing could endanger the success
of the reform.
Financial Sector
15.
Staff correctly observes that the Finnish financial system remains stable and sound. In
2006 the profitability and capital adequacy of the Finnish banks and most insurance
companies was strong. Data from the first two quarters of 2007 indicate continued
improvement of profitability. The risk-bearing capacity of the financial system remains very
good.

5
16.
Banks’ good results have been boosted by rapid growth in net interest income,
generated by an increase in the volume of financial intermediation and the widening margin
between lending and deposit rates, as the pass-through of the increasing market interest rates
is stronger to the former than to the latter. At the same time, tight competition has kept
lending margins over the reference market interest rates narrow, which may pose a risk to
banks’ profitability in the long term. While intensifying competition has not so far been
reflected in deposit rates, there are some incipient signs of a change on this front as well.
17.
Household indebtedness remains relatively moderate in international comparison, and
is not seen as a threat to financial stability or to sustained economic growth. This
notwithstanding, as noted by staff, household debt is unevenly distributed within the
household sector, which might give cause for some concern. The bulk of debt is, however,
held by households with the highest levels of income, which also have greater assets than
other households.
18.
The corporate sector profitability is good and the level of debt reasonable. Banks’
actual credit losses or nonperforming assets show no indication of increased difficulties in
the corporate sector.
19.
The most significant internal challenges to the stability of the financial system are
structural and related to the consolidation and internalization of the financial sector. As also
highlighted by staff, these structural changes also pose substantial challenges for regulation
and supervision. In the future, the two major commercial banks may be transformed into
branches of their foreign parent banks. Such a reorganization would lead to an entirely new
situation for supervision, as the EU legislation so far does not give the host country
supervisor much of a role. To the extent the host supervisor has a role, it comes largely from
the option for the home country supervisor to outsource some tasks. Financial stability and
consumer confidence might require creating a framework that allows active participation by
the host country supervisor also in the case of branches.
20.
The consolidation of the Finnish Financial Supervision Authority and the Insurance
Supervision Authority, which is included in the Government Programme, is designed to
improve the efficiency of financial and insurance market supervision by exploiting the
synergies both in expertise and in terms of common supervised entities.
21.
There are many ongoing large EU projects (e.g. the Single Euro Payments Area) in
the area of financial market infrastructure that will bear fruit over the next few years. These
initiatives will improve the efficiency of the Finnish financial system thanks to economies of
scale, but they also include challenges from the viewpoint of maintaining the current high
service levels, competition issues and crises management.
