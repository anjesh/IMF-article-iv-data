IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with United States

On July 6, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
The U.S. economy’s momentum in the first quarter was sapped by unfavorable weather, a sharp
contraction in oil sector investment, and the West Coast port strike. But the underpinnings for a
continued expansion remain in place. A solid labor market, accommodative financial conditions,
and cheaper oil should support a more dynamic path for the remainder of the year. Despite this,
the weaker outturn in the first few months of this year will unavoidably pull down 2015 growth,
which is now projected at 2.5 percent. Stronger growth over the next few years is expected to
return output to potential before it begins steadily declining to 2 percent over the medium term.
Inflation pressures remain muted. In May headline and core personal consumption expenditure
(PCE) inflation declined to 0.2 and 1.2 percent year on year, respectively. Long-term
unemployment and high levels of part-time work both point to remaining employment slack, and
wage indicators on the whole have shown only tepid growth. When combined with the dollar
appreciation and cheaper energy costs, inflation is expected to rise slowly staring later in the
year, reaching the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent medium-term objective by mid 2017.
An important risk to growth is a further U.S. dollar appreciation. The real appreciation of the
currency has been rapid, reflecting cyclical growth divergences, different trajectories for
monetary policies among the systemically important economies, and a portfolio shift toward U.S.
dollar assets. Lower oil prices and increasing energy independence have contained the U.S.
current account deficit, despite the cyclical growth divergence with respect to its main trading
partners and the rise in the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, over the medium term, at current levels of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

the real exchange rate, the current account deficit is forecast to widen toward 3.5 percent of
GDP.
Despite important policy uncertainties, the near term fiscal outlook has improved, and the federal
government deficit is likely to move modestly lower in the current fiscal year. Following a
temporary improvement, the federal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios are, however, expected to
begin rising again over the medium term as aging-related pressures assert themselves and interest
rates normalize. In the near-term, the potential for disruption from either a government shutdown
or a stand-off linked to the federal debt ceiling represent important (and avoidable) downside
risks to growth and job creation that could move to the forefront, once again, later in 2015.
Much has been done over the past several years to strengthen the U.S. financial system.
However, search for yield during the prolonged period of low interest rates, rapid growth in
assets in the nonbank sector, and signs of stretched valuations across a range of asset markets
point to emerging pockets of vulnerabilities. The more serious risks are likely to be linked to: (1)
the migration of intermediation to the nonbanks; (2) the potential for insufficient liquidity in a
range of fixed income markets that could lead to abrupt moves in market pricing; and (3) lifeinsurance companies that have taken on greater market risk. But several factors mitigate these
downsides. In particular, the U.S. banking system has strengthened its capital position (Tier 1
capital as a ratio of risk-weighted assets is at about 13 percent) and appears resilient to a range of
extreme market and economic shocks. In addition, overall leverage does not appear excessive,
household and corporate balance sheets look generally healthy, and credit growth has been
modest.
The consultation focused on the prospects for higher policy rates and the outlook for, and policy
response to financial stability risks, integrating the findings of the latest IMF Financial Sector
Assessment Program for the U.S.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that the economic
recovery continues to be underpinned by strong fundamentals, despite a temporary setback,
while risks remain broadly balanced. Directors observed that considerable uncertainties, both
domestic and external, weigh on the U.S. economy, with potential repercussions for the global
economy and financial markets elsewhere. These include the timing and pace of interest rate
increases, prospects for the dollar, and risks of weaker global growth. Directors stressed that

managing these challenges, as well as addressing longstanding issues of public finances and
structural weaknesses, are important policy priorities in the period ahead.
Directors agreed that decisions on interest rate increases should remain data-dependent,
considering a broad range of indicators and carefully weighing the trade-offs involved.
Specifically, they saw merit in awaiting clear signs of wage and price inflation, and sufficiently
strong economic growth before initiating an interest rate increase. Noting the importance of the
entire path of future policy rate changes, including in terms of the implications for outward
spillovers and for financial markets, Directors were reassured by the Federal Reserve’s intention
to follow a gradual pace of normalization. They welcomed the Federal Reserve’s efforts, and
commitment to continue, to communicate its policy intentions clearly and effectively. Directors
acknowledged that financial stability risks could arise from a protracted period of low interest
rates. In this regard, they underscored the importance of strong regulatory, supervisory, and
macroprudential frameworks to mitigate these risks.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress in reinforcing the architecture for financial
sector oversight. They concurred with the main findings and recommendations of the Financial
Sector Assessment Program assessment. Directors highlighted the need to complete the
regulatory reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act and to address emerging pockets of vulnerability
in the nonbank financial sector. They encouraged continued efforts to monitor and manage risks
in the insurance sector, close data gaps, and improve the effectiveness of the Financial Stability
Oversight Council while simplifying the broader institutional structure over time. Directors
looked forward to further progress in enhancing cross-border cooperation among national
regulators, and the framework for the resolution of cross-jurisdiction financial institutions.
Directors noted that there remain a range of challenges linked to fiscal health, lackluster business
investment and productivity growth, and growing inequality. They agreed that reforms to the tax,
pension, and health care systems will help create space for supporting near-term growth,
including through infrastructure investment. Directors reiterated the need for a credible
medium-term fiscal strategy that would anchor ongoing consolidation efforts, underpin debt
sustainability, and reduce fiscal uncertainties. They called for renewed efforts to implement
structural reforms to boost productivity and labor force participation, tackle poverty, address
remaining weaknesses in the housing market, and advance the multilateral trade agenda.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the United States will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

UNITED STATES
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 18, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Strategy: The 2015 U.S. Article IV consultation centered on the prospects for higher
policy rates and the outlook for, and policy response to, financial stability risks,
integrating the findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
Main findings and policy messages:


The underpinnings for continued growth and job creation remain in place despite
momentum being sapped in recent months.



The FOMC should remain data dependent, carefully weighing the risk of weakening
progress toward full employment and having to return to zero interest rates versus
the risk of creating a temporary rise of inflation above the Fed’s medium-term goal
and having to subsequently raise policy rates at a faster pace.



The FOMC should defer its first increase in policy rates until there are greater signs of
wage or price inflation than are currently evident. Based on staff’s macroeconomic
forecast, and barring upside surprises to growth and inflation, this would imply a
gradual path of policy rate increases starting in the first half of 2016.



Pockets of financial vulnerabilities are emerging, putting a premium on improving the
resilience of the financial system. Regulatory reforms remain incomplete and the
structure of oversight has scope to be strengthened along a number of dimensions.



A credible and detailed medium-term consolidation plan is needed to address rising
health and social security costs and to improve the tax system. Such a plan would
provide near-term fiscal space to finance supply-side measures that support future
growth.



A range of policy challenges linked to poverty, productivity, and labor force
participation remain largely unaddressed.

THE MACRO OUTLOOK
1.
Momentum interrupted. The U.S. economy’s momentum in the first quarter was derailed by
unfavorable weather, a sharp contraction in oil sector investment, and the West Coast port strike.
These developments represent a temporary drag but not a long-lasting brake on growth.
2.
Respectable growth ahead. Despite the hiatus in growth over the past few months, the
underpinnings for a continued expansion remain in place and the outlook is for a more dynamic path
for the remainder of the year (Figure 1).
Labor Market Slack 1/

A solid labor market. Labor markets have
steadily repaired over the past year and
several indicators suggest a jobs outlook that
is returning to pre-crisis norms. Job growth
has averaged about 250,000 per month over
the past year, the unemployment rate has
fallen to 5½ percent, and real disposable
personal income is growing above 3 percent
year-on-year. Despite this progress, longterm unemployment, subdued participation,
and high levels of part-time work suggest
that the economy remains well below full
employment.
Accommodative financial conditions. Close
to zero short-term rates, compressed risk
and term premia, and an upbeat equity
market all add up to very cheap financing
for both consumers and firms. There is
tentative evidence that spillovers from ECB
actions have loosened U.S. domestic
financial conditions, although the effects
appear quantitatively small.



Cheaper oil. Lower oil prices have added around 1 percent of GDP to households’ purchasing
power since mid-2014. The evidence so far suggests this windfall has largely been saved.
However, in the remainder of the year, the net effect on the economy is expected to be
supportive of growth. The positive consumption effect will, though, be partly offset by
weaker oil-related investment with crude prices falling below breakeven thresholds and
rendering extraction unprofitable for many U.S. fields (Box 1).



A shrinking output gap. Unemployment has fallen close to its natural rate and capacity
utilization rate is at the average levels seen in 2005–07. The output gap has fallen from
1.9 percent at end-2013 to 1.4 percent by end-2014 (Box 2). Conditions are now in place for a

gradual pick-up in real household earnings. A cyclical, albeit gradual, rise in investment by
domestic-oriented (non-oil) businesses should be supported by sizable cash holding, upbeat
business confidence, and an aging capital stock (Figures 1 and 2).
Growth this year is expected to be 2.5 percent. Sustained growth in the next two years should return
output to its potential by end-2017. However, potential growth (at around 2 percent) is expected to
be considerably weaker than pre-crisis unless a broad range of structural issues are addressed to
raise productivity, create incentives for innovation and capital formation, and raise labor force
participation.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Effects of the Oil Price Decline
Oil production
The U.S. has emerged as the world’s largest
producer with crude production almost
doubling between 2010 and 2014 (the bulk of
the increase driven by shale oil). Production
should remain steady in 2015 due to the
substantial investments of prior years. However,
given the depletion profile of existing fields,
production is likely to decline in 2016, as the
recent sudden stop in new investment begins to
feed through.

The oil and gas extraction industry accounts for
about 1½–2 percent of GDP.1 During 2011–14, oil and gas investment contributed about
2½ percentage points to the level of U.S. real investment (equivalent to 0.4 percentage points of
real GDP).


Capital formation. Industry analysts estimate that investment in shale and tight oil
drilling and exploration could be reduced by around 40 percent in 2015. The direct GDP
impact is likely to be around 0.3 percentage points in 2015 (and likely frontloaded in the
first part of the year). The effects on other industry segments—such as support activities
and oilfield services—could make the effect modestly higher.



Consumption. Households should benefit from the sharp decline in gasoline prices and
the reduction in their energy bills. Lower prices of gasoline alone will add 0.9 percent of
GDP to household disposable income in 2015. There is a further savings of about 0.1
percent of GDP in utility bills. So far, the evidence suggests these gains have been mostly
saved with the personal saving rate rising to 5.6 percent in April—about one percentage
point above its level of 6 months ago. However, in the baseline forecast this is expected to
be temporary, as in previous episodes of sharp oil price declines. For 2015 as a whole,
additional consumption from lower oil prices is forecast to contribute 0.6 percentage
points to growth.

In North Dakota—one of the two main centers of U.S. tight oil boom (after Texas)—the sector’s share in state
GDP is below 5 percent. Employment share of the sector in total employment is also very small (0.6 percent).

Box 2. A New Methodology to Estimate Potential Output and the Output Gap1
Previous estimates. Potential output was estimated using a multi-sector production function.
First, for each sector data on output, employment, and capital stock was used to deduce totalfactor productivity (TFP) as a residual from a two-factor production function. Second, the resulting
TFP series was smoothed, maximum employment was determined (using historical relationships
between the unemployment rate and changes in the rate of inflation), and actual data on the
capital stock were used to determine potential output. However, in recent years, this methodology
has suggested a significant output gap that has seemed at odds with rising levels of capacity
utilization and a rapidly repairing labor market.
A multivariate filtering approach. The model incorporates relationships between the output gap
and inflation (Phillips curve); the output gap and unemployment gap (Okun’s law); and an
equation relating the output gap and the capacity utilization gap:
(Philips curve)
(Okun’s law)
(Capacity utilization)
Where is core inflation, is the output gap,
is the unemployment gap, and
is the
capacity utilization gap. The model is estimated for the U.S. using a Kalman filter and Bayesian
techniques.
Results. The new methodology results in a
lower level of potential output, a broadly
unchanged potential growth rate of 2 percent,
larger (positive) output gaps before the global
financial crisis, and smaller (negative) output
gaps in the aftermath of the global financial
crisis. In particular, the 2014 output gap is now
estimated at -2 percent of potential GDP (rather
than the -3.5 percent of potential GDP under
the previous, production function based,
methodology). This is mostly due to the
incorporation of information contained in
inflation dynamics and the behavior of capacity
utilization.

3.
Tepid price inflation. Headline PCE inflation (at 0.1 percent year-on-year in April) is being
temporarily dragged down by lower oil prices. Core PCE inflation (at 1.2 percent year-on-year in
April) has faced headwinds from dollar appreciation, the falling global prices of tradable goods, and
a residual pass-through from cheaper energy (Figure 2). Core inflation is likely to remain flat in the
coming months, and start to rise only toward year-end, reaching the Fed’s 2 percent medium-term
objective by end-2017. The potential for further dollar appreciation, a continued lack of wage
dynamism, and the scope for firms to absorb cost increases into their (currently healthy) profit
margins all pose downside risks to the inflation outlook.

to decline at a slow pace as part-time workers extend
their hours and discouraged workers are drawn back into the labor market.
5.
Fiscal developments. The federal government deficit was $483 billion in FY2014 (2.8 percent
of GDP) and is likely to move modestly lower in the current fiscal year with income tax receipts
currently running above budget forecasts. The Bipartisan Budget Act was passed in December 2013
covering FY2014 and FY2015. Despite this progress, the U.S. faces important fiscal issues in the
coming months:


The Highway Trust Fund. A stop-gap measure provides spending authorization only until
end-July. This is the 33rd short-term patch to surface transportation funding over the past six
years. The uncertainty of prospects for the fund is believed to be negatively impacting statelevel infrastructure spending.



The Affordable Care Act. Legal uncertainties around healthcare were highlighted when the
Supreme Court agreed to hear a lower court case on whether enrollees in federally-run
health exchanges are eligible to receive public subsidies. The Supreme Court is expected to
provide an opinion by end-June. If it were to find against the government, millions of
enrollees in more than 30 states could be affected, impacting access to healthcare and the
ability to pool insurance risks.



The federal debt limit. The suspension of the debt limit ended on March 15. The Treasury has
some headroom created by cash planning and extraordinary measures but, without
legislative action, the debt limit is likely to become a binding constraint towards the end of
the year.

External outlook. The real appreciation of the U.S. dollar has been rapid and a product of

economies, and a portfolio shift toward U.S. dollar

and desirable policies (see Annex III. External Sector
Assessment).
7.
Global spillovers from a sustained dollar appreciation. Many emerging and low-income
economies have lowered their vulnerability to U.S. dollar appreciation. Nevertheless, large gross
dollar funding positions could pose vulnerabilities for some. The rise in U.S. dollar debt issued by
highly leveraged corporates in emerging economies is a notable source of risk (see the 2015
Spillover Report).
8.
Risks to financial stability. At this point, the data suggest a system that has pockets of
vulnerabilities rather than one containing broad-based excesses. Nevertheless, these vulnerabilities
cannot be ignored. Credit risks have risen, underwriting standards are weakening, and an increasing
volume of funds is flowing to lower-rated companies. Equity market valuations, by a number of
metrics, are on the high side (although not extreme relative to historical patterns). The more serious,
macro-relevant sources of risk to financial stability are linked to:


The migration of intermediation to the nonbanks where there is less visibility on the size and
nature of the embedded risks and fewer regulatory and supervisory tools to manage those
risks (Figure 3).



The potential for insufficient liquidity in a range of fixed income markets which could lead to
abrupt moves in market pricing, particularly if there were to be a large rebalancing of asset
allocations. The causes of, and solutions to, such market liquidity risks are still imperfectly
understood.



Insurers have taken on greater market risk. Stress tests show that under severe but plausible
downside scenarios a large part of the industry—particularly life insurers—could be faced
with negative shareholder equity if firms were forced into fire sales.

However, several factors mitigate these downsides. The U.S. banking system has strengthened its
capital position (Tier 1 capital as a ratio of risk-weighted assets is 13 percent) and appears resilient to
a range of extreme market and economic shocks (as evidenced by the recent Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review results and echoed by the FSAP stress tests). In addition, overall leverage does

Box 3. The Impact of U.S. Dollar Appreciation—The Importance of Context
Drawing on a multi-country GIMF model, calibrated for the U.S., the impact of a stronger dollar is
shown to depend highly on the underlying circumstances that generate the appreciation. Three
potential scenarios illustrate the importance of general equilibrium effects:


Permanently higher U.S. shale oil productions. An anticipated increase in shale oil
production that is large enough to create a 5 percent appreciation of the exchange rate
results in a boost to domestic demand and causes non-oil imports to increase (although
exports decline as a result of the appreciation). Over the medium term, there would be a
deterioration in the U.S. current account balance and a rebalancing of the sources of
growth toward domestic demand.



Structural slowdown in Japan and Europe. In general, higher expected growth in the U.S.
relative to trading partners—even after accounting for expected monetary policy
tightening in the U.S. and easing in trading partners—tends to have a relatively small
effect on currencies, particularly since countries are at zero interest rates. However, a
significant slowdown in trading partners (that would be large enough to lead to a
5 percent appreciation), would initially knock around ½ percentage point off of growth
and raise the current account deficit by around ¾ percent of GDP. However, the resulting
lower global oil prices and greater capital inflows into the U.S. would, over a longer
horizon actually boost growth.



A temporary but persistent portfolio preference shift. Increased inflows into U.S. dollar
assets have a large and immediate effect on the exchange rate and can lead to a
loosening of domestic financial conditions (as equity prices rise and bond yields fall).
Looser financial conditions support domestic demand, drawing in more imports and
causing a decline in the current account of close to 1 percent of GDP. Over time, the
dollar appreciation unwinds but domestic demand effects persist causing the overall
growth effect to eventually turn positive.

not appear excessive, household and corporate balance sheets look generally healthy, and credit
growth has been modest.

RISKS TO STRONG AND SUSTAINED GROWTH
9.
A further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. A prominent risk to the outlook is that the
currency will continue appreciating due to sustained cyclical divergences and capital flows into U.S.
dollar assets. If so, the U.S. external position would be pushed further away from levels justified by
medium-term fundamentals and growth could be significantly debilitated. Although the context
would be important, if the U.S. currency were to move into the range where it could be described as
substantially overvalued—with a current account deficit heading toward 5 percent of GDP—this
would likely point to the move in the dollar having gone “too far”, potentially creating future risks,
including in some emerging market economies, as global imbalances reassert themselves.
10.
Uncertainty surrounding the effect of
lower oil prices. The rise of the household saving
rate in the first four months of this year could
have been for temporary reasons: poor weather
and uncertainty about the duration of oil
windfalls. The baseline outlook assumes that these
effects will wane as lower energy prices start to
feed into better consumption and higher non-oil
investment. Because low-income households,
which benefit the most from declines of pump
prices, have still weak balance sheets (having
benefited less from mortgage refinancing and the
equity and property price increases) much of the
oil windfall this time could be used for debt
reduction. The demand effect would be further
compromised if current low oil prices are seen as a
temporary phenomenon. As a further growth
downside, the size of oil industry capital spending
retrenchment could be larger than is currently
estimated, a fact that was vividly underlined by the
recent decline in oil drilling activity. On the other
hand, a potential upside is that there could be an
even bigger decline in the future personal savings
rate than is projected in the baseline, consistent
with previous episodes of steep oil price declines.

The potential for uninspiring business investment. Non-oil, non-residential investment
has been well below rates in previous recoveries (even before the rise in the dollar and in spite of
healthy balance sheets and an aging capital stock). Corporations are using cash holdings for share

UNITED STATES

buybacks and merger and acquisition activity to lessen tax liabilities (rather than for capital
formation). The underlying reasons for low business investment are not well understood, and could
be related to the decline in productivity or the rise of capital-economizing innovations. A shift of
demand to labor-intensive services, as the U.S. population ages, is another candidate explanation. A
more benign explanation is that firms simply need to be more confident regarding future expected
demand (consistent with the findings of the Spring 2015 WEO, which argues that much of the
investment decline can be explained by a simple accelerator model).
12.
A new long-term housing equilibrium. Housing market activity has struggled to recover.
Up until recently, household formation has been depressed despite the potential for pent-up
demand from demographics and more secure job prospects. The slow return of millennials to the
first-time home buyers market could signal a preference shift away from traditional suburban,
owner-occupied housing. Indeed, the urban rental market remains strong which could represent an
enduring increase in demand for multi-family housing units with a smaller square footage. If true,
this would permanently lower the steady state

13.
The debt ceiling, redux. With the debt limit becoming binding towards the end of the year,
down-to-the-wire brinkmanship over fiscal policy could create excessive bond market volatility,
particularly as the political ground is prepared for the 2016 presidential election. This would
undermine confidence, as it has in the past, but could create a more complex if the timing coincides
with a Fed lift-off or an unpredictable external shock.
14.
A less-than-smooth rise in rates. The Fed’s first rate increase in almost nine years has been
carefully prepared and telegraphed. Nevertheless, regardless of timing, higher U.S. policy rates could
still result in a significant and abrupt rebalancing of international portfolios with market volatility and
financial stability consequences that go well beyond U.S. borders. Even without policy changes,
higher inflation numbers unaccompanied by better activity data could lead to a sudden upward shift
in the yield curve or risk spreads. In either case, a shift in expectations about the future pace of rate
increases could create flows into U.S. dollar assets and a further meaningful appreciation of the
dollar. Similarly, anxiety around a tightening cycle—even if accompanied by a strong underlying
economy—could create a sell-off in equities or riskier fixed income assets. Such asset price volatility
could last more than just a few days and have larger-than-anticipated negative effects on financial

conditions, growth, labor markets, and inflation outcomes. Spillovers to economies with close trade
and financial linkages could be substantial.
15.
Negative inward spillovers. Continued weakening of growth in the rest of the world could
suppress U.S. exports and investment in tradable sectors. Weaker global growth or a pronounced
China slowdown, alongside a stronger dollar, would also weaken profits of U.S. multinationals and
could trigger a re-pricing of equity valuations (with the attendant harm to U.S. consumption via
wealth effects). Finally, risks from Russia/Ukraine, Greece or the Middle East represent an
unpredictable wild card with negative, but difficult to quantify, effects for the U.S.
16.
Authorities’ views. Weak growth in the first quarter was seen as a temporary setback. The
recovery was expected to resume given a still strong labor market, but the rebound is likely being
weakened by headwinds from a strong dollar, weak global growth, and possibly greater caution
among households and businesses. Uncertainty remains about the strength of the housing recovery,
despite recent improvements, but there have been policy efforts to increase mortgage availability
and support first-time home buyers. The rapid rise in student debt was a cause for concern but
efforts are being made—including the pay-as-you-earn plans that cap student loan payments at
10 percent of discretionary income—to lessen default risks. While not taking a view on the level or
future direction of the U.S. dollar, there was a general recognition that the different cyclical positions
of the largest economies would influence currency markets. However, the authorities noted that what
is needed at a global level is increased efforts in enhancing total demand, not a shifting of demand
between countries that was facilitated by movements in exchange rates. To achieve that increased
global demand, the policy recipes differed from country to country. However, the U.S. could not be
seen as a sponge for the whole global economy, absorbing their production through U.S. imports.

THE IMPENDING MONETARY NORMALIZATION
17.
An uncertain backdrop. The U.S. economy remains below potential, wage and price
pressures are expected to remain low, and inflation expectations appear well-anchored. Nonetheless,
the decision on the timing and pace of policy rate increases is complicated by significant
uncertainties surrounding the resilience of future economic growth, the remaining distance to
maximum employment, and the current level and future path of the “neutral” fed funds rate (Box 4).
Although financial conditions remain accommodative, monetary conditions are being tightened
somewhat by the appreciation of the dollar. Furthermore, the fragility of U.S. growth has been
repeatedly underlined with the momentum being disrupted by weather, concerns about Europe, and
political stand-offs over the budget and debt limit. Any move to normalize monetary policy,
therefore, needs to be approached cautiously.

Raising rates too early could trigger a greater-than-expected tightening of financial
conditions due to some combination of a further upward swing in the U.S. dollar, lower
equity prices, and/or a repricing of risk premia and the yield curve. Of course, much of this
would depend on financial market reactions to the policy move. However, there is a risk that
the tightening impact on the economy could go well beyond the initial 25bp increase in the
fed funds rate, creating a risk that the economy stalls (Figure 4). This would likely force the
Fed to reverse direction, moving rates back down toward zero—as the ECB and the Riksbank
did in 2011 and Japan did repeatedly in the 1990s and 2000s—with potential costs to
credibility.

Raising rates too late could require a more rapid path upward for policy rates due to an
acceleration of inflation, with negative consequences for financial market volatility and the
macroeconomy. Such a rapid policy rate increase was seen in 1994 when, after an initial 25bp
move, higher-than-expected inflation caused the Fed to accelerate the pace of rate increases
and 10-year yields rose about 200bp over the course of the next 12 months.



19.
Staff’s view. Given the balance in the likelihood and severity of these two-sided risks, there
is a strong case for waiting to raise rates until there are more tangible signs of wage or price inflation
than are currently evident. Inflation inertia, firmly anchored expectations, Fed credibility, and
evidence of a relatively flat relationship between inflation and slack all suggest that a sudden
acceleration in wages or prices (as in 1994, when headline CPI inflation rose 0.7 percent between
May and September) is unlikely. Global disinflationary trends (e.g. in commodities and tradable
goods) and the pass-through from the strengthening dollar are also likely to act as important
dampening forces to inflation. A later increase in rates could imply a faster pace of rate increases
thereafter and may create a modest overshooting of inflation above the Fed’s medium-term goal
(perhaps up toward 2½ percent, see Figure 5). However, deferring rate increases and proceeding
gradually thereafter would provide valuable insurance against the risks from disinflation, policy
reversal, and ending back at a zero fed funds rate. If data evolves in line with staff’s macroeconomic
forecasts, and barring upside surprises to growth or inflation, such a policy would imply keeping the
fed funds rate at 0–0.25 percent into the first half of 2016 with a gradual rise in the federal funds rate
thereafter. Of course, first and foremost, policy should remain data dependent, looking at a broadrange of available indicators and forecasts. This would mean that if either wage or price inflation
were to become more visible at an earlier stage than is embedded in staff’s forecasts, interest rates
should be raised on a more accelerated timetable.

Communication at a premium. The Fed has laid the groundwork for an increase in policy
rates, going a considerable distance in providing clarity about its data-driven decision making
process. Of course, the Fed is unable to provide certainty about its intentions but as the first rate hike
approaches and monetary policy normalization proceeds, there will continue to be a premium on
effective communication about the expected path of increases in policy interest rates ahead. In this
context, past Fund advice—to schedule a press conference by the Fed chair after every FOMC
meeting and to publish a quarterly monetary policy report that details economic projections that are
endorsed by the FOMC—bears repeating. Adding more communication tools will undoubtedly run
into practical implementation challenges, but still merits consideration given the potential benefits.
21.
Global spillover considerations. Higher interest rates that are driven by a robust economy
moving closer to maximum employment should be a positive force for other countries. The effects
from stronger demand outweigh the dampening effects of tighter global financial conditions,
particularly if countries allow their exchange rates to respond flexibly. However, an increase in yields
in a weaker growth environment (e.g. precipitated by a pickup in inflation or an unexpected market
re-pricing of risk premia) could lead to higher sovereign and corporate spreads, volatile capital flows,
falling asset prices, and a drag on partner country growth. Effects would differ across countries and
regions but, in a downside scenario, emerging and frontier market economies with weaker
fundamentals are likely to be the most exposed (see 2015 Spillover Report).
22.
Authorities’ view. The course of monetary policy will be determined by the path of
incoming data and what that reveals about the economy. The U.S. economy appears well positioned
for continued growth and inflation is expected to move gradually up toward 2 percent as the
economy strengthens further and as transitory negative influences wane. At this stage, the decision
to raise rates depends on whether policy makers see the recovery as sufficiently strong to generate
continued improvement in labor conditions, and whether they are reasonably confident that inflation
will move back towards the Fed’s inflation objective. Also, while the timing of the first rate hike was
receiving a lot of attention, the path of subsequent policy rate changes was of greater importance
and, on that, the authorities emphasized the pace of normalization was likely to be gradual. Effective
communication was seen as critical. However, the authorities saw little benefit from more press
conferences and emphasized that they have multiple alternative avenues of communication,
including speeches, publications, and congressional testimony. They also emphasized the practical
challenges that would be involved in building consensus around an FOMC endorsed forecast, given
the size of the FOMC and varying views among members.

Box 4. Lower for Longer: Estimates of the Neutral Rate1
Framework.To better assess current monetary policy stance, a semi-structural model is used to estimate
the neutral rate for the U.S.2 The model incorporates relationships between output gap and interest rates
gaps (IS equation), inflation and the output gap (Phillips curve); and an equation that links the neutral rate
to potential output growth plus other exogenous factors:
(IS equation)
(Phillips curve)
(Neutral rate)
Where is the output gap; r is the real (policy) interest rate, rn is the neutral rate, is core inflation; πm, πo
are import and oil price shocks, respectively, g is potential output growth, z is an exogenous autoregressive
process, and
are shocks. Bayesian estimation of the model incorporates prior information on the
output gap and potential output (based on a production function approach) and accounts for
unconventional monetary policies at the zero lower bound by using estimates of “shadow” policy rates.
The neutral rate turned negative during the
global financial crisis . Model estimates show that
the neutral real rate has fallen steadily over time and
was likely negative subsequent to the global financial
crisis. The fall in neutral rates is driven by a decline in
trend potential output growth, a rise in global
savings and an increase in the equity premium.

Rate Gaps (percent)
The neutral rate is projected to increase slowly.
Conditional on the staff’s medium-term forecast for
output, inflation and policy rates, model based
projections point to a very slow increase in the
neutral rate in the years ahead. At a five year horizon,
even though the output gap has closed the neutral
rate is likely to be well below the FOMC participants’
median forecast for the long-term real policy rate (of
about 1.75 percent). As a result, even if policy rates
begin gradually rising in the second half of 2015 (as
in staff’s forecast, see paragraph 18) monetary policy
would remain accommodative (i.e. with actual policy
rates below the neutral rate) until late 2016.

FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MONETARY POLICY
23.
Financial stability and monetary policy. Even if justified from a macroeconomic
perspective, there is a concern that maintaining policy rates at close to zero for too long will give rise
to increased financial risk-taking and a higher probability of future crisis. Is there a case, then, for
pursuing more aggressive increases in policy rates—relative to that which would be warranted by the
inflation-employment outlook alone—to “lean against the wind” and lessen future financial stability
concerns?
24.
The pros: theoretical support in several recent studies. The academic literature suggests
that if monetary policy reacts to emerging signs of financial excess, it could raise welfare—foregoing
some amount of employment gains but lessening the probability of financial instability events that
carry a high economic cost (see Box 5 and, for example, Woodford, 2012 and Ajello et al, 2015)1. This
suggests that monetary policy could be a sensible tool if other, more targeted, options are
unavailable. There is little theoretical support, however, for nonsystematic policies that wait for
financial vulnerabilities to rise and then use interest rates to try and “prick the bubble”.
25.
The cons: implementation challenges and an imperfect understanding of policy
transmission. In the U.S. case, risks are shifting from the banks to the nonbanks posing challenges in
both identifying and tackling systemic risks. At the same time, there has been little experience in
using monetary policy to address financial stability concerns. This poses challenges for the use of
both interest rate and macroprudential policy in tackling potential financial instability (see Stein,
2014)2. Policymakers may find it difficult to systematically identify and measure rising financial
excesses, in a timely manner, in order to react to them. Also, the transmission mechanism from
changes in policy rates to underlying financial risks may not be well understood. Preliminary results,
for example, suggest that rate hikes succeed in lowering the growth in credit to households but shift
the composition of the originators of that credit toward nonbanks (Box 6).
26.
Staff’s view. At this stage, policy rates should not be used in an effort to either reduce
leverage or dampen financial stability risks. Instead, efforts should be targeted toward strengthening
the macroprudential framework, developing regulatory tools, and addressing gaps in regulation and
supervision. There is clearly, though, an active debate on the role of monetary policy in addressing
financial stability risks in both academic and policy circles. The authorities should give priority to
understanding how this would apply in the context of the complex U.S. financial system, accelerating
research on the theoretical and empirical nexus between interest rate changes and financial
vulnerabilities and working to identify appropriate measures of the financial cycle.

Box 5. Systemic Risk and Monetary Policy1
Analytical framework. A non-linear DSGE model (that has reasonable macro and asset pricing properties,
an explicit intermediation system, and endogenous variation in systemic risk) allows for a joint analysis of
monetary policy and financial stability risks.2
Results. The main findings provide insights about the optimal conduct of monetary policy in the context
of time-varying and endogenously determined risk premia and systemic risk:


Financial variables (i.e. financial leverage or risk premia) contain information about the state of the
economy that is potentially useful for conducting monetary policy.



Nonsystematic monetary policy that reacts to financial risks is likely to raise, not lower, risks. An
unanticipated policy tightening, especially when the financial system is already fragile or leverage
is high, increases the probability of crisis.
Welfare Gains (percent)



Relatively simple, systematic policy rules
that aim to stabilize inflation, the output
gap, and measures of systemic risk (e.g.
cyclical leverage or mispricing of risk) can
yield welfare improvements relative to
those policy rules that focus only on
stabilizing inflation and the output gap.
Incorporating such financial stability
concerns would imply incrementally
moving the policy rate higher by relatively
small amounts to lessen the build-up of
vulnerabilities.

Note: Welfare is measured in terms of consumption relative baseline with no



However, such simple rules can be counterproductive when the economy is hit by a large negative
real shock that induces a fall in asset prices and increases the probability of crisis. This argues for
more complex policy responses, particularly in the face of large and negative real shocks.



The welfare improvement result requires that:





The central bank can measure systemic risks with some accuracy (e.g. the mispricing of risk).



Leverage is pro-cyclical. Empirical evidence suggests that this is the case for some sectors,
(e.g. for broker-dealers and, to some extent, large commercial banks) but not necessarily for
all sectors at all times.

The potential welfare gains from monetary policy leaning against systemic risks are smaller than
an effective and targeted countercyclical macro-prudential policy, in part because the optimal
degree of tightening through interest rate policy is limited by traditional employment-inflation
tradeoffs.3

The model builds on Dewachter and Wouters (2014), which embeds endogenous financial risk (He and Krishnamurty, 2014)
into a DSGE model used for monetary policy analysis. A prominent extension here is that the model allows financial sector
leverage to be procyclical, in line with empirical evidence (see Adrian and Shin, 2014).

Macroprudential policy is modeled as a countercyclical tax on leverage, similar to a countercyclical capital requirement.

Credit to banks (either from other banks or from nonbanks) is the least synchronized with the



A VAR analysis shows that the growth in credit to households is lowered as policy rates rise.
However, the compositional effects are important with the contraction in bank lending being
partially offset by an expansion in nonbank credit to households.



The different reaction of banks and nonbanks to a rates shock is symptomatic of the interconnected
nature of the U.S. financial system. Faced with a tighter liquidity environment, banks may rely on
securitizations and other financial innovations to turn illiquid assets into liquid funds which could, in
turn, lead to a migration of credit to nonbanks.



The procyclicality of nonbank credit stresses the need to strengthen the resilience of both bank and
nonbank system in upswings. Measures to boost nonbank resilience go beyond enhanced capital
and liquidity standards and could include margin or haircut requirements as well as others tools.

Authorities’ view. Intensive efforts are being made at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere to
examine the impact of using interest rate policy to reduce the risk of future bouts of financial
instability. However, the state of understanding of how such a policy might affect the economy and
the nature of the underlying trade-offs involved is still at a nascent stage. As such, “the jury is still
out” on whether such a policy would be advisable in the U.S. context. Also, the current level of
financial risks was seen as moderate and there are other tools available to manage emerging risks
(such as countercyclical capital buffers or margin requirements).

INVESTING IN RESILIENCE
28.
Important progress. Following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, a panoply of measures
were put in place to lessen the potential for financial sector vulnerabilities. These include enhanced
capital and liquidity buffers, strengthened underwriting standards in the housing sector, and greater
transparency to mitigate counterparty risks (see the 2015 Financial System Stability Assessment).
There is growing evidence these efforts have had tangible, positive macroeconomic effects in
lessening financing constraints and boosting investment (see Box 7).

Strengthening regulatory coordination and preparedness. Nevertheless, the agenda
remains unfinished. To keep pace with a continuously changing financial risks profile, continued
evolution of the oversight framework is needed, with the deployment of additional regulatory and
supervisory tools that include, but are not necessarily limited to, macroprudential policies. It will be
important to do this in a way that ensures that regulatory and supervisory safeguards remain
adaptable and flexible in tackling new risks as they emerge. There are five prominent, near-term
priorities:


24

The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). Given the complexity of the U.S.
regulatory system—including the number of agencies involved—the effectiveness of the
FSOC in proactively identifying and addressing risks in a timely and assertive manner is
critical.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES



To underscore this goal, all the individual FSOC member agencies should have an explicit
financial stability mandate. Each material threat identified in the FSOC Annual Reports
should be accompanied by a list of specific follow-up actions with regular reporting of
progress in tackling those risks.



For newly designated entities, oversight by the Federal Reserve should be put in place on
an expedited timetable and delays in the implementation of enhanced regulatory
measures to safeguard against risks should be minimized.



While coordination between agencies has clearly improved, there is a need for greater
clarity on the roles and responsibilities for system-wide crisis preparedness and
management, under the FSOC umbrella.



Data blind spots. Despite progress made by the work of the Office of Financial Research
(OFR), the Fed, and other FSOC member agencies, the comprehensive information needed to
fully assess and understand financial stability risks—particularly the channels for
interconnections between different parts of the system—is not available. Data is
compartmentalized with some agencies seeing part of the puzzle but none having a full
picture. Evidently, such data collection and analysis will always be a work-in-progress.
However, greater efforts are needed to overcome the legal, technological and other
obstacles to providing the FSOC and the OFR with the data it needs to have a comprehensive
view and analysis of systemic risks. Continued and more expansive cross-agency
collaboration on projects to better understand specific vulnerabilities will also prove valuable.



Insurance. While capital positions have improved, the search for yield has prompted insurers
to take on greater risks by investing in private equity, hedge funds, riskier corporate bonds,
and real-estate-related assets (Box 8). The absence of national standards or consolidated
supervision makes any assessment of risks in the insurance industry necessarily tentative and
incomplete. However, there is significant scope to improve the institutional framework.
Specifically, there is a need for:


A coordinated, nationally consistent approach to regulation (particularly for valuation and
solvency requirements), supervision and stress testing. This would bring about a
convergence in standards and supervisory practices and eliminate regulatory arbitrage
as, for instance, through captive insurers.



Assigning regulatory responsibilities to an independent agency that is adequately
resourced, with a nation-wide mandate, operational independence, appropriate powers,
and accountability. In their current configuration, neither the Federal Insurance Office nor
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is equipped to take on this role
(although their expertise would be indispensable for the new nation-wide body).

internally generated earnings) invest more in those countries where the average equityto-assets ratio of the banking system is highest.



The magnitude of this effect is relatively large. For example, the increase in bank capital in
the U.S. from 2007 to 2013 would, all else constant, add 0.6 percent of GDP to the overall
level of U.S. corporate investment. Conversely, if U.S. banks today maintained the average
level of equity-assets that is currently prevailing in European banks, the U.S. would have
0.7 percent of GDP less investment (purely from the effect that lower capital has on the
availability of credit to those firms reliant on financial system funding).



The investment effect is more pronounced when the sample is restricted to the top onethird of firms in terms of the underlying quality of their fundamentals (as measured by
their one year ahead probability of default). This indicates that insufficient bank capital is
a binding constraint on firms with productive investment opportunities.

The empirical findings are robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables that might affect
the banks’ willingness to extend credit (such as the system’s average ratio of nonperforming
loans or the share of intermediation undertaken by banks rather than capital markets), to
changing the sample of countries, and to restricting the sample to a subset of sectors.

Asset management. The increasing role of nonbanks has brought important benefits,
including a greater diversity of funding sources. However, it has also resulted in greater
uncertainty about financial risks and a shift in the locus of systemic concerns toward the
nonbanks. The U.S. system of regulatory oversight has not kept pace with these changes. The
increase in assets held by high-yield debt funds and the liquidity transformation undertaken
by some asset managers creates a potential channel to amplify shocks through asset
liquidation and funding channels.


Such vulnerabilities call for explicit requirements on risk management and internal
control in the sector (particularly linked to liquidity and derivative use) as well as more
frequent and intensive examination of asset managers.



There should be a structured effort to stress test the asset management industry for a
range of downside shocks (including illiquidity and counterparty risks). The results should
be published so as to help build a better data landscape of the industry and to facilitate a
more complete understanding of embedded risks. Over time, such an effort could be
combined with a strengthened Dodd-Frank Act stress testing process that explores
interconnections and bank-nonbank feedback chains.

Money markets. Changes to the triparty repo infrastructure (including reengineering of the
settlement cycle, improvements in the collateral allocation processes, and limits on intra-day
credit) have reduced risks. Despite reforms, vulnerabilities in the triparty repo market remain
large (including the reliance on two clearing banks).


Potential next steps could include the use of central counterparty clearing houses for
repo transactions. This, in turn, would require implementing adequate risk management
requirements for central counterparty clearing houses including cyber resilience,
standardized stress testing, and recovery and resolution regimes.



The requirement that some money market funds move to a floating net asset value by
2016 is a positive step. However, a significant share of funds will be able to maintain
stable net asset values, allowing institutional and retail investors to treat their investment
as deposit-like, despite their greater liquidity risks. Shifting all money market funds to
floating net asset values should be reconsidered.

Improving the understanding of interlinkages. From an aggregate perspective, estimated
financial interconnections among the largest U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) have fallen over
the last two years (to below 2 percent of capital for most institutions). Interbank credit risk between

The large BHCs would be robust to a range
of credit and funding shocks to a single

systemic spillovers from the failure of a
single institution).

However, multiple failures could give rise to

The regular Fed stress tests could be expanded to incorporate a deeper analysis and assessment of
propagation effects via inter-institutional links. In doing this, though, the current lack of information
about the size and nature of interlinkages between banks and nonbanks will be a significant
constraint.

31.
Simplifying the institutional structure. Over time, the regulatory system should be made
simpler, with fewer agencies, so as to lessen gaps and overlaps and reduce the potential for
regulatory arbitrage. This would also make the FSOC’s coordination role easier.

3

To assess potential spillovers among the six largest U.S. G-SIBs, FRB staff implemented an updated version of the
network stress-test methodology developed in Espinosa and Solé (2011) and the results are intended to be illustrative
and should be treated with some caution. See the 2015 FSAP Stress-Testing Technical Note for further details of how
the exercise was conducted as well as key assumptions and caveats.

32.
Banks. Regulatory changes and the evolving global environment are leading banks to rethink
their business models. As a result, there is a premium on continued intensive bank supervision to
avoid banks trying to restore profitability through looser credit standards and riskier investment
strategies. With banks remaining critical for overall systemic stability, steps should be taken to
address gaps in the capital regime relative to Basel III, to strengthen supervisory guidance and limit
concentration risk and transactions with related parties, and to upgrade the regimes for both interest
rate risk in the banking book and for operational risk. Greater quantitative guidance from the
regulators would be helpful (e.g. on the capital to be set aside for interest rate risk).
33.
Cross-jurisdiction resolution. The five largest banks in the U.S. account for 45 percent of
banking system assets, twice the share of 10 years ago. As such, effective resolution and recovery
plans for large banks are important to underpin a stable financial system. Existing plans should
continue to be thoroughly assessed against severe contingencies that have a salient cross-border
component. While cooperation agreements with relevant overseas authorities have recently been
signed to manage the resolution of institutions that have a significant international presence,
attention will need to be devoted to their implementation. The respective agencies are responsible
and the FSOC should monitor progress. Moreover, legislative changes would likely be needed to
avoid undue ring-fencing and the subordination of foreign claimants.
34.
Authorities’ views. The Dodd-Frank Act provided much-needed changes that have
buttressed financial regulation and oversight; implementation of the Act is ongoing. Steps to
strengthen the financial stability framework will continue but it was seen as equally important to
resist backtracking and the persistent efforts to dilute the progress already made, particularly as
memories of the crisis begin to fade. Current risks to financial stability remained moderate, and the
regulators were ever attentive to the evolving nature of vulnerabilities. The FSOC was viewed as
performing well as a coordinating committee and had served as a forum for regulatory coordination
on a range of issues including the Volcker rule, capital standards, and other reforms. Enhanced data
gathering and sharing was ongoing and important joint initiatives were underway, with different
regulators partnering up to study emerging issues. Market liquidity issues remained an area of focus
and various authorities were working to examine the expansion of electronic trading, the role of
changes in regulatory policies, and the rapid growth of certain markets (e.g. for corporate bonds).
Stress testing has proven to be a useful tool to assess the resilience of the system and efforts were
ongoing to improve that process through better scenario design and network analysis. Continued
monitoring was warranted in the insurance sector, however there was also a need to be cognizant of
the broader insurance business models being pursued in the U.S. Before moving ahead with further
regulation of money market funds, it was felt that time was needed also to assess the effects of
recent improvements in regulation. It was emphasized that frameworks for cross-border monitoring
of risks and resolution of failing institutions were under active development, in coordination with
partner regulators in other countries and the Financial Stability Board.

Box 8. Systemic Vulnerabilities in the Life Insurance Sector
The life insurance sector intermediates assets worth one-third of GDP and is highly leveraged.
Although the sectors is much better capitalized than in previous decades, its sheer size and leverage
make it an important contributor to systemic risk.
Vulnerabilities are high at the company level
Investment yields have been declining over recent
years as higher-coupon bonds matured and were
replaced by lower-yielding new issues. From 2006
to 2013, the industry-wide spread between the net
portfolio yield and the guaranteed credited rate on
policies dropped by 57 basis points. Insurers
responded to the decline in margins by extending
portfolio durations (the median duration reached
7.7 percent in 2013, compared to 7.2 percent in
2009) and increasing allocations to lower rated
assets. While credit and redemption risks in the
industry are small, prolonged low interest rates

Systemic risks over the medium term
1

Staff stress tests show substantial long-term stability risks in the U.S. life insurance sector . The
prolongation of the low rates environment until 2018 would lead 11 out of 18 life insurance groups to
report negative shareholder equity (assuming a full mark-to-market accounting regime.) Similarly, a
sharp spike in interest rates would pose a material risk to the market value of their bond portfolio
(given the longer durations insurers are holding). Rising interest rates could also lead to an increase in
policy surrenders as policyholders switch into higher-yielding assets (within and outside the insurance
sector). This would leave the sector vulnerable to liquidity drain and losses on those products that are
exempt from surrender penalties.
Shortcomings in the supervisory regime
Insurance supervision has been strengthened in recent years but reforms remain a work in progress.
Notably, insurance has been brought within the scope of system-wide oversight of the financial sector
by the FSOC, and there have been other supervisory enhancements with the establishment of the
Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and expanded oversight responsibilities of the Fed. However, the Fed’s
supervisory expertise of insurance groups still needs to be built and staffing of the relevant regulation
and supervision units with appropriate skills and expertise requires ongoing effort. At the state level,
the transition from a rules-based approach to more principles-based regulation and risk-focused
supervision continues to face implementation challenges.

UNADDRESSED FISCAL CHALLENGES
35.
The FY2016 Budget. Both the President and the Congress have put forward budget
proposals for FY2016:


The President’s budget is forecast by the Office of Management and Budget to deliver a
stable federal government deficit of around 2½ percent of GDP through the 10 year budget
window and stabilize the federal debt at about 73 percent of GDP by 2025. To achieve this,
the proposal outlines savings in healthcare spending, increased revenues from lower
personal income tax deductions for higher income individuals, changes to the business tax
code, an end to sequestration, funds to augment education and infrastructure programs, and
immigration reform.



The congressional budget blueprint aims to balance the budget in 10 years without revenue
increases and through significant—but largely unspecified—cuts to discretionary,
nondefense spending.

Lawmakers are now working to pass appropriations bills, consistent with the congressional budget
blueprint, to fund the government in FY2016. There is a wide gap between the two proposals and the
President has indicated he would veto spending bills that either lock in sequestration or further
curtail discretionary, non-defense programs.

to rise to about 78 percent of GDP by 2025. In staff’s view, aiming for a medium-term general
government primary surplus of about ¾ percent of GDP (a federal government primary surplus of
about 1 percent of GDP) would be appropriate to put the public debt ratio firmly on a downward
path. Addressing these medium-term imbalances will require actions on multiple fronts:


Tax reform. A reform of the U.S. tax code is long overdue. Complexity and loopholes have
increased over the years, undermining revenues and damaging productivity. Changes should
focus on simplifying the system and broadening the tax base by capping or eliminating
personal income tax deductions; removing tax preferences, exclusions and deductions from
the business tax; and changing the tax treatment for multinationals to limit base erosion and
profit shifting. In addition to improving the structure of the system, there is a need to raise

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

UNITED STATES

revenues, which could be achieved through a broad-based carbon tax (Box 9), a higher
federal gas tax, and the introduction of a federal-level VAT.


Pension reform. The prospective depletion of the social security trust fund needs to be
countered through a gradual increase in the retirement age, greater progressivity of benefits,
raising the maximum taxable earnings for social security contributions, and indexing benefits
and contributions provisions to chained CPI.



Health care. Cost pressures have declined but more efforts are needed. Legislation could
usefully focus on ensuring a better coordination of services to patients with chronic
conditions, steps to contain overuse of expensive procedures and technologies, higher
degree of cost sharing with beneficiaries, and eliminating tax breaks for more generous
employer-sponsored health plans.

37.
Near-term fiscal priorities. Tackling the longer-term fiscal challenges would provide scope
to modestly expand the near-term budget envelope (by around ¼ percent of GDP, in line with past
policy advice) to finance supply-side measures that support growth, job creation, and productivity.
This would include front-loading infrastructure spending, raising labor force participation (e.g.,
through policies such as subsidized childcare assistance), incentivizing private innovation,
strengthening education spending (including through apprenticeships and vocational training), and
improving job search assistance programs. Creating a stable funding solution for the Highway Trust
Fund, that will prevent the need for continued stop-gap patches, and reducing policy uncertainty
associated with the budget process are immediate priorities.
38.
Authorities’ view. The President’s FY2016 budget carefully balances the medium-term need
for consolidation with the near-term priorities to bolster growth and job creation. The proposal
achieves $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years and stabilizes the debt-GDP ratio.
Policies underlying that adjustment include repairing the broken U.S. tax code, ending the broad
brush austerity implied by sequestration, slowing healthcare cost growth, cutting inefficient
spending, instituting comprehensive immigration reform, and prioritizing critical investments in
research, education, and training. Expanding investments in infrastructure—including $478 billion
over the next six years for surface transportation—is also a long-held goal of the Administration. In
that, the near-term emphasis should be on a multi-year extension of the Highway Trust Fund which
would create an environment of predictability that would improve the ability to plan public projects.
A serious discussion on business tax reform was needed in the U.S. and could garner bipartisan
support. It was also clear that it was not in anyone’s interest to repeat the high-wire tension
associated with past shutdowns and debt limit discussions. There was hope that a workable
compromise could be found, similar to that legislated in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. If not,
though, the President has been clear that he would not sign appropriation bills that the
Administration views as inadequate in addressing the pressure that sequestration places on
nondefense discretionary spending.

Box 9. Meeting Climate Pledges and Fiscal Objectives with a Carbon Tax1
The case for a carbon tax. The U.S. has pledged to reduce greenhouse gases by 26–28 percent below
2005 levels in 2025. Carbon pricing is the most efficient way to achieve this commitment. The
introduction of a carbon tax in the U.S. would increase the price of fuels and electricity and help
incentivize mitigation efforts and clean technology investments. The recent decline of energy prices
creates a window of opportunity to introduce carbon pricing.
A lesson from the North. In 2008, British Columbia phased in a carbon tax (rising to CAN $30 per ton
in 2012) on fossil fuels in transportation, home heating, and electricity to finance reductions in income

The administration of carbon taxes in the U.S. should
be straightforward. A carbon tax would involve building a carbon charge into existing gasoline and
diesel excises and extending similar charges to the supply of other petroleum products, natural gas,
and coal. In the U.S., this could involve administering taxes on about 150 petroleum refineries, 500
large natural gas operators, and about 1,500 coal mines.

Calibrating the level. A tax of around US$45 per ton of CO2 would reflect costs of global climate
change, although a higher tax might be needed to meet the 2025 pledge. Leaving global effects aside,
a substantial carbon tax would result in domestic environmental benefits from less fossil fuel use (e.g.
2
better health outcomes from reduced local air pollution). Phased in gradually, this tax would raise
revenue of around US$170 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) once fully implemented.
Potential effects. A US$45 per ton of CO2 charge would increase gasoline prices by about 40 cents a
gallon, electricity prices by 2.2 cents per kWh, and coal prices by US$90 per short ton. Carbon charges
are regressive, and the introduction of a carbon tax may need to be accompanied with compensation
mechanisms for low-income households (e.g. through the EITC or existing system of social benefits)
which would likely use around 10 percent of revenues. Competitiveness concerns would be best
addressed through international coordination over carbon pricing and, in this, the U.S. could provide a
leadership role.

POVERTY, PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH
39.
The U.S. economy faces substantial and fundamental challenges from demographic changes
and an unfinished policy agenda in areas affecting long-term growth. In tackling these, the advice
from past Article IV consultations bears repeating:


Confronting poverty (see link). Combine an expansion of the earned income tax credit (to
workers without dependents, low-income youth, and older workers not yet eligible for social
security) with an increase in the federal minimum wage. Make permanent the tax provisions
that are due to expire in 2017, including the extension of the earned income tax credit to
larger families, the mitigation of the marriage penalty, and increase in the child tax credit.



Raising productivity (see link). Invest in infrastructure, particularly in surface transportation.
Expand sources for infrastructure financing. Reinstate and make permanent the Research and
Experimentation tax credit. Support states in improving training programs and build
partnerships with industry and higher education institutions for vocational training. Raise
educational outcomes through better spending on early childhood education and support
for science, technology, engineering and math programs.



Increasing labor force participation (see link). Improve family benefits, including childcare
assistance for working families, and modify the federal disability insurance to provide
incentives for beneficiaries to work part-time.



Immigration reform. Institute a comprehensive, skills-based immigration reform. Such a
program would have a significant positive impact on growth and fiscal finances by increasing
the labor supply (and thus future economic growth rates), strengthening productivity, and
reducing the dependency ratio.



Trade policy (see link). Promote bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements, such as the Trans
Pacific Partnership, alongside renewed efforts to advance the multilateral trade agenda.



Housing finance reform. Lessen the government’s footprint and foster a greater role for the
private sector in housing finance by expanding the use of market transactions to transfer
first-loss risks to private investors; establishing a single securitization platform; making GSE
guarantee fees more risk-based; subjecting GSEs to similar regulatory requirements as other
systemically important financial institutions; and lowering the ceilings for the size of
mortgages that can be securitized by the GSEs (see Selected Issues Paper).

40.
Authorities’ view. Tackling poverty will require action on several fronts starting with an
increase in the minimum wage, a second earner tax credit, and an expansion of the earned income
tax credit. Both poverty and productivity can be positively affected by the Administration’s proposed
investments in education including providing tuition-free community college, an expansion of tax
incentives for higher education, supporting universal preschool and developing high quality
preschool programs in targeted communities. Providing incentives for private investment, rebuilding

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

public infrastructure, and building consensus around common-sense immigration reform will provide
important boosts to longer-term growth. The authorities were working to find ways to move housing
finance reform ahead without legislation so as to reduce the government’s footprint, minimize the
risks to taxpayers, and encourage private capital. There was also optimism that progress could be
made on trade agreements—notably on the Trans Pacific Partnerships—and could be an important
area for bipartisan support, building on the common ground in the recently passed Senate Trade
Promotion Authority bill.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The near-term outlook. Data in the first few months of 2015 have been a setback, mainly
due to temporary factors. Absent further negative shocks, the U.S. economy should be able to move
ahead at an underlying run-rate of above 3 percent in the coming quarters. There remain limited
signs of wage and price inflation and sizable output and employment gaps still remain.
42.
Monetary policy. The FOMC should remain data dependent and defer its first increase in
policy rates until there are more tangible signs of wage or price inflation than are currently evident.
Under the staff’s baseline, the pace of policy rate increases is expected to be gradual. At this stage,
policy rates should not be used in an effort to either reduce leverage or dampen financial stability
risks.
43.
The current fiscal policy dysfunction. The inability of the Congress and the Executive
Branch to collectively pass a budget and corresponding appropriations bills creates fiscal uncertainty
that is damaging to the U.S. economy. The disruption from either a prospective government
shutdown or a stand-off linked to the federal debt ceiling represent important (and avoidable)
downside risks to growth and job creation which could move to the forefront, once again, later in
2015.
44.
A need for agreement on a medium-term fiscal strategy. Public finances in the U.S.
remain on an unsustainable path. A credible plan is needed to address these imbalances and should
include revenue enhancing reforms to the tax system, a pension reform that intertemporally aligns
contributions and benefits, and steps to lessen the growth in public healthcare costs. Such a plan
would provide near-term fiscal space to finance supply-side measures that support growth, job
creation and productivity.
45.
Strengthening financial stability on a number of fronts. Much has been done over the
past several years to strengthen the U.S. financial system and it will be important to ensure that this
progress—including the legislative advances in the Dodd Frank Act—is not rolled back. The FSAP has
identified an extensive list of reforms to raise the U.S. system’s resilience and these should be
pursued without delay.
46.
The exchange rate. So far, the global adjustment of exchange rates—and the strengthening
of the U.S. dollar—has represented a warranted shift of demand to those parts of the world economy
that were being most threatened by deflation and stagnation. Nonetheless, the stronger dollar is

impacting U.S. growth and job creation, as well as weighing on inflation. There is a risk that a further
marked appreciation of the dollar—particularly one that takes place in an environment where
policies to address growth deficiencies languish both in the U.S. and abroad—would be harmful.

Supply side reforms. A range of challenges linked to poverty, productivity and growth
remain unaddressed and will require policy efforts simultaneously on a number of fronts.

Russia/Ukraine: the mounting conflict depresses
business confidence and heightens risk aversion, amid
disturbances in global financial, trade and commodity
markets. Heightened risk of fragmentation/state
failure/security dislocation in the Middle East and
some countries in Africa, leading to a sharp rise in oil
prices, with negative global spillovers.

A US$10 further decrease in oil prices could
increase growth by 0.1-0.2 percentage points
in the first and second year.
Medium
A permanent 50 bps increase in 10-year
interest rates could subtract about ½ percent
of GDP after two years. Sustained spikes in
term and risk premia would imply greater
output losses.
High
If unaddressed, imbalances could lead to
financial instability with significant economic
costs and spillovers to the rest of the world.
Medium
Slower growth in advanced and emerging
economies would weigh on growth.
Low

A rise in oil prices would have a negative
impact on the U.S. with a flight to safety
resulting in dollar appreciation.

Low

High

The federal borrowing limit is not raised owing to
political gridlock. Policymakers do not take sufficient
measures to put debt on a sustainable trajectory. The
lack of fiscal sustainability triggers a sharp rise in the
sovereign risk premium.

Failure to raise the debt limit would be very
costly and depend on how long the impasse
lasts. There would be severe global spillovers.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
The budget deficit in the United States has been reduced significantly over the past few years. Yet, the
public debt ratio remains on an unsustainable trajectory over the medium term. Under the baseline
scenario, public debt is projected to first stabilize, but then to start rising as aging-related spending
pressures on entitlement programs assert themselves and interest rates normalize. Gross financing
needs are large but manageable given the global reserve currency status of the United States. A
medium-term, credible consolidation plan remains a key policy priority.
Background. Significant fiscal consolidation measures were legislated in 2011–13 to tackle the high
public debt ratio, which has doubled at the federal government level since 2007 as a result of the
financial crisis and the ensuing recession. The Bipartisan Budget Act of December 2013 partially
reversed the cuts scheduled to take place in FY2014 and FY2015, replacing them with savings
generated through cuts to mandatory spending in later years and, thus, improving the pace and
distribution of near-term deficit reduction.
Baseline. Staff baseline includes savings from the reduction in overseas contingency operations, and
assumes that current tax policies are mostly extended (with the notable exception of bonus
depreciation) and automatic spending cuts are partially reversed and replaced with back-loaded
measures (similar to the deal reached in the Bipartisan Budget Act). With these assumptions, the
public debt ratio temporarily stabilizes in 2015–19. However, the debt ratio starts rising again owing
to the health care and social security related spending pressures from an aging population. Federal
debt held by the public is projected to increase from 74 percent of GDP now to close to 80 percent
of GDP in FY2025, with general government gross debt exceeding 110 percent of GDP by CY2024.
Overall, despite the substantial deficit reduction achieved so far and the legislated savings in the
pipeline, U.S. public finances remain on an unsustainable trajectory.
Adjustment scenario. The 2014 general government primary balance was -2.8 percent of GDP. In
staff’s view, aiming for a medium-term general government primary surplus of about ¾ percent of
GDP (a federal government surplus of about 1 percent of GDP) would be appropriate to put the
public debt ratio firmly on a downward path. Lower interest expenses than previously projected
reduce the estimated adjustments needs. Nevertheless, the target primary surplus would have to be
higher in the long run to bring the debt ratio closer to the pre-crisis levels by 2030.
Debt servicing costs. The fiscal projections benefit from the current favorable interest rate-growth
differential. Reflecting accommodative monetary policy and the safe haven status of the United
States, real interest rates have fallen well below GDP growth. Under the staff’s baseline, the effective
interest rate is projected to rise gradually from the current historical lows and reach about
4¾ percent by 2024 (compared to an average of about 4 percent in the previous 10 year period). As
a result, real interest rates will become a major debt-creating flow over the medium-term.
Realism. Baseline economic assumptions and fiscal projections are generally within the error band
observed for all countries. While ambitious, the projected fiscal adjustment is realistic based on the
consolidation episodes observed in 1990–2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

Stress tests. The public debt dynamics are highly sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions,
primarily reflecting the fact that the U.S. public debt ratio already exceeds 100 percent of GDP. An
increase of 200 basis points in the sovereign risk premium would mean a debt ratio that is about
15 percentage points above the baseline. If real GDP growth turns out to be one standard deviation
below the baseline, the public debt would increase by about 8 percentage points above the baseline.
A scenario involving a 1 percentage point slippage in the planned consolidation over the next two
years would lead to a debt-to-GDP ratio of 113 percent in 2024. A combined macro-fiscal shock
could raise the public debt ratio as high as 132 percent of GDP by the end of the 10-year horizon. An
exchange rate shock is unlikely to have important implications for debt sustainability in the United
States given that all debt is denominated in local currency and the reserve currency status of the
dollar.
Mitigating factors. The depth and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market as well as its safe haven
status at times of distress represent a mitigating factor for relatively high external financing
requirements.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) declined from -18.7 per cent of GDP in 2010 to -34.5
percent of GDP in 2014, reflecting sustained current account deficits, stronger performance of the U.S. stock market
relative to trading partners, and valuation changes of foreign currency denominated assets. /1 Under staff’s baseline
scenario, U.S. NIIP would deteriorate by about 10 percentage points of GDP over the next five years predominantly due to
projected current account deficits.
Assessment. A decline in foreign demand for U.S. debt securities (for example, by a protracted failure to restore long-run
fiscal sustainability) would raise financial stability risks, but at the same time weaken the exchange rate and strengthen
the trade balance. Given the dollar’s reserve currency status, such financial stability concerns are limited. Most U.S. foreign
assets are denominated in foreign currency and over 50 percent are in the form of FDI and portfolio equity claims, whose
value tend to decline when global growth and stock markets are weak, as well as when the U.S. dollar appreciates.

Overall Assessment:

Current
account

Background. The U.S. current account (CA) deficit has narrowed from its pre-crisis height of 6 percent of GDP to 2.4
percent of GDP in 2014, reflecting a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit, higher private saving, lower investment in the
aftermath of the financial crisis, and a stronger energy trade balance (due to the rapid increase of unconventional energy
production). /2 The CA deficit is expected to decline moderately but steadily from 2015 through the medium-term as the
effects of a stronger U.S. economy and a more appreciated U.S. dollar are only partly offset by lower oil prices.
Assessment. The EBA model estimates a cyclically-adjusted CA gap of -1.2 percent of GDP for 2014. The calculation,
however, does not fully account for the increase of unconventional energy production and the effects of the 2014 price
decline on domestic energy production and the oil balance. The staff view is, on balance, that the 2014 cyclically-adjusted
CA is between 0 and 1 ¼ percent weaker than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. /3
Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated in 2014 by about 2 percent compared to 2013.
Notwithstanding this moderate overall annual figure, the REER appreciated by more than 6 percent in the second half of
2014, due to solid U.S. economic performance and divergence of U.S. growth and monetary policy prospects from key
trading partners. As of May 2015, the REER was about 9 percent stronger than its average value over 2014.
Assessment. Indirect estimates of the REER (relying on the preferred current account assessment) suggest the exchange
was overvalued by about 5 percent in 2014. Direct REER analyses suggest an overvaluation of between 2 and 8 percent. /4
Considering all estimates and the uncertainties around them, staff assess the 2014 average REER as overvalued, within a
range of 0 to 10 percent, compared to the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
Background. Net financial outflows were about 0.8 percent of GDP in 2014. 5/ Portfolio inflows increased by about 40
percent, year over year, in 2014 but were offset by weaker direct investment and other inflows. On the outflow side, there
were further increases in U.S. portfolio investment overseas, but much less so than the previous year. The stronger
outlook for the U.S. economy compared to its key trading partners, the dollar reserve currency status and safe haven
motives continue to boost foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities.
Assessment. The U.S. has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are limited by the dollar’s status as a reserve
currency and the U.S. role as a safe haven.

The U.S. external position has improved
considerably in recent years, as have
assessed imbalances and fiscal policy gaps.
As of May, the REER was about 9 percent
above its average value of 2014. This was
due to solid U.S. economic performance
and divergence of U.S. growth and
monetary policy prospects from key
trading partners. The negative effects of
the REER on the external position in 2015
are partially offset by the positive effects
of lower oil prices.

FX intervention Assessment. The dollar has the status of a global reserve currency. Reserves held by the U.S. are typically low relative to

standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.
level

The U.S. external position was broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policies in 2014. As of May
2015, sizable recent REER appreciation has
weakened the U.S. external position. This is
partially offset by lower oil prices. The U.S.
REER is currently moderately above the
level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals.

Recommended policies:
Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation
should aim for a general government
primary surplus of about ¾ percent of
GDP (a federal government primary
surplus of about 1 percent of GDP).
Structural policies should be implemented
to raise productivity and labor force
growth, including taking steps to fully
exploit the benefits of the boom in
unconventional energy production. This
would be consistent with maintaining
external stability and achieving full
employment.

United States (continued)
Technical
Background
Notes

1/ The U.S. has a positive net equity position, with sizable portfolio equity and direct investment abroad, and a negative debt position vis-à-vis the rest of the world,
owing to sizeable foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds. Gross assets and liabilities are about 140 and 180 per cent of GDP, respectively.
2/ The oil portion of the CA had a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2014, 0.3 percentage points lower than in 2013, reflecting less net imports and lower oil prices.
3/ Developments in the oil sector are not fully captured in the EBA. In particular, the price elasticity of U.S. oil production has dramatically increased following the shale
revolution. While acknowledging that the use of price elasticity of oil is implicit in the EBA, it is important to note that the terms of trade adjustment used in the EBA CA
assessment is derived from longer historical relationships, which fail to fully capture the changing level and nature of U.S. oil production.
4/ The two direct EBA models are the REER Index model and the REER Level model.
5/ This is substantially below pre-crisis levels of about 5.0 percent of GDP.

Annex IV. Responses to Past Policy Advice
Fiscal policy. Over the last few years staff has emphasized the importance of fixing long standing
fiscal problems to slow entitlement spending and normalize the budget process. Cost saving
measures that were part of the Affordable Care Act appear to be lowering health care inflation. A
continuing resolution for the rest of FY2015 that was passed in December 2014, subsequent
extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, as well as bipartisan support for
passing a reform package that ends automatic Medicare payment cuts to doctors –the so-called
“Doc-Fix” were positive steps that lessened fiscal uncertainties. Staff also advocated adopting a
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to restore long-run fiscal sustainability, stressing that early
action is needed to slow entitlement spending. Anchored by such a plan, staff called for expanding
the near-term budget envelope through specific measures—including front-loaded infrastructure
spending, a better tax system, active labor market policies, and improving educational spending, with
these measures funded by offsetting savings in future years. The prospects for progress in these
areas remain unfavorable, given the lack of political consensus.
Monetary policy. Given continued economic slack and expectation of muted inflationary pressures,
staff supported maintaining policy rates at zero for longer (past mid-2015) than foreseen by markets
at the time of the last consultation. Staff also stressed the importance of a well communicated
normalization of U.S monetary policy conditions, in the context of robust U.S growth, and pointed to
scope for enhancements to the Fed’s communications toolkit. The Fed continues to maintain a
supportive monetary policy and has made significant efforts—in FOMC statements, press
conferences, and speeches—to strengthen its communication and prepare markets for
normalization.
Financial policies. Based on the 2010 FSAP and subsequent work, staff has recommended several
steps to tackle financial sector risks, particularly those related to activities in nonbank intermediaries.
Substantial progress has been made on the national and global financial reform agenda over the last
few years, and many of the policy suggestions have been implemented. These include enhanced
capital and liquidity buffers, strengthened underwriting standards in the housing sector, greater
transparency to mitigate counterparty risks, as well as progress in collecting more comprehensive
information to assess risks. Still, several reforms emphasized by staff, such as addressing remaining
vulnerabilities of the money market funds and the tri-party repo market, allowing for the orderly
resolution of too-important to-fail financial institutions, and reforms to increase the resilience of the
insurance sector remain to be completed.
Structural policies. Staff has recommended several structural measures to counter the slowdown in
potential growth and high poverty rates, including expand the EITC, increasing the minimum wage,
investing in infrastructure and education, improving the tax system, using active labor market
policies, implementing a broad, skills-based approach to immigration reform and capitalizing on the
gains from rising U.S. energy independence. The Administration has taken measures to increase
wages for some workers and several states and localities have increased minimum wages. Building
political consensus on a reform of the tax system in the direction envisaged by staff (a less complex

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

system with a broader tax base and lower rates) has made little progress. Support for immigration
reform is elusive and there is no plan to raise the gas tax or to introduce a VAT or a carbon tax.
Housing finance. Staff has stressed policy measures to encourage greater availability of mortgage
credit, while clarifying the future role of government in housing finance. Administrative measures
have been taken to lessen regulatory uncertainties and to transfer risks from the agencies to private
investors through market transactions. Legislative proposals to more fundamentally reshape housing
finance have made little headway in Congress.

Exchange Rate Arrangements. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar floats independently and is
determined freely in the foreign exchange market. The United States has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the IMF's Articles of Agreement and maintains an
exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those measures imposed for security
reasons. The United States notifies the maintenance of measures imposed for security reasons under
Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). The last of these notifications was made June 19, 2014
(EBD/14/35).

Article IV Consultation. The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 23, 2014 and the
Staff Report was published as IMF Country Report No. 14/221. A fiscal Report of Observance of
Standards and Codes was completed in the context of the 2003 consultation.
The 2015 Article IV discussions took place May 11–May 19, 2015. Concluding meetings with
Chair Yellen of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Treasury Secretary Lew
occurred on June 1 and June 3 respectively. The Managing Director, Ms. Lagarde, the Deputy
Managing Director, Mr. Zhu, and WHD Director, Mr. Werner, participated in the concluding
meetings. A press conference on the consultation was held on June 4, 2015. The team comprised
Nigel Chalk (head), Stephan Danninger, Ravi Balakrishnan, Ali Alichi, Juan Solé, Jarkko Turunen, and
Andrea Pescatori (all WHD); Per Stefan Laseen (SPR); and Deniz Igan (RES). Ian Parry (FAD), Aditya
Narain (FSAP head), Martin Cihak and Simon Gray (all MCM) participated in some of the meetings.
Mr. Sobel (Executive Director), Mr. Haarsager (Senior Advisor) and Ms. Douglass Kochman (Advisor)
attended some of the meetings. Outreach included discussions with Congressional staff, U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO, private sector representatives and think tanks. Unless an objection
from the authorities of the United States is received prior to the conclusion of the Board’s
consideration, the document will be published.
A Financial System Assessment Program involved two missions, during October–November 2014,
and February–March, 2015. The Financial System Stability Assessment is scheduled to be discussed
at the Board, together with the 2015 Article IV Consultation, on July 6, 2015.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 6, 2015

1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
An upward revision to first quarter GDP. Growth in the first quarter was revised
up to -0.2 percent, suggesting that the temporary factors that hampered growth in the winter
were a smaller drag than had been previously thought. Staff, however, has maintained its
annual growth projection for 2015 at 2.5 percent, with recent data pointing to a modestly
slower second quarter than had been assumed in the forecasts underpinning the staff report.
3.
A generally upbeat picture from other indicators. Recent data releases have shown
real personal consumption expenditures and consumer sentiment rebounded in May, personal
income growth remains solid, manufacturing surveys are improving, and housing data shows
a mild but steady recovery. Inflation continues to be subdued (core PCE inflation was
1.2 percent in May). Nonfarm payrolls in June added 223 thousand jobs—close to Consensus
expectations— with the unemployment rate falling to 5.3 percent, mainly reflecting a decline
in the participation rate. Average hourly earnings slowed to 2.0 percent year-over-year in
June—0.3 percentage points below Consensus expectations—from 2.3 percent in May.
4.
The Supreme Court ruled on the Affordable Care Act. In a 6-3 decision, the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld a key provision of the Affordable Care Act. The Court ruled that
health insurance subsidies should continue to be available for those states that have not set up
their own health insurance exchanges and are, instead, using the federal exchange.
5.
Trade Promotion Authority was approved by Congress and signed by President
Obama. The Congress approved Trade Promotion Authority on June 24, allowing for an upor-down vote (so-called “fast track”) on future trade deals. In addition, Trade Adjustment
Assistance was signed into law, renewing funding for assistance and job training to workers
displaced by the forces of globalization. This legislation opens the way for a congressional
vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, potentially as early as this Fall.
6.
The Export-Import Bank’s authority to extend new loans, guarantees or credit
insurance expired on June 30. The bank will, however, continue to operate and manage
transactions related to its existing portfolio.
7.
Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis. The fiscal situation in Puerto Rico continues to
deteriorate, raising concerns that the commonwealth may be unable to service its $72 billion
in public debt. On July 1 the Puerto Rico Electricity Power Authority reached an agreement
with its creditors that allowed it to meet a debt service payment that was due that day and
extended until September 15 a forbearance agreement between the utility and its creditors.

2
The bondholders and the utility continue to work on a long-term plan to put the finances of
the company on a sustainable footing. Puerto Rico’s Governor Padilla announced on June 30
that the commonwealth’s debts are “not payable” and has established a working group to
analyze, by August 30, the options for a “complete restructuring and development plan” for
Puerto Rico.
8.
The impact on the U.S. of recent events in Greece has, so far, been modest.
Following the Greek government’s call for a referendum, U.S. equity markets fell by around
2 percent, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate fell by 10 basis points, and the U.S. dollar
strengthened around 1 percent versus the Euro.
