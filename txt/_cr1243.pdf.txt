STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Near-term outlook. Economic activity is expected to moderate as the weaker external
environment tempers exports, private investment and consumption growth. This is
expected to lower inflation, but will make the 2012 budget deficit target difficult to
achieve. General elections, expected by analysts in early 2012, may add to market
volatility.
Managing the spillovers from downside external risks. Given its integration with the
rest of the world, the economy is vulnerable to a prolonged downturn in advanced
economies or a sharp escalation in global financial stress. Weaker exports and terms of
trade would spill over into domestic demand. Financial spillovers could include a
reversal of cross˗border bank and portfolio flows. Healthy financial and corporate
balance sheets, ample foreign exchange reserves, and room to further loosen monetary
policy would help contain the impact of an external shock on the financial sector and
the economy. The room for fiscal policy to respond is, however, more limited given
elevated federal government debt levels.
Ensuring sustained and more inclusive growth. Raising potential growth will require
sustained efforts to raise the skills of the workforce, facilitate greater competition in
product markets, and implement structural fiscal reforms. To make growth more
inclusive, this will need to be complemented with investments in social safety nets.
Given the limited fiscal room over the medium term, social spending will need to be
better targeted to the needy, although an unemployment insurance scheme and
expanded pension provision could be designed without a large fiscal cost.

The authorities concurred that

growth is likely to ease. They agreed that
weaker exports would feed through to
domestic demand, but underscored that if the
downdraft from external sources remains
contained, employment would remain well
supported and prevent a more substantial
downturn. While acknowledging that the
growth projections underlying the 2012
budget may now be somewhat optimistic, they
noted that the drag from external sources
would be mitigated by higher private
investment under Economic Transformation
Programme (ETP) projects, fiscal transfers
contained in the 2012 budget of 0.3 percent of
GDP, and rising intraregional trade. In addition,
the authorities noted that investment will be
boosted in 2012 by a special off˗budget

Financial channels
External financing. There were large reversals in portfolio equity flows and trade credits, while loans to the private sector
and private debt securities were much less affected. The banking system also experienced large net outflows in 2008:Q4.
Foreign holdings of BNM bills declined sharply, while outflows from government bills were more moderate.
Domestic financing. However, the decline in foreign holdings of government securities was offset by domestic residents.
Indeed, yields fell, in line with the decline in global interest rates. Despite large external bank outflows, domestic credit
slowed but remained positive. The banking system also remained financially sound, with NPL ratios steady.

The authorities response was multipronged. The main measures included:



Loosening monetary policy: the policy rate was cut by 150 basis points to 2 percent and reserve requirements were
reduced.
A combination of exchange rate depreciation and reserves drawdown: between August 2008 and March 2009 the
ringgit depreciated by 9.5 percent against the U.S. dollar while reserves fell by 28 percent.
Providing U.S. dollar liquidity to the markets by drawing down reserves.
Announcing that Bank Negara Malaysia would back interbank lending.
Extending a blanket guarantee on all ringgit and foreign currency deposits through December 2010.
Introducing new financing and guarantee facilities for SMEs.

Box 2. Asia: Exposure to European Banks
Like many emerging economies that are highly integrated, Malaysia’s exposure to
European banks is also high. According to BIS data as of end˗June 2011, foreign banks had
total consolidated claims on the Malaysian economy of about 60 percent of GDP on an ultimate
risk basis, with European banks accounting for around 40 percent of claims (Figure 4).
While such a high exposure suggests Asia faces a significant vulnerability to deleveraging
by European banks, there are some key factors which mitigate this risk for Malaysia:


Local deposits. Total European banks’ claims include credit extended by European banks
subsidiaries in Malaysia, which are funded largely by local deposits. In that sense, the
consolidated claims may somewhat overstate the vulnerability to deleveraging by European
banks.



Substitution. U.K. banks account for almost 80 percent of European banks claims. Given this,
local and other banks (e.g., from the United Kingdom, United States, and the region) may
have the capacity to offset euro area bank withdrawals, using it as an opportunity to gain
market share and increase margins, especially if financial stress remains confined to the euro
area. Local banks appear well placed given low reliance on wholesale funding (less than
11 percent of total funding) and external assets significantly above 100 percent of external
liabilities. There may be limits to their ability to substitute for euro area banks, however,
given the latter’s expertise in specialized areas such as project, mining, shipping and aircraft
finance.



Reserves. The large stock of foreign reserves (over 200 percent of total European banks’
claims) enhances Bank Negara’s ability to mitigate any serious foreign currency liquidity
shortages that may arise from European banks deleveraging.

34.

The economy’s medium˗term

growth outlook is conditioned on the pace
and implementation of broad˗based
reforms. Under the staff’s baseline scenario,
medium˗term growth is estimated at about
5 percent, with a gradual rebalancing of
demand from the tradable to the nontradables
sector. Raising potential growth above
5 percent would require sustained efforts to
boost the productivity of both human and
physical capital.9
35.

Investments under the ETP would

underlying fundamentals identified by the
government. More progress is needed in a
number of critical areas, including education
and training, governance, and creating equal
opportunities for all segments of the
population.
36.

Structural measures need to be

accompanied by fiscal reforms. Efforts
should concentrate on increasing fiscal space
to allow room for countercyclical fiscal policies,
putting federal government debt on a
declining trajectory, and removing distortions
in the tax and subsidy system. Broadening the
tax base through the proposed goods and
services tax would help reduce reliance on
procyclical oil˗related revenues. Resource
allocation would be improved by the
streamlining of subsidies and wasteful tax
incentives, and replacing them with targeted
assistance to the needy.
37.

To achieve the authorities’ projected

deficit path and generate sufficient fiscal
space, consolidation needs to be faster than
under the staff’s baseline. Committing to a
medium term anchor accompanied by
well˗articulated revenue and expenditure
measures, while allowing room for automatic
stabilizers to operate and some discretionary
spending to counter cyclical downturns, would
help cement credibility. The staff’s

and practice.12 The key question is whether its
role in supporting wages of low˗skilled workers
is offset by disemployment effects, and will
depend on the rate that is set.13 Moreover,
implementation will be challenging in an
economy with porous borders and where
workers can easily migrate from the formal to
informal sector. A minimum wage policy would
have to be carefully designed to address these
concerns.
41.

Appreciation of the real effective

exchange rate over the medium term will
be a key element of rebalancing the sources
of growth. The current account surplus has
declined quite significantly from its recent
peak of just under 18 percent of GDP in 2008.
However, the staff’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rates (CGER) estimates suggest that
the ringgit is still weaker than the level implied
by medium˗term fundamentals. Going forward,
the policy of two˗way flexibility with
intervention limited to smoothing excessive
volatility should allow for the appreciation of
the currency over the medium term, and would
facilitate the allocation of resources towards
the nontradables sector, particularly if
accompanied by ambitious structural reforms.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Authorities’ Views
42.

The authorities shared the view that

enhancing human capital, improving
governance, and ensuring broad˗based
access to opportunities are critical to the
success of the reform. They underscored their
commitment to decisive implementation of
wide ranging reforms. The authorities were
also somewhat more optimistic regarding the
role of the ETP program as a catalyst for
sustained, private sector investment.
43.

The authorities agreed with the

need for consolidation and streamlining
inefficient subsidies. They said that work is
ongoing on plans to streamline subsidies and
other public expenditures, and on a goods and
services tax. They also noted that adhering to
the deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by 2015
and budget balance by 2020 will reduce
federal government debt, but cyclical
considerations may warrant flexibility in
individual years.

The authorities argued that the real

The gross debt to GDP ratio for the

the medium term, falling to just over

16 percent of GDP by 2016. The

scenario, debt is expected to rise steadily

10 percentage point decline in the external

relative to GDP over the next five years,

debt to GDP ratio from 2011 to 2016 mostly

reaching about 61 percent of GDP by 2016.

reflects sustained current account surpluses

Bound tests indicate that the debt path is

and some shift towards domestic debt. Stress

highly vulnerable to growth and interest rate

tests indicate that external debt would remain

shocks. For instance, a decline in real GDP

manageable under a variety of shocks,

growth of about 1½ percentage point relative

including weaker GDP growth, a lower current

to the baseline would increase the debt to

account deficit, and a one time 30 percent

GDP ratio to above 70 percent in 2016. Further

depreciation of the ringgit. Under these

budget consolidation efforts are needed to put

scenarios, the external debt to GDP ratio rises

the debt to GDP ratio on a declining trajectory

above the baseline over the projection period

over the medium term through clearly

by only modest margins to about 24 percent

articulated revenue and expenditure measures,

of GDP in 2016. In the case of the exchange

including a phased reduction of subsidies,

rate depreciation scenario, the debt ratio

broadening of the tax base, and more targeted

would rise sharply to 36 percent of GDP

and efficient social spending.

in 2012, but would subsequently fall to
24 percent of GDP by 2016.

5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

ANNEX III: MALAYSIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 22, 2011)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts to improve statistics
for the consolidated public sector are necessary.
National accounts: Currently, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) compiles and publishes
annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure at current and constant prices, and
annual estimates for gross disposable income, saving, and net lending for the economy based on
the 1993 SNA. The quarterly data are released about two months after the reference quarter.
Price statistics: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. A revised CPI was
introduced in January 2011; it covers all 14 states and features a more disaggregated measure of the
consumption basket and updated expenditure weights based on a 2009/10 comprehensive household
income and expenditure survey.
Government finance statistics: There is a need to improve the timeliness, detail, and availability of data
on NFPEs and the state and local governments. Dissemination of more detailed data on nonlisted NFPEs’
assets and liabilities and domestic and foreign financing by type of debt instrument and holder would be
desirable; efforts in this direction will require continued close collaboration among the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU), the Treasury, and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). There is also a need to disseminate more
information on public private partnerships.
Monetary statistics: The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are reported on a timely and regular basis
and are broadly in conformity with the Fund’s data needs. There is a need to improve the institutional
coverage of the financial corporations, sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification and
valuation of financial instruments to ensure full adherence to the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. In addition, due to the growing importance of insurance corporations, pension funds, and other
financial intermediaries in Malaysia, coverage of MFS should be expanded to include these institutions. The
MFS missions of January 2004 and 2005 developed an integrated monetary database to be used for
publication and operational needs of the BNM, STA, and APD. The Bank Negara Malaysia reports data in
STA’s standardized report forms (SRFs) which provide more detailed classification of certain items, fuller
sectoral and instrument breakdown, and currency aggregation. MFS based on the SRFs are published in
the quarterly IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments: Department of Statistics Malaysia compiles and publishes quarterly balance of
payments estimates in accordance with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and the SDDS.
The quarterly data are released three months after the reference quarter. No data are shown for the capital
transfers or acquisition/sale of nonproduced nonfinancial assets, and transactions in reserve assets are
computed as differences in amounts outstanding and thus include valuation changes. The international
investment position data on other investment—assets and liabilities—are reported only in an aggregate
form.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Malaysia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). It is using a timeliness flexibility
option for general government operations (within six quarter lags after the end of reference year).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 10, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Malaysia
On February 6, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Malaysia. 1
Background
Following a strong recovery in 2010, the Malaysian economy is moderating in the face of a
challenging external environment. While growth remains supported by robust consumption
and investment, export growth has slowed relatively to 2010. In the near term, external
demand is expected to soften further, driving down domestic economic activity. GDP growth
is projected to slow to 4 percent in 2012. Inflation rose through mid˗2011, but has since
eased and remains contained.
Global financial market volatility has not spared Malaysia. While capital inflows remained
strong through the first half of 2011, there was a significant retrenchment in the third quarter
as global uncertainty increased, leading to a decline in equity markets, a depreciation of the
exchange rate, and a pause in reserve accumulation.
The financial system, however, remains sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions and
still declining nonperforming loans. Credit growth has accelerated in line with the economic
recovery, but there are no signs of overheating or asset price excesses. Household debt,
however, has continued to climb, with growth in unsecured personal lending particularly
strong.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

The fiscal deficit in 2011 is expected to be roughly in line with, or even below, budget
projections. Higher petroleum prices and strong tax collections led to a better-than-budgeted
revenue performance, more than offsetting the increase in energy-related subsidies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Malaysia’s strong macroeconomic
performance in the aftermath of the global downturn. Underpinned by robust fundamentals
and policy frameworks, Malaysia is well positioned to face the challenging external
environment in the period ahead. Consolidating public finances remains a high priority, while
structural reforms continue to be crucial to raise the economy’s growth potential and achieve
a more balanced and inclusive growth.
Directors supported the current stance of monetary policy. They saw room for lowering the
policy rate if growth prospects worsen significantly. Directors noted that letting the exchange
rate move flexibly in line with fundamentals while limiting excessive volatility would allow the
real exchange rate to appreciate over the medium term. This would support the structural
reforms to rebalance the sources of growth and a reallocation of resources toward dynamic,
high productivity industries.
Directors noted that Malaysia’s financial system remains sound, well capitalized, and
resilient. In case downside risks materialize, extraordinary support measures similar to those
deployed in 2008−09 could be reinstated. The significant increase in household indebtedness
warrants close monitoring. In this context, Directors welcomed the prudential measures taken
recently, including the introduction of guidelines to ensure that borrowers’ debt is in line with
their incomes. They looked forward to the upcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) report.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to put debt on a downward trajectory. Given
the projected slowdown in growth and the relatively high public debt, scope for discretionary
fiscal support appears limited. Nonetheless, Directors encouraged the authorities to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate, while anchoring any temporary stimulus around a medium
term consolidation path. They also recommended further efforts to better target expenditure,
broaden the tax base, and enhance fiscal transparency as recommended in the fiscal Report
on the Observance of Standard and Codes (ROSCs).
Directors welcomed the ambitious reform agenda to boost potential growth, based on
comprehensive diagnoses of the bottlenecks that hinder investment and productivity. In
particular, they stressed the need to improve the business climate, enhance competition,
upgrade workers’ skills, and create economic opportunities for all Malaysians. Reforms in
these areas, combined with measures to enhance social safety nets, including a well
designed minimum wage, would strengthen the foundations for more inclusive growth.

Statement by Der Jiun Chia, Executive Director for Malaysia
and Shasha Ridzam, Advisor to Executive Director
February 6, 2012
1.
On behalf of our Malaysian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF team for the
focused and constructive discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in
Malaysia. For the most part, there is broad agreement on almost all of the major policy
thrusts. As such, this statement will provide an update on the latest developments in Malaysia
and elaborate on selected policy issues mainly for emphasis and clarification.
Outlook for 2012
2.
In October 2011, the authorities projected that the economy will expand between 5 –
6 percent in 2012. This outlook was premised on several key assumptions at that time,
namely lower but still positive world growth, resilience in regional trade, and firm
commodity prices. While Malaysia’s domestic fundamentals are strong and resilient, the
deterioration in global conditions will affect external demand. Nevertheless, domestic
demand is expected to continue to be the anchor of growth. Private consumption will be
supported by stable employment outlook, continued income growth and firm commodity
prices. The additional factors that will support private consumption in 2012 are the one-off
financial assistance to low- and middle-income groups, civil service pension adjustments and
improved remuneration scheme for civil servants. Private investment is also expected to
continue to record strong growth, supported by the implementation of the Economic
Transformation Programme projects and projects approved by the Malaysian Industrial
Development Authority, still high capacity utilisation rate in the manufacturing sector and
sustained domestic demand, which in turn will support capital spending in the services
sector. The public sector is expected to remain supportive of growth, driven by the higher
capital expenditure of the non-financial public enterprises.
Navigating a Challenging Global Environment: Policy Challenges and Responses
in 2011 – 2012
3.
As a highly open economy, Malaysia would be affected by the increased uncertainty
in the international environment. Nevertheless, the economy is expected to be supported by
internal sources of demand. Furthermore, the more diversified economic and trade structures,
the strong financial system as well as favourable macroeconomic fundamentals have
increased the resilience of Malaysian economy and its capacity to cope with such external
challenges. In addition, there remains sufficient policy flexibility to support the domestic
economy should conditions warrant it.
Monetary Policy
4.
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) normalised the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR)
cumulatively by 100 basis points between March 2010 and May 2011. The assessment then
was that the economy was firmly on a steady growth path and there was the risk that keeping

2
interest rates too low for too long could result in the accumulation of financial imbalances
that could undermine growth in the long run. The Statutory Reserve Requirement was also
raised as a pre-emptive measure to manage the risks of the build-up of liquidity from
resulting in macroeconomic and financial imbalances. Since the second half of 2011, the
OPR has been left unchanged as the deteriorating external environment tilted the balance of
risks towards growth. Going forward, BNM will assess carefully the evolving developments
and adjust monetary conditions accordingly to ensure the sustainability of economic growth
in an environment of price stability.
Financial Sector
5.
Financial stability remained intact in 2011 amid more challenging external conditions
and greater domestic competition. This was underpinned by well-capitalised financial
institutions which provided continued support for financial intermediation activities in the
domestic economy. As at end-November 2011, the banking system continued to maintain a
high level of capitalisation with the core capital ratio and risk-weighted capital ratio
remaining strong at 12.8 percent and 14.8 percent respectively. Approximately 85 percent of
total capital comprised high quality Tier-1 capital primarily in the form of paid-up capital and
reserves. Capital in excess of the minimum 8 percent regulatory requirement remained high
at USD 21.9 billion, hence providing the banking system with the strong capacity to absorb
any unexpected losses from adverse market and economic conditions.
Limited exposure to European banks
6.
Public confidence in the financial system was also preserved. The financial market
demonstrated the capacity to absorb the increased volatility arising from concerns about
sovereign risk in the US and Euro area. Malaysian banks’ (including Labuan banks) exposure
to the Euro area account for less than one fifth of total external exposures. More than half of
these direct European exposure were with the EU-3 countries. As mentioned in Box 2, there
are several key factors that mitigate the risk for Malaysia. European banks in Malaysia fund
their operations domestically, with the bulk of these being in the form of domestic deposits
which account for more than 80% of their total funding. Furthermore, European banks in
Malaysia are locally incorporated subsidiaries. Thus, the risks emanating from their parent
companies are somewhat “isolated”.
Household indebtedness level remains manageable
7.
The overall household indebtedness to GDP ratio was relatively stable at 77.6 percent
in the third quarter of 2011. The bulk of household debts continued to be directed towards
asset accumulation through the purchase of residential properties and vehicles. Banks’ credit
to households through personal financing and credit cards increased at a faster pace but
continued to represent less than 10 percent of overall banking system loans, unchanged
from 2010. The rising trend in household indebtedness level has been supported by strong
household fundamentals and financial capacity.

3
 On aggregate, the debt servicing capacity of households continued to be wellsupported by financial assets that amount to 2.3 times of total household
debts.
 Given sustained growth in income levels and a low unemployment rate, the
capacity to undertake borrowings have been strengthened.
 Moreover, a high savings rate has been supported by continued growth in
deposits of households1. This should provide sufficient cushion to households
when faced with income shocks.
Financial institutions, on their part, have continued to maintain underwriting standards,
supported by information obtained from the Central Credit Reference Information System.
As a result, the net impaired loan ratio for the household sector has remained low at 1.8% at
end-2011.
8.
While the level of overall household indebtedness in Malaysia remains manageable at
this juncture, as part of the ongoing initiatives to ensure sustainability in the household
sector, BNM has put in place the necessary infrastructure and introduced several pre-emptive
measures to manage the possible risks emanating from expansion in household debts. Among
others, these include:
 Revised credit card guidelines.
 Intensified supervisory focus.
 Implemented a maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 70 percent on the third
and subsequent financing facility for the purchase of houses.
 Higher risk weights of 100 percent (from 75 percent) for capital charge on
housing loans with LTV exceeding 90 percent and personal financing with
tenure of more than five years.
9.
On 18 November 2011, BNM issued the Guidelines on Responsible Finance to
promote responsible behaviours and practices by both the lenders and households. The
Guidelines will subject financial institutions to a set of minimum standards in lending
practices with a focus on strengthening the rigour of affordability assessments and ensuring
more consistent practices in the conduct of such assessments across the industry. Similar
guidelines have also been issued to cooperatives by the Co-operative Commission of
Malaysia.
Financial Sector Blueprint 2011 – 2020
10.
As Malaysia transitions towards a high value-added and high-income economy, the
role of the financial sector is envisioned to grow beyond its role as an enabler of growth to
being a driver and catalyst of economic growth. The aim is for the financial sector to be more
1

competitive, dynamic, inclusive, diversified and integrated, with the ability to offer world
class financial services to serve the needs of Malaysia. To chart the future direction of the
financial system over the next ten years, BNM unveiled the new Financial Sector Blueprint
in December 2011. The Blueprint builds on the strong foundation laid out by the Financial
Sector Masterplan (2001 - 2010), of which, all the recommendations have been successfully
completed or are being implemented on an ongoing basis.
11.
Meanwhile, the Islamic finance industry continues to demonstrate sustainable growth
as Malaysia enhances its interlinkages with other financial centres and further strengthens the
country’s position as an international Islamic financial centre. Over the recent year, the
authorities have undertaken measures to strengthen the prudential and regulatory framework,
strategic collaboration with global partners and operationalisation of the International Islamic
Liquidity Management Corporation for more efficient cross-border liquidity management.
Fiscal Policy
12.
The Government is expected to register a better-than-expected lower fiscal deficit of
5.4 percent of GDP in 2011. This is a result of favourable revenue collection due to firm
commodity prices and concerted efforts to widen the revenue base. In line with the
commitment to further strengthen public finances over the medium term, Malaysia expects to
achieve a lower fiscal deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2012.
13.
With regard to debt management, Malaysia has embraced a broader rule to ensure
fiscal sustainability. Although legal debt limits vary for domestic and external debt, the
Government is fully committed to ensuring a total debt level (domestic and external) not
exceeding 55 percent of GDP. Given the increasing uncertainty in the external environment
and if growth deteriorates, the authorities view a temporary rise in Federal Government debt
level (above the 55 percent to GDP threshold) as acceptable to support aggregate demand.
14.
The authorities are committed to improving their fiscal position while remaining
supportive of growth. More importantly, the authorities are mindful that strict adherence to
fiscal discipline as well as medium-term fiscal targets will ensure fiscal sustainability and
promote macroeconomic stability.
Exchange rate
15.
The managed float exchange rate policy continued to serve the economy well in
balancing between stability and flexibility. The policy focus of authorities has been to
maintain orderly foreign exchange market conditions in the short term while ensuring that the
ringgit is not misaligned against the country’s fundamentals over the medium to longer term.
It is important to note that the ringgit’s exchange rate is determined by market forces and the
authorities have no particular target for the exchange rate level. As staff have also noted,
intervention operations have been two-way and have been limited to ensuring orderly market
conditions and to prevent extremes in currency volatility.

5

16.
The ringgit reached a new high in July 2011, an appreciation of 29% since the
adoption of the managed float in July 2005. This appreciating trend, however, was
interrupted in the second half of 2011 due to mounting concerns in the global economy. The
modest depreciation in 2011 only partially reversed the cumulative appreciation of 9%
appreciation in 2009 and 2010. Nevertheless, the authorities believed that as global financial
market normalise, fundamental factors will continue to support the ringgit in the medium to
long term. While a strengthening of the exchange rate could complement the structural
reforms needed to rebalance sources of growth and raise the potential growth of the
economy, it is important to caution against excessive reliance on the exchange rate alone to
facilitate such adjustments. An over-reliance on the exchange rate could result in other
imbalances in the economy.
17.
With regard to the valuation assessment by the IMF, the authorities remain
unconvinced with the capacity of the model-based estimates to capture country-specific
features of the economic structure, including the significant contribution of non-renewable
commodities such as oil to the trade balance. The IMF assessment on the potential
undervaluation of the ringgit also is not corroborated with qualitative evidence, given the fact
that inflation remains low and there has been no evidence of persistent imbalances in the
economy.
Structural Reforms: Enhancing Growth Potential
18.
The Government has put in place comprehensive structural reform plans to address
the structural issues in the economy and to create a globally competitive enabling
environment for the private sector. This is to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a
high-income economy by 2020. Most of the initiatives to transform Malaysia are set forth in
the Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme
(ETP). Since the last Board meeting in July 2010, significant progress has been achieved
since the launch of the ETP in October 2010. Thus far, total committed investments (up to
the year 2020) amount to around USD58 billion.
Final Remarks
19.
Malaysia has embarked on a far-reaching reform agenda that would elevate it to the
next stage of growth and development. At the same time, the authorities are mindful of the
significant downside risks posed by the current challenging global environment. The
authorities will closely monitor developments in the external environment and will respond
as appropriate.
