REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and G. Russell Kincaid
October 11, 2005
The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Tallinn during July 11–
22, 2005. The team comprised Mr. Haas (head), and Messrs. Lutz and Stavrev (all
EUR). Messrs. Farelius and Ross, Alternate ED and Senior Advisor, respectively, for
the Nordic-Baltic constituency, and Mr. Rosenberg (Regional Representative) attended
several meetings. The mission met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance,
the Governor of the Bank of Estonia, and other officials, business representatives,
academics, and representatives from the trade unions.
Estonia joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004 and entered ERM II on
June 27, 2004. A three-party center-left coalition government took office in April
2005; the next general election is scheduled for 2007.
Estonia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, section 2, 3, and 4, and maintains
no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for those imposed in compliance with applicable UN Security
Council resolutions. All such restrictions have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Estonia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Coverage,
periodicity, and timeliness of the data are adequate for surveillance.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2005/072205.htm) and have expressed their
intention to publish the staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Growth remains strong in Estonia, reaching 8½ percent in the first half of
2005. After touching 5 percent in March 2005, headline inflation decreased to 4.2 percent in
August, but still remains well above the Maastricht criterion. Core inflation is more
reassuring and is stable at about 2 percent. The current account deficit widened further in
2004 to 12.7 percent of GDP, but strong export performance is inducing some narrowing in
2005. Fiscal policy eased in 2004 and again in 2005, but the budget is still in surplus, albeit a
small one. Credit is growing at a rapid rate; there are signs that the economy is beginning to
overheat. Estonia entered ERM2 in June 2004 and unilaterally maintains a currency board
arrangement against the euro, which it intends to adopt in 2007.
Outlook: Robust growth is expected to continue, but is forecast to taper off toward
potential—some 6-7 percent per year—as from 2006. Headline inflation should fall to
2½ percent in 2006 after a number of one-off factors, including some related to EU
accession, pass through the system. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Estonia will meet the
Maastricht inflation criterion by June 2006, the first possible test date. It is more likely that
the criterion will be met in late 2006 or early 2007. The current account deficit is expected to
decline to more sustainable levels in the medium term as private saving rebounds. The main
near-term risk is inflation, which could turn out to be higher than envisioned while persistent
high external imbalances and growing debt pose risks over the medium term.
Policy issues and discussions
Fiscal policy was inappropriately expansionary in 2004-05. Estonia has had a history of
over-performance in achieving its balanced budget target. However since 2003, the surpluses
have been ever diminishing with the consequence that the public sector has added to demand
pressures at a time when the economy was nearing potential and external imbalances were
large. Fiscal policy is critical in a currency board country as it is essentially the only effective
stabilization tool. Thus the argument for letting the automatic stabilizers work and targeting a
balanced budget only over the cycle—not annually—was made. While the authorities
acknowledged the need for prudence, they felt that this was met by their commitment to a
general government balance or surplus over the medium term, consistent with the provisions
of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The authorities shared staff’s concerns about high credit growth. While much of the credit
boom is an expected component of real convergence, part of it is caused by credit conditions
in the euro-zone being looser than warranted for Estonia. Given the constraints of a currency
board, the room to maneuver is limited. Nevertheless, the authorities are ready to tighten
prudential regulations and further reduce mortgage deductibility if banks relax their credit
standards.
Solid export performance and relatively stable real effective exchange rates suggest that the
Estonian economy is competitive and the current exchange rate is appropriate. Maintaining
flexibility in labor and product markets will be crucial in preserving this competitiveness.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Estonia has made extraordinary progress in the 14 years following
independence. It has successfully established a market economy and joined the EU. This
was done by following sound macroeconomic policies (broadly consistent with Fund advice
(Box 1)) and implementing far-reaching structural reforms which touched virtually every
sector of the economy. As a result, the country is witnessing a remarkable convergence in
real terms to EU levels, with purchasing power parity per capita income increasing to

2.
Nonetheless, there are risks in both the short and medium terms: in the short
term, there is the very real risk that inflation will exceed the Maastricht criterion and
jeopardize the early adoption of the euro. With average inflation forecast at 4 percent in
2005—well above the estimated Maastricht criterion of about 2¾ percent—meeting the
Maastricht inflation criterion in June 2006 (the earliest possible test date) is increasingly
unlikely. Over the medium term, vulnerability to external shocks remains, with a persistent
and large current account deficit and a rapidly expanding stock of gross external debt. The
current account deficit averaged slightly above 8 percent of GDP during 1995–2004 with
FDI financing three quarters of the gap. However, over the last three years, FDI coverage of
the current account has dropped to about half of the deficit and bank credit has increased.
This has translated into a rapid expansion of gross external debt to over 80 percent of GDP in

-5-

2004, up from 55 percent in 2001.1 At the same time, net external debt increased at a much
slower pace, to 26 percent of GDP (Figure 2).

Box 1. Article IV Fund Policy Advice Implementation
Estonia has had an excellent working relationship with the IMF since becoming a
member in May 1992.1 The Fund’s assistance has been gauged to fit Estonia’s needs
during various phases of the country’s development. Initially, during a period of
stabilization, the IMF provided policy advice and financing; more recently the Fund
has provided extensive technical assistance while continuing with policy advice in the
run up to EU accession. Most Fund policy advice was taken on board and its
implementation has been characterized by a high degree of ownership, something that
has proved critical in Estonia’s successful transformation into a market economy.
However, more recently, fiscal policy has been easier than advised by the Fund and has
not contributed to a needed restraint in aggregate demand and a curbing of inflationary
pressures.
Estonia is generally at the forefront with issues of transparency and good governance.
In response to Fund advice, they have pledged to refrain from all off budget
transactions, which, while legal, are non-transparent.

Two-thirds of gross external debt (excluding inter-company lending to FDI
offspring/partners) is undertaken by highly rated and heavily capitalized commercial banks.
Only about one third of this debt is short term in nature. The total amount of foreign
borrowing by “other” sectors (households, non-bank financial institutions and non-financial
enterprises) was equal to 7 percent of GDP at the end of 2004. Trade credits accounted for
the bulk of this but were more than covered by the “other” sector’s assets.

Inflation has increased since
mid-2004 and remains significantly
above the Maastricht criterion.
Headline inflation accelerated to
5 percent, year-on-year, in March 2005
from just below 1 percent at the
beginning of 2004, driven by rising
energy prices, price increases related
to EU accession, and a jump in food
prices. Although headline inflation has
since declined to 4.2 percent—and is
expected to retreat further by year-end,
as the initial effects of EU accession-

-7-

related price increases wane—it is still forecast to remain above the Maastricht criterion in
2005 and, indeed, with current policies, also by the time of the earliest possible test date in
mid-2006. Measures of core inflation, however, are somewhat more reassuring, suggesting
that inflationary pressures may abate in the future. Specifically, inflation excluding energy
and seasonal food prices has risen much less—about 3 percent year-on-year—while inflation
excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices has remained flat at around 2 percent
since early 2004.
5.
With output estimated to be close to potential, sharp wage growth in the first
half of 2005, combined with signs of labor shortages in the construction sector and an
overall decline of unemployment, could signal nascent overheating. Wages increased
11 percent in the second quarter of 2005. The unemployment rate, according to the
harmonized EU definition, declined by 1.9 percentage points to 8.1 percent in 2005Q2, while
overall employment continued to increase.
6.
The current account deficit has widened further, increasing external
vulnerabilities. Despite strong export growth—goods exports grew 17½ percent in volume
terms in 2004—the current account deficit increased to 12.7 percent of GDP in 2004 from
12.1 percent in 2003 (Table 2). This reflected a fall in the public sector saving rate combined
with a further, though small, decline in private sector saving, with domestic investment
remaining robust (Table 3). Strong export performance in the first half of 2005, however,
resulted in a substantial improvement of the current account, with the deficit declining to
10.4 percent of GDP.

Following four years of conservative fiscal policy, the fiscal stance eased in 2004,
and the fiscal surplus is projected to decline further in 2005. There was substantial overperformance of revenue in 2003 and, with the more-rapid-than-advised unwinding, a
significant expansionary fiscal impulse in 2004. The fiscal surplus (on a cash basis) declined
to 1.7 percent of GDP from 2.9 percent in 2003 (Table 4) as the government increased

around 25 percent a year earlier, with one-half of all lending to non-financial enterprises
channeled into real estate, leasing, and business activities. As a result, credit to the private
sector, as a percent of GDP, and its growth rate, remained somewhat above the trend implied
by Estonia’s income level (Figure 4).

Confidence in the currency board remains strong and Estonia’s entry into
ERM II has been uneventful. Estonia’s credit rating was upgraded in mid-2004 by Fitch to
A from A- following upgrades by both Moody’s and S&P in 2002 (Table 6) and is one of the
highest among the new EU members.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
The discussions focused on policies required to maintain macroeconomic
stability in the run-up to euro adoption and thereafter. There was general agreement that
the challenge of macroeconomic policies over the near term is to limit risks in the external
and financial sectors and to minimize possible inflationary pressures in order to ensure the
timely adoption of the euro, with staff seeing a need for greater fiscal restraint. Over the
medium to longer term, the goal of policy was seen as supporting sustainable real
convergence by preserving external competitiveness and maintaining the flexibility of the
Estonian economy.
A. Economic Outlook and Risks
12.
The authorities viewed the macroeconomic outlook in the short term as
favorable, but with some upside risk for inflation. They project real GDP growth of at
least 6.5 percent in 2005-06, driven largely by domestic demand with support from the
external sector, although the latter is subject to some uncertainty. Average headline inflation
is forecast to accelerate to about 3½ percent in 2005—from 3 percent in 2004—as a result of
rapidly growing energy prices, increases in administered electricity prices, and EU-related
increases in tobacco and fuel excises. 2006 inflation is forecast to decline to 2.6 percent by

- 10 -

the end of the year. However, they recognized that there are upside risks to their inflation
forecast which they see coming mainly from higher-than-expected energy prices and possible
increases of administered prices by local governments. The authorities also acknowledged
that further fiscal stimulus could fuel second-round effects from these supply shocks and
result in higher inflation in 2006 when Estonia could be evaluated for full EMU entry
membership. The current account deficit is projected to decline to 10½ percent of GDP in
2005 as private saving, aided by increased participation in the second-pillar of the pension
system, is forecast to rebound.
13.
This inflation outlook means that it is unlikely that Estonia will meet the
Maastricht criterion by June 2006, the earliest possible test date. The chart below shows
the baseline forecast and an

(Estimate)
both the authorities and staff, this
is neither a cause for undue
alarm, nor should it be viewed as
a set-back. The Maastricht
criterion aside, inflation is
decreasing toward a low core
rate, and the inflation differential in Estonia is largely a by-product of real convergence.
Furthermore, accession related factors themselves account for part of the explanation as to
why inflation is higher than in established EU members with relatively low inflation. It is
also worth noting that markets have not been perturbed by a possible delay in adopting the
euro.2

Over the medium term, the authorities expect generally positive macroeconomic
developments. They forecast real GDP growth to remain close to potential at around
6 -7 percent. The current account deficit is projected to decline to about 6 percent of GDP by
2010 (from 12.7 percent in 2004), driven by higher private saving. In their baseline scenario,
the authorities forecast headline inflation at around 2½ percent over the medium term.
15.
Staff broadly agreed with this assessment, but saw the risks stemming from
inflation and slower external growth. The main near term risk is inflation, while high

states.

- 11 -

external imbalances and growing foreign indebtedness, especially when used to finance
mortgages, pose risks over the medium term. Upward risks to inflation are significant and
come from the continuing high growth of energy prices and further wage pressures.
Regarding external imbalances, a worsening of economic activity in its main trading partners
could reduce growth and widen the current account deficit.
B. Fiscal Policy
16.
The 2005 budget is projected to have a slight surplus, on the order of 0.4 percent
of GDP. In that there was a large surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004, this will impart a
fiscal stimulus equal to about 1¼ percent of GDP. As in the past, revenues appear to have
been stronger than budgeted, the result of higher-than-forecast growth. In previous years this
led to supplementary budgets in which much of the tax windfall was not spent, but rather
used to acquire financial assets. Staff advised that the 2005 supplementary budget do the
same. This would have kept the fiscal position broadly unchanged and not injected an illtimed and unnecessary stimulus to an economy showing signs of overheating. The authorities
acknowledged the prudence of such a policy. However, subsequent to the mission, they
announced a supplementary budget that will increase spending by about 1 percent of GDP
with an amount equal to about 0.4 percent of GDP being saved.
17.
The new coalition government has committed itself to several expenditure and
revenue initiatives within the context of a balanced budget. Beginning in 2006, the new
coalition agreement envisages a further increase in the levels of the basic pensions and higher
maternity benefits (the latter to be increased to 15 from 12 months). The authorities
maintained that the planned pension increase, the major item in the additional spending
package, would be financed by a combination of recently revised upward projections of
social tax collections and a somewhat smaller-than-expected number of pensioners. To
provide the additional financing required for these new spending initiatives, the coalition has
agreed on two revenue measures. First, they intend to slow the pace of the previously
announced income tax rate reduction to 1 percentage point annually from the current
2 percentage points. This would delay the reduction of the income tax rate to 20 percent from
the current 24 percent until 2009. Second, the authorities intend to increase dividend
payments from government-owned Estonian Energy and Estonian Telecom. Initially the
authorities planned to accelerate the scheduled increase in excise taxes to gain additional
revenue, but, in the course of the discussions, decided, because of its inflationary impact, to
postpone this until after the adoption of the euro. However, they also emphasized that should
the expected additional revenues not cover the entire package of new expenditures, other
spending would be cut to balance the budget.
18.
Given the additional expenditures planned by the new government, staff saw the
proposed slower path of cuts in income tax rates as appropriate in limiting
macroeconomic imbalances. However, it pointed out that the additional revenue measures
considered by the authorities to finance their new spending initiatives could have adverse
side effects. In particular, higher dividend withdrawals might be counterproductive at a time
when Estonian Energy requires significant investment funds in order to upgrade its

- 12 -

technology. The authorities maintained that the future investment needs of the energy and
telecommunications companies would not be undermined. Regarding Estonian Telecom, the
authorities pointed out that this would not hurt the company’s investment plans because it is
a mature firm with few investment needs.
19.
An annually balanced budget is part of the coalition agreement; indeed, this has
also been the policy of previous governments. Difficulties with this approach emerge when
the economy is growing above its potential rate. In this case, a balanced budget is procyclical and exacerbates macro imbalances. Thus staff argued, as it has in the past, that the
budget be balanced over the cycle and the automatic stabilizers be allowed to operate. And,
given that the 2005 budget at the time of the mission was projected to be in strong surplus,
staff recommended that a balanced budget be targeted only over the medium term—and
consequently the surplus be lowered gradually—so as not to be pro-cyclical. In addition, staff
noted, a gradual reduction of fiscal surpluses over the next several years would provide an
opportunity to better provision for the future needs of Estonians. The authorities argued that
the balanced budget target was appropriate, given the low level of public debt, and
maintained that it would be difficult to justify to the public the need for continued fiscal
surpluses over the medium term. Staff agreed that, from a debt sustainability viewpoint, the
target appeared appropriate over the longer term, but saw a short-term need for fiscal
restraint to reduce external vulnerabilities and support the adoption of the euro.
20.
The authorities voiced resolve in introducing medium-term budgeting for the
next budget cycle in order to improve expenditure control and maintain fiscal
prudence. This approach was suggested by a recent FAD TA mission. Given the increase in
the size of the government over the past several years, staff welcomed this, especially in light
of growing demand for healthcare services in Estonia’s aging population. Staff also noted
that the government’s wage bill has increased significantly (by around 1 percent of GDP) in
recent years, reflecting large increases in both health and education employment, as well as
sizeable increases in healthcare wages this year. However, the authorities pointed out that
part of the expenditure increase was due to EU related spending, and that the growth of
wages in the public sector was not excessive, if adjusted for education level differentials with
the private sector.
C. Financial Policy and Euro Adoption Issues
21.
The authorities shared staff concerns about the high growth rate of credit.
However, they pointed out that, to a great degree, the boom in credit is a result of Estonia’s
sound macroeconomic development, the decline in real interest rates, improved external
credit ratings, and financial deepening. They also noted that credit conditions in the Euroarea were looser than conditions in Estonia warranted. While agreeing with this assessment,
staff noted that fast credit growth could spur inflationary pressures. Furthermore, it argued
that continued high credit growth rates had stimulated a rapid expansion of the real estate
sector and, given that real estate lending is largely financed from abroad, contributed to
external risks.

- 13 -

22.
The authorities stressed their readiness to use all available tools, including
prudential regulations, to safeguard credit standards. They pointed out that levels of
credit in Estonia were low by EU standards and financial stability indicators remained sound,
with risk adjusted capital adequacy ratios well above the required 10 percent, and nonperforming loans close to zero. The authorities also noted that periodic, forward-looking
stress tests of the banks’ balance sheets both by the Financial Supervisory Authority, as well
as by the banks themselves, indicate that the banking system is sound. Staff agreed but noted
that there were signs of overheating in the real estate market, as evidenced by strong
mortgage demand and developing labor shortages in the construction sector. Therefore, staff
suggested consideration be given to further reducing mortgage interest deductibility and to
maintaining the limits on the housing activities of Kredex—a quasi-government loan
guarantee agency—to restrain the growth of housing demand.
23.
The authorities pointed out that the strong performance of exports and broadly
stable traded goods prices suggest that the current exchange rate peg was appropriate.
Estonia’s external competitiveness remains relatively strong (Figure 3). Market shares of
Estonian exports in both world and EU markets increased in 2004. With respect to relative
cost measures, the

economy-wide unit labor
(Index, 2000=100)
cost-based real effective
exchange rate has remained
broadly unchanged since

1999, the CPI-based real
effective exchange rate has
appreciated on average by
about 2 percent a year, in
line with estimated
Seasonally adjusted PPI-based REER
Balassa-Samuelson effects,
while the PPI-based real
effective exchange rate has
stayed roughly flat. The
authorities also
acknowledged the
importance of labor market flexibility in the context of the currency board in maintaining
Estonia’s competitiveness over the past decade. Staff agreed with this assessment and noted,
in light of the continuing high current account deficits and given the currency board
arrangement, that maintaining labor and product market flexibility is vital in preserving
Estonia’s competitiveness over the medium term and ensuring sustainable real convergence
in the run-up to euro adoption and thereafter.
24.
Discussions on euro adoption covered several technical issues. First, it will be
necessary for Estonia to harmonize its reserve requirements with EU norms. Neither the
authorities nor staff saw lowering reserve requirements, from 13 percent to 2 percent, as
causing any insurmountable liquidity problems. Owing to the availability of funds from
foreign parent banks and access to external borrowing, changing reserve requirements on

domestic deposits will not materially alter liquidity. Second, the possible need for a
constitutional amendment to give the government the power to declare the euro legal tender
has been raised in Brussels. The authorities argued against the need for a constitutional
amendment which would involve delaying adoption of the euro and felt that an amendment
to the Bank of Estonia Law that makes it clear that the euro is the legal currency of the
country would be sufficient to remove any doubt on this issue.
25.
The authorities acknowledged the risks associated with the high current account
deficit and the rapid accumulation of gross external debt, but saw the external position
improving over the medium term. Their argument was twofold. First, the high level of FDI
in Estonia over past years is expected to result in robust export oriented growth over the
medium term. Second, saving is expected to increase, supported by the growing second pillar
pension fund and a decline in consumption smoothing, as income levels continue to increase.
They noted also that conventional indicators suggest that Estonia’s vulnerability to a crisis
was similar to that in the other Baltic countries (Table 8) and net external debt was not
excessive.3 Moreover, they pointed out that the major banks had treasury mandates with their
parents that significantly reduce rollover risks. Staff agreed with this assessment, but pointed
out that, nevertheless, risks remain. In the staff’s baseline scenario, gross external debt is
forecast to rise initially to around 90 percent of GDP, before declining gradually to
84½ percent of GDP by 2010 (close to its 2004 level), with net debt at roughly half those
levels (Tables 2 and 7)4. Staff pointed out that if the expected rebound in private saving did
not materialize, the outlook would be less sanguine. The alternative scenario (Table 9)
attempts to quantify this by assuming that consumption, met by imports, continues at a high
level. In this case, a higher external debt path results (above 90 percent) in the medium term.
Thus external vulnerabilities increase, as does the likelihood of a hard landing.
D. Structural and Other Issues
26.
The authorities saw labor market conditions improving further. They maintained
that while structural unemployment, in part a legacy of Estonia’s central planning past,
remained high, it was localized. The authorities pointed out that in addition to buoyant
economic activity, the active labor market policies introduced in autumn 2004 were also seen
as contributing to declining unemployment. The new vocational education development
strategy for 2005–08 has been expanded and Estonia has prepared for the future use of EU

The level of net external debt has increased on average by 14 percentage points of GDP
over the past five years when the amount of foreign assets held by “other” sectors (including
pension funds and insurance companies) is excluded, but the dynamics remain broadly
unchanged.

structural funds to achieve the goals of the plan. This should improve labor market
performance.
27.
Reforms to increase effective competition in network industries continue, albeit
at a measured pace. Progress in reforming the electricity sector continues on schedule; in
light of Estonia’s heavy reliance on domestic shale-oil resources, it was granted (under the
EU accession treaty) a transitional period lasting until the end of 2012 before complete
opening of the electricity market. The telecommunication market has experienced rapid
growth following its liberalization in 2003 with recent measures, including mobile phone
number portability, further increasing competition.
28.
The authorities reported that legislation to combat money laundering and the
financing of terrorism has been implemented in accordance with international norms.
Estonia’s anti-money laundering legislation was brought in line with the latest EU directives
in this area; Estonia has fully implemented all U.N. Security Council Resolutions regarding
the financing of terrorism.
29.
Estonian data are of good quality and do not impede effective surveillance. The
authorities compile fiscal data on cash basis and do not plan switching to accrual basis in the
medium term. However, staff noted that quality fiscal data are at the heart of policy
formulation and urged the authorities to give a higher priority to adopting the European
System of Accounts established in 1995. Staff also suggested that the authorities collect
detailed data on the maturity structure of bank assets and liabilities to aid in assessing
financial risk.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Estonia has made major economic strides since independence. Sound
macroeconomic policies and far-reaching structural reforms have been instrumental in
fostering macroeconomic stability and promoting strong growth. As a result, the country is
rapidly converging to EU levels. And Estonia is leading most other new EU member states in
meeting the Maastricht criteria, although satisfying the inflation criterion remains a
challenge. The country entered ERM II in late June 2004, unilaterally maintaining its europegged currency board, and is well positioned to adopt the euro in due course.
31.
While economic developments are generally favorable, the future is not without
risks, with nascent signs of overheating in some sectors, and external vulnerabilities
mounting. For a country at Estonia’s stage of development, some inflation is to be expected
as productivity-led wage increases spread throughout the economy. In a small open economy
with a currency board arrangement, inflation is, in large measure, determined by external
factors. Notwithstanding this, domestic policy has a role to play. While the core inflation rate
is currently low at about 2 percent, an expansionary fiscal stimulus, especially if combined
with rapid credit growth, could result in a build-up of inflationary pressure. And vulnerability
to external shocks remains, with a relatively large current account deficit that is increasingly
financed by borrowing from abroad. Again, for a country in Estonia’s position, some current

- 16 -

account deficit is to be expected as the country increases its productive capacity by importing
capital equipment. But, at present, the current account deficit is at a level that cannot be
maintained indefinitely.
32.
Prudent policies need to be pursued to keep inflation in check, and thereby
facilitate the smooth adoption of the euro, and to allow external imbalances to return to
sustainable levels. In the short-term, with the economy near potential and early signs in the
real estate and construction sectors that the economy may be facing some bottlenecks, fiscal
restraint is called for. This would reduce domestic demand and the external imbalances as
well as forestall inflationary pressures. Looking beyond the short-term, maintaining product
market and wage flexibility is paramount in preserving Estonia’s competitiveness and
facilitating convergence.
33.
Given the limitations a currency board places on an independent monetary
policy, tight fiscal policy is the only effective major tool available to reduce external
vulnerabilities and restrict domestic demand. However, by reducing a large fiscal surplus
to a small one, Estonia has chosen to run an expansionary macro policy in 2005. Should any
further revenue windfalls occur, it is important that they be saved. In 2006 the authorities
should tighten fiscal policy, run a substantial surplus, and thereby reduce demand pressures
in an overheated system. Looking ahead, while a balanced budget appears appropriate from a
medium- to long-run perspective, it should be achieved only gradually, with a measured
reduction in the fiscal surplus over several years to limit external vulnerabilities and support
the timely adoption of the euro. In as much as the recent supplementary budget has reduced
the surplus at too rapid a rate, the authorities should reverse enough of this easing to ensure a
cyclically neutral stance.
34.
The announced increase of the basic pension in 2006 could put pressure on the
fiscal balance despite the higher revenues expected from a slower pace in the reduction
of the income tax rate. The authorities have proposed increasing dividends from stateowned companies, something that might prove counterproductive at a time when significant
investment funds are required. Thus, should the pension increase be implemented, sufficient
cuts in other expenditures should be taken in order to avoid further fiscal stimulus.
35.
Greater efforts to control government current expenditure are also called for.
The government’s wage bill has increased significantly. Controlling expenditure growth,
especially in the light of growing demand for healthcare services, should be improved to
preserve the relatively favorable tax environment which has clearly been beneficial to
Estonia over the past decade. The necessary preparatory work has been completed and
medium-term budgeting should be implemented in the next budget cycle. Furthermore, a
functioning multi-year budgeting framework could serve as a vehicle to implement a strategy
of balancing the budget over the cycle. A move toward general government accrual
accounting in the medium term is also recommended.
36.
The high growth rate of credit continues to add to demand pressures. If banks
loosen credit standards in the current period of high growth, financial supervisors should use

- 17 -

all of the tools at their disposal, including prudential regulations, to ensure the stability of the
financial system. While levels of credit in Estonia are low by EU standards—and some
relatively rapid credit growth is to be expected as the financial system converges to EU
norms—there are emerging signs of overheating. Slowing the growth in housing demand
could be achieved by further reducing mortgage interest deductibility and maintaining the
current limits on the housing activities of Kredex.
37.
The strong performance of exports and relatively stable traded goods prices
suggest that the current exchange rate peg is appropriate. There is no evidence that the
current account deficit reflects a problem in competitiveness. Because Estonia has a currency
board arrangement, maintaining labor and product market flexibility is critical in preserving
Estonia’s competitiveness over the medium term and ensuring sustainable real convergence
in the run-up to euro adoption and thereafter.
38.
Establishing a market based system and pursuing prudent macro policies have
worked well for Estonia. The country has enjoyed robust growth and relatively stable
prices, achieved EU membership, and entered ERM II. However, full integration into the
euro area is not yet complete and the authorities should guard against complacency and
continue on the course they have charted for themselves.
39.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Estonia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Banks must meet reserve requirements on the basis of average reserve holdings over each reporting period. End of period levels
can, therefore, be below the level of required reserves. Starting in January 2001, 3 percentage points of the 13 percent reserve
requirement could be met with high quality euro-denominated foreign instruments. In July 2001, this foreign share of reserve
requirements was raised to 50 percent.
2/ Non-performing loans are defined as loans overdue from 30-150 days and under current regulations all non-performing loans
over 150 days are written off.
3/ Defined as the ratio of total liabilities to total capital; a decline in the ratio indicates improvement.

1/ Total general government and government guaranteed debt excluding government assets held abroad.
2/ Excluding reserve assets of the Bank of Estonia.
3/ At remaining maturity.
4/ Starting in 2000, the definition of external debt was widened to include money market instruments and financial derivatives.
5/ Based on a wider definition of gross external debt than previously reported. Were it not for the change in definition of external debt, the gross debt to GDP ratio would have
declined in 2000.
6/ Net of portfolio assets (including money market instruments), financial derivative assets, other investment assets, and reserve assets held by Estonian residents.
7/ Tallinn stock exchange index (TALSE), end of period.
8/ Standard & Poor's long-term foreign exchange sovereign rating.
9/ One-month spread between Tallinn interbank borrowing rate (TALIBOR) and the corresponding EURIBOR rate.

B. Bound Tests
B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B3. Change in Euro GDP deflator is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B4. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B5. Combination of B1-B4 using one standard deviation shocks
B6. One time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2006

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessment:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Estonia was subject to the
transitional procedures with respect to the Stand By Arrangement which was approved on
March 1, 2000 and which expired on August 31, 2001. The transitional procedures require a
review of only the BOE's external audit mechanism. This assessment determines whether the
BOE publishes annual financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with
internationally accepted standards. The external audit assessment was completed on
December 13, 2000. The assessment concluded that BOE's external audit mechanism is
adequate, as reported in 2001 Article IV Staff Report.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Estonia is the kroon. The kroon replaced the ruble on June 20, 1992. Since
that date, the Bank of Estonia has guaranteed the conversion of kroon bank notes, coins, and
reserve deposits of commercial banks at a fixed rate of exchange of EEK 15.6466 per euro
(and EEK 8 per deutsche mark until 31 December, 2001). Estonia has accepted the

- 33 -

APPENDIX I

obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Estonia maintains an exchange system that is
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, apart
from restrictions in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1076,
1269, 1333, 1368 and 1373 and the measures adopted by the EU within the framework of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy. All such restrictions have been notified to the Fund
according to Decision 144-(52/51). It appears that Estonia does not maintain restrictions on
capital transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
The 2004 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
November 8, 2004.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Estonia’s financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
March, 2000. The associated Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), and
the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report, were completed in June and August
2000 respectively. IMF missions also conducted assessments of fiscal transparency, and data
quality and dissemination practices, in Estonia, in April and May 2001, respectively. These
assessments were discussed in the 2001 Article IV consultations, and the resulting ROSC
modules were completed later that year. The ROSC modules were updated during the 2002
Article IV consultation. The updates were published on the Fund’s external website.

- 38 -

Statement by David Farelius, Alternate Executive Director for Republic of Estonia
and Timo Kosenko, Advisor to Executive Director
October 26, 2005
Our Estonian authorities would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Haas and his team
for the constructive discussions and the set of high quality papers. The authorities broadly
agree with staff’s assessment as well as with the recommendations for the years ahead.
Recent economic developments and prospects
Estonia is enjoying the sixth consecutive year of rapid economic expansion, underpinned by
strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the EU entry and appropriately flexible market
structures. In the current cyclical position, the real GDP growth reached 8.5 percent in the
first half of 2005 and is expected to exceed 8 percent for 2005 as a whole. Thereafter the
output expansion is expected to move closer to the long-term average that is revised upwards
to 6 - 7 percent. While the domestic demand remains strong, the recent acceleration of
growth is mostly accounted for by a buoyant export performance, contributing some
additional 2 percentage points to the previous forecasts.
After the anticipated gradual decline during the first half of 2005, the rate of the annual CPI
inflation picked up to 4.9 percent in September. The authorities have correspondingly
changed their inflation forecast to 4.2 percent for 2005. This recent acceleration is mostly
driven by the increase in oil prices. While the authorities remain vigilant to pre-empt possible
second round effects, they are confident that the medium-term inflationary pressures remain
modest. Moreover, as noted by staff in the Selected Issues paper, the impact of energy shocks
on core inflation in Estonia has been low, likely reflecting the degrees of product market
competition and labor market flexibility. Against this backdrop, the authorities expect the
headline inflation to decline to somewhat above 3 percent in 2006, slightly lower than staff’s
projections, provided that oil prices will not reach new highs.
Long term confidence effects, rapid income growth and rising employment - in the context of
full integration of Estonia’s banking system with the European markets and favorable interest
rate environment - have fuelled the private sector credit, particularly mortgage financing. By
June 2005, the rate of credit expansion has leveled off at slightly above 40 percent year-onyear, with the accompanying rise in real estate prices remaining at the level of 20 percent.
The authorities are well aware that vigilance is needed to avoid the possible undesirable
effects of the rapid credit growth on the medium term developments. In this context, they
take note of staff’s suggestion to further reduce the tax deductibility of mortgage interest
payments.
After peaking at 12.7 percent of GDP in 2004, mostly due to one-off shocks related to the EU
accession and a number of large infrastructure investment projects, the current account
deficit has remained on a declining trend with the four-quarter average decreasing to 10.4
percent of GDP in the first half of 2005. The deficit is expected to continue to decline
gradually in the coming years, supported by the competitive export sector and gradually

-2increasing domestic savings. Strong profitability of foreign-owned enterprises is expected to
continue to have an impact on the headline deficit. As has been the case in the recent years,
the reinvested profits will likely account for about half of the current account deficit (4.7
percent of GDP in 2004).
Staff notes the declining share of the net FDI in capital inflows. A significant part of this is
attributable to increased FDI by Estonian companies. Moreover, the full integration of
Estonia’s financial system with European markets has resulted in substituting part of intragroup transactions for borrowing from Estonian subsidiaries and branches of large regional
banking groups. Nevertheless, the authorities are fully aware that vigilance and prudent
macroeconomic stance is needed to support the continuing decrease of the current account
deficit.
Adoption of the euro
While the EU accession has provided a new impetus to the development of the economy and
the society, the authorities recognize that the adoption of the euro would enable Estonia to
reap full benefits of economic integration and the single market. Therefore, the adoption of
the euro by 2007, in full compliance with the well known provisions of the common EU
framework, remains an overarching goal for the Estonian authorities. Moreover, they are well
aware of the need to maintain prudent macroeconomic stance and to continue with advanced
structural reforms to ensure sustainable economic development and real convergence after
joining the Euro Area. The authorities share staff’s emphasis on maintaining labor and
product market flexibility as the key to sustainable convergence in both the near and
medium-term.
Estonia is expected to have little difficulties in meeting most of the Maastricht criteria.
Estonian kroon has maintained its peg to the euro, including in the ERM II framework, the
general budget has been in surplus for the past five years and the long-term interest rate
differential with the euro rates remains negligible. Moreover, the gross public debt is low at
5.5 percent of GDP and accumulated gross reserves of the public sector amount to over 10
percent of GDP. Practical preparations for the currency changeover are also well underway.
Looking ahead, the recent surge in the headline inflation rate is the biggest challenge, as the
relatively higher share of energy and liquid fuel in the Estonian consumer basket (adding up
to over 20 percent) makes the CPI inflation sensitive to changes in the world market
conditions. However, it is reassuring that the core inflation has remained stable at around 2
percent year-on-year.
Macroeconomic policies in 2005
The authorities remain committed to the transparent macroeconomic framework to support
sustained economic expansion and smooth entry into the Euro Area. Their policies remain
firmly centered around the currency board framework, underpinned by the general
government’s fiscal position being balanced or in surplus, the strong financial system and
labor and product market flexibility. The authorities recognize that the current combination
of high output growth and low interest rates leaves no room for complacency to maintain

-3stable and balanced economic development; the sustainability of the external position
remains a key issue. While the underlying inflation rate is ultimately driven by external
factors in a small and very open economy with the currency board arrangement, the
authorities make every effort to ensure stability of the price level and to avoid excessive real
exchange rate appreciation.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy has a key role for the economy functioning under a currency board
arrangement. The authorities have a well established track record of fiscal prudence and the
general government is running a surplus budget for the fifth consecutive year. At this stage,
the official estimates put the general government surplus for 2005 to over 1 percent of GDP,
mostly due to higher than expected output growth and continuous improvements in tax
collection, while even higher outcome could not be ruled out. With traditionally conservative
growth estimates, the government is planning a balanced budget from 2006 onwards.
The authorities’ medium-term budgeting process relies on the State Budget Strategy; in
addition, the annual budgeting process takes into account the medium-term impact of next
year’s budget decisions. The authorities share staff’s view of the importance of medium-term
budgeting in order to maintain fiscal prudence and to improve expenditure control.
Financial sector policies
The sixteen months of participation in the ERM II mechanism have been uneventful. The
Estonian kroon has not experienced any pressures and the short-term interest rate differential
against the euro has been negligible at 10-15 bps. Estonia will maintain its currency board
arrangement as a unilateral commitment while in the ERM II.
The still rapid credit growth underlines the need to ensure the credibility of the financial
system and to avoid possible unwarranted macroeconomic impact if the credit market
conditions start to change. As the staff’s report notes, the banking sector remains financially
sound in every aspect, with profitability solid, the share of nonperforming loans negligible
and consolidated capital adequacy ratio at 12 percent, comfortably above the legal minimum
requirement of 10 percent. Both the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) and banks are
performing periodic, forward-looking stress tests of the balance sheets, which have
confirmed the soundness of the banking system.
The authorities are monitoring the situation very carefully and stand ready to implement
necessary measures, should the credit standards show any signs of worsening. However, with
Estonia’s banks being fully integrated with Nordic financial groups in both financial and
institutional terms and in the context of EU’s single market for financial services, the
authorities’ very close cooperation with financial supervisors of the region is equally
important. Maintaining prudent lending policies is also instrumental to contain the increasing
gross indebtedness of Estonia’s private sector even if Estonia’s net position vis-à-vis the rest
of the world is not yet alarmingly high.

-4Structural policies
Estonian business climate remains attractive by international standards with the World
Bank’s recent survey “Doing Business 2005” ranking Estonia as 16th by ease of doing
business. It is, therefore, not surprising that Estonia continues to enjoy sizable gross FDI
inflows that reached new highs at around 12 percent of GDP in the first half of 2005
(excluding a major investment in financial sector that amounted to over 20 percent of GDP).
The productivity growth has increased further, reaching 6.8 percent in the first half of 2005.
Recent developments on the labor market are encouraging with unemployment falling from
the peak of 13.6 percent in 2000 to 9.7 percent in 2004 and 8.1 percent in the second quarter
of 2005. The number of people unemployed for a year or longer has also fallen to the lowest
level of the past six years. While the EU membership appears to have had a significant
impact on labor market developments in certain sectors, most notably in the health care and
construction, the Estonian authorities agree with staff’s advice regarding the wage
developments.
Estonia firmly supports the Lisbon goals of higher growth and employment. In October 2005,
the Government approved the National Action Plan, focusing on measures to sustain
macroeconomic stability and increase competitiveness, including higher investments into
R&D, active labor market policies and measures to improve business climate and
entrepreneurship.
The authorities continue their advanced reform agenda in the network industries where
market liberalization in several sectors, including in the telecom sector, was already
accomplished some years ago. In accordance with the EU directives and provisions
governing Estonia’s accession to the EU, the electricity market will be fully opened for
competition by 2012. The market for natural gas is already liberalized to a large extent; the
draft legislation is currently discussed in the Parliament to effectively increase the openness
of the market for natural gas from 90 to 95 percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Estonia
On October 26, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Estonia.1
Background
Estonia has made extraordinary progress following independence. Sound macroeconomic
policies and far-reaching structural reforms have resulted in the successful establishment of a
market economy and EU membership. The country is witnessing a remarkable convergence in
real terms to EU levels, with purchasing power parity per capita income increasing to
46 percent of the EU15 level. Estonia has also achieved significant nominal convergence,
meeting all of the Maastricht criteria, save for inflation. Estonia entered ERM II in late June
2004, unilaterally maintaining its peg to the euro with a currency board arrangement, and is
aiming at early euro adoption.
Robust economic growth continues, largely driven by domestic demand. Real GDP growth
increased to nearly 8 percent in 2004 (from 6¾ percent a year earlier) and accelerated further,
to 8½ percent year-on-year, in the first half of 2005. Inflation has increased since mid-2004
and remains significantly above the Maastricht criterion. Headline inflation reached 4.9 percent
year-on-year in September and, with current policies, is forecast to remain above the
Maastricht criterion by the time of the earliest possible test date in mid-2006. At the same time
labor market conditions have tightened: in the second quarter of 2005, the unemployment rate
declined to 8.1 percent, overall employment continued to grow and wages increased by
11 percent. With output estimated to be close to potential and labor shortages appearing in the
construction sector, signs of nascent overheating are emerging.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2The current account deficit remains large, increasing external vulnerabilities. Despite strong
export growth, the current account deficit widened to 12.7 percent of GDP in 2004. However,
on the heels of a strong export performance, it subsequently declined to 10.4 percent of GDP
in the first half of 2005.
Following four years of tight fiscal policy, the fiscal stance eased in 2004, and is projected to
ease further in 2005. The fiscal surplus declined to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004 when the
government increased expenditures in a supplementary budget late in the year. As a result of
higher pension expenditures planned for the second half of this year, and a recent
supplementary budget allocating a good part of revenue overperformance to additional
spending, the fiscal surplus will decline again in 2005 to a projected 0.4 percent of GDP. The
2006 budget foresees a further easing to an overall balanced position.
The rapid expansion of credit to the private sector continued in 2004 and the first half of 2005,
financed increasingly by borrowing from abroad. Credit growth to households accelerated to
above 50 percent in 2004, year-on-year, with household loans for real estate accounting for
over 80 percent of this. Credit growth to enterprises reached 48 percent at end-June 2005
from around 25 percent a year earlier. Estonia’s banking system remains financially sound,
with strong profitability continuing despite increased competition. Confidence in the currency
board remains strong.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities on the remarkable progress Estonia has
made in the 14 years since independence, which has been made possible by sound
macroeconomic policies and far-reaching structural reforms. These policies have achieved
sustained growth and declining unemployment, and the country is rapidly converging to EU
levels. Directors considered that the economic outlook is generally favorable, but noted the
nascent signs of overheating, including the rapid growth in domestic credit, and the country’s
continuing external vulnerabilities. In these circumstances, Directors called for fiscal restraint
and careful monitoring of credit developments in the short term, and continued efforts to
maintain product market and wage flexibility for safeguarding competitiveness.
Many Directors viewed the continuing large current account imbalance with concern. The
current account deficit has been at a level that is unsustainable over the longer-term and
needs to be addressed. Directors noted that the deficit did not appear to stem from any
problems of competitiveness, but has rather been influenced by macroeconomic conditions.
They emphasized that, in the context of Estonia’s currency board, fiscal restraint is needed to
restrict domestic demand and reduce the external imbalances.
Directors commended the authorities for their pursuit of prudent fiscal policy over several
years. At the same time, they noted that the decline in the fiscal surplus in 2005, and the
further decline planned in 2006, meant that fiscal policy will continue to impart a positive fiscal
impulse when the economy is showing signs of overheating and external imbalances are large.
Furthermore, they noted that, in Estonia, fiscal policy is the only effective stabilization tool. In
these circumstances, Directors considered that fiscal policy should be tightened. Should any
windfall revenues occur, they should be saved and the expansionary effects of the recent
supplementary budget should be reversed in 2006 to limit demand pressures. Directors
welcomed the plans to introduce medium-term budgeting aimed at improving expenditure
control. They agreed that the medium-term budget should target balanced budgets over the
cycle enabling a gradual reduction in the fiscal surplus.

-3Directors noted that the banking sector remains sound, with strong bank balance sheets, good
supervision, and well developed risk management systems. Nevertheless, they expressed
concern about the high growth rate of credit, especially as much of the increase in domestic
credit is funded by foreign borrowing and used to finance credit to the domestic real estate
market. Directors agreed with the authorities that, in the absence of an independent monetary
policy, large scale measures to restrict credit growth are largely precluded. Still, they urged the
authorities to use all tools at their disposal to reduce the demand for credit, including by
tightening prudential regulations should banks loosen their credit standards. Accordingly,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to remain vigilant and stand ready to implement
any needed measures. They also welcomed the authorities’ progress on implementing AntiMoney Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism legislation in line with international
norms.
Many Directors observed that, while inflation is relatively high, it is not seen as a threat to
competitiveness as it is declining and core inflation is under control. Nevertheless, it will be
challenging for Estonia to meet the Maastricht inflation criterion in 2006, although Estonia has
otherwise achieved an impressive degree of convergence toward the euro area. Directors
observed that the currency board remains credible, as indicated by Estonia’s relatively high
credit rating, and is a viable strategy in the run up to euro adoption.
Directors observed that flexible labor and product markets are critical in a country where there
is no nominal exchange rate flexibility and, consequently, it is important for Estonia to maintain
the high degree of market flexibility that has been achieved. They also noted the need to keep
wage increases in line with productivity increases, if Estonia is to remain competitive. Directors
were supportive of Estonia’s recent steps to increase employment through active labor market
policies. They also welcomed the planned reforms to increase competition in the electricity and
telecommunications sectors.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
the Republic of Estonia may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
