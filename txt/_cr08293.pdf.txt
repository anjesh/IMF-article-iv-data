SURINAME
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Suriname
Approved by Ranjit Teja and Michael T. Hadjimichael
May 2, 2008
•

Context. A narrow economic base, terms-of-trade swings, and a weak policy/institutional
framework have in the past led to macroeconomic instability. However, performance has
strengthened in recent years, on the back of high commodity prices and improved policies.

•

Developments. Although economic growth is strong and reserves are being rebuilt, inflation
has risen to double digits, driven by large increases in food and fuel prices, rapid domestic
demand growth (terms-of-trade improvements have raised real income by over 10 percent),
and depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate. Against the backdrop of a de facto
peg to the U.S. dollar, monetary policy easing is contributing to a credit boom, while a large
fiscal expansion is envisaged for 2008. These are adding to macroeconomic pressures.

•

Policy advice. Policies need to rein in domestic demand growth and lower inflationary
pressures, while reducing financial sector risks. Specifically, staff recommend to:
o Tighten monetary conditions to lower booming credit growth. This should be done
through T-bill issuance or, as a second-best option, higher reserve requirements.
o Strengthen the fiscal balance by 2–3 percent of GDP relative to the current target for
2008. This would require a slower expansion of capital spending, more modest wage
growth, and savings from likely revenue overperformance.
o Consider utilizing the flexibility allowed by the de jure managed float to deal with
inflationary pressures, while moving to a more flexible exchange rate regime over time, as
institutions and policies strengthen.
o Bolster the medium-term fiscal framework to increase resilience to shocks. Annual
budgets should be set in a multi-year framework, while targeting public debt of no more
than 20–25 percent of GDP and a sustainable non-mineral balance.

•

Authorities’ reactions. Rising core inflation reflects mainly spillovers from supply shocks.
In any event, strengthening the fiscal stance in 2008 would be very difficult given political
pressures for higher spending and lower taxes. Strengthening the medium-term fiscal
framework is a priority.

•

Data. Statistics have been inadequate for surveillance purposes (Appendix I), reflecting
capacity limitations. The authorities are planning to address deficiencies, particularly in the
area of national accounts, and may request Fund technical assistance.

•

Fund relations. Suriname is an Article VIII country, but maintains two multiple currency
practices (Appendix I).

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Suriname’s narrow economic base makes it prone to macroeconomic volatility.
Three commodities (alumina, gold and oil) account for 80 percent of export receipts and
50 percent of GDP, and generate one-fourth of central government revenues. The prices of
these products have exhibited large swings, and during the 1990s sharp downturns led to
sizable fiscal deficits, external arrears, central bank budget financing and episodes of nearhyperinflation. Weak policy and institutional frameworks have contributed to higher
economic volatility and lower growth than in other commodity-exporting countries
(Figure 1). These have undermined the credibility of policies and contributed to high
financial dollarization, with over half of deposits denominated in foreign currency.

2.
Aided by strong commodity prices and an improvement in policies,
macroeconomic performance has strengthened markedly in recent years (Figure 2). The
terms of trade have improved by about 30 percent since 2005, implying an increase in real
income of over 10 percent. Supported by this environment, improved policies—strengthening
of the non-mineral balance, bolstering central bank independence, and reduction of foreign
exchange market fragmentation—have contributed to higher growth, lower inflation, large
reserve accumulation, and a sharp decline in public debt.
3.
Economic growth in 2007 was strong and the external accounts improved, but
inflation has risen to double digits.
•

Aided by high commodity prices and improved confidence, GDP growth is estimated
at 5½ percent, with strong performance in both the mineral and non-mineral sectors.

•

Twelve-month inflation more than trebled to almost 14 percent in March, driven in
large measure by food and fuels prices (Figure 2). However, non-tradables inflation, a
better measure of underlying excess demand pressures, has also picked up
significantly since November. Tradables inflation excluding food and fuels has also
risen rapidly, reflecting depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate.

Reflecting higher commodity prices and oil output, the current account surplus rose to
3 percent of GDP, leading to a sharp increase in reserves (Figure 3).

4.
Fiscal performance strengthened in 2007, reflecting mainly a lower non-mineral
deficit (Figure 4).
•

The central government posted an overall surplus of 3 percent of GDP. Driven mainly
by higher excise taxes (which doubled for tobacco and alcoholic drinks in June) and
improvements in income tax administration, revenue increased sharply, while
expenditure growth was kept under control.

•

Public debt declined to 21 percent of GDP, aided by a large pre-payment to the
Netherlands (4 percent of GDP). Progress has been made on the clearance of external
arrears, but these remain large at 5½ percent of GDP. The authorities have contacted
creditors to settle these arrears, which are mainly to Brazil (71 Percent) and the
United States (22 Percent). Standard and Poor’s has raised Suriname’s rating from B
to B+, citing improved fiscal discipline and arrears clearance.

5.
Bank credit grew by 35 percent over the last year. This large liquidity increase
resulted from incomplete sterilization of reserve accumulation (base money grew by
30 percent) and a reduction in reserve requirements on domestic-currency deposits in early
2007. The latter were lowered by 3 percentage points in effective terms to 15 percent.
Nominal lending rates fell by 2½ percentage points in the last year. Credit to the private
sector is now well above trend, suggesting the presence of a credit boom (Figure 5).

1/ Credit is the deposit-taking institutions' claims on the nonbank private sector. Staff used one of the
approaches employed in the Western Hemisphere Regional Economic Outlook of November 2007 to
identify credit booms. This specifies thresholds for the difference between actual and trend credit relative to
GDP for a credit growth episode to qualify as a boom. The trend is obtained by fitting an HP filter for each
country. For Suriname, the approach suggests the presence of a credit boom in 2007.

Financial soundness indicators have generally strengthened, but there is room
for further improvement (Figure 6). Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have been falling but
remain high, owing mainly to problems in state-owned banks (with an NPL ratio of onequarter). Capital adequacy ratios declined in 2007, but on average are above minimum
requirements—except for state-owned banks. Dollarization ratios remain high.

Progress has been made on structural reforms, but much remains to be done.
The domestic telecommunications sector was opened to private investors in 2007, with two
foreign companies entering the market. An agricultural company is being liquidated, while
another one has been put under private management with a foreign company. However, there
are a large number of inefficient public enterprises that hinder the development of the private
sector and whose operations are weakly monitored. A comprehensive civil service reform,
needed to increase public sector efficiency and reduce a large wage bill, is still outstanding.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Given the elevated WEO commodity price baseline, growth is projected to
accelerate in 2008 and remain high for some time. Higher commodity prices and an
expansionary macroeconomic policy stance would raise GDP growth to 7 percent this year.
The authorities’ target of a broadly balanced budget would imply a large fiscal stimulus,
while their objective of substantial reserve accumulation will result in continued strong
monetary growth if not fully sterilized. Moreover, abundant liquidity and reduction (in
January) of the T-bill rate (from 8 to 7½ percent) are expected to lead to further declines in
lending rates. GDP growth is projected to ease over the medium term, in line with WEO’s
projected overall decline in commodity prices and staff estimates of potential growth.
9.
Inflation is projected to continue rising in 2008 and to decline only slowly over
the medium term. The central bank is targeting inflation below double digits in 2008. The
macroeconomic policy stance and an unchanged de facto peg to the U.S. dollar would,
however, complicate achieving the inflation objective (Box 1). Staff projects a positive
output gap of 1–2 percent in 2008, and average inflation of 11¼ percent, compared to
6½ percent in 2007. This assumes that inflation expectations do not ratchet up and that,
consistent with the current WEO baseline, food and fuel inflation declines in late 2008.
Provided that economic growth moderates and imported inflation falls over the medium term,
headline inflation would ease to an average of 7 percent in 2009–13.

Box 1. Commodity Booms, Credit Growth and Inflation—A Comparison
The experience of several countries undergoing large commodity booms points to some common
macroeconomic features. Absent well-developed financial systems, these countries have found it difficult to
fully sterilize large increases in reserves, with rapid monetary growth fueling inflationary pressures. Exchange
rate policy has also contributed to a rise in inflation.
•

Azerbaijan. The central bank undertook large unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange to limit
exchange rate appreciation. The strong increases in base money led to credit growth exceeding 80 percent
and inflation accelerating from 3½ in 2003 to double digits in 2006. In 2007, the monetary and exchange
rate policy response to the continued fiscal expansion was less than expected. In the face of a large one-off
increase in energy and fuel prices and higher import prices, this contributed to inflation reaching about 20
percent by year-end.

•

Bolivia. The modest appreciation of the currency under the crawling peg regime led to strong growth in
broad money. While Bolivia’s financial system liquidity has not affected growth of private sector credit,
fiscal policy has fueled rapid demand growth, with an expansionary stance in 2007–08. This policy mix
resulted in raising inflation, which reached 14 percent in March 2008.

•

Trinidad and Tobago. Large increases in reserves under the de facto peg regime resulted in strong credit
growth. Inflation, which was only 3 percent in 2003, rose to 9 percent in 2006. In response, the authorities
raised repo rates, stepped up open market operations, and foreign exchange sales, while more long-term
bonds were placed domestically to mop up liquidity.

Suriname seems to be on a path to a similar dynamics. Increased reserve accumulation has led to high
money supply growth and –combined with an expansionary monetary policy—has resulted in a credit boom.
This, together with an unchanged peg, is contributing to rising inflation.

Public debt is projected to decline slightly over the medium term. Gross public
debt would remain broadly unchanged in 2008 in light of large loan disbursements for
infrastructure projects. Over the medium term, declining commodity prices and increases in
capital spending will turn the current primary surplus into a deficit. Even so, debt would stay
slightly under 20 percent of GDP, leaving fiscal space to cushion future shocks (Table A1).
Debt could decline further if the authorities’ plans to settle external arrears materialize.

11.
The outlook is subject to several risks. So far, the slowdown in world growth and
stress in financial markets have had little impact on Suriname, mainly because the turmoil
has been accompanied by high commodity prices and because the country relies mainly on
FDI for external financing. However, a more pronounced slowdown and/or a worsening of
the terms of trade may dampen domestic growth, while significantly weakening the external
sector and the public finances. For example, staff estimates that a one standard deviation
(16 percent) decline in commodity prices would worsen the current account by some
3 percent of GDP and the overall fiscal balance by about 1 percent of GDP. Political
pressures for additional spending are likely to increase ahead of the 2010 presidential
elections. At the same time, a sharp deterioration in inflation expectations would lead to
higher inflation than projected. On the upside, investment projects in the mining sector could
be larger than assumed over the medium term, boosting GDP growth and the public finances.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.

The discussions focused on four interrelated areas:

•

An assessment of external stability, and the current level of the real effective
exchange rate;

•

Policies for maintaining external and domestic stability, including the appropriate mix
of monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policy to deal with inflation pressures;

•

An assessment of financial sector risks and policy responses; and

•

Strengthening the medium-term policy framework to increase resilience to shocks.

14
External stability and exchange rate policy
13.
The staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is slightly undervalued
(Box 2). A forward-looking assessment that considers the need to accumulate savings to
sustain the current account after mineral resources are exhausted suggests that the underlying
current account position is sustainable. PPP-based estimates suggest that the Suriname dollar
is somewhat below its expected value. Indeed, the real effective exchange rate has remained
broadly constant since 2005, despite the significant improvement in the terms of trade.
14.
The de jure managed float has in practice hardened into a de facto peg to the
U.S. dollar. With the global weakening of the dollar, the nominal effective exchange rate has
depreciated, exacerbating inflation pressures. The upward trend in inflation could become
entrenched in expectations, which would be a risk for a country with a history of high
inflation. Therefore, consideration could be given to utilizing the flexibility allowed by the de
jure managed float to help deal with these pressures.
15.
As Suriname’s financial system develops and institutions and the policy
framework strengthen, a more flexible regime would be more appropriate to adjust to
shocks. The authorities concurred with this assessment. Staff noted, however, that tighter
monetary and fiscal policies would be needed to support the current de facto peg. The
mission advised unifying the current dual exchange rate system, which gives rise to a
multiple currency practice (Appendix I).
Preserving domestic and external stability
16.
Staff advised tightening credit policy to lower inflation and to reduce potential
risks to asset quality in the banking system. Instruments to manage liquidity are limited
and the authorities have tended to rely on reserves requirements and moral suasion.1 As a
preferred approach, staff proposed issuance of treasury or central bank bills to withdraw
liquidity. In the near term, this would consist mainly of direct placements, with auctions
introduced gradually over time. A second-best option would be to lower the proportion of
reserves that banks are allowed to use low-cost mortgages. Staff also suggested phasing out
this facility over time and channel the subsidy through the budget. To avoid providing
additional incentives for dollarization, the mission proposed two alternative options:
(i) leveling the playing field for both types of deposits; or (ii) raising pari pasu reserves
requirements on foreign-currency deposits. The authorities were not prepared to take
measures to curtail credit growth at this stage. They were of the view that the rise in core
inflation reflected mainly spillovers from global supply shocks. They also said that asset
quality had not deteriorated so far.

1

Suriname has higher reserve requirements on foreign-currency (one-third) than on domestic-currency deposits
(one-fourth) in order to discourage dollarization. Foreign-currency reserves can be kept abroad in interestbearing accounts in correspondent banks, while domestic-currency reserves are unremunerated and kept at the
central bank. However, banks are allowed to use up to 10 percentage points of reserves on domestic currency
for low-cost housing.

15
Box 2. Assessments of the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate and Current Account
The real effective exchange rate has been broadly stable since 2005. The de facto peg to the U.S. dollar
has resulted in a depreciation of the nominal effective rate, which has offset the inflation differential
between Suriname and its trading partners.

PPP-based estimates point in the same direction.
The exchange rate is somewhat below its expected
value (by about 10 percent) in a sample of over 150
countries. Suriname’s lack of a sufficiently long
series for an adequate set of economic
fundamentals precludes an analysis based on a
single country model of the real exchange rate.
Using CGERs’ estimates (which are primarily
based on a sample of non-mineral producers) to
implement the macrobalance approach would be
inappropriate.

Domestic price level relative to U.S. prices

The external sustainability approach suggests that the exchange rate is slightly below its equilibrium
level. In light of the large weight of mineral exports, staff adapted the external sustainability approach to
consider the non-renewable nature of Surname’s mineral resources. The approach uses estimates of
reserves of bauxite, gold and oil, and

expansion of tourism.

16
17.
Staff recommended tightening fiscal policy in 2008 to rein in domestic demand
growth. The mission indicated that a tighter fiscal policy would help contain monetary
growth and lower the burden on monetary policy for demand management. It advised an
overall surplus of 2–3 percent of GDP. A surplus of 3 percent of GDP would imply an
underlying fiscal stance (measured through the non-mineral balance) stronger by close to 1
percent of GDP than in 2007. The authorities thought that it would be very difficult to
achieve such a target, given strong pressures and initiatives being proposed for large wage
increases and lower taxes. They stressed that they were against such initiatives, which risk a
permanent deterioration of the public finances. The mission shared these concerns and
emphasized the need to protect revenues; it also suggested caution with a proposed jobregrading scheme and new salary structure, and recommended keeping the wage bill broadly
in line with the budget. Staff agreed with the authorities that the latter would also contribute
to keeping inflation expectations under control. The mission also recommended a more
modest expansion of capital spending and saving any revenue overperformance, which likely
would be ½–¾ percent of GDP.

18.
Staff recommended a constant non-mineral balance over the medium term to
help eliminate excess demand pressures. This should be accompanied by a better
composition of public spending to support growth. The mission recommended reducing
unproductive current spending (such as untargeted subsidies for electricity) to create room
for higher priority spending (such as capital outlays that target known bottlenecks in
infrastructure).
Strengthening the financial sector
19.
Staff pointed to several risks in the financial sector, which the authorities viewed
as manageable.
State-owned banks. While recognizing that financial indicators of state-owned banks are
weak, the authorities said that they are improving and that these institutions do not benefit
from public resources. They indicated that they have been gradually reducing regulatory
forbearance towards them, especially on reserves requirements.

17
Nonperforming loans. Staff indicated that while private banks’ NPLs are significantly lower
than those of state banks, they are high (6 percent of gross loans) by international standards,
and provisions are low. While recognizing this, the authorities explained that NPLs are
declining, bank lending in Suriname is backed by strong collateral, and foreclosure
procedures are effective. They thus saw few risks from current NPL levels.
Financial dollarization. The mission stressed the importance of maintaining tight demand
management policies to continue lowering inflation and strengthening credibility to reduce
dollarization. It also recommended eliminating incentives to dollarization by leveling the
playing field for financial transactions in domestic and foreign currency.2 Staff proposed
adopting prudential regulations to limit banks’ net open foreign exchange positions and to
deal with risks from currency mismatches in the balance sheets of borrowers. (Banks can
lend to borrowers that do not have foreign-currency earnings and it is estimated that about
40 percent of foreign-currency loans are made to such borrowers).
Structural reforms
20.
The mission supported several tax reform initiatives planned for 2008. These
include (i) measures to improve customs administration; (ii) income tax reform aimed at
modernizing and simplifying the regime and reducing administration costs; (iii) a new
investment law that would, inter alia, reduce exemptions on import duties. The authorities
agreed it is important to ensure that the income tax reform is revenue-neutral. Staff advised
caution on a separate initiative seeking to raise the wage tax threshold, and recommended a
thorough assessment of its fiscal cost and offsetting measures to protect revenue. The
authorities indicated that any revenue losses were expected to be offset by continued
improvement in income tax administration.
21.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ interest in establishing a medium-term
fiscal framework (MTFF) and encouraged them to move as fast as feasible on this front.
•

Staff proposed that fiscal discipline over the medium term be anchored on a debt
target of no more than 20–25 percent of GDP when revenues are at trend. This would
allow some room for debt to temporarily rise when commodity revenues were
unusually low, without threatening sustainability. The authorities found this ceiling
somewhat restrictive, and preferred a ceiling of some 30 percent.

•

Staff indicated that an MTFF should also include a target for the non-mineral balance.
The authorities explained that setting a formal target for this would require changing
legislation, which could take time. They will consider the staff’s recommendation to

2

During 2007, the combination of existing reserves requirements and interest rates appeared to provide banks
an incentive to fund themselves with dollar deposits. At the same time, given the interest rate differential
between loans in U.S. dollars and loans in Suriname dollars, and the flatness of the exchange rate, it was
cheaper for borrowers to contract loans in U.S. dollars.

18
present a measure of the non-mineral balance in budget documents (perhaps in an
appendix). Staff also indicated that it would be advisable to supplement the MTFF by
a ceiling on expenditure growth, especially since the debt ceiling is non-binding and
formal adoption of a target for the non-mineral balance may take time.
•

A well-managed natural resource fund (NRF) could help safeguard surpluses and
accumulate financial assets as future mining projects come on stream. Staff stressed
that an NRF should be fully integrated into the budget, with no independent spending
authority. The authorities agreed that, since new large mining projects are not
expected to come on stream in the near term, priority should be given to establishing
an MTFF. Staff also pointed to the need to settle external arrears before starting asset
accumulation in an NRF, and supported plans to normalize relations with creditors.

22.
The mission urged better assessment of fiscal risks. Available public debt statistics
cover only debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government. In addition, some stateowned enterprises are legally allowed to borrow without government guarantee, and
reporting on their operations is incomplete. The mission recommended improving monitoring
mechanisms and reporting their operations in budget documents. The authorities noted that
cases of public enterprises borrowing with no government guarantee had been very rare, and
that for external loans, creditors consistently asked for a government guarantee even for
financially sound enterprises. They explained that a ministry of finance unit was already
charged with monitoring public enterprises, although they were not yet in a position to
comprehensively report these entities’ operations in budget documents.
23.
The mission encouraged the authorities to continue moving forward with the
privatization of state-owned enterprises and civil service reform. The authorities
indicated that plans to privatize the banana company are moving forward. This may take
place in 2008. Another agricultural company that has been dependent on budget support is
being liquidated. Staff also pointed to the need for a civil service reform to increase public
sector efficiency and reduce the large wage bill. This would also help free up resources for
more productive uses (e.g., social spending and basic infrastructure). The authorities said that
there are currently no plans for a civil service reform beyond the job regrading scheme and
new wage structure under discussion, although a more comprehensive reform may be
considered in coming years. They were of the view that Suriname’s wage bill is broadly
comparable to similarly-sized Caribbean countries.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Supported by favorable terms of trade and improved economic policies,
economic performance has improved in recent years. Economic growth has risen,
inflation has fallen and international reserves have strengthened. Public debt has declined
sharply, and financial supervision has improved.

19
25.
However, the global commodity boom, combined with a rigid peg and an
expansionary macroeconomic policy stance, are contributing to rising inflation. An
unchanged de facto peg would lead to continued depreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate in 2008. Monetary growth is set to remain strong, as the central bank continues
to accumulate reserve and interest rates keep declining. At 35 percent, credit growth is too
high, even if it is from a relatively low base. It also increases the risk of a high incidence of
nonperforming loans. A large fiscal expansion would also contribute to excess demand
pressures. Against this background, inflation is projected to rise in 2008 and remain high
over the medium term, even if global supply shocks subside.
26.
With the real effective rate unchanged since 2005, despite a large improvement
in the terms of trade, staff estimates point to a slight undervaluation of the Suriname
dollar. The current de facto peg does not preclude adjustment of the exchange rate, and
indeed the de jure managed float regime envisages such adjustment when necessary. Over
the longer term, as institutions develop and the policy framework strengthens, the de facto
exchange rate system should give way to a more flexible regime to better respond to shocks.
Staff does not recommend approval of the multiple currency practices, since there is no
timetable for their removal.
27.
More restrictive macroeconomic policies would help reduce inflation and lower
financial sector risks. Issuance of treasury or central bank bills or higher reserves
requirements would help lower credit growth to more sustainable rates. Staff considers that
the fiscal stance for 2008 should be significantly tighter than currently envisaged.
28.
Setting up a sound medium-term fiscal framework would help strengthen fiscal
discipline and should be a priority. The key components of such a framework would be a
low debt ceiling to provide an adequate cushion for external shocks, and a target on the nonmineral balance consistent with macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. These two
anchors would help ensure that fiscal policy avoids procyclicality in the short run and is
sustainable over the long run. A well-designed natural resource fund could help protect
surpluses and accumulate financial assets once new mining projects come on stream and
external arrears have been settled. Progress made in the last year on clearing arrears is
welcome and should be followed up with resolving remaining arrears.
29.
There is scope for further strengthening the financial system. State-owned banks
continue to have weak indicators and could give rise to fiscal liabilities, while private banks’
NPLs remain high. While slowly declining, financial dollarization is high and there is a need
to eliminate policy-related incentives to it. Maintaining sound demand management policies
would strengthen credibility and help lower dollarization over time. There is room to reduce
risk from dollarization by introducing prudential regulations to limit banks’ foreign exchange
open positions and protect against the risk of currency mismatches.

20
30.
Ongoing efforts toward tax reform are welcomed, including improved customs
administration and modernizing income tax and investment legislation. Staff emphasizes that
modifications to the income tax law should be revenue-neutral. It advises caution with a
separate initiative seeking to adjust the wage tax threshold and a thorough assessment of its
revenue impact before committing to it.
31.
Better monitoring of public enterprises is needed to reduce fiscal risks. Existing
monitoring mechanisms and legal provisions need strengthening to ensure regular and timely
reporting. There is also a need to modify the current legal framework that allows public
enterprise to borrow without a formal government guarantee. The coverage of debt statistics
needs to be broadened to include non-government guaranteed public debt. Staff supports
steps to privatize state-owned companies in the agricultural sector, and encourages the
authorities to extend these efforts to other areas, including the financial sector.
32.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be held
on the 12-month cycle.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation

APPENDIX I. SUMMARY OF INFORMATIONAL ANNEXES
Discussions: The 2008 Art. IV consultation discussions were held in Paramaribo during March
27–April 4. The mission met with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Humphrey Hildenberg; the
Governor of the Central Bank of Suriname, André E. Telting; the Minister of Natural Resources,
Mr. Gregory Rusland; the Minister of Planning, Mr. Ricardo van Ravenswaay; the Minister of
Trade and Industry, Mr. Clifford Marica; senior staff of several government ministries and
agencies; representatives of the private sector; a major labor union; and a political analyst. The
staff team comprised L. Abrego (Head), P. Dyczewski and E. Flores (all WHD). Ms. Florestal
(OED) joined most meetings.

Fund Relations and Exchange Arrangements
The last Article IV consultation with Suriname was on March 21, 2007 (IMF Country Report
No. 07/87). The country has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Suriname has a dual exchange rate regime, comprising an official and a commercial market.
The official rate (SRD 2.75 per U.S. dollar) is used for government debt service and tax
payments by mineral companies. The commercial rate is used for all other transactions,
comprising over 80 percent of the market. Suriname has two multiple currency practices—
one arising from the potential for the spread between the official and the commercial rate to
exceed 2 percent, and one from the existence of a special rate for imports of baby milk.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank Group
The IDB is the major multilateral lender operating in Suriname at this time. As of February
2008, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$56 million. Bank strategy in
Suriname is outlined in the Suriname Country Strategy. The current version was approved in
2007. The main thrust of the IDB strategy has been to support policy and institutional
reforms as the basis for promoting private-sector led-growth. In addition, this approach has
been followed with the help of an active Technical Cooperation program.
Recent World Bank involvement in Suriname has been limited. The last activity consisted of
setting up an Investment Promotion Agency in October 2004.
Statistical Issues
Except for monetary data, the statistical information provided by Suriname has been
generally inadequate for surveillance purposes. Although the quality and timeliness of
economic statistics has been improving in recent years, there is still no breakdown of the
national accounts from the expenditure side, while data on external services and private
capital inflows are subject to significant shortcomings.

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities

Exchange rate arrangements
The national currency is the Suriname dollar (SRD), which replaced the Suriname guilder in
January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD. Suriname has a dual exchange
rate regime, comprising an official and a commercial rate. The official rate of SRD 2.75 per
U.S. dollar is used by the central bank for government external debt service and financing
and for tax and royalty payments (in the case of the state oil company also dividend

3

payments) by mineral sector companies. Over 80 percent of transactions take place at the
commercial rate. In June 2004, the central bank removed the ceiling and the floor on this
rate, which had previously been set at SRD 2.8 and 2.6 per U.S. dollar respectively. Since
then, the commercial rate has traded between SRD 2.85 and 2.71 per U.S. dollar. Over the
last year, the differential between official and commercial rate has been well under 2 percent.
There is also a special rate of SRD 1.4 per U.S. dollar, used for imports of baby milk powder.
Last Article IV consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 21, 2007
(IMF Country Report No. 07/87). Suriname is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

ANNEX II: SURINAME: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
AND THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. Inter-American Development Bank
Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1980. Since then, the IDB
has approved 16 loans to Suriname amounting to US$108.6 million and 100 technical
cooperation operations totaling US$29.7 million.
The IDB is the major multilateral lender operating in Suriname at this time. The other main
sources of financing for public sector investment are The Netherlands and the European
Union. As of February 2008, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at
US$53.2 million, mostly on Intermediate Fund Financing (IFF) terms.
Bank strategy in Suriname is outlined in the Suriname Country Strategy 2006-2010. The
current version was approved in 2007 and is founded on three equally important pillars—
development of the public sector, development of the private sector, and integration of the
interior. The first two pillars consolidate the thrust of the former Country Strategy (2000 to
2005) by continuing to target weaknesses in the policy and institutional framework that
constrain Suriname’s development, and thereby promote private-sector-led-growth. The third
pillar focuses on integrating the indigenous and maroon communities living in the interior of
Suriname more fully into national development and raising their living standards.
Structural reform projects
Public sector. In June 2004, the IDB approved a US$5 million loan to Suriname to support
the strengthening of public sector management, which is considered a critical element of
institutional reform in the country, given the large size and importance of the public sector.
The loan is complemented by TC (technical cooperation) to elaborate a road map, which will
help to guide implementation of the public sector reform project.
Banking system. The authorities have utilized IDB financing to develop a reform and
rationalization of the state banks. To this end, the IDB approved in May 2003 a technical
cooperation project (Financial Sector Strengthening and Rationalization—US$500,000) that
supported a financial evaluation of the state banks and identification of reform options. The
options open to the government have been presented to the Council of Ministers for
consideration. It is not clear exactly when a decision will be taken. If authorities decide to
pursue a reform strategy consistent with sound financial and public policy criteria, the Bank
has indicated its willingness to finance the development of a detailed implementation plan.

5

Financial relations (as of end February 2008)
At present, 8 loan projects are in execution amounting to US$55.6 million in IDB
contribution and 34 technical cooperation projects in execution with total IDB contributions
of US$11.9 million. The undisbursed portion of the loan portfolio in execution is entirely on
OC terms with IFF subsidy.

ANNEX III. SURINAME: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Overview
Data provided to the Fund can generally be considered inadequate for surveillance purposes.
While the quality and timeliness of economic statistics have improved somewhat over the
past two years, there are still significant shortcomings in the areas of the expenditure
breakdown of national accounts, informal sector activity, and data on external services and
private capital inflows. These inadequacies hinder staff’s analysis and hamper the
development of a reliable quantitative medium-term policy framework. In particular,
•

Real sector. Deficiencies in data collection and presentation methodologies and long
delays in the provision of source data for main economic activities affect GDP estimates
from the production side. As an expenditure breakdown of national accounts is
unavailable, the estimate of saving and investment balances relies largely on fiscal
accounts and balance of payments data, rendering problematic the estimation of private
savings and investment. The authorities, in consultation with the CARTAC are currently
devising a plan to update the national accounts’ base year (dating from 1990).

•

Fiscal sector. A substantial amount of additional information on government finance
statistics is needed to derive an accurate and timely picture of the fiscal position from
above the line. The coverage of debt statistics needs to be broadened to include nongovernment guaranteed public debt.

•

External sector. While trade data are relatively reliable, data on services and private
capital inflows suffer from poor compilation systems. Estimates of the components of the
financial account (especially, private external debt) also need to be strengthened.

In general, institutional arrangements need to be strengthened to facilitate improved reporting
as well as collaboration between the Central Bank (CBvS), the Bureau of Statistics (BoS), the
Ministry of Finance (MoF), the Ministry of Planning (MoP) and the Debt Management
Office, and to avoid duplication of data production efforts and some inconsistencies across
institutions. Suriname participates in the GDDS since June 2004. However, information on
statistical practices and plans for improvement (metadata) need to be updated.
To address some of the weaknesses in the production of sectoral GDP data, the BoS has
initiated a census of economic activities, including in its coverage tourism, financial
businesses, and transport and communications. Also, the MoP (in charge of GDP projections)
has aligned its methodologies to the one used by BoS.
Real sector
Some efforts have been made to improve the GDP data from the production side. The
constant price series were rebased to 1990 and sectoral estimates are now based on indicators
which still suffer from poor response rates to questionnaires and exclude informal sector

7

activities. Also, a lack of timely, reliable source data on price indices for tourism services,
transportation and communication adversely affects production-based GDP estimates in
nominal terms. There are no national accounts by expenditure, while consistency of labor
statistics could be improved. There is also no reconciliation between the national accounts
and the balance of payments data. The development of a supply and use table would lead to
better estimates for all sectors of the economy.
The methodology used to compile the consumer price index (CPI) is sound. The production
and dissemination of the consumer price index (CPI) was disrupted by the temporary
cessation of work by the BoS in June 2003–March 2004 due to a fire. As a result, there are
no CPI data for that period.
Fiscal sector
The only public finance statistics available are those for the central government. With respect
to revenue, data are collected on a cash basis by the Inland Revenue Department and the
Non-tax Revenue Division. There is a Central Paymaster Department that also provides
revenue and expenditure data on a cash basis, which are used by the CBvS to furnish a
statement of central government operations (produced daily, weekly, and monthly) and these,
in turn, are the basis for the liquidity report on revenue and expenditure prepared by the MoF.
Some capital expenditure items are recorded by the Central Paymaster, but the majority
seems to be recorded only at the ministerial level. As there are also no centralized records for
receipts of external grants, capital expenditure has to be inferred from partial donor
information.
As the estimates for revenue and expenditure components can differ significantly among the
MoF, the Treasury Department, the CBvS, and the Central Paymaster data, the authorities
have been streamlining the system of fiscal reporting, improving the reconciliation process
and standardizing the reporting format. There is a pressing need for standardization of
expenditure by economic classification and more coordination between the MoF and other
ministries, as well as between the MoF and the CBvS. Available public debt statistics cover
only debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government. Since 1986, no data on central
government operations have been published in the IFS, and no data are reported for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
For the rest of the public sector, the collection of comprehensive and consistent financial data
remains a challenge. The Netherlands has recently provided technical assistance in this area.
The actual number of public enterprises remains unknown, and is estimated to amount to 120
companies, but some are dormant, others are social associations and many of them are small
enterprises. Most of these enterprises do not produce accounts on a timely basis and their
impact on fiscal operations, domestic credit and employment is not known with any
certainty.

8

Financial sector
STA missions visited Suriname in September 2001 and February 2005 to help in the design
of new report forms to allow a proper sectorization of the accounts. The quality and
periodicity of the reported data has improved significantly as a result of these missions and
the time-lag was reduced to two months. Suriname migrated to the new standardized report
forms (SRFs) early in 2006, and its data are being published in the quarterly IFS Supplement
since its first issue in September 2006.
External sector
In October 2002, a STA technical assistance mission assessed progress in improving
compilation consistent with the Balance of Payments Manual Fifth Edition (BMP5), and
designing new survey and reporting formats for detailed BPM5 classifications. A GDDS
mission in March 2004 found that little progress had been made in implementing the
recommendations, although a proposed revision to the CBvS Act on compulsory reporting of
statistical information to the CBvS was approved by Parliament on May 20, 2005.
The balance of payments data are prepared on a cash basis. While trade data are relatively
reliable, data on services and capital inflows suffer from poor compilation systems and poor
procedures of reconciliation, which result in a substantial errors and omissions item. For
example, STA missions have assessed the method for recording FDI as incorrect. The scope,
classification, and basis for recording FDI could be made more transparent and better aligned
with current international methodologies.
Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data from the BoS limit the timeliness of
quarterly estimates of the external current account balance produced by the CBvS. As a
result, the CBvS uses data from the banking system on firms’ foreign exchange contracts,
which differ from the Customs Union data used by BoS. There is thus a risk of data
inconsistencies. Also, there are some discrepancies between the data reported by the CBvS
and those reported by the DMO for gross external disbursements and amortization of the
central government. The CBvS should expand its current debt reporting system to include
comprehensive coverage of external loans, including for the private sector.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 26, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Suriname
On June 2, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Suriname. 1
Background
Aided by strong commodity prices and improvements in policies, macroeconomic
performance has strengthened markedly in recent years. The terms of trade have improved
by about 30 percent in 2005-07, implying an increase in real income of over 10 percent.
Supported by this favorable environment, improved policies—strengthening of the nonmineral balance, bolstering central bank independence, and reduction of foreign exchange
market fragmentation—have contributed to higher growth, lower inflation, large
accumulation of international reserve, and a sharp decline in public debt as a ratio to GDP.
Macroeconomic performance was strong in 2007, but inflation has risen to double digits.
GDP grew by an estimated 5½ percent, with strong performance in both the mineral and
non-mineral sectors. The external account surplus was about 3 percent of GDP, and
international reserves rose by over 60 percent. Twelve-month inflation more than trebled to
13.8 percent in March 2008, driven mainly by large increases in food and fuels prices.
However, non-tradables goods inflation has also picked up significantly since November.
Tradable goods inflation excluding food and fuel has also been rising rapidly, as the nominal
effective exchange rate has depreciated.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Fiscal performance strengthened in 2007, reflecting mainly a lower non-mineral deficit, with
the central government posting an overall surplus of 3 percent of GDP. Driven mainly by
higher excise taxes and improvements in income tax administration, revenue increased
sharply, while expenditure growth was kept under control. Public debt declined to 21
percent of GDP, aided also by a large pre-payment to the Netherlands. The authorities also
made progress on the clearance of external arrears.
In the financial sector, bank credit grew by 35 percent over the last year. This large liquidity
increase resulted from incomplete sterilization of international reserve accumulation and a
reduction in reserve requirements adopted in early 2007. Nominal lending rates declined by
2½ percentage points in the last year. Financial soundness indicators have generally
strengthened, although nonperforming loans remain high, especially at state-owned banks.
Financial dollarization is also high, with over half of deposits in foreign currency.
GDP growth is projected to accelerate to about 7 percent in 2008, led by rapid expansion of
domestic demand. This is expected to contribute to higher inflation, which is projected to
close the year at 10 percent. Stronger commodity prices would result in an increase in the
current account surplus to about 3¾ percent of GDP. The central government balance is
projected to weaken compared to 2007, mainly reflecting large increases in capital
spending. Public debt would continue to decline, but only marginally.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in economic policies in recent years which,
supported by a favorable external environment, has contributed to higher economic growth
and lower inflation, a sizeable buildup of international reserves, a decline in public debt, and
improved bank supervision.
Directors stressed, however, that inflation has become a growing challenge. While
substantial increases in world food and fuel prices have clearly contributed to inflation,
domestic demand growth has also played a role, spurred by the substantial improvement in
Suriname’s terms of trade and an expansionary macroeconomic policy stance. In particular,
given the de facto exchange rate peg, external inflows are fuelling rapid money and credit
growth, and the envisaged fiscal loosening in 2008 will add further stimulus.
Against this background, Directors called on the authorities to tighten macroeconomic
policies. They recommended the issuance of treasury or central bank bills, or raising
reserve requirements, to bring credit growth to more sustainable levels. A significantly
tighter fiscal stance is needed in 2008 to help rein in domestic demand growth.
Many Directors saw exchange rate stability as advantageous for Suriname at this stage,
and favored keeping the de facto peg, both to anchor expectations and to safeguard the
competitiveness of the non-mineral sector. A few Directors noted that the exchange rate is
somewhat undervalued. Looking ahead, Directors broadly agreed that, as policies
strengthen and institutions develop over time, greater exchange rate flexibility would be
appropriate, and would enable the economy to better weather adverse shocks. Directors

3
called on the authorities to unify the current dual exchange rate system, which gives rise to
a multiple currency practice.
Directors emphasized that a sound medium-term fiscal framework will be central to
Suriname’s economic prospects. Setting a more prudent debt ceiling and an appropriate
target for the non-mineral fiscal balance would help ensure that fiscal policy avoids
procyclicality and remains sustainable over the long run. Directors recommended
strengthening the monitoring of public enterprise operations to lower fiscal risks, and
broadening the coverage of public debt statistics to include debt that is not contracted or
guaranteed by the central government. They welcomed the continued progress being made
in reducing external arrears, and encouraged the authorities to follow through with efforts to
fully normalize relations with all creditors.
Directors welcomed ongoing reform efforts in customs administration and income tax and
investment legislation. They emphasized the need for income tax reform to be revenueneutral.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the financial system. Very rapid
credit growth risks increasing the nonperforming loan rate. Directors recommended
continuing efforts to reduce financial dollarization, and encouraged the authorities to lower
the associated risks by adopting prudential regulations to limit banks’ foreign exchange net
open positions and deal with potential currency mismatches.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Suriname
and Ketleen Florestal, Advisor to Executive Director
June 2, 2008

1.
In 2007, prudent macroeconomic management and high commodity prices led to
strong GDP growth, a strengthened external position and an important decrease in
Suriname’s debt to GDP ratio. Performance was strong in both the mineral and non-mineral
sector as evidenced by a significantly lower non-mineral fiscal deficit and the important
contribution of agriculture and tourism to growth. At the level of the external sector, the
current account surplus rose to 2.9 percent of GDP and official reserves strengthened from
two to about three months of imports. The important rise in oil and food prices largely
accounted for the rise in inflation from under 5 percent in 2006 to over 8 percent in 2007.
2.
This global price shock and associated cost-push factors may exacerbate the impact
on inflation of demand pressures in a booming economy in 2008. Nevertheless, our
Surinamese authorities do not see the need to tighten credit conditions as yet. They
acknowledge that the recent rise in private sector credit must have contributed to rising
inflationary pressures and that several investment projects (in mining and infrastructure) are
on the verge of being implemented. Moreover, our authorities anticipate possible pressures in
the labor market given the potential rise in demand for specialized and skilled labor in certain
growing sectors both in Suriname and in neighboring countries. Even so, they believe that the
dominant factors behind the inflationary pressures are the global increases in the prices of
basic food stuffs and petroleum products. It should be noted also that the aforementioned
investment projects rely primarily on imported inputs and thus may have little impact on
domestic demand. The timely implementation of these projects remains crucial for achieving
growth objectives.
3.
Our Surinamese authorities are committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability
and most particularly safeguarding the positive fiscal performance, notwithstanding
mounting pressures to loosen fiscal policy as a response to the population’s diminishing
purchasing power with the rise in basic commodity prices. The upcoming Parliamentary
elections (2010) may be an additional source of pressure, which will have to be withstood.
One of the key challenges the authorities face is indeed that of addressing the pressing and
growing social demands without forsaking fiscal sustainability. These demands include an
increase in the old age allowance, a considerable increase in public wages and a decrease in
the taxation of fuel. Also, in order to lessen the impact of the global price increases of basic
goods on the domestic market and, in conformity with Caricom’s recent ruling on the partial
and temporary suspension of the Common External Tariff (CET), tariffs on forty eight goods
have been reduced. The inclusion of goods in the suspension list was based on two concerns:
the potential impact on the CPI and the potential impact on fiscal revenues.
4.
The authorities welcome staff’s suggestion to set a formal medium run target for the
non-mineral balance when elaborating the national budget in order to preserve fiscal
sustainability. They wish to stress that no concessions will be made that jeopardize fiscal

2

sustainability. They are also appreciative of the information Fund staff has shared on best
practices relative to the management of a Natural Resource Funds (NRF). We take this
opportunity, on behalf of our Surinamese authorities, to thank Fund management and staff
for the conference that was delivered on the topic during the mission. One may want to recall
that Fund’s technical support in this field was formally requested on the occasion of last
year’s Article IV Board Discussion. The idea of creating a NRF is welcomed by most social
and political forces in Suriname. Nevertheless, given that ex ante several key decisions need
to be taken, a Natural Resource Fund can only be realistically projected to be put in place in
the medium run. These key decisions include defining the objectives of the NRF, i.e.,
whether the main goal of setting up such a fund would be saving for future generations or
stabilizing fiscal revenues or both. Also, the choice on how and where the resources of the
fund will be invested is as crucial.
5.
Another key element of the medium-term fiscal framework is debt sustainability.
Substantial efforts have been made in recent years to decrease the stock of public debt which
has successfully been held in recent years well below the established ceiling of 60 percent of
GDP. In 2007, the debt to GDP ratio has been held below 25 percent and the authorities
agree with staff on the necessity of setting a much lower target than the existing 60 percent
ceiling. However, given the investment needs of the country and potential economic
downturns in the future, the authorities would want to leave themselves some room for
maneuvering and do not wish to consider setting a target ceiling below 30 percent.
Concurrently, our Surinamese authorities are committed to decreasing the existing stock of
arrears even further by continuing to pursue efforts to reach a suitable agreement on the
remaining arrears with Brazil and the United States. Suriname has presented an outline to
Brazil on how it proposes to address the issue of restructuring its debt and is now awaiting
negotiations with the Brazilian government. As regards the debt with the United States, a
deadlock has emerged on the issue of accumulated penalties. Suriname has proposed a bullet
payment for principal and interest. But the parties remain divided on how to treat penalties on
delayed payments.
6.
In the financial sector, reforms of the state-owned banks have borne fruit and helped
strengthen the health of the banking sector. Most indicators of financial soundness have
improved. The reduction of the level of non-performing loans and particularly in state-owned
banks (SOBs) should be underscored. Nevertheless, the authorities recognize that the SOBs
remain undercapitalized. In 2007, dollarization was also kept under control close to its 2006
level. The reduction in reserve requirements on domestic currency deposits in early 2007
contributed to achieving this result. Additionally, the authorities view the present level of the
exchange rate as adequate. The exchange rate’s relative stability has served as a valuable
anchor for expectations.
7.
Staff’s has recommended to phase out the partial allocation of reserve requirements to
mortgage credit and convert it into direct budget expenditures. In 2008, to address the
shortage in availability of low cost housing, the Government is considering to put in place a
direct housing subsidy program, which will be financed until 2010 with Central Bank profits.
These profits are normally transferred to the Ministry of Finance.

8.
Finally, on behalf of the Surinamese authorities, we wish to thank staff for the quality
of the dialogue with the authorities and for the candid report. We also wish to thank the Fund
for the sustained provision of technical support to Suriname both directly from headquarters
and through CARTAC. As a result, a lot of progress is being achieved particularly in the field
of public financial management, revenue administration and statistics. Nevertheless, much
remains to be done to strengthen institutional capacity. Additional TA to broaden the scope
of information that is being collected on state-owned enterprises particularly on debt
contracted would be welcome.
