GUINEA-BISSAU
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 5, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Guinea-Bissau is a fragile state. The military coup d’état in April 2012 was a
significant set-back to the progress achieved in previous years toward improved
macroeconomic policies and prospects. The associated political crisis has negatively
affected economic developments, including through a reduction in traditional donors’
support. In addition, Guinea-Bissau suffered a severe terms-of-trade shock as prices of
cashew nuts, its primary export product, fell sharply in 2012. The economy is expected to
recover somewhat in 2013, but remains highly vulnerable to political and cashew exports
developments. Achieving high and sustained economic growth will require political
stability and a resumption of structural reform efforts. The three year ECF-supported
program, approved in May 2010, went off-track after the coup and expired in May 2013.
Focus: The challenges are to navigate through near-term uncertainties and accelerate
growth over the medium term. Discussions focused on short-term challenges to restore
macroeconomic stability and the medium-term macroeconomic agenda, including
revenue mobilization, competitiveness and external sustainability, and reform priorities.
Outlook and risks: In the short term, the main risks relate to the international
environment, including a possible intensification of the euro area crisis, which could
affect exports, remittances, and official development assistance. Over the medium term,
resolution of the political crisis and the associated restoration of external financial
support are critical to end the vicious cycle of poverty, weak institutions, and large
physical and human capital gaps.
Recommendations: The authorities should adopt and implement a prudent budget for
2013 grounded on realistic revenue and financing estimates so as to avoid running
further arrears, while avoiding non-regularized payments. In the medium term, policies
should aim to create fiscal space by raising more tax revenues through tax policy and
administration reforms, increase infrastructure investment in a sustainable way, and
strengthen debt management. Structural reforms should focus on improving the
business environment, promoting economic diversification, and increasing access to
financial services.

POLITICAL SITUATION
1.
Security conditions remain calm, albeit fragile, while the political situation remains
fluid. A military coup d’état took place in April 2012 in the midst of presidential elections. An
interim government was formed to manage a transitional period leading to new elections, but its
legitimacy has been questioned by part of the international community. In late April 2013,
increased pressure from the international community forced the interim government to reach a
broad agreement to form an inclusive transitional government and to conduct elections in
November 2013. However, negotiations on the specifics of that agreement have been protracted.
Against this background, the UN extended its mandate of peace building operation in
Guinea-Bissau to May 2014, and the international community has expressed its commitment to
cover the costs of the elections.
2.
Most development partners maintain limited working relations with the interim
government. The World Bank has limited its support to pre-existing projects under the Bank’s
policy concerning de facto governments, as well as the AfDB. The EU is not expected to resume
its official support until a democratically-elected government is put in place. In contrast, the
regional partners, i.e., ECOWAS, WAEMU, and BOAD, have stepped up their financial support to
Guinea-Bissau.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The political crisis has negatively affected economic developments. The coup led to
a disruption in cashew exports and a suspension of traditional donors’ aid was only partially
offset by increased budget support from the region. As a result, the economy contracted by
1½ percent in 2012. Despite some upward pressures on prices driven by food and fuel shortages,
the impact on headline inflation was muted in light of low domestic demand pressures.
12 month inflation was about 2 percent at end-2012. The external current account deficit
(including transfers) deteriorated to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2012 from 1.2 percent in 2011,
reflecting also a fall in cashew export prices (Figure 1 and Tables 1–3).
4.
The resulting sizeable reduction in fiscal revenues led to a deterioration in spending
composition and fiscal control and to a further accumulation of domestic arrears in 2012.
Total revenue (excluding project grants) fell short of the budgetary target by about 3 percent of
GDP. In response, the government completely cut domestically-financed capital spending. A loss
of fiscal control amid rising defense-related expenditure, which increased by about 1 percent of
GDP, led to a substantial increase in non-regularized payments.1 The overall fiscal deficit was
financed partially by depleting the treasury deposits and by transfers from the FUNPI. The
remaining financing gap translated into an accumulation of domestic arrears (about 1 percent of
GDP). For the first quarter of 2013, treasury deposits remained low notwithstanding some budget

support from Nigeria. Despite the government’s efforts to cut the current expenditure against
lower-than-expected revenue, the government ran domestic arrears of 0.3 percent of GDP
(Figure 2 and Tables 4a–4d).
Box 1. Guinea-Bissau: Implementation of the 2010 Article IV Recommendations
Mobilizing fiscal revenue: Staff called for stepping up revenue mobilization as a step toward attaining a
sustainable fiscal position over the medium term. The government raised customs reference prices of key
imports toward market levels, launched the ASYCUDA++ in Bissau’s port, and reduced some exemptions. A
substantial increase in tax revenue allowed the government to cover three quarters of current expenditure
in 2011, up from only one third in 2008; and better expenditure control created space for increased social
spending. The revenue-raising measures agreed during the third ECF review in December 2011 experienced a
set-back in 2012 when implementation stalled in the context of the political crisis.
Strengthening PFM: Measures recommended in this area focused on (i) unifying and computerizing payroll
management and (ii) firming up expenditure control. The unified payroll system has been extended to all
ministries, except for the Ministry of Defense. The personnel management system, SIGRHAP began operating
in 2011, which helped tighten expenditure control.
Improving the business environment: Staff advised that the authorities prepare a plan to clear domestic
arrears as a way to help restore the credibility of government policies and to speed up efforts to simplify
administrative procedures. The authorities reduced domestic arrears consistent with their medium-term
strategy in 2010–11, but accumulated domestic arrears again in 2012 amid the political crisis. The government
prepared an action plan to identify and remove impediments to private sector development in 2011.
Securing debt sustainability: Staff recommended that the authorities take the necessary policy actions
(“triggers”) under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative: implement a national poverty reduction strategy; maintain
macroeconomic stability; strengthen public expenditure management; and demobilize former combatants.
Guinea-Bissau reached the completion point in December 2010 and received debt relief of US$1.2 billion in
nominal terms.

RESTORING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
Near-term economic prospects remain difficult due to political uncertainties. Maintaining a prudent
fiscal policy is crucial to restoring macroeconomic stability.

A. Near-term Economic Outlook
5.
Despite a partial economic recovery in 2013, income levels will remain depressed.
The staff baseline assumes that political uncertainties continue through 2013, and that stability is
only gradually restored from 2014 onwards. With an assumed robust recovery in cashew exports,
and continued support from regional partners, real GDP could increase by about 3½ percent in
2013. However, activity would remain constrained by weak domestic demand, including low
investment, on account of lingering concerns about instability. Inflationary pressures are
projected to remain moderate. The current account deficit (including transfers) is projected to fall
relative to 2012, owing to the recovery of cashew export earnings (Figure 3).

6.
The economic outlook is subject to external and domestic risks (see Risk Assessment
Matrix, Table 5). If Guinea-Bissau fails to achieve even the gradual political stabilization envisaged
in the baseline, there would be further downside risks to external financing, which could intensify
fiscal pressures and further undercut economic growth. A delayed cashew export campaign,
associated with financing constraints and uncertainty about the FUNPI contribution and the
prices for exporters and producers, also poses a downside risk. The main risks related to the
international environment include a possible intensification of the euro area crisis, which could
affect exports, remittances, and official assistance.

B. Fiscal Policy
7.
Lingering political uncertainty is expected to lead to a tight budget constraint in
the context of suspended aid by traditional donors and spending pressures including from
the defense sector. The 2013 budget has

revenue and grants envelope, together
with limited financing options, have forced the authorities to commit to cutting current spending
by 2.1 percent of GDP. The sharp adjustment of current spending poses a risk of a surge in
arrears if not strictly enforced.
8.
The tight fiscal situation in 2013 poses concerns about fiscal slippages and
accumulation of arrears. Revenue projections might be affected by a delayed approval of the
budget, while available financing sources remain almost nonexistent. This leads a need to reduce

recurrent spending. At the same time, there is a need to rebuild Treasury deposits (at least up to
one month of the wage bill) to facilitate a policy response in the face of potential negative
shocks. Implementation of a tight current expenditure envelope hinges on strengthened fiscal
control, particularly to avoid non-regularized payments, a mechanism that has been used to
bypass budgetary limits on certain expenditure items (particularly related to the defense sector).
In addition, implementation of the budget needs to be supported by monthly treasury cash
management plans to minimize the risk of running arrears.
9.
A contingency plan is required to face the highly likely emergence of a financing
gap. For instance, if the committed budgetary support does not materialize and/or the
authorities fail to contain recurrent spending, the authorities would be unable to timely pay
salaries after the cashew campaign season ends in late September. Given limited financing
options, the contingency plan should focus on cutting domestically financed capital expenditure
and defense-related outlays, while protecting social expenditures.
10.
The recovery of cashew exports this year would be helped by a suspension of the
FUNPI contributions. The contribution to FUNPI complicates the financial position of cashew
producers and exporters (particularly the former) under uncertain market conditions.
Furthermore, delays in setting up transparent statutes to make best use of FUNPI resources
undermine the growth potential of the cashew processing industry. The government raised
2.1 percent of GDP for the FUNPI in 2011–12 through a cashew export surcharge, but none of the
FUNPI resources have been used for developing the sector.
Authorities’ views
11.
The authorities acknowledged the need for an approved 2013 budget and stronger
fiscal controls. They agreed that priority should be given to legislative approval of a prudent
2013 budget and rapid implementation of the revenue measures envisaged in the budget. The
authorities highlighted some recent measures that were adopted with the aim of mobilizing tax
revenue and strengthening fiscal control: collection of tax revenue and payment of civil servants’
salaries via the banking system; and implementation of a fuel marking program to limit the fiscal
costs of fuel tax exemptions. In addition, they noted that ASYCUDA++ is being gradually
expanded to three border posts to strengthen customs administration and that the treasury
account is being more closely monitored by the court of audit (cour de comptes). The
government committed to record FUNPI operations in the national budget as a way to ensure its
transparent management and operation.

BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Guinea-Bissau’s medium-term challenges are to diversify its economy, reduce widespread poverty,
and generate employment opportunities. That requires continued focus on policies to create an
enabling environment for private sector-led growth and to relax structural constraints.

A. Medium-term Outlook and Context
12.
Medium-term growth prospects critically depend on a stabilization of the political
environment and increased support by traditional development partners (Text Table 2).

baseline, uncertainties about
implementation of those conditions suggest scope for only a slow and weak recovery, leaving
real per capita incomes below 2011 levels until at least 2016. In this environment, and with
depressed external financing, public spending would remain constrained, leaving the economy
locked in a vicious cycle of poverty, weak institutions, and large physical and human capital gaps.
In contrast, should political stabilization gain momentum more rapidly, a strengthened political
mandate could be used to boost revenue collections, mobilize additional foreign financing, and
finance growth-promoting public investments (Text table 2).

B. Increasing Fiscal Space
13.
Guinea-Bissau’s medium-term fiscal program should focus on mobilizing more
fiscal revenues. Guinea-Bissau’s tax performance is the lowest relative to regional peers, i.e.,
WAEMU countries, and staff’s analysis suggests that Guinea-Bissau’s actual tax-to-GDP ratio falls
short of its potential by as much as 12 percent of GDP (Box 3). An increase in tax revenues can be
achieved by broadening the tax base, including through a rationalization of existing tax
exemptions, and by strengthening tax and customs administrations over the medium-term.

GUINEA-BISSAU

Box 2. Guinea-Bissau: Progress of the Security Sector Reform and its Prospects
Successful implementation of a SSR is critical for political stability and economic development. GuineaBissau’s history has been characterized by recurrent military coup attempts. This has in turn translated into an
inability to implement economic programs and reforms. In that context, a reform of the SSR has been
identified as a cornerstone reform. Such reform would create a virtuous cycle of stability and growth, and help
restore budget and project support from traditional donors.
A roadmap to modernize and restructure the security sector was prepared in 2010 with assistance by
international partners, CPLP, ECOWAS and UN. The roadmap involved the gradual reduction of military
forces from about 4,500, to 3,500 and reversing an inverted pyramid organizational structure of the military
through a combination of retirement schemes and professionalization.
Several development partners have pledged financing to implement the reform. ECOWAS has
committed up to US$63 million, of which 60 percent would be used for a military pension fund and
40 percent for rehabilitation of military barracks. In March 2012, ECOWAS set up a scheme to disburse a first
tranche of US$23 million. Angola dispatched their military personnel from early 2011 through April 2012.
Other partners (EU and UN) also committed financing to the SSR.
Amid disagreements between international partners regarding the implementation of the SSR
roadmap, the April 2012 coup d’état has stalled the SSR. The coup stopped the cooperation with CPLP,
and ECOWAS repatriated the first tranche of committed funds. Since then, no progress has been made in
reaching an agreement between ECOWAS, the CPLP, and the Government of Guinea-Bissau for the
implementation of the roadmap.
The February 2013 ECOWAS summit renewed the calls for implementation of the DSSRP. The DSSRP,
bilateral agreement signed in November 2012 between ECOWAS and the government of Guinea-Bissau,
replaced the SSR, conceived as a tripartite agreement including the CPLP. The summit instructed the initiation
of the DSSRP by March 2013 and confirmed ECOWAS’ financial pledge.

14.
Technical assistance by the Fund and other partners should help create fiscal space
Targeted Fund technical assistance would support the authorities’ reform programs and capacity
building efforts, particularly in the areas of tax and customs administration. For instance,
Guinea-Bissau benefits from a multi-year program to modernize tax administration under a
dedicated topical trust fund (TTF–TPA). Since expenditure restraint is essential to reestablish
macroeconomic stability until revenue performance improves, some technical assistance will be
geared toward the implementation of PFM reforms aimed at reinforcing fiscal control and
improving cash management to better allocate scarce budgetary resources.
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities hope to increase fiscal space by making good use of Fund technical
assistance for enhancing tax revenue. The authorities intend to establish a reform coordination
and fiscal modernization unit to consolidate their fiscal reform efforts and to move toward the
adoption of a value added tax to broaden the tax base. They also expressed a commitment to
review the pension system for public employees to help limit the transfers of the government.

the elasticity of tax revenue with respect to

for its low tax-to-GDP ratio. Guinea-Bissau’s tax revenue has not kept up pace with economic growth. The
country has revenue buoyancies that are below unity and similar to SSA fragile states, but below all WAEMU

A cross-country econometric analysis suggests that the tax gap between tax potential and actual tax
collection in Guinea-Bissau is substantial. The tax gap would have been as much as 12 percent of GDP
in 2011. The tax effort (i.e., the actual tax collection
relative to the taxable capacity) increased from

C. Improving Competitiveness and the Business Environment
16.
External price-competitiveness appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
Staff’s analysis indicates no significant misalignment of the real effective exchange rate. However,
many factors, including insufficient infrastructure, lack of qualified labor force, and high
transportation and communication costs affect negatively the economy’s overall competitiveness
(Box 4).
17.
Despite recent improvements, business climate indicators point to significant
challenges for the creation of a competitive and diversified economy. Despite a low overall
ranking, the country had made a significant progress in improving its business environment for
2005–11.3 A number of weaknesses on the quality and reliability of institutions, labor force
quality, and some business practices explain Guinea-Bissau’s weak competitiveness performance
and its last place ranking among WAEMU countries. Moreover, some of the earlier progress is
likely to have been reversed following the 2012 coup.
18.
There has been limited progress in the implementation of structural reforms. The
authorities need to step up the efforts, as committed in their second PRSP, to implement an
action plan for removing impediments to private sector development. In this context, the
government has recently taken steps to reactivate the one-stop shop which had been introduced
in 2011 to simplify registration of private enterprises. The ongoing strengthening of the anti-money
laundering regime should contribute to improve governance and transparency, and strengthen anticorruption efforts. The implementation of 2012 AML/CFT law would benefit, among others, from
making the financial intelligence unit operational, and ensuring that AML/CFT supervision of financial
institution takes place.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities acknowledge the need to further improve the business environment
to help diversify the economy. They intend to establish a natural resource management
framework to guide the concession of development licenses and enhance the institutional
capacity of the natural resources sector with technical assistance from development partners. The
authorities are reviewing the labor law with the aim of promoting the absorption of the unskilled,
young, and under-employed labor force.

D. Increasing Access to Finance and Strengthening Financial Stability
20.
The financial sector is not yet in a position to support growth. The financial system in
Guinea-Bissau is shallow—with a few commercial banks—and financial intermediation remains
the lowest in the WAEMU. Microfinance is almost non-existent. Weak physical infrastructure
impedes the expansion of the banking system and limits the range of financial services.
Rudimentary payment and settlement systems limit the benefits of using the banking system. No
meaningful progress has been made in the financial sector from poor initial conditions, and the
banking system is burdened by large NPLs (Box 5). There is a need to encourage a broader range
of financial services, to support increased access to finance, and to enhance the monitoring of
the banking system.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities share the staff’s assessment on the development of the financial
sector. The authorities intend to revise the national strategy document for the microfinance
sector by consolidating the existing initiatives and by signing a partnership agreement with the
African Microfinance Network to energize the underdeveloped sector.

E. Maintaining Debt Sustainability
22.
Guinea-Bissau has limited space to borrow. A debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
suggests that the country’s debt outlook has worsened considerably, but risks of debt distress
remain moderate (See Supplement I). Such an assessment critically depends on a post-crisis
recovery and on the assumption that the authorities resume prudent fiscal and debt
management policies. Without tight limits on new borrowing and efforts to improve exports,
revenue and growth performance, the country might face a high risk of debt distress. The
immediate resumption of publication of quarterly reports on the total public debt will help
strengthen sound debt management. Extending the debt management system (SYGADE) to the
BCEAO would improve debt monitoring capacity. Since the Paris Club agreement of May 2011,
most of the debt owed to multilaterals and official bilateral creditors has been canceled, while
about half of the remaining debt owed to non-Paris Club creditors is subject to rescheduling.
Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities concur with the staff’s assessment and intend to pursue a prudent
borrowing strategy focused on concessional financing terms. As regards the progress of
post-HIPC implementation, the authorities are making efforts to finalize agreements with
remaining official creditors.

Box 5. Guinea-Bissau: Financial System’s Structure and Performance
The financial system in Guinea-Bissau is mostly limited to the banking sector. The banking sector,
composed of 4 commercial banks,
holds about 94 percent of the
financial system’s assets. Only five

from about 24 percent in 2009 to
38 percent in 2012, but still below the WAEMU average. Only about one percent of the population holds bank
accounts. The number of bank accounts per thousand adults (35 in 2011) is well below other WAEMU
countries (about 45). A sizable cash-based informal sector, relatively high interest margins, scarce access to
financing, insufficient collateral, and poor financial accounting practices pose significant obstacles to the
development of the financial system. Moreover, weak infrastructure, a rudimentary payments system, weak
legal and judicial systems, lack of a credit reference system and political instability hinder the financial sector’s
ability to provide adequate support for the private sector.
The banking system appears to be relatively robust, but lending concentration to the cashew sector
poses risks. The financial
soundness indicators suggest

Guinea-Bissau: Financial Soundness Indicators for the Banking Sector, 2007-12

that the banking system is
broadly sound. At end–2012,
banks were well capitalized,
relatively profitable, and
somewhat liquid, while asset
quality has deteriorated. The
high NPLs are mainly due to a
rise in unpaid loans of cashew

exporters following the fall in cashew export prices in 2012. Loans to the cashew sector represent about
25 percent of total loans.
The microfinance sector is still very small. The stock of credit by MFIs, mostly funded by NGOs grant
financing, represented less than 1 percent of bank credit in 2012. Although the first MFIs were established
in mid–1990s, only 5 licensed institutions were operating at end-2012. NPLs were about 51 percent at
end–2012. Moreover, data and financial statements from the MFIs are unreliable and do not comply with
WAEMU regulations.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT AND STATISTICAL ISSUES
24.
Capacity building is needed to complement fiscal reforms and ensure their
effectiveness and sustainability. Guinea-Bissau is characterized by weak government
institutions. Development partners have actively provided technical assistance in various areas,
with an emphasis on training. Efforts have been made to identify key priorities (Box 6). The Fund
is providing technical support in public financial management, revenue administration, and
national accounts statistics.
25.
Weaknesses in the national accounts and the balance of payments statistics hamper
surveillance. These issues are discussed in the Informational Annex (See Supplement II). Several
development partners are providing technical assistance in macroeconomic statistics. A strategic
plan for development of statistics is being prepared, aiming at improving the quality of statistics.
Box 6. Guinea-Bissau: Technical Assistance Priorities over 2013–14
The priorities remain on strengthening tax and customs administration, deepening PFM reform, and
improving debt management. It is expected that FAD, MCM, and STA will be involved in providing TA,
supported by AFRITAC West. Training should focus in the tax and customs administration areas. Capacity
constraints and the ongoing political fragility could limit progress. The following priorities have been
identified by the authorities:
Revenue administration: Under the multi-year TPA-TTF, the objective is to (i) accurately register the large
and medium-sized taxpayer population by the Tax Department; (ii) establish a relevant auditing framework
including institutional auditing responsibilities and procedures; (iii) improve large taxpayers’ filing rate; and
(iv) reorganize the Tax Department.
Customs administration: The goal is to strengthen computerized customs procedures through continued
implementation of ASYCUDA++ and to reinforce controls by ensuring proper valuation of goods. In this
context, the focus would be on (i) expanding the ASYCUDA++ to key border posts, (ii) professionalizing
checks at the customs clearance, including import value and exemptions; and to (iii) developing postclearance audit and enhancing collection of information on fraud.
Tax policy: The short-term goal is to broaden the tax base, including by closing tax loopholes, and to
consolidate and rationalize tax exemptions, while a medium-term goal is to implement a VAT system.
Public financial management: The objective is to enhance budget preparation and control in budget
execution; to strengthen accounting, recording, and reporting procedures; and to reinforce internal and
external controls.
Debt management: The focus would be on enhancing debt management capacity and regular reporting on
all public debt through the SYGADE.
Statistics: The goal is to timely produce the national accounts under 1993 System of National Accounts.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The combined impact of the domestic political crisis and the deterioration in terms
of trade was severe. During 2012, economic activity declined, partly on account of sharp cuts in
public investment in response to a sizeable reduction in fiscal revenues and deterioration in
government’s spending composition. Also, the implementation of structural reform stalled.
27.
Macroeconomic stability needs to be re-established in the context of difficult (and
uncertain) short-term prospects. Achieving macroeconomic stability is crucial for a successful
political transition process. The limited levels of projected revenue and grants, together with
limited financing options, warrant a tight expenditure envelope and strict fiscal controls to avoid
further domestic arrears, while protecting social and priority spending. A prudent 2013 budget
needs to be speedily approved, while contingency plans need to be formulated for eventual
shortfalls in revenue collection. In addition, liquidity buffers need to be reconstituted and nonregularized payment procedures brought under control. The authorities should consider
suspending FUNPI contributions as a mechanism to improve the prospects of the 2013 cashew
export campaign and to support cashew producers’ income.
28.
The achievement of sustained and inclusive growth hinges critically on political
stability, support by (traditional) donors, and structural reforms. Restoring political stability
and implementing a security sector reform are pre-conditions for investors’ confidence and the
reengagement of development partners. Otherwise, the country might be locked in a vicious
cycle of sluggish income growth, underinvestment, and poverty. Support by development
partners is essential since financing needs for sustained growth and poverty reduction are large
and it will take time to substantially increase tax revenue. In addition, structural reforms will need
to be accelerated, particularly to lower the cost of doing business and to enhance competiveness.
In this regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ intentions to enhance revenue administration, to
gear PFM reforms towards an improved composition of public spending, and to improve the
business climate. The authorities’ plans to develop the financial markets and improve access to
credit, especially for the financially neglected groups, are also welcome.
29.
The authorities need to urgently tackle structural deficiencies in the provision of
macroeconomic statistics. Gaps in macroeconomic data provision complicate Guinea-Bissau’s
public policy-making and Fund surveillance. This requires immediate reform and strengthening
of the national statistical agencies.
30.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau be held
on a 12-month cycle, in accordance with the decision on Article IV Consultation cycles.

Appendix I: Civil Conflicts and Inequality1
This note analyzes the role of social conflicts on income inequality in Guinea-Bissau. The results
from country-specific analysis and panel data of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and developing
countries suggest that social conflicts have significant and persistent effects in terms of increasing
inequality. Pursuing policies and actions that mitigate the risks of conflict outbreak are keys to
foster inclusive growth.

Introduction
1.

Inequality in Guinea-Bissau has decreased considerably over the last two decades,
and growth has been broadly inclusive. The inclusive growth indicators2 in Guinea-Bissau show
visible progress, especially when compared to its peers (Figure A1 C). For instance, income
inequality has significantly declined and extreme poverty has been reduced (Figure A1 A);
employment and participation rates have remained stable; and health and education outcome
indicators have markedly increased (Figure A1 B). The decline in inequality, however, has not
been smooth. Inequality (proxied by the Gini coefficient) in Guinea-Bissau has declined from
about 53.4 in 1991 to 35.6 in 2002 and increased subsequently to 38.7 in 2005. Interestingly,
inequality has declined on average during peaceful periods and seems to have increased in the
aftermath of social conflict episodes (Figure A1 D).

2.

Social conflicts may have a significant distributive impact. From a theoretical point of
view, inequality and social conflicts are interrelated. On the one hand, social conflicts have
detrimental and long-lasting effects on investment. Therefore, inequality increases owing to
deterred investment in physical capital and the loss of human capital due to migration, lower
school enrollment, reduction in life expectancy, higher mortality, and reduced social spending in
health and education (Kim and Conceicao, 2009). On the other hand, high degrees of inequality
may damage people’s current and future expectations and lead in turn to social unrests and
conflicts (Campante and Chor, 2012).

3.

This note analyses the role of social conflicts on inequality through a country-specific
and a panel of Sub-Saharan countries analyses. It also proposes policies and actions that mitigate
the risks of conflict outbreak and are keys to foster inclusive growth.

Distributive consequences of social conflicts
4.

Episodes of civil conflicts are typically widespread around the world, but they are
recurrent in many SSA countries. Table A1, based on the Cross-National Time-Series Data
Archive (CNTS)3, provides an overview of civil conflicts’ occurrence over the world in the last
three decades. That table shows that, while social conflicts typically occurred in all developing
countries, they were much more recurrent in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, Guinea-Bissau
constitutes a particular case, recording 10 episodes of civil conflicts over the last 20 years.

5.
Civil conflicts usually lead to a robust, significant, and persistent effect on
inequality (Figure A1 E). The methodology used to assess this effect is detailed in Box A1. Civil
conflict episodes are found to have long-lasting effects on income inequality. In particular, the
estimates suggest that the occurrence of an episode of social unrest typically increases the Gini
index by about 0.2 percentage points in the very short term — 1 year after the civil conflict —,
and by about 1.7 percentage points over the medium term — 8 years after the conflict. The
effect reaches a peak of about 2.1 percentage points around the sixth year following the conflict
episode.4
6.
The effect of social conflicts on inequality is particularly high in SSA and GuineaBissau (Figure A1 F). The effect of social conflicts on inequality varies markedly across regions,
with the largest effect found in East Asia and Pacific and in SSA.5 In particular, the results for SSA
suggest that episodes of social conflicts are associated with a short-term effect of about
0.8 percent and a medium-term impact of about 3.8 percentage points. The peak effect is about
5.0 percentage points and occurs around the sixth year following the conflict episode.
Interestingly, the short and medium-term effects for a panel of SSA are very close to those found
3

The social and political instabilities listed there include conflicts such as: (i) guerrilla warfare, defined as any
armed activity, sabotage, or bombings carried on by independent bands of citizens or irregular forces and aimed
at the overthrow of the present regime; and (ii) revolutions, defined as any illegal or forced change in the top
government elite, any attempt at such a change, or any successful or unsuccessful armed rebellion whose aim is
independence from the central government.

4

The results are robust to several checks, such as controlling for endogeneity, different lag-parameterizations,
and the inclusion of macroeconomic and political controls which may affect both inequality and the probability of
the occurrence of a civil conflict episode. See Zdzienicka (2013) for details.

for Guinea-Bissau in a bi-variate framework,6 suggesting that the empirical evidence for SSA can
be used as a reference for the effect of social conflicts on inequality in Guinea-Bissau.
Box A1. Estimating the dynamic impact of social conflicts on inequality
The medium-term dynamic impact of social conflicts on inequality is assessed following a two-step approach.
In the first step, a composite measure of civil conflicts is computed using principal component analysis and
CNTS conflict indicators on guerrilla warfare and revolutions. In the second step, impulse response functions
(IRFs) are estimated from local projections, following a method proposed by Jorda (2005). In detail, for each
future period k the following equation has been estimated on annual data:

measures the impact of social instability on the change of (the log of) the Gini for each future period k. Since
fixed effects are included in the regression, the dynamic impact should be interpreted as changes in
inequality compared to a baseline country-specific trend. The number of lags (l) has been chosen to be equal
to two, even if the results are extremely robust to different number of lags included in the specification.
Impulse response functions are then obtained by plotting the estimated

for k= 0,1,…,8, with 95 percent

confidence bands for the estimated IRFs being computed using the standard deviations associated with the
estimated coefficients

. Reverse causality is addressed by estimating changes in inequality in the years that

follow a social conflict.
To overcome data limitation in terms of poor reliability, coverage, and inconsistent methodology, the
Standardized World Income Inequality Database is used. The database combines information from the United
Nations’ World Income Database and the Luxembourg Income Study, and provides comparable estimates of
the Gini indices for 173 countries for as many years as possible from 1960 to 2010.1

See Solt (2009, 2011) for details on the methodology.

Policy Actions
7.

Pursuing policies that mitigate the risk of conflict outbreaks is key to fostering
inclusive growth in fragile countries. Empirical evidence in the literature suggests that social
conflicts may have long-lasting effect on output (Cerra and Saxena, 2008; Bernal-Verdugo
et al. 2013). In addition, the results presented in this note suggest that social conflicts may have
significant and long-lasting distributive consequences. Therefore, pursuing policies that mitigate

6

The simple regression of medium-term changes in the Gini coefficient and episodes of social conflicts provides
similar findings: the occurrence of a social conflict episode in Guinea-Bissau tends to be associated with a
medium-term increase in inequality of about 3 percentage points.

the risks of conflict outbreak are key to fostering inclusive growth, particularly in fragile countries.
In this context, international efforts on peacekeeping can play significant role in reducing the risk
of civil conflicts (Doyle and Sambanis,2006; Fotna, 2008). Foreign aid and development support
can also have an impact in reducing the risk of civil war. Collier and Hoeffler (2002) suggest that
aid and policy do not have direct effects upon conflict risk, but both directly affect the economic
growth rate and the extent of dependence upon primary commodity exports, and these in turn
affect the risk of conflict. Collier and Hoeffler (2004) also find that policies aimed at improving
educational outcomes are closely linked with the outbreak of conflicts. Finally, reforms aimed at
improving the level of governance play a significant role in reducing the probability of civil
conflict and shape its macroeconomic consequences (Bernal-Verdugo et al. 2013). In the case of
Guinea-Bissau, a security sector reform would be a specific policy action to foster inclusive
growth over the medium- to long-terms.

Bissau collected 8 percent of GDP in
tax revenue, the lowest ratio among all countries in SSA. Low per capita income, an agriculturalbased economy, poorly structured tax systems, and weak tax and customs administrations all
contribute to difficulties in raising tax revenue. Notably, weak revenue mobilization is the root
cause of Guinea Bissau’s fiscal imbalances. It explains the dependence on budget support and
the lack of space to increase priority spending. In this context, a better understanding of the tax
gap that currently exists in Guinea-Bissau − the difference between potential tax revenue and
actual collection − will help assess prospects for tax revenue over the medium term and identify
areas for further improvements.

Tax Buoyancy1
2.
Guinea-Bissau’s tax buoyancy remains low compared with other SSA countries,
suggesting another explanatory factor for its low tax-to-GDP ratio. Guinea-Bissau’s tax
revenue has not kept up pace with economic growth. Table B1 reports revenue buoyancy for
three types of taxes (total, direct, and indirect) for Guinea-Bissau and other peer group (WAEMU,
SSA countries, and SSA fragile states) over the 2000–11 period. Guinea-Bissau’s record on tax
buoyancy is poor, as reflected in those observations. Guinea-Bissau has revenue buoyancies that
are below unity and similar to SSA fragile states, but below all WAEMU and SSA averages for all
three categories of taxes. Indirect taxes have the highest buoyancy, followed by total taxes and
direct taxes (Table B1).

1
Tax buoyancy is defined as the elasticity of tax revenue with respect to nominal GDP. A buoyancy of 1 means,
for example, that if GDP increases by 1 percent, taxes increase by 1 percent, which results in a neutral impact to
the tax-to-GDP ratio.

Tax Potential vis-à-vis Tax Effort
3.
This study uses a stochastic time-varying tax frontier. This approach measures taxable
capacity by regressing the tax revenue to GDP ratio for sample countries on explanatory variables
that serve as proxies for possible tax bases and other factors that might affect a country’s ability
to raise tax revenue. Following the literature, a stochastic frontier estimation model is defined
with a reduced form equation for a cross-country panel regression (Coondo et al., 2003,
Varsano, 2006). The predicted tax ratio from such a regression is considered a measure of taxable
capacity, i.e., tax revenue potential, while the ratio of the actual to the predicted tax ratio is then

Following the literature, economic and socio-political variables are used to explain
the potential tax revenue in sample countries. The estimation uses a panel dataset that covers
173 countries over the period 1995–2011, where 39 SSA countries are included. The estimated
coefficients (Table B2) indicate that higher potential tax revenue is associated with variables that
capture higher population, larger share of economically active population whose age is between
15 and 64, higher GDP per capita, higher degree of trade openness, non-oil exporters, less
agricultural value added, the degree of financial deepening, and high quality of institutional
factors.
We assume that vit is independently and identically distributed random variable with N(0,  v2 ), and it is also
independent of u it . We also assume that u it follows non-negative truncated normal distribution, N(0,  u2 ).

Scope for further improvements in Guinea-Bissau remains substantial. GuineaBissau’s tax performance and its associated potential revenue are estimated at the lowest in the
WAEMU countries (Table B4). Noting that Guinea-Bissau’s tax rates are already broadly in line
with those in the rest of the WAEMU region except for the value added tax,4 the lowest tax
revenue performance would be mainly due to limited administrative capacity. Many WAEMU
countries widened the tax base by limiting tax exemptions and strengthening tax and customs
administration. Reforms focused on measures to strengthen auditing, control exemptions, and
combat fraud, and to improve taxpayers’ compliance.

Concluding Remarks
7.
Significant additional revenue can be raised in Guinea-Bissau by implementation of
best practices in a sequence consistent with the country’s circumstances. More progress
might have been possible by enhancing the collaboration between the tax and customs
administrations, including systematic exchanges of data and more joint controls. Looking ahead,

efforts should focus on measures that will deliver the biggest revenue impact. In particular, the
tax administration needs to be made more efficient, supported by a broadening of the tax base
and actions to combat tax evasion. Key measures for consideration include:


Broadening the tax base by establishing broad-based competitive tax rates consistent with
regional standards and implementing simple but coherent regimes for taxing smaller
businesses, particularly the informal sector;



Building administrations that effectively limit incentives and opportunities for rent seeking
and inappropriate behavior which would help enhance tax compliance;



Adopting and making readily available clear laws and regulations and streamlining tax
exemptions;



Stepping up the implementation of recommendations from the IMF tax policy and tax
administration technical assistance missions under the multi-year program (TTF-TPA), which
includes operationalizing the large taxpayer office, introducing the single taxpayer
identification number, taxing imports on the basis of actual values, strengthening control of
taxpayers that have stopped filing tax returns, and strengthening tax audits; and;



Implementing prerequisite steps to move toward a VAT.

Appendix III: Financial System’s Structure and Performance1
Overview
1.
The financial system in Guinea-Bissau is mostly limited to the banking sector. It is
composed of 4 commercial banks, but only two have branches outside the capital city. Banks
make up about 94 percent of the financial system (Table C1). There are just five micro finance
institutions (MFIs) providing limited financial services to lower income households. MFIs cover
both urban and rural regions; nonetheless, more than three quarters of the sector’s activity is
concentrated in Bissau. Private insurance companies (3) and a semiautonomous public pension
fund (National Institute of Social Security) account for most of the remainder of the domestic
financial system. Local institutions, including the government, have capacity constraints to access
funding from the regional securities and equity markets.

addition to its retail business. Only about one percent of the population holds bank accounts,
with bank deposits amounting to about 18 percent of GDP. There is no interbank market: banks
recur directly to the BCEAO for liquidity needs, if any. Banks usually have excess reserves with
only a limited amount of liquidity traded among them.

deposits have also increased substantially
through 2012, but they are lower than in
neighboring countries. Moreover, the ratio of credit to deposits is lower than one, indicating that
banks are liquid and do not have much investment opportunities.
5.
The banking system appears to be relatively robust, with concentration of lending
being the main risk. Financial indicators show that capital adequacy decreased to 20 percent at
end–2012, but it is still largely above the regulatory minimum of 8 percent. Profitability remains
also adequate. Nonetheless, the main risk comes from credit concentration (just one sector,
commerce and retail trade absorbs 50 percent of loans), as reflected by the large increase in nonperforming loans to 9.7 from 6.5 in 2011 due mostly by the accumulation of arrears by cashew
exporters. Other risks, including liquidity risks, seem not to be overriding given that banks are
highly liquid (due to the lack of profitable projects and the absence of a developed interbank
market).
6.
The international financial crisis and the slowdown in emerging markets affected
Guinea-Bissau’s banks through delays in export trade receipts and lower remittances.
However, the impact has been rather limited because banks do not have access to European lines
of credit: most banks are funded locally. This also increased the opportunity for African banking
groups to expand in the region, counterbalancing some of the negative effects of the global
crisis.

Microfinance
7.
Microfinance (MFI) activities are negligible within the Guinea-Bissau financial
system. They focus on basic sector services, such as savings accounts and micro-credit. The
activities of MFIs are not well understood and not many people have accounts there. MFIs’ loans
amount to less than 1 percent of bank credit (CFAF 340 million). Some MFIs are operated by
NGOs and have a social mandate, e.g., to lend to women and farmers in remote regions, but they
do not report their operations. Moreover, since the initial MFIs were established by NGOs based
on grant-financing, there has been an entrenched concept that MFIs should provide loans
without the need to repay back. This has negatively contributed to a high level of NPL and,
eventually, the disappearance of a large number of MFIs. The two largest MFIs make up around
90 percent of their operations.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

8.
The sector has experienced a significant drop in the number of active MFIs.
Although the first MFIs were established in 1997, as of end–2012 there were only 5 licensed
institutions, falling from

there are more than
10,000 registered members in the microfinance sector. Political instability and a slowdown in
economic activity have significantly affected the sector, with loans declining to just CFA
219 million (less than 0.1 percent of GDP). Credit is mostly allocated to micro businesses such as
female merchants, fishermen and horticulturists.
9.
Despite an improvement in 2011, the quality of MFIs portfolios appears to have
deteriorated more recently. NPLs were about 25 percent of total loans during 2011 and
reached 51 percent of the MFIs portfolio at end–2012. Moreover, data and financial statements
from the MFI’s are unreliable and are not produced within the timeframe mandated by the
WAEMU regulations. The sector is in need of capacity improvements. Additionally, the
supervision activities provided by the ministry of finance need to be strengthened. Financing
from both local and international sources to the MFIs has also plummeted substantially. Thus,
Guinea-Bissau’s microfinance sector continues to be the least developed in the WAEMU region.
For instance, in Senegal the MFIs provide services to about 20 percent of the population and
about 10 percent of bank credit.
10.
The legislation that deals with microfinance was set up in 2008. Under the current
legislation, the Ministry of Finance through a specialized unit (CADESP) is in charge of
authorizing the opening of MFIs, as well as their supervision. The ministry also handles the
promotion activities, while the BCEAO contributes to inspection and supervision activities.
However, the legislation presents some handicaps to facilitate the proper functioning of MFIs.
The government, with assistance from the UNDP, produced in 2008 a comprehensive diagnostic
of the sector and remedial actions (e.g. focusing the role of the ministry of finance to
authorization and inspection and the one of the ministry of economy to promotion).
Nonetheless, the associated legislation has yet to be approved.
11.
The NFIs sector suffers from a large drop of membership, lack of financial
resources, and a high level of NPLs. The sector is in need of a comprehensive overhaul. The
government has initiated this with a change of leadership at the CADESP level. UNDP and other
donors appear willing to cooperate once the proper regulations are in place, so that the MFIs can

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

accomplish their main objective of providing financing to the large low-income segment of the
population, as a way to reduce poverty.

Conclusions
12.
Fragile states at initial stages of financial development, like Guinea-Bissau, can
benefit from financial deepening. Financial deepening has a positive effect on growth if done
properly, i.e., accompanied by appropriate policies for financial sector reform and regulation. The
literature shows that countries with higher levels of financial development tend to have higher
growth rates than those with lower levels of financial development. However, rapid and excessive
deepening, as manifested in a credit boom, can be problematic for the banks and
macroeconomic policy management.
13.
There are several factors that impede the growth of financial intermediation in
Guinea-Bissau. A sizable informal sector; where transactions are in cash-basis, insufficient
collateral, and poor financial accounting practices in the business sector, pose significant
obstacles to the development of the financial system and translate into relatively high credit
costs.2 Moreover, a weak infrastructure, a rudimentary payments system, weak legal and judicial
systems, the lack of a credit reference system, and political instability hinder the financial sector’s
ability to provide adequate support for the private sector.
14.
Some key recommendations to improve the role of the MFIs could include:
strengthening the promotion, authorization and inspection, and supervision of the MFIs, by the
ministries of economy, finance and the BCEAO, respectively; strengthening capacity building and
training of MFIs; mobilize financial resources from domestic and international resources, and
wholesale such resources to MFIs on a competitive basis; establishing a credit guarantee fund
that would make it possible for MFIs to lend without significant collateral requirements; supervise
MFIs in accordance with international best practices; and create a bureau of credit and risk
similar to the BCEAO’s one for banks.

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

Allum (IMF) and
Marcelo Giugale and
Jeffrey Lewis (World
Bank- IDA)

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA).1

This debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries (DSA) confirms2 a moderate risk of
debt distress for Guinea-Bissau. Despite a more challenging (especially domestic) environment,
and worsening debt outlook, the projected external debt indicators show a moderate
vulnerability to shocks. The inclusion of domestic public debt into the analysis confirms the
conclusions of the external DSA. Overall, however, risks have increased substantially. Therefore,
the current assessment critically depends on the post-crisis recovery and on the assumption that
the authorities will reestablish prudent fiscal and debt management policies, implement
structural reforms, and have access to concessional borrowing.

The DSA was prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staff, in consultation with the Debt Management Unit of the
Bissau-Guinean Ministry of Finance. The fiscal year for Guinea-Bissau is January 1- December 31.

BACKGROUND
1.
Overall, Guinea-Bissau’s debt outlook improved considerably since the country benefited
from a substantial debt relief, but it has worsened recently due to a more challenging environment.
Following the implementation of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in
December 2010 and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in May 2011, the ratio of public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt to GDP decreased from 122 percent (US$1,066.7 million) at
end 2009 to 27.5 percent (US$232.4 million) at end-2012 (Text Table 1). Most of the debt owed to
multilaterals and official bilateral creditors was canceled, while 53 percent of the remaining debt owed to
non-Paris Club creditors is subject to rescheduling.3 Since then, domestic political instability has led to
some deterioration of Guinea-Bissau’s debt outlook. The economy experienced a recession in 2012 while
development partners, except regional ones, have reduced their support to the country.

Limited access to official external financing has forced the authorities to rely on less
concessional regional borrowing. Since 2010, the authorities have resorted, mainly if not only, to
borrowing at less favorable terms from the regional development bank (the BOAD) to finance their public
investment projects in road construction and rehabilitation, rice production and food security support.
Therefore, the share of the BOAD debt in total debt has increased from 0.1 to about 21 percent within the
last 3 years and may increase even more as the authorities continue their investment effort and official
external financing remains limited in the near future. For the debt sustainability analysis, BOAD debt is
treated as external based on residency basis.4

The government recently signed bilateral agreement with France and Belgium and concluded rescheduling
agreements with the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Islamic Development Bank, Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia. The authorities continue to work on finalizing bilateral agreement with remaining creditors.

According to the Technical Memorandum of Understanding of the program supported by a recent arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the CFAF-denominated debt is considered domestic for debt limits policy
purposes (IMF Country Report No. 11/335).

3.
Public domestic debt decreased in recent years, but may increase quickly again given
limited access to external financing. The ratio of domestic debt to GDP decreased from 36 percent at
end–2009 to 26.3 percent at end–2011 thanks to the authorities’ domestic arrears clearance strategy.
However, funding constraints have resulted in a recent increase in domestic arrears and the suspension of
the domestic arrears’ clearance strategy. In addition, preliminary information of contingent liabilities
suggests that there is a recent explicit government guarantee of an electricity company loan from regional
commercial banks and that the authorities have started to rely on financing from regional commercial
banks to finance their investment projects. Therefore, the ratio of public domestic debt to GDP has
increased to above 30 percent at end-2012 and may increase further in the future.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The macroeconomic outlook has been revised to reflect the impact of a double political and
economic shock that occurred in 2012. Going forward, the baseline scenario assumes that near-term
economic recovery will be affected by uncertain political environment and delays in restoring traditional
development partners’ support; in the medium term, however, a more stable political situation should
bring positive returns in terms of macroeconomic stabilization and economic growth (Text Table 2; Box 1).

1/ Long-term value of the indicator is defined as an average over the last 15 years of the projections.



The near-term growth is expected to be lower and long-term growth is projected to increase
only to 4 percent. This assumes the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms and the authorities’ continued investment effort, although constrained by
limited resources.



The primary fiscal balance is projected to improve, turning into a surplus in 2013 and remaining
in deficit at around 0.2 percent of GDP in the long term, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to
build fiscal space in the context of limited access to borrowing.

The non-interest external current account deficit is expected to improve in the long term
reflecting an upward revision in the fiscal balance and a slightly lower growth in imports.



Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions
In the medium term (2013-18), projections are consistent with the macroeconomic framework of the 2013 Article
IV Consultation. Long-term (2019-33) projections assume a more stable political environment, continued growth
in cashew exports, and positive returns in terms of macroeconomic stabilization and economic growth from
increased public investments and policies implemented in previous years.
Real GDP growth is projected to recover from -1.5 percent in 2012 to 3.5 percent in 2013, fall to about 3 percent
in the medium term, and stabilize at about 4 percent over the long run. Medium-term economic activity would be
affected by the fragile political situation, but, over the long term, benefit from the implementation of investment
projects in agriculture and infrastructure and structural reforms aimed at increasing efficiency and competitiveness
and improving the business climate.
Inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) is projected to stabilize over the medium term at around 1.3 percent.
Over the long term, inflation is projected to increase to about 2.3 percent.
The primary fiscal deficit is assumed to slightly improve over the medium term from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012
to 0.3 percent in the medium term, owing to improvements in public fiscal management and efforts to contain
recurrent expenditures. Over the long run, the primary fiscal balance is projected to remain at about 0.2 percent of
GDP. Over the near-term, government’s domestic debt is projected to slightly increase from 30.9 percent in 2012
to 32.2 percent in 2013. In the long term, domestic debt is expected to decrease to about 5 percent reflecting the
authorities’ commitment to a prudent borrowing strategy and a regular repayment of outstanding arrears.
The non-interest external current account deficit is projected to narrow from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2013 to
2.4 percent of GDP in 2018. In the long term, the current account deficit would stabilize at about 2.4 percent,
reflecting improved export and fiscal performance.
Net foreign direct investment is projected to decrease in the medium term to about 0.6 percent per year and
increase to about 1.3 percent of GDP per year, owing to the stabilization of the political situation, a more favorable
business climate, and improved infrastructure.
Net aid flows (official grants and concessional loans) are expected to decrease to about 6 percent of GDP in the
1
medium- and long-runs reflecting some limited development partners’ support to Guinea-Bissau infrastructure
development and reform efforts. Concessional loans are assumed to be at standard terms, i.e. on 0.25 percent
interest rate with 40 (IDA) and 50 (AFDB) years maturity and ten-year grace period. Over the medium term, some
new external borrowing is assumed to be on less-concessional terms, and this borrowing is expected to increase
moderately as access to concessional financing remains limited. Over the medium- and long-terms, however, the
DSA assumes that the authorities will benefit from some concessional borrowing mainly from multilaterals and will
have only temporary access to commercial debt. In this context, the average grant element of new disbursements
is expected to increase from 21 percent in 2013 to about 30 percent in the long run. The baseline debt scenario
assumes that all creditors will provide HIPC debt relief and topping-up assistance, and remaining debt will be
rescheduled (Text Table 1).
1

Some development partners are expected to channel their aid through non-governmental organizations. Therefore, private aid flows are projected

to increase from about 1 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term.

5.
The present value of external debt has increased following the revision of the discount
rate used in the DSA template. The discount rate was adjusted from 4 percent to 3 percent in 2012
to reflect the evolution of its reference rate, i.e., the long-term U.S dollar commercial interest rate
(CIRR). Therefore, Guinea-Bissau’s debt indicators in PV terms have been revised upward and the
debt outlook worsened. For instance, ceteris paribus, a one percentage point decrease in the

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

discount rate increases the PV of the Guinea-Bissau’s debt-to-GDP ratio by about 2 percentage
points.
6.
New risks to the baseline scenario have emerged. Domestically, a prolonged period of
political instability could undermine the population’s, development and trading partners’ confidence
and lead to a slowdown in economic recovery and lower-than-expected exports. In contrast, a
successful transition period and political stabilization would speed up the economic recovery.
Overall, however, much will also depend on the availability of concessional external financing as well
as on the authorities’ debt management capacity and ability to implement investment projects and
structural reforms. Externally, a weakening external environment could result in lower-than-expected
exports and remittances.5

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
7.
All but one debt indicators are expected to remain below their thresholds6 in the baseline
scenario, but the most extreme shock7 leads to a significant breach of three of them
(Figure 1, Tables 1 and 2). In the baseline scenario, one debt burden indicator – the PV of debt-to-export –
breaches by a limited margin its respective threshold at the beginning of the projection period. On this
basis, Guinea-Bissau could be classified as a high risk country, but the breach is projected to be temporary
as exports are expected to healthily increase over the medium-term due to improved road infrastructure
and some product diversification. In addition, the recent increase in debt-financed investments took place
in the context of a restriction in project grants that is expected to be lifted over the medium-term. Stress
tests indicate, however, that the economy remains vulnerable to a fall in exports and a one-time currency
depreciation shock. The PV of debt-to-export ratio would increase significantly from about 122 percent
in 2013 to 306 percent in 2015 and remain well above the relative threshold for the whole projection
period. The PV of debt-to GDP and revenue ratios would breach the relative thresholds in the first half of
the projection period. Other indicators are also sensitive to the most extreme shock scenario, but do not
breach their corresponding thresholds.
8.
The current assessment presents a considerably worse debt outlook than the previous DSA.
Compared to the previous DSA, the three debt burden indicators have deteriorated significantly on
account of a less favorable macroeconomic framework. At the same time, the two debt service-related
indicators show less favorable debt service trends than the last DSA for the period beyond 2020, reflecting
5

The inclusion of remittances in the analysis, accounting on average for 2.5 percent of GDP, results in only minor
changes of debt burden indicators.
6

Debt sustainability thresholds are determined by the three-year (2009–11) average of the Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating (2.7), which classifies Guinea-Bissau as having low-quality policies and
institutional frameworks.
7

The most extreme shock is calibrated as an export shock in 2014–2015 equal to the historical average (2003–2012)
of export growth minus one standard deviation (in the same period), or a one-time, 30-percent nominal currency
depreciation.

the conclusion of less beneficial than originally expected debt rescheduling agreements with the non-Paris
club creditors.
B. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
9.
Total (external and domestic) public debt indicators are projected to decline gradually
(Figure 2, Tables 3 and 4). In the baseline scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease
from about 56 percent in 2013 to 16 percent in 2033, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to
decline from 334 percent to 90 percent, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would fall from 11 percent
in 2013 to 5 percent at the end of the projection period. These indicators are projected to increase initially
when compared to the previous DSA, reflecting a deterioration of economic environment and the signing
of less favorable than expected debt rescheduling agreements, but the authorities’ prudent borrowing
strategy and a limited access to external financing would result in their more gradual decrease afterwards.
10.
Moderate risks to the baseline may occur if key macroeconomic variables remain
unchanged at historical levels.8 Under the historical scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP and revenue ratios
would decline slightly and remain at around 53 and 275 percent in 2033, respectively. The debt service-torevenue ratio is expected to grow and remain at around 11 percent after 2026. Other stress tests do not
point to significant vulnerability. The risks posed by contingent liabilities, which can be approximated by
a 20 percent of GDP increase in other debt creating flows, appear contained as well.

CONCLUSION
11.
In the staff’s view, Guinea-Bissau continues to face a moderate risk of debt distress under
the assumptions of medium-term gradual economic recovery, sound policies, and continued
structural reforms. Although, the external debt outlook worsened compared to the previous assessment,
the baseline scenario indicates a limited small and temporary breach of one indicative threshold at the
beginning of the projection period, while the stress tests result in the breach of three of them. The breach
in the debt-to-export threshold in the baseline scenario is due to ongoing investment efforts to improve
the country’s infrastructure and its export base. This justifies maintaining a moderate risk of debt distress
for the moment. The inclusion of domestic public debt in the analysis confirms that the country’s debt
position presents a moderate vulnerability to shocks for now. Nevertheless, risks have increased
substantially and the debt sustainability critically depends on the normalization of the political situation and
sound macroeconomic and debt management policies in the context of limited access to borrowing.
12.
The authorities broadly agree with the staff conclusions and policy recommendations. The
authorities concur that debt sustainability depends critically on the ability to access concessional financing,
improvements in potential economic growth, and sound macroeconomic and prudent debt management
policies. However, the authorities noted that if concessional financing is difficult to access, the country may
need to borrow at less concessional terms to finance structural reforms and investment projects.
8

Real GDP growth and the primary fiscal balance (in percent of GDP) would remain at their 10-year averages, i.e. at
2.6 percent and -3.5 percent, respectively.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; capital grants; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, grow th of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrow ing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the low er level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in w hich the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point

corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.

Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt
relief.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The most recent safeguards
assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update assessment
found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the operational level. The overall
governance framework needed nonetheless to be strengthened by the addition of an audit
committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the
control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements. Such committee
was established after the completion of the assessment following the Institutional Reform of
the WAMU and the BCEAO. Efforts to implement fully the International Financial Reporting
Standards should also be pursued. An update assessment was initiated in February 2013.
Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guinea Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from
January 1, 1997. It joined the WAEMU in 1997, and has no separate legal tender. The exchange
system common to all members of the union is free from multiple currency practices and
exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has been pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate
of € l=CFAF 655.957. On April 30, 2013, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of the SDR was
CFAF 757.217=SDR 1. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based
on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional
change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the
exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.
Article IV Consultation
Guinea-Bissau is on the 24–month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions with Guinea-Bissau were held in Bissau January 12–26, 2010. The staff report
(Country Report No. 10/117) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 7, 2010.

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
1.
Guinea-Bissau joined the World Bank three years after independence in 1977. The
International Development Association (IDA) has approved 44 projects (including trust
funded projects) for Guinea-Bissau, totaling commitments of US$383 million. As a grant
recipient, Guinea-Bissau has 4 current grants from the IDA as of April 23, 2013. The current
portfolio consists of IDA lending operations and Trust Funds. IDA-funded projects amount
US$42.85 million. They include multi-sector infrastructure rehabilitation, emergency electricity

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUINEA-BISSAU

and water rehabilitation, bio-diversity conservation, community-driven development, and
regional fisheries. Trust-funded grants - drawing on European Union funds, the State and
Peace-Building Fund, and the Global Environmental Facility - provide an additional
US$12.45 million for emergency food security, including rice production and school
feeding/food-for-work programs in collaboration with the World Food Program (WFP), as well
as coastal and biodiversity management, participatory rural development, and to provide
technical assistance to the emerging extractive industries sectors.
The sixteenth replenishment of IDA’s resources (IDA16) yielded an allocation of
SDR 16.3 million (about US $26.3 million) for Guinea-Bissau for the period of July 2011 through
July 2014. The country still has an IDA16 allocation of about SDR 12.7 that might be to use if
full re-engagement takes place. As of April 23, 2013, Guinea-Bissau had 6 credits from the IDA.
As a borrower, based on an original principle of US$ 84 million, US$88.6 million has been
disbursed. Guinea-Bissau’s borrower’s obligation is US$55.2 million.
Budget Support Operations
2.
Since 2008, after a period of discontinuation of budget support due to political
instability, the Bank initiated new budget support operations to Guinea-Bissau, first with
an emergency economic rehabilitation operation in 2008 that provided funds exclusively for
the payment of primary teachers’ salaries, and then with a series of three programmatic
Development Policy Grants, of which the first one was approved in June 2009 and disbursed in
early September (US$8 million), the second one approved in June 2010 and disbursed in
December 2010 (US$6 million), and a third one approved in June 2011 (US$6.4 million). At time
of publication, one project has been approved since mid-2011, US$3.2 million for Extractive
Industries Sectors Technical Assistance in October 2011.
Lending Program
3.
In June 2009, the Bank approved an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for GuineaBissau for 2009–2011, based on two pillars: (i) Strengthening Economic Management
and Laying the Foundations for Improvement in the Productive Sectors; and
(ii) Increased Access to Basic Services. The ISN bridged the time until Guinea-Bissau reached
HIPC completion point (December 2010), and a second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP II in September 2011) was prepared. A new 4-year Country Assistance Strategy paper’s
preparation was suspended following the April 2012 coup. A new ISN is currently being
prepared, expected to be released in 2014.
4.
There are eleven actively funded World Bank projections or operations
in Guinea-Bissau. The current IDA Portfolio is composed of six active operations with a total
commitment of about US$42.85 million. The focus has been on a Multi-Sector Infrastructure
Rehabilitation project (US$15 million), along with an Emergency Electricity & Water
Rehabilitation Project (US$12.7 million). Other projects include a Rural Community
Developmental Project (US$5 million), a Participatory Rural Development Project

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

GUINEA-BISSAU

(US$5 million), Additional Financing for an Emergency Electricity and Water Rehabilitation
Project (US$2.2 million), and a Biodiversity Conservation Project (US$.95 million). As of
April 1, 2013, the IDA undisbursed balance was US$15.7 million.
5.
Trust-funded grants provide an additional US$20 million for emergency food
security, including rice production and school feeding/food-for-work programs in
collaboration with the United Nations World Food Program (WFP). These trust-funded
grants also go toward coastal and biodiversity management, and technical assistance for
economic management, for extractive industries, and for the health sector. The trust-funded
grants draw on the Global Environmental Facility (which helps supports the Biodiversity
Conservation Project), the State Peace-Building (SPF) Trust Fund (Participatory Rural
Development, Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Finance on Economic Management,
Extractive Industries Sectors Technical Assistance) and European Union funds. In
December 2012, the Bank’s Food Crisis Response Program (US$5 million) recommended the
resumption of disbursements to existing operations, extending the closing date of the
program to June 30, 2013. However, at the end of March, 2013, the WFP’s Global Food Crisis
Response Program lacked additional financing, requiring US$7.1 million to carry out food
assistance activities through the end 2013.
Non-lending Program
6.
On December 14, 2010, the IDA Board of Executive Directors approved the
achievement of the HIPC Completion Point for Guinea-Bissau. IDA provided MDRI debt
forgiveness by irrevocably canceling Guinea-Bissau’s debt service obligations for credits
disbursed before December 31, 2003 and still outstanding at December 31, 2010, after the
application of HIPC assistance and topping up. In March 21, 2011, the IDA Board of Executive
Directors approved the topping-up additional debt relief. IDA debt service reduction under the
enhanced HIPC initiative, MDRI and topping-up assistance at Completion Point amounts to
US$263.7 million.
7.
The Joint Staff Advisory Note on the PRSP II was completed in September 2011.
Covering the period from 2011–2015, the objectives of the PRSP II are to significantly reduce
poverty, create and expand income-generation opportunities, and improve access to public
services in the context of strengthened public institutions and an enhanced rule of law. Linking
its strategy explicitly to Millennium Development Goals (MDG) outcomes, the PRSP II
represents a comprehensive development strategy based on four pillars: (i) strengthening the
rule of law and improving the efficacy of public administration; (ii) guaranteeing
macroeconomic stability, consolidating public financial management reforms and fostering
robust private-sector development; (iii) promoting sustainable broad-based economic growth;
and (iv) enhancing human development.

have been in the social sector, 22.1 percent in agriculture, 18.9 percent in the multi-sector,
18.6 percent in transport and 10 percent in public utilities. A total of UA 164.09 millions
representing 87.9 percent of net commitments have been disbursed. As of April 2013, the
active portfolio comprises five ongoing projects representing a total net amount of
UA 28.76 million and a disbursed amount of UA 9.95 million.

9.
During the period January 2008–April 2013, AFDB approved an interim HIPC debt
release (US$17.48 million), a Fragile State Facility grant (UA 2 million), a fish sector
support grant (UA 2 million), a health sector grant (UA 6 million), an emergency support
grant to cholera (UA 0.33 million), a capacity building grant to public administration
(UA 7.86 million) and an emergency budget support to budgetary reforms
(UA 5.7 million).
Non-lending Program
10.
The AFDB undertook a mid-term review of its Country Strategy Paper (CSP)
in 2009 as well as a combined portfolio review and completion report of its
CSP 2005–2010, in October 2010. The AFDB has more recently released a CSP for 2012–2016
in November 2011. A Regional Integration Strategy Paper for West Africa for 2011–2015 was
released in March 2011. Africa-wide Country Performance Assessment (CPA), Country
Governance Rating (CGR), Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Country
Portfolio Performance Assessment (PPA) all which included Guinea-Bissau, were released in
March 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Shortcomings are most serious in the national accounts and balance of payments. Data
compilation was impaired during the 1998–99 civil conflict. Given weak capacity and
outdated practices, the authorities have improved their data compilation in the recent years,
with technical assistance from international and regional institutions.
National Accounts: In the second quarter of 2010, the National Institute of Statistics (INE)
published revised national accounts data for 2003–08, based on the System of National
Accounts 1993. Since then, the INE has continued to release annual national accounts data.
The new data have a broader coverage of all sectors of the economy, and as a result, the
GDP level has doubled. The new data provides GDP in both current and constant (2003)
prices, and GDP deflators.
Price statistics: Since July 2002, a harmonized consumer price index (CPI) has been
compiled, based on the same methodology as in other West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) countries. The CPI was updated in 2010 (new base year 2008–2009,
improvement in compilation techniques, extended coverage of products and increase in
outlets). Price data are collected only for the capital city, Bissau.
Government finance statistics: Since 2007, the monthly worksheet table for the State
Financial Operations is compiled on a regular basis and used as a basic tool for monitoring
the program by the IMF. In March 2010, a government finance statistics (GFS) mission from
West AFRITAC provided technical assistance to the authorities in compiling and
disseminating GFS and implementing action plans designed to improve the GFS data
dissemination to users. Under the West AFRITAC work program, a government finance
statistics technical assistance mission is planned to take place in the second half of 2013.
Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics, compiled and disseminated by the
regional Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), are broadly adequate, and their
institutional coverage is comprehensive. Accuracy is somewhat hampered by the use of
outdated sorting coefficients to estimate cross-border amounts of banknotes among BCEAO
countries, which in turn are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net
foreign assets of each member country.

Balance of Payments Statistics: Guinea-Bissau reports trade data to AFR for operational
purposes, using information from customs. Balance of payments data are weak, mostly due
to substantial unregistered trade and inconsistencies between data on net foreign assets as
reported by the BCEAO and other economic indicators. The large number of small-scale
operators, a large informal sector, and institutional weaknesses (only some 20 percent of
businesses file tax returns) hamper the data collection. While no external debt data are
published by the Ministry of Finance, stock and flow data are regularly produced and
transmitted to the BCEAO.

Data Standards and Quality
Guinea-Bissau has participated in the General
Data Dissemination System since
November 2001. Metadata for all data
categories and plans for improvement need to
be updated.

No data ROSC is available.

Reporting to STA
Currently no monthly, quarterly or annual government finance data is submitted for
reporting in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. Monthly data on monetary statistics for Guinea Bissau are reported on a regular
basis for publication in the IFS with some delays. Guinea-Bissau reports balance of payments
and international investment position statistics to STA on an annual basis with considerable
delays.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Guinea-Bissau
On June 21, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau.1
Background
A military coup d’état in April 2012 set back some progress achieved in previous years toward
improved macroeconomic policies. The coup led to a sharp drop in cashew nut export volumes
and a suspension of traditional donors’ aid that was only partially offset by increased budget
support from region. As a result, the economy contracted by 1½ percent in 2012. Despite some
upward pressures on prices driven by food and fuel shortages, the impact on headline inflation
was muted in light of low domestic demand pressures. Twelve-month inflation was about
2 percent at end-2012. The external current account deficit deteriorated, reflecting also a fall in
cashew export prices. The resulting sizeable reduction in fiscal revenues led to a deterioration
in spending composition and fiscal control. Some domestic arrears were accumulated in 2012,
although the government completely cut domestically-financed capital spending.
Economic growth will recover somewhat in 2013, but overall prospects remain difficult.
Assuming a recovery in cashew exports and continued support from regional partners, real
gross domestic product (GDP) could increase by about 3½ percent in 2013. But the near-term
outlook hinges on a rapid resolution of the current political crisis. Most development partners
maintain only limited working relations with the interim government. Until the political situation is
normalized and development partners resume their full financial support, the economy will

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

remain highly vulnerable and social conditions would likely deteriorate. Inflationary pressures
are projected to remain moderate. The current account deficit is projected to fall relative to 2012,
owing to the recovery of cashew export earnings.
The economic outlook is subject to external and domestic risks. The persistent political crisis is
likely to continue to compromise external financing flows, which could result in fiscal slippages
and a slowdown in economic growth. A delayed cashew export campaign also poses a
downside risk. On the other hand, rising unemployment rates in the Euro area can have a
negative impact on remittances and domestic demand.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted Guinea-Bissau’s fragile economic conditions amid a difficult political
situation, weak donor support, and downside risks to the external sector. While the economy is
expected to rebound in 2013, re-establishment of macroeconomic stability, normalization of the
political situation, restoration of donor and investor confidence, and acceleration of structural
reforms will be needed to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors stressed the importance of timely approval of a prudent 2013 budget based on
realistic revenue projections and a tight expenditure envelope. Given limited financing options,
strict fiscal controls and contingency planning should help protect social expenditures and avoid
a surge in arrears. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve transparency in the
management of the fund to promote the industrialization of agricultural products (FUNPI).
For the medium term, Directors stressed the importance of building fiscal space. Efforts,
supported by continued technical assistance, should focus on increasing tax revenues by
broadening the tax base and strengthening tax and customs administration and enhancing
public financial management. Directors emphasized that prudent fiscal and debt management
policies will be critical to maintain debt sustainability.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reforms to boost competitiveness and
achieve inclusive and diversified growth, which will also be essential to reduce vulnerability to
shocks. Priority should be given to enhancing the business environment and improving physical
infrastructure and access to financial services. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to
improve access to credit for financially neglected groups and to review the labor law to promote
employment.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Guinea-Bissau
June 21, 2013

Introduction
My Bissau-Guinean authorities thank the Executive Board, Management and Staff for the
support they are receiving from the Fund since the resumption of the cooperation early
this year. They are appreciative of the policy dialogue held with staff under the 2013
Article IV consultation held in May in Bissau. My authorities broadly agree with staff’s
analysis and recommendations which they fully take into account in their efforts to
address the challenges facing Guinea-Bissau.
Following the coup d’état that occurred in April 2012, Guinea-Bissau is experiencing a
difficult economic and political situation aggravated by the suspension of support from its
main development partners. Given the daunting development challenges, my authorities
look forward to Fund technical and financial assistance. It is their view that Fund support
under an ECF will help them develop and implement a medium-term program of
economic reform and macroeconomic stabilization, as well as being a catalyst for
additional assistance from development partners.
In this regard, the presidential elections are scheduled to take place in November 2013.
In the meantime, an inclusive government made up of all political stakeholders has been
formed on June 12, 2013 to implement the measures required to the holding of these
elections with the technical and financial assistance of the international community. In
addition, the efforts of this inclusive government will be devoted to reverse the economic
situation through the restoration of good governance and macroeconomic stability.
Economic Developments in 2012
The lack of financial support from the main development partners added to the disruption
in cashew exports led to a significant deterioration of the macroeconomic situation. In
particular, economic growth contracted by 1.5 percent in 2012 and government revenue
fell significantly leading to a further accumulation of domestic arrears and a large
overall fiscal deficit. Moreover, the external current account deficit reached 6.5 percent
of GDP in 2012 against 1.2 percent in 2011. However, inflation remained low at about
2.1 percent. Guinea-Bissau, is a member of WAEMU, and follows a regional monetary
policy. Guinea-Bissau’s membership in the common monetary zone has served the
country well. Its real exchange rate is in line with the country’s fundamentals.
Policy Measures for Near and Medium-Terms
My Bissau- Guinean authorities are of the view that diversifying the economy, reducing
the widespread poverty and creating employment opportunities will help root-out the

2
main causes of instability experienced by the country over the past years. They are
committed to implement economic policies and reforms geared at preserving
macroeconomic stability and creating an enabling environment for private sector-led
growth. In particular their efforts will be focused on increasing the fiscal space,
strengthening the financial sector, maintain debt sustainability and improving the
business environment.
1. Fiscal Policy
The authorities’ fiscal measures are aimed at restoring fiscal discipline to enhance the
restoration of macroeconomic stability. The implementation of envisaged measures under
the interim period will help increase the fiscal revenue, exercise strict fiscal controls to
avoid further domestic arrears and protect priority spending.
For 2013, with a view to encourage cashew production and exports, the authorities are in
the process of reviewing the export tax and the floor price on cashew. In addition, they
are also committed to record in the national budget the operations of the fund to promote
the industrialization of agricultural products (FUNPI) to ensure its transparent
management and operation.
The authorities also envisage implementing a medium-term fiscal program designed to
help increase the country’s tax performance at the regional level. In this respect, they are
of the view that measures to increase revenue should include a rationalization of existing
tax exemptions and strengthening of tax and customs administrations. Moreover they
intend to establish a reform coordination and fiscal modernization unit with a view to
further strengthen the fiscal reforms. The pension system for public employees will be
reviewed to ensure a strict control on government’s transfers. With the assistance of the
international community, the authorities will pursue their efforts towards the
demobilization and professionalization of the military forces.
2. Debt Sustainability
The authorities welcome the Staff recent DSA and agree on the need to preserve the
country’s debt sustainability. In this regard, they will continue to implement sound
macroeconomic and prudent debt management policies. Borrowing will be further
improved and more focused on concessional financing notably in favor of development
projects. Moreover, the authorities plan to resume the publication of quarterly reports on
the total public debt and extend to the central bank (BCEAO) the debt management
system (SYGADE) with a view to further improve the debt monitoring capacity. They
will also pursue their efforts to finalize, under the post-HIPC context, agreements with
the remaining official creditors
3. Financial Sector
The authorities will pursue efforts to improve the contribution of the financial sector to
the country’s economic development. In this regard, they will enhance the steps aimed at

3
encouraging payment via the banking system of tax collection and public salaries. They
intend also to consolidate the existing initiatives in the microfinance sector by revising
the national strategy document and signing a partnership agreement with the African
Microfinance. The banking supervision will be further enhanced to reduce the high levels
of NPLs due mostly to the rise in unpaid loans of cashew exporters.
In addition, the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the anti-money laundering will be further
pursued with the implementation of the 2012 AML/CFT law. The financial intelligence
will be operational as well as the AML/CFT supervision of financial institutions with the
support from external assistance.
4. Structural Reforms
The Bissau-Guinean authorities are determined to improve the climate for business and
investment by removing impediments to the promotion of a dynamic private sector. The
one-stop shop established in 2011 has been reactivated to simplify registration of private
enterprises.
The authorities plan also to improve the country’s human and institutional capacities
which are essential to promote transparency and good governance. In this context, the
labor law is under review. A new natural resource management framework will be issued
to enhance the institutional capacity of the natural resources sector.
Conclusion
Guinea Bissau’s economy has been severely affected by recent events. However, it is the
intention of the authorities to reverse the situation, but given the magnitude of the
challenges they will require the strong support of the international community in this
endeavor. Already, they have taken steps in this direction and economic performance in
2013 will be much improved from 2012. However, the country needs to embark on a
medium term program of reforms and adjustment to address the vulnerabilities and put
the economy on a sustainable growth path.
The authorities have already shown their determination to take the necessary measures.
Elections will be held before the end of the year and presently all major political stake
holders are cooperating in this effort and in implementing prudent economic and financial
policies. My authorities are hopeful that the country will benefit from stronger Fund
assistance in the form of a Fund-supported program, as well as additional technical
assistance. It is their hope that donors and development partners will also support GuineaBissau in their development efforts to raise growth and reduce poverty.
