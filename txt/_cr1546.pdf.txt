STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Malta has weathered the crisis well and its economic outlook is stronger than that
of the euro area as a whole. Real GDP growth accelerated to 2.5 percent in 2013, and
the external position remained strong. This reflects a relatively diversified economy and a
stable banking sector, which withstood well the economic slowdown and shocks from
international financial markets. The stronger than expected growth pushed the fiscal
deficit in 2013 below 3 percent of GDP. Remaining vulnerabilities stem from high public
debt, elevated non-performing loans, high cost of capital, and the need to maintain
competitiveness.
To raise growth in a sustainable manner and reduce vulnerabilities, the policy
priorities are:


Strengthening fiscal sustainability. The budgetary targets for 2015–2017 are
welcome but meeting them is subject to risks. The authorities need to continue the
progress towards meeting the medium-term objective of a balanced budget in
structural terms. In particular, broad based reforms of expenditures, pensions,
healthcare, state owned enterprises (SOEs), and fiscal governance are the priorities.



Maintaining financial stability. Bank regulatory and supervisory frameworks have
been recently strengthened in several areas. The largest banks passed the ECB’s
recent Comprehensive Assessment (CA) without a need to raise additional capital.
Priorities to preserve financial stability include: (i) vigilance over risks from the high
concentration of core domestic banks’ exposure to the property market and high
NPLs; and (ii) further improving the bank regulatory, supervisory, and contingency
frameworks.



Enhancing competitiveness and reducing the cost of capital. The priorities
include improving labor participation and productivity, and reforming the judicial
system to enhance the business environment. Measures, such as developing and
implementing a strategy for NPL resolution and implementing the planned credit
registry, will help lower the cost of capital.

CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK: RESILIENT ECONOMY
1.
Malta’s economy has remained
resilient since the global crisis. Spillovers from
turmoil in financial markets have been contained
because of low reliance on external finance by
domestic banks and the government. Real GDP
has increased at one of the highest rates in the
euro area since the crisis, supported by relatively
diversified exports and, more recently, by
domestic demand. At the same time,
unemployment has declined close to its historical
lows—among the lowest in the euro area—
despite increasing labor participation rates.

Growth is strong while inflation has
declined along with the euro area trend (Table 1). The economy expanded by 2.5 percent
in 2013, driven by domestic demand. Growth further accelerated to 3.6 percent (y-o-y) in the first
nine months of 2014, supported by investment in large scale energy infrastructure projects and
consumption. Inflation remained subdued at around 0.75 percent, reflecting lower oil prices, a
decline in electricity tariffs, and low inflation in the euro area. Core inflation has been running
higher, at about 1.5 percent, reflecting a closed output gap.

3.
Malta has made impressive strides in improving its external balances, but unit labor
costs are rising faster than in trading partners (Figure 5, Appendix 1). The trade balance reverted
from a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of 9.2 percent of GDP in the first three
quarters of 2014. Robust export growth after the crisis has reflected a diversified export base, both
geographically and across sectors, and rapidly growing exports of services. Exports, however, grew

MALTA

only marginally in 2014, partly reflecting a drop in the semiconductor sector. The current account
remained positive at 8.1 percent of GDP, mainly driven by lower goods imports and a shrinking
deficit in the primary income account. At the same time, unit labor costs have been increasing at
one of the fastest rates in the euro area, posing risks for competitiveness when many euro area
neighbors are undertaking structural reforms and internal devaluations.

Despite a growing economy, credit to corporations has remained weak, and the cost of
capital has remained relatively high. Loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs) had been
declining and only recently have stabilized at around a zero growth rate. At the same time, NFCs’
lending rates have remained high relative the euro area average—despite the decline in ECB policy
rates and a sound banking system—making it difficult for viable firms, particularly smaller ones, to
access credit. High lending rates could reflect various factors, including higher funding cost of banks
(relative to the ECB policy rates), limited competition, high level of NPL ratios, and relatively high
corporate sector leverage, particularly for smaller firms and in certain sectors (Appendices 2 and 3).

Overall, the baseline outlook is strong. In particular:



Growth is projected to remain robust, at around 3 percent in 2015–16. The output gap is slightly
positive and is expected to close over the next two years. Domestic demand is supported by
large scale investment projects in the energy sector and strong household income from rising
wages and employment. Lower oil prices are expected to raise growth marginally in 2015. Over
the medium-term growth is projected at 2.6 percent, slightly higher than the average since the
EU accession on account of increased labor force participation.



Inflation is projected to rise slowly as upward pressures from a small positive output gap and
higher unit labor costs are expected to be dampened by planned reduction in energy tariffs, the
pass-through of lower global oil prices and euro area inflation.



The current account surplus will persist, supported by lower oil prices in 2015, the projected
gradual recovery in external demand, Malta’s continued competitiveness in the services sector,
and the planned transfers of EU structural funds, despite the uncertainty surrounding the
primary income account reflecting transactions of international banks (Table 3).

6.
Risks to the outlook are balanced (Risk Assessment Matrix). In the short-term, prolonged
stagnation and deflation in the euro area would reduce external demand and make fiscal adjustment
more challenging. Medium-term risks of delays in implementing energy infrastructure projects and
restructuring state-owned enterprises are balanced by the possibility of positive spillovers to private
investment and consumption from ongoing large scale investment projects. Broader than expected
changes in the EU regulatory framework and tax reforms could erode Malta’s competitiveness
especially if implementation of structural reforms in Malta is delayed while many other euro area
countries continue to reduce their unit labor costs. Fiscal slippages and a further increase in public
debt could feed into higher financing costs, crowding out private investment.
Box 1. Exchange Rate Assessment
Since the last Article IV consultation, the real effective exchange rate (REER based on INS), is
depreciated by about 1.5 percent. Real effective exchange rates remain elevated relative to trading partners,
and the gap between the ULC and CPI based REER persists (Figure 5).
Nevertheless, estimates of exchange rate
valuation are broadly in line with
fundamentals. While the macro balance
and external sustainability approaches show
a small undervaluation, the equilibrium
exchange rate approach points at an
overvaluation of about 6 percent.

Authorities’ views
7.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and risks. Staff’s growth projections are
marginally more optimistic than the Central Bank’s, reflecting recent oil price and exchange rate
developments, while the Ministry of Finance expected higher growth rates in 2015 and 2016 (3.5 and
3.4 percent, respectively) on account of more favorable external assumptions. Continued strong
performance of the tourism industry was also expected to support growth. The authorities saw the
external environment as one of the main sources of downside risks, including for the recovery of
semiconductor exports. They noted that the downside risk of investment project delays is balanced
by the possibility of stronger than expected consumption due to improved confidence and labor
market conditions. The risk of loss of competitiveness from changes in regulation and tax reform
was seen as modest as the authorities emphasized still-relatively-low labor costs, flexibility and
availability of skilled labor, and Malta’s overall diversification and dynamism as the main sources of
competitiveness.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUSTAINING GROWTH AND
REDUCING VULNERABILITIES
8.
Despite the broadly favorable outlook, Malta faces important challenges: public debt is
still high; non-performing loans are elevated; the cost of capital is relatively high despite abundant
liquidity; and maintaining competitiveness is increasingly difficult. To raise growth in a sustainable
manner and reduce vulnerabilities, the policy agenda should focus on: 1) strengthening fiscal
sustainability; 2) maintaining financial stability; and 3) enhancing competitiveness and reducing the
cost of capital.

A. Strengthening Fiscal Sustainability
9.
Malta has made significant progress in reducing its overall deficit and strengthening
fiscal governance since the last Article IV consultation. Stronger than expected growth helped
lower the fiscal deficit by almost 1 percentage point to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013, and debt
reached 69.5 percent of GDP, partly reflecting stock-flow adjustments. Fiscal consolidation has
continued in 2014, despite rapidly growing current expenditures, financed by stronger-thanexpected revenues. Staff estimates the fiscal deficit to decline to 2.2 percent in 2014. The authorities
enacted the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) over the summer, introducing i) a balanced-budget rule
and a debt rule in line with EU requirements; ii) an independent fiscal council to monitor fiscal rules;
iii) the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement and the Fiscal Policy Strategy; iv) a fiscal risk statement;
and v) a contingency reserve to be built over the next five years.
Staff’s views
10.
The budgetary targets for 2015-2017 are welcome but meeting them will be
challenging. The authorities aim at bringing the structural deficit to -0.4 percent in 2017, implying

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MALTA

an annual average fiscal consolidation of about 0.6 percent of GDP. The implied pace of adjustment
strikes an appropriate balance between adjusting towards the MTO of balanced budget in structural
terms and limiting its impact on growth. However, the authorities’ target for 2015 (-1.6 percent of
GDP) is based almost entirely on revenue measures, and the underlying growth projections rely on
favorable external assumptions. To ensure that the proposed fiscal targets are met, additional
expenditure measures should be considered. These measures should be designed to contain the fast
growth in current spending— including through prudent wage agreements and further restraint on
public sector employment— while preserving incentives for labor participation and education, and
capital spending. Given weaker growth assumptions, possible slippages in the wage bill and
subsidies relative to the targets, and lack of specific measures beyond 2015, staff project an overall
deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2015 and 1.5 percent for 2017 (Table 2). Staff project debt to reach
69.8 percent in 2015, gradually declining to around 62 percent of GDP by 2020. Low inflation and
growth, and contingent liabilities are the key risks (DSA Annex).
11.
Broad-based reforms—on expenditures, pension, and healthcare— are critical to
contain fiscal pressures going forward. The authorities have started a Public Expenditure Review
(PER) process, and the main progress has been made in social security spending. Building on this
initiative, a comprehensive spending review would help prioritize and contain spending. In addition,
such a review would facilitate improvements in the efficiency of spending, for example on education
and health, where outcomes remain weak despite high spending levels. On pension reforms, while a
private third pillar pension scheme was introduced in 2014, progress has been limited. Further
measures—such as accelerating the planned increase in the retirement age and linking pensionable
income to a longer period of working years— are needed to curb the projected increase in public
pension outlays.1 On health care, initial steps in improving medical procurement have been taken,
increasing access to drugs and controlling costs. The government is also planning to establish cost
centers within hospitals aiming to enhance management practices. However, progress in reforms

Note: The age-related spending is going to be updated
given new populations statistics. New estimates will
likely yield lower expected expenditure.

The retirement age is set to gradually reach 65 years for both genders only in 2027, whereas 16 EU member
states will have already reached or exceeded this level by 2020. No further increases are envisaged. While
recently revised population projections will likely result in lower projections for age-related spending, there is
still a gap between the projected outlays and available resources.

and its impact on the budget are expected to be modest and gradual. Accelerating the
implementation of planned health care measures—such as increasing the administrative efficiency
and strengthening primary care— will help contain spending growth.
12.
The authorities should continue to push forward with restructuring of state-owned
corporations and overall fiscal reforms. Given the extent of ongoing restructuring efforts and
implications on the budget, it is important to disclose, analyze, and manage risks to public finances
from the state owned enterprises in a consolidated manner. Enemalta’s (the utility company)
restructuring, once completed as planned, will bolster public finances, reduce guaranteed debt
(16 percent of GDP in 2014, about 60 percent of which is due to Enemalta) and help lower energy
costs.2 As the privatization agreement is at its final stages, a part of the proceeds has been already
used to cover the tax arrears, and the rest is going to be used to reduce bank loans. Regarding the
infrastructure projects—essential to reduce production costs—the interconnector to Sicily is almost
complete, but the completion of one of the power plants, originally scheduled for 2015, is now
delayed to 2016. To ensure a sustainable financial position, tariff reductions should be backed by
cost containment. The restructuring of Airmalta is continuing (involving a total government injection
of €130 million, about 1¾ percent of GDP, to be completed by 2016), but the company is facing
challenges in breaking even as planned. Recent nationalization of the public transport company has
led to an increase in subsidies (about 1/3 percent of GDP). The authorities are in the process of its
re-privatization. Staff encouraged the full implementation of the FRA for the next budget period,
which would help manage risks, including from the SOEs, in a multi-year framework. In addition,
ongoing initiatives to integrate the revenue administration agencies will help improve the overall
budgetary process.
Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities acknowledged the risks, but were confident that their deficit targets
would be met. They noted that the fiscal deficit declined by 1 percentage point in 2013, and
additional expenditures in 2014 were concentrated on priority areas, such as health care and
education. On SOEs, the authorities anticipate that the expected cost and efficiency gains from
Enemalta’s restructuring would cover the tariff reductions implemented in 2014 and 2015. In
addition, they noted that SOEs are subject to public scrutiny individually. On pension reforms, the
authorities noted that they would wait for the results of the updated projections for pension
spending based on new population statistics before taking any additional measures. On fiscal
reforms, the authorities intend to implement the FRA for the next budget period, starting with the
appointment of a fiscal council. They also noted that the National Audit Office reviewed the macro
and fiscal projections for the 2015 budget. On spending review, they emphasized that progress has

During recent years, Enemalta’s losses have averaged at around 1 percent GDP, partially met by subsidies,
and led to buildup of the guaranteed debt. The authorities signed a memorandum of understanding for a
strategic partnership with the Shanghai Electric Power in 2013 and are in the process of completing the deal,
selling a 33 percent stake in Enemalta and undertaking energy infrastructure projects.

been made on social security, and they are considering expanding it to other sectors, including
through technical assistance by the IMF.

B. Financial Sector Policies
14.
The Maltese financial system remains resilient. Solvency and liquidity of banks remain
well above regulatory requirements, and profitability is good (Table 5). Solid performance of core
domestic banks reflects their conservative business model, particularly limited external assets and
liabilities and relatively low loan-to-value ratios. As a result, the largest banks passed the ECB’s
recent Comprehensive Assessment (CA) without a need to raise additional capital. The large
segment of international banks has very limited links with domestic residents, and as a result the
recent significant deleveraging of some of these banks had minimal impact on the local economy
(Box 2)3. While there may be some spillovers to domestic financial system from stronger crossborder deleveraging and/or regulatory changes elsewhere, the impact on the economy is likely to
be limited.

Box 2. Malta: Overview of the Financial Sector
The Maltese financial sector is very large compared to the size of its economy. As of mid-2014, assets of
banks were close to 7 times GDP and assets of non-bank financial institutions (insurance companies and
investment funds) were around 2 times GDP. The financial institutions in each of these groups can be classified
as either domestic or international, depending on the scope of their involvement in activities with residents.
Risks and vulnerabilities related to domestic institutions differ substantially from those related to international
institutions. For banks, the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) also separates the category of domestic institutions
into core domestic banks and non-core domestic banks.



Core domestic banks have a traditional business model of attracting household and corporate deposits
and providing loans to the economy. These banks have limited external assets and liabilities, provide
around 97 percent of bank lending to residents in Malta, and collect around 94 percent of resident
deposits. Two banks account for over 90 percent of both loans to and deposits from residents. Core
domestic banks that are subsidiaries of big foreign parent banks have not relied on parent funding for
their operations in Malta. As of end-June 2014, the core domestic banks had an aggregate capital
adequacy ratio of 14.9 percent and liquidity ratio (liquid assets to short-term liabilities) of 42.6 percent,
well above the minimum requirements of 8 percent and 30 percent, respectively.



International banks rely mostly on wholesale (including intra-group) funding and nonresident deposits of
relatively long maturities. These banks concentrate on activities for the group (custodian services, trade
finance, investment banking). While international banks are particularly large compared to the size of the
economy, risks to systemic financial stability arising from these banks are rather low. With negligible direct
balance sheet links to the domestic economy both from the assets and the liabilities sides, the systemic
financial implications in the event of materialization of solvency or liquidity risk affecting international
banks would be contained. Furthermore, with abundant capital and liquidity, these banks should be able to
absorb significant pressures before the point of non viability.



Non-core domestic banks have limited links with the domestic economy and are funded primarily from
wholesale markets and non-resident deposits. Unlike the international banks, these banks have some
(albeit still small) exposure to residents in the form of loans and deposits. Around 9 percent of assets and
12 percent of liabilities are respectively claims on and due to residents. Therefore, the main risks related to
these banks stem from possible cross-border deleveraging pressures and claims on the local deposit
compensation scheme in the event of bank failure.

The non-bank financial institutions are relatively small, and the main systemic risk arising from these
institutions relates to their interconnectedness with core domestic banks. Around one third of insurance
companies (with assets of €2.4 billion as of end-2013) and investment funds (with assets of €0.8 billion) are
classified as domestic. The insurance sector is dominated by one company, which has a market share of around
60 percent in terms of assets. Assets of insurance companies and investment funds mainly consist of shares
and equity holdings, of which over one half is issued outside Malta. Core domestic banks hold a significant
shareholding in several domestic insurance companies, while over 10 percent of insurers’ assets consist of
deposits held with the Maltese banks. The investment funds have significant investments in local bank equity.

15.
The regulatory and supervisory frameworks have recently been strengthened in
several areas (Box 3). In late 2013, the Malta Financial Supervisory Authority (MFSA) amended the
regulation on loan provisioning, requiring banks to allocate higher provisions for nonperforming
loans. As a result, the coverage ratio increased from 39.5 percent in 2013 to 40.3 percent in
June 2014, and expected to increase further. The CBM Act was also amended in late 2013, adding
the formulation and implementation of macro-prudential policy as an explicit objective of the CBM.
In this context, work on developing a macro-prudential toolkit has started. At present, the CBM and
the MFSA are conducting research on the macro-prudential toolkit, such as possible use of broadbased and sector-based capital buffers for banks. The Joint Financial Stability Board (JFSB) has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

enhanced inter-agency cooperation on financial stability. In November 2014, the supervision of the
largest banks was transferred from the MFSA to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
Box 3. Malta: Bank Regulatory and Supervisory Frameworks
The Malta Financial Supervisory Authority (MFSA) is a unified supervisor of all financial institutions and
markets. The MFSA periodically conducts internal audits or commissions external experts to review
compliance of its regulatory and supervisory arrangements with the best international standards. However,
there has been no Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in Malta since 2003.
In response to the past recommendations of staff and the EC, the authorities have taken measures to
increase loan loss provisions. Following a consultation with stakeholders, the new regulations (Banking Rule
BR/09) became effective as of end-2013. The amended regulations require banks to allocate a higher amount
of provisions for NPLs, by allocating reserves of 2.5 percent of a bank’s NPLs.
The institutional set up for macro-prudential policymaking has been recently strengthened. The
amendments to the CBM Act of November 2013 augmented the responsibilities of the CBM by adding the
formulation and implementation of macro-prudential policies to the functions of the CBM. A second deputy
governor was appointed with a focus on financial sector issues. The amendments also gave a legal status to
the JFSB that was set up in early 2013 and made up of representatives from the CBM, MFSA, and Ministry of
Finance, the latter as observer.1
1

The main objective of the JFSB is to facilitate cooperation between domestic authorities in matters related to systemic
financial stability, including the identification and assessment of macro-prudential policy instruments.

Staff’s views
16.
While noting solid performance of the Maltese banks and welcoming recent legal and
regulatory changes, staff pointed to several areas where resilience could be further
strengthened. In particular:


Although the two largest banks were found to be adequately capitalized under the ECB’s CA,
their NPL ratios were revised substantially upwards, suggesting that the NPL ratio for the rest of
the banking sector could also be higher under stricter loan classification rules. Swift
implementation of the action plans resulting from the CA would be essential. Of particular
importance is the need to align definitions of impairment triggers and forbearance used by
individual banks with those used by the European Banking Authority and the SSM, and
continued efforts to boost provisioning.



The MFSA should maintain sufficient resources as needed by the intensity of the regulatory and
supervisory work, including in the AML/CFT area. The transfer of supervision of the largest banks
from the MFSA to the SSM has been smooth. Continued close cooperation between the MFSA
and the SSM is needed to ensure no reduction in supervision of these banks.

12

MALTA

Figure 1. Malta: Non-Performing Exposures, 2014



Enhanced focus of the MFSA on smaller banks is now appropriate, given forthcoming changes in
ownership. Two mid-sized core domestic banks (Banif and Lombard) are in the process of
ownership change.4



One of the main risks facing core domestic banks relates to their exposure to the real estate
sector. Around two thirds of loans extended by banks are secured with real estate collateral, and
mortgages are one of the few segments of bank loans which have been increasing recently
(unlike loans to NFCs). It is important to continue mitigating the risk of exposure concentration
to the real estate sector by the application of a cautious collateral valuation and conservative
loan-to-value ratios. There is also room to enhance the loan foreclosure process by advancing
judicial reform.5 This risk can be exacerbated by the weak performance of the EU countries,
generating negative spill-over effects on the Maltese economy and its financial sector.

4

Banif Bank Malta is majority-owned by Banif Financial Group of Portugal and Lombard Bank is 49 percent
owned by Popular Bank of Cyprus. The Portuguese and Cypriot banks received state aid in recent years,
which—in accordance with the EU rules on state aid—obliges them to sell their overseas investments.
5

As noted by the 2014 World Bank Doing Business report, Malta scores relatively unfavorably compared to the
EU average in terms of the time needed for loan foreclosure and recovery rates in insolvency.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALTA



The contingency framework should be strengthened in line with reforms at the EU level. This
includes boosting the ex-ante funds of the deposit compensation scheme while lowering the
share of banks’ special contribution (ex-post payment commitments).6 Also, legal amendments
are needed to implement the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, establishing a
resolution fund and introducing a bail-in requirement.



The MFSA and FIAU should continue to aim for high standards in the AML/CFT framework,
particularly in light of the large financial and online gaming sectors.



To get a fuller assessment of the financial sector’s condition and oversight, an update of the
FSAP—which took place in 2003—would be appropriate.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to adapt the financial sector policy
framework to the changing environment. They intend to maintain local laws and regulations on
loan classification, macroprudential oversight, deposit insurance, and bank resolution in line with the
EU requirements, and stressed that work is under way in all these areas. In particular, there are plans
to amend the MFSA Act with the aim to establish a Resolution Board under the auspices of the
MFSA. The authorities were positive about the move toward a banking union in the EU, and both
MFSA and the ECB emphasized the importance of close cooperation in supervising the largest
banks. The MFSA noted that two mid-sized banks are now in the process of asset quality review
similar to the one conducted for the largest banks under the ECB’s auspices, and two more banks
will be subject to a similar review in 2015. The authorities agreed with the recommendation to
ensure high standards in the AML/CFT framework, and indicated that efforts are under way in
several areas to address shortcomings noted by the 2012 MONEVAL report. The authorities stated
that they would soon request an FSAP update.
18.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on possible sources of risk to the financial
sector. They noted that a slow economic recovery in the EU represents a risk to the domestic
economy and financial sector. While they agreed that high NPL ratios are an important challenge for
core domestic banks, they expected a reduction going forward as growth picks up. The authorities
were less concerned than staff about the exposure of banks to the real estate sector. They were of
the view that delinquency rates on mortgages have traditionally been one of the lowest, the
exposure of banks to speculative property trading is very small, and household income (the main
source of vulnerability for mortgages) is growing at a healthy rate.

6

Currently, the ex-ante contribution paid by banks to the deposit compensation scheme is equivalent to at
least 0.2 percent of eligible deposits, while the special contribution is equal to at least 0.8 percent of eligible
deposits. In accordance with the 2014 EU Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes (Directive 2014/49/EU), the
target level for ex-ante funds should be 0.8 percent of the covered deposits.

14

MALTA

C. Structural Policies
19.
The authorities are making progress in a number of structural reform areas — energy,
judicial reform, and labor market. These priorities are outlined in the National Reform Program
(NRP), which aims at increasing competitiveness of the economy and ensuring long-term fiscal
sustainability. These steps should help address the low female participation, skill gaps in the labor
market, difficulties of early school leavers, Malta’s dependency on oil as the main energy source, and
inefficiencies of public procurement.
20.
The government is implementing a three year plan for judicial reform based on the
recommendations of the Justice Reform Commission. The first year focused on amendments to
criminal law, with improvements to civil and commercial law planned in the upcoming year. Planned
reforms include: increasing the number of courts assistants, greater use of information technology in
court administration, raising the thresholds for streamlined judicial procedures, and introducing
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation.
21.
A number of labor market and education reforms have been aimed at increasing labor
participation and enhancing skills. The authorities have improved incentives to work by
introducing free childcare for working mothers, and gradual tapering of social benefits for those
entering employment. The government is improving search and matching efficiency by introducing
electronic platforms for job vacancies and involving the private sector in finding jobs for youth.
Planned measures on education include compiling an employability index for higher education
courses to assess how they correspond to labor market requirements, and introducing private
tuition support for youth experiencing difficulties in primary education.
Staff’s views
22.
Maintaining Malta’s competitiveness will require sustained productivity and valueadded growth. In global competitiveness assessments, Malta is lagging behind in some key areas,
such as ease of starting a business, access to credit, and legal rights. While Malta’s comparative
advantage in the services sector has helped support its exports, some sectors (e.g. remote gaming)
remain vulnerable to regulatory and tax changes elsewhere. Competitiveness may also be
threatened by increased mismatch between wages and productivity growth, especially when many
euro area neighbors continue to reduce their unit labor costs (Appendix 1). At the same time,
Malta’s dynamic economy should be supported by affordable lending to viable firms (Appendices 2
and 3). The following areas are priorities for structural reforms.


Skills upgrading: Ensuring sufficient growth in labor productivity requires better upgrading and
utilization of skills. Malta has one of the lowest tertiary education enrollment rates and one of
the highest drop-out rates in the EU. Measures to boost tertiary education enrollment and the
quality of vocational training need to continue in order to reduce skills mismatches and improve
the quality of labor.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MALTA

Female labor participation: Female labor force participation has increased, helped by
government policies, but it is still one of the lowest in the euro area. With growth increasingly
dependent on financial and niche services, the authorities need to ensure ample and wellqualified labor force. Budget measures that incentivize labor participation, especially female
participation, should be prioritized over other forms of current spending. Vocational education
should be strengthened further by identifying and expanding programs that deliver best
employment outcomes.



Judicial reforms: While Malta has made some progress in reducing the time needed for dispute
resolution, including insolvency proceedings, it remains high compared to EU peers (see e.g.
the 2014 EU Justice Scoreboard). The government should continue planned judicial reforms and
monitor their outcomes focusing on the speed of resolving judicial cases and the use of
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation. Encouraging greater use of the
insolvency regime, as well as more out-of-court workouts, accelerating collateral recovery, and
reforming bankruptcy procedures are crucial for the resolution of the growing stock of nonperforming loans on bank balance sheets and dealing with the debt overhang of some SMEs.



Reducing the cost of capital: A number of measures should be considered to reduce the
relatively high cost of capital.


16

Creating a credit registry, as planned by the authorities, should help reduce financing costs
and, in the medium-term, help facilitate other forms of market financing, such as
securitization. This would complement initiatives to jump start markets for risk capital. Full
benefits of the credit registry can be obtained if it is comprehensive (collecting data also
from non-financial institutions) and includes not only indebtedness information, but also
payment history (including positive history).

Dec-08

High NPLs are contributing to high
interest rates, particularly in certain
sectors, as implied by the correlation
between NPL ratios (and relatively high
corporate leverage) and lending rates
on new loans (Appendix 3). There is a
need for a strategy for NPL resolution.
Such a strategy should include
accelerating NPL write-offs,
encouraging greater use of the
insolvency regime, faster enforcement
of creditor rights, and developing
options for out-of-court workouts.



While the reliance on domestic funding across sectors (government, banks, and corporates)
has helped shield Malta from the global financial crisis, encouraging a moderate increase in
cross-border financing should help lower funding costs across the economy.



A development bank—which is being considered by the authorities—could in principle help
stimulate markets for long-term financing of risky projects and stimulate nascent markets.
However, it should not be in direct competition with commercial banks, should have a clear
and periodically re-evaluated mandate, be effectively supervised, and have strong
governance.

Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of structural reforms. Specific areas
such as judicial reform and labor market improvements are priorities for the government. The
authorities emphasized that reforms would take some time owing to a large amount of institutional
changes requiring consensus building, approval by Parliament, and a cultural change in some cases.
24.
The authorities agreed that the cost of capital is relatively high. They expected positive
results from the planned credit registry and tax measures to stimulate venture capital investments.
On credit registry, the authorities expected to finalize the consultation with banks in early 2015 and
introduce the registry in two stages. The first stage is expected to be completed by mid 2015, in line
with data requirements at the euro area level (the ECB’s Anacredit project with a deadline of
December 2017). They saw the influence of NPLs as limited only to certain sectors such as
construction. The authorities agreed that there may be scope to facilitate increased cross-border
financing, but pointed to a number of structural obstacles and trade-offs with financial stability,
particularly the small size of issuance and high resulting liquidity premiums.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Malta continues to weather the global crisis well. Real GDP growth has been one of the
highest in the euro area since the crisis and remains solid going into 2015. The external position has
stayed strong, and unemployment is close to historical lows and among the lowest in the euro area.
These developments reflect a relatively diversified economy and a stable banking sector.
26.
The economic outlook is strong and risks are balanced. Staff project continued robust
real GDP growth in 2015–16, driven by domestic demand. Inflation is projected to remain subdued.
In the short-term, a prolonged stagnation and deflation in the euro area would reduce external
demand and make fiscal adjustment more challenging. While risks related to the delays in
restructuring of various state owned enterprises remain, there are potential positive spillovers to
private investment and consumption from large infrastructure projects. In the longer term, Malta’s
competitiveness could be eroded if Malta falls behind in implementing structural reforms while
many euro area countries continue to reduce their unit labor costs, including through stepped up
regulatory and tax reforms elsewhere.
27.
Now is an opportune time to push forward with policies to raise growth in the
medium-term in a sustainable manner and reduce vulnerabilities. Despite a robust outlook,
Malta faces important challenges: public debt is still high; non-performing loans are elevated; the
cost of capital is relatively high despite abundant liquidity; and maintaining competitiveness is
increasingly challenging. The policy agenda, therefore, should focus on three areas: (i) strengthening
fiscal sustainability; (ii) maintaining financial stability; and (iii) enhancing competitiveness and
reducing the cost of capital.
28.
The budgetary targets for 2015-2017 are welcome but meeting them will be
challenging. The fiscal deficit declined to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013, and with the output gap
closed, there is a window of opportunity to reduce public debt. The consolidation measures
proposed by the government for 2015 are mostly on the revenue side, and the underlying growth
projections rely on favorable external assumptions. To ensure that the proposed fiscal targets are
met, additional expenditure measures should be considered. These measures should be designed to
contain the fast growth in current spending while preserving incentives for labor participation and
education, and capital spending. If revenues turn out to be higher than projected, they should be
used for debt reduction. In this context, full implementation of the comprehensive spending review
would help prioritize and contain spending, while increasing efficiency.
29.
Broad-based reforms—on pension, healthcare, and public corporations—are critical to
contain fiscal pressures going forward. Further measures are needed to curb the projected
increase in public pension outlays and health care spending. Authorities should continue to push
forward with restructuring of state-owned corporations. More generally, it is important to disclose,
analyze, and manage risks to public finances from state owned enterprises in a consolidated
manner.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

30.
The government’s efforts to strengthen fiscal governance are welcome. The full
implementation of the FRA for the next budget period is encouraged. Ongoing initiatives to
integrate the revenue administration agencies will help improve the budgetary process.
31.
Overall, the financial sector remains stable. Malta continues to host a relatively large
financial sector without exposing itself to excessive risk. The regulatory and supervisory frameworks
have recently been strengthened. A fuller assessment of the financial sector’s condition under the
Financial Sector Assessment Program would be useful.
32.
Remaining financial sector vulnerabilities stem from the relatively high level of NPLs
and exposure to the property market. The NPL ratios of the largest banks were revised upwards
under the AQR. At the same time, exposure of the core domestic banks to the property market
remains substantial, leaving the banking sector vulnerable to developments in the real estate sector,
particularly in the case of direct exposure to the construction sector.
33.
Efforts are needed to further boost the resilience of Maltese banks and ensure robust
supervisory and contingency arrangements. Policies should focus on: (i) a swift implementation of
the action plans resulting from the ECB’s comprehensive assessment, and applying the same
standards across the rest of the banking sector; (ii) strengthening the contingency framework in line
with reforms at the EU level, including by boosting the resources of the deposit compensation
scheme and lowering the share of banks’ special contribution; (iii) following through legal
amendments needed to implement the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, establishing a
resolution fund and introducing a bail-in requirement; and (iv) continuing to aim for high standards
in the AML/CFT framework.
34.
Maintaining Malta’s competitiveness will require sustained productivity growth. The
priorities include improving labor participation and productivity, and reforming the judicial system
to improve the business environment. Malta’s dynamic economy should be supported by affordable
lending to viable small firms. Therefore, policy actions are needed to reduce the cost of capital,
including by developing a strategy for NPL resolution, implementing the planned credit registry, and
encouraging a moderate increase in cross-border financing.
35.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Malta follows the standard
12-month cycle.

materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

1/ Real exchange rate measures disseminated by the Eurostat differ from those used in CGER calculations (based on INS data).
Eurostat exchange rates assign greater weight to euro area trading partners making the impact of recent euro nominal depreciation
appear more muted.
2/ All available real exchange measures use weights that are based on trade in goods only. For Malta, whose primary exports are in
services they should be interpreted with caution.
3/ The decline in other services is driven by insurance and pension services and the use of intellectual property.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
1.

The public debt to GDP ratio has been rising since 2008, but is projected to decline

after 2014. The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase from 62.7 in 2008 to
70.3 in 2014. Under the baseline scenario the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak in 2014, before
declining to 62.7 percent in 2020.
2.

The stock of contingent liabilities is expected to stabilize in 2015. Government

guaranteed debt is projected to increase from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 16 percent of GDP
in 2014. This increase is largely attributable to Enemalta (the national utility company), whose
financial performance has been poor. With Enemalta’s ongoing restructuring plan and its partial
privatization, its guaranteed debt and the fiscal pressures are expected to decline in 2015.
3.

To assess the sustainability of government debt, a number of adverse scenarios are

considered. Although under the baseline scenario the debt-to-GDP ratio converges to a level below
70 percent of GDP, the ratio is sensitive to shocks, if they were to materialize.


Under a growth shock that lowers output by 1.9 percent (equivalent to 1 standard deviation of
growth over the past 10 years) in 2016–2017 and inflation declining by 0.9 percent in 2016,
debt would peak at 73.4 percent of GDP in 2017, 6.1 percentage points higher than in the
baseline.



A sustained interest rate shock of 200 bps would slow down the rate of debt decline so that
by 2020 the debt-to-GDP ratio is 1 percentage points higher with respect to the baseline.



A primary fiscal balance shock of 0.4 percentage points over 2016–17 (1/2 standard deviation
of the historical 10-year average) yields a debt-to-GDP ratio 1 percentage point higher in 2020
relative to the baseline.



A combined macro-fiscal shock including the three shocks above would lead to debt peaking
at almost 73.5 percent of GDP in 2017, 3.2 percentage points higher relative to the baseline,
and declining slowly to about 70.6 percent of GDP in 2020.



Under a financial contingent liability shock there is a one-time increase in non-interest
expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of the banking sector assets—which could also be
contributed partially by contingent liabilities stemming from SOEs—that leads to a real GDP
growth shock as the one above (with growth declining for 1 standard deviation over 2016–17),
revenue-to-GDP ratio remains the same as in the baseline while the deterioration of the

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

primary balance leads to higher interest rates and the decline in growth lowers the inflation
rate. This leads to debt jumping to 82.3 percent of GDP in 2017 and declining only to
78.5 percent of GDP in 2020.


A low inflation shock lowers inflation by 0.7 percentage point in each year from 2016 to 2020
with respect to the baseline (equivalent to a decline in 1 standard deviation of inflation over
the past 10 years), output growth is lower by 0.5 percentage points with respect to the
baseline in 2016 to 2020, revenue decreases by 2 percent each year, expenditures remain the
same, and there is a 100 basis points increase in risk premium with feedback to growth each
year. As a result, the debt-to-GDP ratio follows an upward trend and reaches about
78.4 percent of GDP in 2020.

4.

Risks stemming from Malta’s high external financing requirements are mitigated by

large holdings of foreign assets. In fact, 85 percent of outstanding short-term debt is for other
monetary and financial institutions (OMFI) and is fully backed by foreign assets. Excluding OMFI’s
and intra company lending, outstanding short-term debt at the end of 2013 was 31.8 percent of
GDP and total net debt is about minus 120 percent of GDP.

Appendix I. Developments in Malta’s
Competitiveness in
Goods Sector1
1.

Malta has made impressive strides in improving its trade balance since its accession to

the european union in 2004. The trade balance reverted from a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2006
to a surplus of 6.6 percent of GDP in 2013. Given the high degree of openess of Malta’s economy,
maintaining its competitiveness is key in sustaining the current growth rates. This appendix analyzes
the recent progress in Malta’s external competitiveness focusing on the goods sector (given data
availability).
2.

To better assess Malta’s competitiveness in the goods sector, Malta’s export market

shares are decomposed into structural and performance effects. This appendix looks beyond the
growth in exports and real exchange rate developments, which could reflect other factors such as an
increase in trade partner’s demand and hide developments in various subcomponents, providing
only a partial picture of competitiveness gains. To better measure improvements in Malta’s
performance, this section uses econometric shift-share decomposition, with data covering 2005
to 2013: Q1 at the 6-digit Harmonized System (HS) classification (Cheptea and others, 2014; and
Gaulier and others, 2013). This decomposition isolates the effects of a change in demand and a
change in export composition from other determinants of export performance that account for
competitiveness.
3.

This decomposition identifies the determinants of changes in market shares. In

particular, changes in market shares are decomposed into three components: a geographical
composition effect (a change in market share due to growth in imports of specific markets), a
sectoral composition effect (a change in market share due to growth in exports of individual
products), and a pure performance effect (indicating the degree to which the exporting country has
been able to gain or lose market share after controlling for composition effects). The first two effects
are structural and the latter is usually taken as a proxy for competitiveness. The pure performance
effect may also include other determinants not explained by the structural effects, since it implies
that a country is more competitive than another one if its exports and market shares increase above
those of countries that have the same composition of exports.
4.

The gains and losses in Malta’s market shares were mainly driven by performance

effects. Overall there is a large variation in terms of the evolution of market shares and their
determinants. In particular:



Prior to the crisis, Malta’s market share expanded slightly (2006–2007). This increase is
mainly explained by a sectoral composition effect, suggesting that Malta specialized in products
and sectors that on average have had a relatively higher growth. During this period, the
geographical composition and export performance effects played broadly a neutral role.



The global financial crisis affected export growth negatively. The dramatic drop in market
shares in 2008 is linked to the collapse in global trade during the global financial crisis and not
driven by developments in Malta itself. In fact, world trade suffered an unprecedented collapse
in the last quarter of 2008 (see Levchenko and others 2011). The performance effect has been
the main driver.



Market shares in Malta recovered in 2010 and 2011, driven by gains in performance.
In 2011, this was partly offset by the losses stemming from geographical and sectoral effects—
implying that despite the specialization in sectors that had lower growth and countries that had
lower import demand, Malta managed to increase its market share.



During 2012 and 2013: Q1, Malta lost market share with respect to their trading partners.
This decline in market shares is mainly explained by a negative contribution of performance.
While in 2012 sectoral effects were negative, they contributed positively in 2013: Q1. While a
part of the declines in market shares in recent years could be driven by the semiconductor
sector— which has suffered significantly during recent years— it is not possible to isolate this
effect given data availability.

5.

While non-price competitiveness has improved since 2010, price competitiveness has

worsened. It is illustrative to differentiate the effects stemming from volumes and prices.2 We follow
the common practice and use changes in unit values as a proxy for changes in prices. Unit values are
calculated as the ratio between value and quantity exported. While the decomposition based on
volumes shows gains in market share since 2010, the decomposition based on prices shows a
decline—driven by performance effects.

Maintaining Malta’s dynamic export performance and boosting its competitiveness

will require actions in various fronts. The determinants of Malta’s market shares have varied
across time. First, it is important to diversify the export base both geographically and across sectors.
Second, policies aiming at improving productivity and competitiveness will help support market
share gains. Indeed, historically, performance effects have been an important driver of Malta’s
export shares. Finally, price competitiveness is as important as non-price competitiveness in
maintaining market shares.

One limitation about this methodology is that when disentangling between price and quantity effects, only the
intensive margin of trade is taken into account. Incorporating the extensive margin is non-trivial from a
computational point of view.

Appendix II. Interest Rate Pass-Through in Malta1
This appendix estimates the short-term and long-term interest rate pass-through coefficients in Malta.
Interest rate pass-through is low in Malta both in an absolute sense and relative to the rest of the euro
area. This is driven by significant reliance on deposit funding, limited competition in the banking
sector, and, possibly, by rising share of non-performing loans.

Context

1.

Interest rates in Malta have remained

relatively high and constant for an extended
period of time. Even as the ECB policy rate has
declined to historically low levels, interest rates
on deposits and loans fell only marginally in
the aftermath of the global financial crisis. In
this appendix we estimate the pass-through
from the ECB policy rate to a set of deposit and

lending rates for Malta and compare it with the
rest of the euro area. The second part of the
appendix focuses on the lending rates to
nonfinancial corporations (NFCs).

Methodology

2.

An autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) is used to calculate short- and long-

term pass-through in Malta. The model for a range of lending and deposit rates is:

(1)
Where r stands for lending or deposit rates, p stands for the policy rate, and i* and j* refer to
optimal lag lengths (Micallef and Gauci, 2014). Policy rate is the main refinancing rate set by the ECB,
and lending and deposit rates are interest rates available to the Maltese residents. Deposit rates
cover households, businesses and the weighted average of these two. Lending rates cover
mortgages, consumer loans, loans to businesses and also a weighted average for loans overall. The

interest rates are for the “outstanding amounts” to maintain compatibility with earlier published
analyses of interest rate pass-through in Malta.2 This, however, creates a downward bias in the passthrough rates, because the pass-through from policy rates to interest rates on new loans is higher
than the pass-through to the rates on outstanding amounts (which represent an average rate that
includes loans granted before the change in the policy rate). The estimation period is for
January 2008 to November 2014 (post-EA accession). Since all interest rates series are nonstationary and integrated of order 1, they are used in the model in a form of first differences.
3.

The appendix considers both long-and short-run pass-through. The short-run pass-

through is obtained by estimating coefficient β0 in equation (1), whereas the long-run pass-through
is calculated using the following equation that assumes an inter-temporal equality across interest
rates in the long-run:

Pass-through for Lending and Deposit Rates

The estimated long-term pass-

through is less than 50 percent for
both deposits and lending rates. The

Micallef and Gauci (2014) point out that the series on new rates exhibit considerable volatility in Malta that
complicates estimation of pass-through coefficients.

More precisely the model selection strategy is as follows: (i) begin with the model with i*= 0 and j* = 1. We
then augment first j* and then i* by 1 each time using Breusch –Godfrey LM test for autocorrelation in the
residuals of up to 12th order. The most parsimonious model where autocorrelation is rejected for all 12 lags is
then chosen.

The long-term pass-through for Maltese NFCs is one of the lowest in the euro area.

Using comparable data for all countries from the ECB4, and the model in (1)5 suggests that the passthrough rates for loans and deposits to non-financial corporations in Malta is one of the lowest in
the euro area. For household loan and deposit rates the pass-through from policy rates is slightly
larger, but still ranks in the bottom half of the distribution. Low pass-through to NFC rates may
reflect limited competition in the banking sector, as well as considerations specific to Maltese NFCs,
including their high leverage and relatively large level of non-performing loans on the balance
sheets of core domestic banks.

Notes: Symbol * next to a country name indicates not a statistically significant coefficient. These results
show a rough comparison of Malta and other euro area member states, but do not represent a
comprehensive analysis and should be interpreted with caution. Not only does the use of rates on
outstanding amounts introduce a bias, but there are country specific considerations such as loan
rejection frequencies that change the extent to which loan rates on outstanding amounts are
informative about financial conditions.

viable firms (especially SMEs) to invest and grow, which in turn can inhibit economic growth. In
order to analyze the drivers of low pass-through and high interest rates the previous ARDL model is
augmented by additional variables, capturing bank funding costs as well as growth outlook
(uncertainty index and confidence indicators). Consequently, the estimated equation takes a
following form:

(3)
Where l refers to interest rate on outstanding business loans to NFCs, b refers to ECB policy rate, d
refers to average interest rate on outstanding business deposits (a weighted average of both
household and NFC deposits), i*, j* and k* refer to optimal lag lengths, and X is a vector of
additional variables such as economic uncertainty index6 or confidence indicators.7 Bank funding
costs are proxied by deposit rates since Malta’s two core domestic banks are predominantly funded
by residential deposits. The method for lag choices for the baseline model remains as in Section C.
The number of lags for deposit rates is chosen based on the Akaike selection criterion.
7.

The short-term pass-through to NFC lending rates remains low but robust. The first

column in Table 2 corresponds to the basic model of the equation (1), which includes only ECB
policy rate and lagged lending rates as explanatory variables. The coefficient of the short-term passthrough is 23.5 percent and is statistically significant. Both its value and significance remain robust
when deposit rates are included (in the second column (2), as well as when crisis dummy is added
(for periods before June 2009).8

6

The uncertainty index measures European policy-related economic uncertainty and it is based on newspaper
articles regarding policy uncertainty. The source of the data can be found here:

These include economic sentiment indicator, industrial confidence indicator and services confidence indicator,

The short-term pass-through from deposit rates is significant and close to a

100 percent. This reflects the aforementioned core banks’ dependence on deposit funding. The
short-term pass-through from ECB policy rate drops to slightly to around 19 percent, when deposits
rates are added to the model, however the adjusted R-squared increases by almost 10 percentage
points and the coefficients on deposit rates are statistically significant.
9.

Confidence and uncertainty indicators are not statistically significant. After accounting

for the policy rate and deposit rate, including these additional variables (either in levels or in

Appendix III. Small and Medium Enterprises in Malta1
This appendix reviews the financial position of Maltese SMEs. Maltese SMEs have comparable
profitability to that of their European peers; however, there is a larger share of firms experiencing
losses and there a heterogeneity across industries and sizes. The smallest firms have the highest levels
of leverage. Maltese SMEs rely primarily on bank finance, which is generally available, although at
high interest rates. SME sector could be strengthened further by improving credit information sharing
and reducing non-performing loans.

A.

Context

1.

SMEs2 generate three quarters of employment and value added in Malta. The European

Commission (EC) estimates suggest that this share in Malta is close to other smaller countries in the
European Union and higher than for the European Union as a whole. However, the EC estimates
explicitly exclude financial and insurance sectors of the economy3 (European Commission, 2014a).

Malta’s SMEs have weathered the crisis better than European peers. The number of

registered business units employing less than 250 people was 8 percent higher in 2013 than in 2008.
Similarly, the number of people employed and value added from 2008 to 2013 have also increased
by 8 and 15 percent respectively. In terms of value added Maltese SMEs outperformed large firms,
which may have suffered more due to their greater exposure to exports markets (European
Commission, 2014b). Significantly stronger growth, investment and exports than in the euro area
overall helped support SMEs. As a result, unemployment in Malta has actually been lower after the
crisis, and overall economic sentiment, having diverged from the euro area average around 2012, is
now close to historically high levels.

Concerns about the SME sector center on the availability of financing and particular

industries. Lending volumes in Malta have declined and interest rates remain higher than in the
euro area overall. At the same time, Maltese firms are relatively highly leveraged, especially in
certain industries such as construction. In addition, a number of structural gaps limit the

component of the World Bank Doing Business Indicators (World Bank, 2014).

Financial Position of Maltese SMEs

Non-financial business economy
5.

Malta’s SME sector is dominated by small firms, primarily in services and trade. Most of

Maltese SMEs are family owned (Malta Business Bureau, 2013). Firms with less than 10 employees
have close to 45 percent of total employment and value added compared to the average of
37 percent for the European Union. Almost half of the value added in the non-financial sector is
generated by services, and an additional third is generated by trade. Services are the most
productive sector in Malta (in terms of value added per employee), followed by construction.

There are also limits on the amount of assets or turnover—less than 2 million euro for micro enterprises and less than 10 million

Within the dominant services sector, considerable changes have occurred over time.

Turnover in accommodation and food services as well as administration and support services is now
at historically high levels. On the other hand, turnover in information and communication sector and
professional, scientific and technical activities has declined in 2012–13. Employment, hours worked
and wages followed similar trends, except they have been steadily increasing in the professional,
scientific and technical activities.

7.

Malta’s SMEs are more leveraged than larger firms. Grima and Vella (2014) show that

leverage (defined as the ratio of assets to equity) of Maltese NFCs by size over the period from 2004
until 2011 was relatively stable, even in the years of the global financial crisis. The smallest
companies had the highest levels of leverage.
8.

Firm-level data and sample selection. In order to get a more granular picture of the

financial characteristics of Maltese SMEs, we rely on firm-level data from ORBIS dataset by Bureau
van Dijk. The ORBIS database in principle aims to cover all private and publicly listed firms.
Nevertheless the data available covers only a small subset (1615 of an estimated 35,000 Maltese
SMEs), even with the generous sampling criteria.41
9.

Data on employment. The ORBIS dataset lacks data on employment for most Maltese firms

making the application of this part of the SME definition problematic. We therefore define two
samples: a broad sample, which includes the firms for which no data on employment is available and
a narrow sample where the employment criterion is applied as well. The narrow sample includes 313
firms.
10.

How representative is the sample? Suitable benchmarks to judge the representativeness of

the sample could be its composition by firm size and industry because the European Commission
estimates population sizes by these criteria. The EC, estimates, however do not include financial
firms, which makes it necessary to consider them separately.

We focus on firms that met the limits for turnover and assets in at least one of the years from 2011 until 2013.
For calculations, the year in which the enterprise matched this limited definition of SME is used. We exclude
firms with more than 250 employees (when employee data is available). To avoid double counting, we focus
our search on firms with unconsolidated accounts and exclude firms that have only consolidated accounts
available. We also exclude firms with zero or negative equity and/or negative liabilities.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11.

Available firm level data are skewed towards larger firms in particular industries. Even

though the vast majority of Maltese firms are small, they are relatively poorly represented in the
sample with less than 10 percent of firms included in the broad sample and less than 1 percent in
the narrow sample. This suggests that firms for which no employment data is available are primarily
small in terms of assets and turnover. On the other hand, for medium-sized firms, more than half of
the population for manufacturing, trade and construction sectors is included. To correct for the
particular characteristics of the sample, we use probability weights in estimating population
parameters. Probability weights are the inverse of the sampling fractions. For example, in weighted
sample observations from micro firms in manufacturing count more than six times as much as
observations from medium firms.
12.

A significant proportion of firms report zero profits. Out of 1615 firms in the broad

sample, 997 (62 percent) of mostly smaller firms report exactly zero profits. In the narrow sample
only 12 (4 percent) of firms report zero profits. This may reflect either a gap in the data gathering
procedure or tax specific considerations. Thus, while median leverage can be computed for the
entire sample, firms with zero profits are excluded from the sample for calculation of median
profitability indicators and the share of loss-making firms.51

Median profitability of Maltese firms is relatively high compared to peers6,2however

so is the share of loss-making firms. This is true for both narrow and broad samples. The
unweighted estimates of profitability are similar in both narrow and broad samples, while weighted
estimates for narrow sample have lower ROE, but not ROA, in other words, lower leverage. Note that
estimates for Malta have relatively larger standard errors illustrating greater uncertainty arising from
a small sample (especially in the narrow sample).

level estimates are higher than suggested in Grima and Vella (2014), who argue that smaller
companies are more likely to be leveraged and since the share of smaller firms is higher in Malta,
higher leverage is a “structural feature” of the economy.
15.

Differences by sector and size. Returns on assets are comparable across all three size

classes, however returns on equity are higher for smaller and micro-sized firms7,3confirming that
smaller companies may have higher leverage in Malta. On the other hand, micro-sized companies
also have the largest proportion of firms experiencing losses. Among sectors, construction has
notably lower returns on assets as well relatively higher share of firms experiencing losses,
suggesting continued difficulties within this sector. On the other hand, the services sector has the
highest returns on assets and equity, suggesting also greater leverage. Construction has by far the
highest leverage ratio of 3, followed by services at 2.5.

6

For peer countries because of greater data availability, the SME sample is composed by applying a full
definition (including the number of employees), based on 2013 data. Those estimates were originally obtained
in IMF (2014).
7

Only results based on the broad sample are reported to maximize representation by firm sizes and industry.

Financial Services
16.

Financial services sector has low profitability, comparable leverage and high share of

loss-making firms. The broad (without employment data) sample of financial and insurance firms
yields 676 firms, a substantial addition to the overall sample size of 1615. Of these, 117 firms have
exactly zero profits. Another 271 have assets less than equity, which is likely another tax issue or
imperfection in data collection. After removing such firms from the sample, the median leverage
ratio of financial services firms is 2.4, comparable to the non-financial business economy firms.
However, median profitability is lower with an estimated 2.3 percent return on assets, 8.7 percent
return on equity and 35 percent of firms experiencing losses.84

C.

SME Financing in Malta

17.

Besides own finance, bank based financing is the main source of SME finance. The

dominant forms of bank finance have been overdraft facilities and credit cards, followed by trade
credit and bank loans. Surveys suggest that loans are generally used by larger SMEs, while in the
case of smaller companies only about half have used them before (Malta Business Bureau, 2013).
18.

Bank lending standards and loan demand for SMEs are similar to large firms. After a

significant tightening in 2008 and 2012 (as well as additional tightening for SMEs in 2011), lending
standards remained unchanged for both large firms and SMEs. Survey evidence suggests that the

8

data is available only for 45 firms of the above sample.

last tightening was related to changes in the perception of firm outlook and risk on the collateral
demanded. Demand for loans has been volatile, especially for SMEs.

The frequency of application rejections for loans is lower in Malta than in the euro

area. According to the European Commission (2014) it was almost zero in 2013, compared to the
average of 14.4 percent for the euro area. No rejections have been documented by the SME survey
performed in Malta Business Bureau (2013).
20.

However, interest rates on new loans are significantly higher in Malta than in the euro

area. The difference is larger for large loans (for amounts greater than 1 million euro). The existence
of a large spread between Maltese and euro area rates may in part be driven by the limited
competition in the financial sector. However, this spread has not been constant suggesting that
other factors may also be important.

Surveys suggest substantial financial constraints for manufacturing but not services

firms. The share of firms in the manufacturing industry reporting financial constraints has been
persistently higher in Malta than in the euro area overall. The spike in the third quarter of 2014 is
especially worrying, although evidence derived from surveys with small samples as may be the case
in Malta can be volatile, and in the last quarter of 2014 the share of firms reporting financial
constraints return to it. On the other hand, service firms appear relatively less constrained in Malta
than in the euro area overall and, unusually so, less constrained than Maltese manufacturing firms.
Firms also indicate availability of labor as a constraint. Different from many other euro area
countries, demand is relatively less important.

Non-bank finance for the most part is not used in Malta. A number of venture capital

initiatives have existed in the past but met with limited success. Stakeholders indicated various
reasons for this such as low quality of the projects by start-ups, unwillingness to dilute ownership,
administrative difficulties, and past experiences of failed local mergers (Malta Business
Bureau, 2013).

D.

Policies to Strengthen the SME Sector

Existing Policies
23.

The government has supported SMEs extensively through a mix of various subsidies,

grants as well as measures to improve access to finance. Most of the support is provided
through Malta Enterprise, a national development agency responsible for the growth and
development of Maltese firms (Malta Business Bureau, 2013). Support measures include both

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

MALTA

subsidies and grants. The authorities have also successfully utilized and leveraged EU structural
funds. For example, the JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) Malta
fund is the first loss portfolio guarantee vehicle set up in Malta to grant SMEs and self-employed
loans of up to 500,000 euro at advantageous interest rates and considerably lower collateral
requirements. A similar scheme is being planned in the future.
Policy Proposals
24.

There is scope for improvement in the legal framework of access to credit. The World

Bank Doing Business indicators highlight access to credit as the area where Malta has the largest
distance to the frontier of the best performing economies. The reasons are the lack of credit
information sharing as well as relatively weaker legal rights of creditors. To the extent that structural
gaps or slow enforcement of collateral weaken creditor’s rights, they will likely be reflected in higher
overall risk premiums on loans and therefore higher interest rates.
25.

Ongoing work on credit information sharing could improve the efficiency of bank

lending and strengthen competition. There is empirical evidence that after the introduction of a
credit bureau, the likelihood that a firm has access to finance increases, interest rates drop, maturity
lengthens, and the share of working capital financed by banks increases (Peria and Singh, 2014).
Introducing credit information sharing can also overcome one of the most significant barriers to
SME loan securitization – heterogeneity of SME loans.
26.

High leverage in certain sectors and sizes suggests that there may be scope to reduce

debt overhang. From the SME side possible steps could include reforming bankruptcy procedures,
including by introducing time limits to expedite reorganization or pre-packaged insolvency. Greater
reliance on online court filings could speed up foreclosures, while best practice guidelines for
restructuring would encourage more out-of-court workouts. From bank side, NPL write-offs could
be accelerated by, for example, higher capital charges or time limits for writing off NPLs. Regulatory
changes could also be used to encourage banks to establish NPL asset management companies.

STATISTICAL INFORMATION
(As of January 6, 2015)
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB)
and Eurostat while upgrading statistical systems to meet the euro area standards 1. Most
macroeconomic statistics can now be accessed through Eurostat. The country has been a participant
in the SDDS since December 1, 2009, with the metadata posted on the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics: Malta has compiled its national accounts in accordance with the guidelines of
ESA 2010 since October 2014. The effect of the conceptual differences from ESA 1995 on the
estimated level of GDP in 2010 was a relative small upward revision of 0.5 percent. Data on retail
and consumer prices, labor market indicators, and tourism arrivals are released monthly, usually with
a short lag. A harmonized index of consumer prices has been published since May 2004. These data
are available through Eurostat and via the Internet at the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the
National Statistical Office (NSO) websites. The NSO releases quarterly national accounts data in
current and constant prices with a lag of about two months, annual nonfinancial sectoral accounts in
current prices with a lag of about 11 months, and a monthly index of industrial production with a lag
of just over a month. However, national accounts data have been subject to substantial revisions,
often affecting several years. The reasons for revisions include large statistical discrepancies
(captured under changes in inventory stocks), particularly on the first release and revisions of
deflators. Furthermore, supply-side GDP estimates by type of economic activity are only available at
current prices. The producer price index for manufacturing has been published, but that for services
sector is still under discussion. National accounts imports and exports data are not disaggregated
into goods and services. Financial balance sheets and transactions by sectors, and data on
household debt saving are not available.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics meet basic requirements, with quarterly accrualbased data on general government operations compiled in accordance with the ESA2010
methodology and disseminated with a one-quarter lag. The general government comprises data
from the consolidated fund of government adjusted to include other accounts of g overnment, the
accruals elements, and the financial performance of the Extra Budgetary Units and of the Local
Councils. The NSO also publishes monthly statistics on the cash operations of the central
government, for which the authorities plan to utilize the targeted timeliness flexibility option in light
of additional time required for the final month of the fiscal year.

1

The 2007/08 Eurostat peer review on the implementation of the European Statistics Code of Practice found
that the NSO had reached a remarkable compliance with large parts of the Code despite its small size, but
underscored the need to improve adequacy of resources and data quality management.

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MALTA

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality. Since the
entry into the euro area in January 2008, monetary data for IMF statistical publications are now
obtained through a gateway arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the reporting burden of the
country. Malta has reported Financial Soundness Indicators beginning from 2005 along with
metadata, which are available on the IMF’s website (http://fsi.imf.org).
External sector statistics: Summary data (merchandise trade, current account balance, and selected
financial account data) are released on a quarterly basis with a lag of about three months. More
detailed BOP and IIP data are released annually, the latter with a lag sometimes exceeding one year.
The balance of payments data are usually subject to large revisions. Summary trade statistics are
released monthly with a lag of about 40 days. The CBM also publishes the external debt templates in
line with requirements of the SDDS, including both gross and net external debt. In line with the
European regulation, Malta has prepared the first BOP estimates in the BPM6 format covering the
period 2009-onwards; however these data have not yet been approved for publication in the IFS.
The country is planning to release historical data, possibly starting from 2004 in 2015. The new BOP
data include estimates for SPEs and other coverage improvements.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Malta
On February 23, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Malta.
Malta’s economy continues to weather the global crisis well. Spillovers from turmoil in
international financial markets have been contained due to low reliance on external financing by
the government and banks. Real GDP growth has been one of the highest in the euro area since
the beginning of the crisis, supported by relatively diversified exports, a recent recovery in
domestic demand, and a stable banking sector. Unemployment is close to historical lows and
among the lowest in the euro area. The external position is strong, and progress has been
achieved in reducing the budget deficit.
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable. Growth is expected to remain robust in 2015–16,
supported by domestic demand. Inflation is projected to remain subdued. The current account
surplus will likely persist.
The authorities have taken action on multiple fronts. Regarding fiscal policies, the Fiscal
Responsibility Act was enacted, and restructuring of various state-owned enterprises are
ongoing. As regards financial sector policies, the regulatory and supervisory frameworks have
been strengthened in several areas. On structural policies, steps have been taken to increase labor
participation and improve the judicial system.
Despite the robust outlook and policy action, Malta faces important challenges: public debt is
still high, nonperforming loans in banks are elevated, capital is relatively costly, and maintaining
external competitiveness is increasingly difficult.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Malta’s continued good economic performance and commended
the authorities for their consistent prudent policies. The external position is strong, the economy
is relatively diversified, and the banking sector is stable. Although the economic outlook is
robust, challenges remain, and policies should aim to further strengthen fiscal sustainability,
maintain financial stability, and enhance competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ fiscal targets for 2015–17. They recommended more
focus on expenditure measures by containing the growth in current spending while preserving
incentives for labor participation and education, and capital spending. Full implementation of the
comprehensive spending review would help prioritize and contain spending, while increasing
efficiency. Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen fiscal governance, and
stressed the importance of broad-based reforms on pensions, healthcare, and public corporations
to contain fiscal pressures going forward.
Directors observed that the large financial sector remains stable, and welcomed the
progress in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory frameworks. They considered that
reducing the relatively high level of nonperforming loans would further boost the resilience of
Maltese banks. It will also be important to remain vigilant to the exposure of banks to the real
estate sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to implement the action plans resulting from
the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment of the largest banks, and to apply the same standards
across the rest of the banking sector. They saw a need to strengthen the contingency framework
in line with reforms at the EU level, by boosting the resources of the deposit compensation
scheme, establishing a resolution fund, and introducing a bail-in requirement. Continuing to aim
for high standards in the AML/CFT framework will be important as well. Directors supported
the authorities’ intention to request an update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain the momentum of structural reforms to
enhance external competitiveness and boost medium-term growth. They called for continued
action to improve labor participation, upgrade skills, and reform the judicial system. To support
affordable lending to viable firms, Directors recommended measures to reduce the cost of
capital, by developing a strategy for the resolution of nonperforming loans, implementing the
planned credit registry, and encouraging a prudent increase in cross-border financing.

Statement by Carlo Cottarelli, Executive Director for Malta
and Antonio Bassanetti, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 23, 2015
I.

Overview

The Maltese authorities thank staff for a very constructive and valuable dialogue. The Report for
the 2014 Article IV Consultation is well-balanced and comprehensive. It conveys the message
that consistent structural, fiscal, and financial policies allowed Malta to weather the global
economic crisis well and resume a path of strong economic growth. On all these fronts they are
delivering steady and progressive results. The authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s
assessment and policy recommendations.
II.

Economic Outlook and Structural Policies

Since the onset of the crisis, Malta’s GDP growth outpaced that of the euro area and output is
currently around 14 percent higher than in 2008. This performance reflects strong fundamentals,
sound and prudent macroeconomic policies, and a resilient and well-supervised financial sector.
The remarkable diversification achieved by the Maltese productive system has also strengthened
the capacity of the economy to weather negative external shocks. In particular, recent years have
witnessed the sustained growth – in terms of both value added and employment – of financial
services, internet-related services, and aviation services, compounded by the reorientation of
more traditional sectors such as manufacturing and tourism (for example, the latter is benefiting
from the tapping of new source markets).
While the flexibility and adaptability of the productive structure makes investing in Malta
attractive (operating surpluses as a percentage of gross value added is well above the average in
the euro area), the authorities agree with staff that continued efforts are needed to prevent the
Maltese competitive edge from being eroded. In this respect, it is reassuring that the priorities
established by the National Reform Plan – and on which work has already been in progress for a
few years – largely overlap with staff’s recommendations. The steady increase of the
participation rate – particularly of the female component – is the result of a number of recent
initiatives (Free Childcare, among others). Together with the renewed efforts on youth education
and vocational training (Youth Guarantee scheme), it will help reducing skill gaps. Ongoing
progress in reforming the energy sector – including through the well-advanced restructuring of

Enemalta and the diversification of energy sources (gas, renewables, interconnector to Sicily) –
will contribute enhancing the country’s infrastructures and its business environment. The latter
will also benefit from the ongoing judicial reform, with positive spillovers to the credit market,
and the reduction of bureaucracy which is underway. On these and other fronts the authorities are
committed to deliver steady progress to sustain productivity and attract further investment.
III. Fiscal Policy
Building on the important results achieved in recent years, the authorities remain committed to
prudent fiscal policies. Despite some skepticism on the side of staff (Report for the 2013 Art. IV
Consultation), the 2013 target of a deficit below 3 percent was achieved with a sizeable margin
(2.7 percent). The authorities expect the 2014 deficit to have decreased to 2.1 percent, and target
its further decline to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2015. They note that staff projects a somewhat larger
deficit in 2015. While believing the measures undertaken so far are sufficient to achieve the
target, the authorities stand ready to revise the fiscal strategy as developments unfold to comply
with the fiscal targets committed in the Stability Programme and later confirmed in the Budget
estimates for 2015. To this purpose, revenue and expenditure outcomes will continue being
monitored closely, on a monthly basis, also in line with the new monitoring requirements
established by virtue of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and under the scrutiny of the newly
established Fiscal Council. In particular, as for the expenditure side, the authorities take careful
note of staff’s suggestions and observe that the budgetary targets are based on a three-year
medium term framework for expenditure commitments, complemented by the Comprehensive
Spending Review which is conducted at each Ministry level and should ensure a continuous
scrutiny of spending activities.
According to the latest estimates – based upon an updated information set made available after
the cut-off date of the staff Report and which includes payment of arrears as well as other factors
– after peaking at around 69.5 percent in 2013, public debt-to-GDP is estimated to have declined
to 68.2 percent in 2014 and the reduction is expected to continue steadily in the following years,
reaching 64.4 percent in 2017. Though with some more caution, a sustained fall in both the
deficit and the debt ratios is projected also by the recently published Winter Forecasts of the
European Commission. The latter bode well for the upcoming Excessive Deficit Procedure
Decision.

The authorities remain vigilant also to ensure the long-term sustainability of aging-related
expenditures. As staff described, initial important steps have been already taken on health care to
enhance the efficiency of spending. A review of the medicines and medical devices procurement
and distribution processes got underway with a view to reducing wastage. Looking forward, the
increased focus of the administration on primary care should also provide an important
contribution to sustainability.
Careful attention is also being paid to the pension system with the recent introduction of the third
pillar – the so-called Personal Retirement Scheme – supplemented by the Individual Savings
Account scheme. Both schemes are supported by fiscal incentives to encourage savings for
retirement. As correctly reported by staff, before considering if additional measures are needed,
the authorities prefer to wait for the availability of the updated pension projections to be
published in the 2015 Ageing Report of the European Commission (envisaged in May 2015).
The authorities are committed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the system and stand
ready to introduce, where necessary, further reforms to the first pillar. A Pension Strategy Group
(PSG) was set up in 2013 to assess and recommend how reforms can be introduced in the
pension system. The PSG has delivered its report to Government and a presentation with the
proposals is expected to be delivered shortly to the Cabinet.
There are plans to realign the national parliamentary programme closer to the European
Semester. This might imply that the Government would initiate the budget process at an earlier
stage, allowing the finalisation of the national budget closer to the submission of the draft budget
plan. This should ensure a better evaluation by the European Commission.
IV. Financial Sector
The resilience of the financial sector is a key ingredient of Malta’s competitiveness. The core
domestic banks continue to rely on a cautious business model, based on stable retail deposit
funding and locally-oriented lending, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio. The international banking
sector – though sizeable – has virtually no links with the domestic economy, and continues to be
profitable. Solvency and liquidity indicators compare broadly well with the average of the
European Union both for the domestic and the international banking sectors. The recent ECB’s
Comprehensive Assessment did not identify any capital shortfalls for the three participating
banks that operate in Malta. Continuous efforts are needed to preserve the resilience and

reputation of the system, to diversify funding sources, and to reduce exposure to non-performing
loans.
In this context, as staff pointed out, the amendments to Banking Rules 09 and 12 adopted by the
Joint Financial Stability Board are aimed at improving the banks’ overall coverage ratios and
provisioning practices, further strengthening the capital base, and enhancing governance
structures and risk oversight. These same amendments should also contribute to mitigating
potential risks from the exposure to the real estate sector, although we would recall – as we did
last year – that this kind of exposure, particularly in terms of collateral, is to some extent
unavoidable given the small dimension of the country. It is also pertinent to mention that
although advertised residential property prices have picked up recently, this follows a period of
modest growth. There are currently no signs of stress in the housing market.
The authorities will monitor closely the effectiveness of the adopted measures and the
developments of the broad financial system, standing ready to intervene as appropriate to
continue safeguarding financial stability.
As to staff’s recommendations, the authorities confirmed that the supervising institutions will
continue to be endowed with adequate resources and that the alignment of local definitions of
impairment triggers and forbearance with those used by the European Banking Authority and the
SSM has been already implemented through the amended Banking Rule 09 which became
effective in December 2013. Furthermore the Maltese authorities will be requesting an FSAP to
be undertaken by the second half of 2016.
The relative soundness of the banking sector should allow a gradual recovery of bank credit
growth, which, as staff pointed out, remains low. The authorities are tackling this issue through
different initiatives. A credit register administered by the Central Bank of Malta is being
introduced and will contribute easing informational asymmetries and lowering risk premia. At
the same time an assessment of potential market failures influencing access to finance is under
way, while the authorities are also considering the establishment of a Development Bank which
would complement lending activities undertaken by existing domestic banks. According to the
authorities, weak credit growth is partly attributable to a relatively high cost of capital,
particularly to SMEs, that could be addressed by a more diversified funding base by banks to
lower the cost of funding, and to some extent also by a stronger degree of competition in the
banking market. The judicial reform being undertaken to expedite liquidation of collateral, and

hence the resolution of non-performing loans, would also contribute to lower interest rates. The
authorities are also seeking to widen the possibilities of access to more diversified capital
markets for SMEs; actions in this direction include the setting up of a venture capital initiative.
