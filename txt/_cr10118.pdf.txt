INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the
Republic of Poland
Approved by Marek Belka and Aasim Husain
April 13, 2010
Executive Summary
Owing to a strong performance before and during the crisis, Poland is well
positioned for an advanced recovery. It is the only EU country to have escaped a
recession in 2009 due to its limited reliance on exports, well-capitalized and profitable
banking system, flexible exchange rate, and limited pre-crisis imbalances that afforded
policy-makers room to undertake counter-cyclical policies. Looking forward, growth is
expected to pick up as the global environment improves, banks’ risk appetite reemerges,
and the inflow of EU funds to Poland accelerates.
Fiscal policy should aim to gradually withdraw the large fiscal stimulus. Policies for
how to reduce the deficit remain to be fully specified. In staff’s view, striking an
appropriate balance between short-term cyclical and medium-term consolidation
objectives would call for a reduction in the overall government deficit to 3 percent by
2013-14. To help anchor confidence in medium-term targets, the fiscal framework should
be strengthened, including by introducing a permanent counter-cyclical expenditure rule.
Monetary policy should not be tightened prematurely. Given the subdued outlook for
inflation, policy rate hikes are not warranted any time soon. If upward pressures on the
zloty persist, there could be scope for policy rate cuts, provided inflation remains
contained. Under the current outlook, the central bank could also consider limited foreignexchange interventions without jeopardizing the inflation-targeting framework.
The banking sector is well buffered, but risks related to foreign-exchange lending
should be curbed. With balance-sheet adjustment having run its course and banks poised
to begin lending again, there is a risk of renewed build up of foreign-exchange exposures.
The authorities should take forceful steps to prevent a rapid growth of foreign-exchange
mortgage lending.

CONTEXT AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS1

1.
Poland is the only EU economy to have escaped a recession in 2009. Like its
regional peers, it experienced spill-overs from the crisis through both real and financial
channels, in particular the latter, as an abrupt slowdown in capital inflows caused a credit
crunch and a sharp decline in investment. However, consumption held up relatively well, and
the foreign balance began to contribute positively to growth from the onset of the crisis. This
reflected the large domestic market and attendant modest reliance on exports; a flexible
exchange rate policy (the zloty depreciated by 30 percent in real effective terms during the
initial phase of the crisis); and, not least, significant fiscal stimulus and monetary easing, as
policymakers took full advantage of the room for maneuver afforded by Poland’s contained
external and internal imbalances on the eve of the crisis. GDP growth amounted to 1.7 percent
in 2009, and a negative output gap of only some 1 percent of GDP had opened up by end-2009
(Box 1).

2.
Inflation has fallen close to the National Bank of Poland’s (NBP) target of
2½ percent. Headline inflation declined from close to 5 percent in mid-2008 to 2.9 percent in
February 2010, helped by a renewed strengthening of the zloty. Core inflation followed a
similar path, declining to 2.2 percent in February.
3.
The zloty is recovering. The rapid contraction in the trade balance led to a decline in
the current account deficit from 5 to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2009. In the financial
account, FDI has fallen notably, although higher retained earnings have cushioned the fall.
After an initial sharp contraction, trade credits are again increasing. Portfolio inflows have

A mission comprising Messrs. Thomsen (head) and Epstein and Ms. Velculescu (all EUR) and Messrs. Nier
(MCM) and Llaudes (SPR) visited Warsaw during March 2-25, 2010. Messrs. Allen and Sierhej, from the
Warsaw Regional Office, supported the work of the mission. Mr. Morsink (EUR, future mission chief) attended
the key policy meetings. Poland is an Article VIII country (Informational Annex, Appendix I). Data provision is
adequate for surveillance (Informational Annex, Appendix II).

performed particularly well, especially since the middle of last year, driven by renewed
external appetite for zloty-denominated government debt.2 As a result, after its initial sharp fall,
the zloty has been recovering steadily, although it remains some 18 percent below its pre-crisis
peak level in real effective terms.3
Box 1. Estimating Poland’s Potential Output
In the run-up to the global financial crisis, Poland was growing above its potential. In view of
the weakness of statistical methods, such as the HP filter, in identifying boom-bust turning points, a
recent IMF working paper provides new estimates of Poland’s potential output using a standard
production-function approach.1 The methodology concentrates on obtaining a robust estimate of the
labor input by deriving Poland’s natural rate of unemployment and the corresponding unemployment
gap. The paper finds that, prior to the recent global financial crisis, Poland’s output and employment
were both growing above their respective potential levels. This finding is consistent with the upward
trend in inflation and the emergence of capacity constraints seen in Poland during the pre-crisis
period.
Indeed, the rapid investment-led output growth in
2006-07 was unsustainable. By disaggregating the
contributions to potential growth, the paper finds that the
contribution of TFP growth was steadily rising through the
first half of the decade, remaining positive until 2007,
when it turned negative—largely coinciding with the trendreversal in potential output growth. At the same time, the
contribution of capital was steadily increasing, as
investment growth stayed robust, but it was insufficient to
prevent the growth in potential output from declining
throughout 2008.
In the aftermath of the current downturn, Poland is not
expected to experience a sizable and persistent negative
output gap. While Poland avoided an outright recession,
economic growth slowed down sharply, resulting in a
small negative output gap in 2009. According to the
production function methodology, the gap is projected to
bottom out at around minus 1 percent this year, and
gradually close by 2011-12. This contrasts somewhat with
the experience of other European countries, many of which
currently have negative output gaps that are large and
expected to persist for a number of years.

Poland’s Balance of payments (BoP) accounts show relatively large errors and omissions for 2007-09. An IMF
technical assistance mission visited Poland in July 2009 to investigate these statistical discrepancies and
concluded that they appear to be primarily concentrated in selected financial accounts. The NBP has been
following up on several areas identified by the mission and is working on adopting a new BoP compilation system
in the course of 2010, which is expected to solve many of these discrepancies.

The zloty is currently classified as free floating.

The banking system has withstood the crisis relatively well. Capital adequacy ratios
(CARs) have risen to over 13 percent at end-2009, from 11 percent a year ago. Moreover,
profits remained robust in 2009, reaching about two thirds of the record-high level of the
preceding year. While nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose from around 4½ percent in 2008 to
about 7½ percent in 2009 as economic activity declined, their growth appears to be slowing.
Banks’ balance-sheet restructuring is coming to an end. They have recently started to ease
lending policies for housing loans and short-term corporate credits and resumed foreigncurrency lending, especially for Euro-denominated mortgages (Box 2).

9
Box 2. Recent Developments in the Banking Sector
The banking system entered the crisis from a position of relative strength. Polish banks were not
exposed to toxic products and relied on international funding sources to a lesser extent than regional
peers. Moreover, foreign subsidiaries—representing about 70 percent of the Polish banking system—
continued to receive significant liquidity and capital support from their parent institutions.
Credit quality has deteriorated as the economy slowed. The increase in NPLs to 7.6 percent at end2009 was mainly due to worsening corporate credits. More recently, household consumer loans have
started to deteriorate at a faster rate, though mortgages (both in domestic and foreign currencies) have
remained relatively stable. With unemployment on a rising trend, non-performing consumer loans are
expected to increase further and then stabilize. The quality of corporate credits is expected to gradually
improve, as non-performing loans linked to foreign-exchange (fx) derivative contracts have been
declining as contracts have expired and the zloty has appreciated. Overall, the system remains resilient to
adverse macroeconomic shocks, as shown by recent stress tests by the NBP.
Capital adequacy ratios have risen, and profits remained robust. Capital adequacy ratios have
reached over 13 percent at end-2009. Some of the increase, however, is due to banks’ holding significant
amounts of government paper, which reduces risk-weighted assets. Moreover, the zloty appreciation has
also led to a decline in risk-weighted assets associated with fx-denominated mortgages. Profits remained
strong in 2009, reaching about two thirds of the record-high 2008 levels.
Banking-system liquidity is gradually improving. As elsewhere, the interbank market froze in late
2008. While the market resumed functioning in 2009, it has not fully normalized. The spread between the
3-month WIBOR and the policy rate declined and remained stable in the last quarter of 2009. But it still
remains above its pre-crisis level and higher than comparable euro area spreads, with transactions at
maturities longer than one week still rare. However, swap markets are normalizing, and demand for the
NBP’s facilities in Swiss franc, euro and dollar has been negligible since November last year. In addition,
inflows of EU funds are increasing banking-system liquidity, pushing overnight interbank rates close to
the floor of the NBP’s corridor and prompting the NBP to absorb liquidity through the issuance of bills.
Finally, deposit growth has held up well, underpinned by rising corporate deposits. Though still high,
rates on retail deposits appear to be softening.
The decline in credit growth has stopped. Annual credit growth declined to 10 percent in 2009 from
36 percent in 2008. This was due mainly to slowing corporate credit, as enterprises ran down inventories
and reduced demand for loans to finance fixed capital formation. In contrast, the growth of household
credit remained robust, especially in the mortgage segment. The latest senior loan-officer survey suggests
that in Q4 2009 banks stopped tightening overall lending policies and lowered spreads, based on a more
positive economic outlook for 2010. While banks eased policies for housing loans and short-term
corporate credits, they still tightened them somewhat for consumer and long-term corporate lending.
Looking forward, the survey reports an expected increase in demand, a slight softening of the lending
criteria on short-term credit, and a slight tightening of long-term credits.
Banks have started to increase foreign-currency lending. The introduction of Recommendation S in
2006, imposing tight lending standards on mortgages, including those denominated in foreign currency,
was helpful—together with favorable developments in interest rates—in limiting credit risks during the
downturn. Nevertheless, this measure was not able to prevent a sizable build-up of fx-denominated
mortgages. The stock of fx-denominated mortgages now stands at 65 per cent of total mortgage assets,
most of which is denominated in Swiss francs. Since Q3 2008, the share of new fx-denominated loans
has fallen, as banks faced difficulties in hedging the associated foreign-exchange risk in wholesale swap
markets. But, more recently, there has been an uptick in fx-denominated mortgages, especially in euros.

II. RECENT POLICY RESPONSES
5.
Fiscal policy is providing significant counter-cyclical stimulus. There was a
discretionary fiscal relaxation estimated at 1¾ percent of GDP in 2008 and 2½ percent of GDP
in 2009, mainly due to tax cuts enacted in 2007 but coming into effect with a delay. While the
government initially intended to offset revenue shortfalls to the extent needed to maintain the
state budget deficit below the limit of Zloty 18 billion in 2009—through what would have been
highly pro-cyclical expenditure cuts—it appropriately changed such plans at mid-year, when it
raised the limit to Zloty 27 billion. As a result, the general government deficit increased from
under 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to over 7 percent of GDP in 2009. The strong counter-cyclical
stimulus provided by fiscal policy—through a combination of discretionary relaxation and the
work of automatic stabilizers—was a major reason for Poland’s not falling into recession
during the global crisis.
6.
Market reaction to the wider deficits remained positive, helped by the
authorities’ decision to avail themselves of the FCL. While the impact of the Flexible
Credit Line (FCL) is difficult to disentangle from a broader improvement in sentiment, senior
officials and market participants indicated that access to the FCL was helpful to allow the
authorities to acknowledge considerably larger fiscal deficits without unsettling markets.
Thus, the FCL has been credited, in part, for the increase in demand in the domestic bond
market—which saw a return of foreign investors especially after April 2009—and the
subsequent decline in yields. Moreover, after the approval of the FCL, the government was
able to tap successfully international markets with long-term bond offerings that were
significantly oversubscribed. This allowed the authorities in late 2009 to start pre-financing
needs for 2010. The positive trend continued this year, with two large issuances of Eurobonds
at spreads that were half of those paid a year ago.
7.
The monetary policy easing cycle has ended. The Monetary Policy Council (MPC)
continued to cut rates through the first half of 2009, to 3.5 percent. It maintained a loosening
stance until October 2009, when it changed its informal bias to neutral, reflecting an improved
outlook and renewed concern about inflation. The new MPC that took office in February
confirmed the neutral bias in its first meeting.
8.
Facilities for exceptional liquidity support are being phased out. In early 2009, the
NBP lowered reserve requirements, extended the maturity of repo operations, broadened the
range of accepted collateral, and engaged in foreign-exchange repos with the ECB and the
Swiss National Bank (SNB). Given the improved market conditions, the NBP has limited the
use of the three and 6 month repos and allowed the repo agreement with the SNB to expire in
early 2010. Finally, the authorities have offered a credit-guarantee scheme through the stateowned BGK bank aimed at boosting corporate lending, but demand for such guarantees has
been limited so far.

14
9.
Further measures have been taken to safeguard financial stability. The
recommendation by the Financial Supervision Commission (KNF) last year that all banks
retain 2008 profits was instrumental in quickly restoring CARs to pre-crisis levels. With CARs
now considered to be at comfortable levels despite the continued increase in NPLs, the KNF
has decided not to repeat this general recommendation in 2010, although it intends to
encourage weaker banks to retain a large share of their earnings to create buffers above the
recommended CAR of 10 percent. While the quality of capital is generally high, the KNF
recently allowed banks to count certain convertible and long-term bonds in their own funds for
a set period of two years. However, this measure is subject to approval on a case-by-case basis
and aimed primarily at the cooperative sector. The KNF has also recently introduced
Recommendation T, which tightens credit assessments on household lending, as it considered
standards in this segment of the market to be of uneven quality.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
The recovery is set to continue to gain strength. The global environment is
improving; the balance-sheet adjustment in the Polish banking system appears to have run its
course, with renewed risk appetite suggesting that banks are ready to cautiously expand credit;
and, not least, transfers from the EU are expected to almost triple in the next few years.
Against this background, staff projects a continued recovery in domestic demand, in particular
public investment; a gradual increase in real GDP growth to around 2¾ percent in 2010 and 3¼
in 2011; and closure of the negative output gap by 2011–12. The projection assumes a small
negative contribution of the foreign balance to GDP growth, with the current account rising to
around 3 percent of GDP in 2010–11.4 Despite the zloty’s sustained appreciation since early
2009, staff assesses the real exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3).

11.
Inflation is expected to remain contained. In view of the negative output gap, and
with no evidence of pressures on wages and commodity prices, staff projects inflation to
continue to fall during the first half of 2010, stabilizing at or below the NBP’s target, under the
assumption of unchanged policies.
12.
Risks to the outlook are balanced, but external uncertainty looms large. On the
upside, developments during 2009 point to the possibility of a stronger-than-expected rebound.
Risks in this regard arise mainly from the possibility of larger capital inflows, if ample
liquidity and low interest rates in advanced countries, coupled with an accelerated recovery in
global risk appetite, were to cause an even stronger demand for assets of well-performing
emerging market countries like Poland. An alternative upside risk is a confidence-driven
improvement in domestic demand, not least coming from a faster-than-expected expansion of
banks’ balance sheets. On the downside, the still fragile economic outlook in Europe, including

4

This takes into account the expiration of car-scrapping programs in Western Europe, which proved useful in
sustaining exports during the crisis.

17
tail risks associated with vulnerabilities of a number of countries with high fiscal deficits
within the Euro Area, point to the possibility that global investors might yet decide to retreat.
Box 3. Real Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates suggest that the real exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium. Preliminary estimates
based on the CGER methodology for
the latest reference period suggest that
the recent appreciation of the zloty has
partly offset the real depreciation that
had been registered in the earlier part
of 2009. Specifically:


The equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) methodology suggests a
balanced assessment. This estimate
reflects a strengthened equilibrium
level, driven by improvements in
relative productivity.



The projected medium-term current account deficit (including capital transfers) is below the net
foreign asset-stabilizing deficit and close to the current account norm, implying a moderately
undervalued estimate according to the external-stability (ES) approach and a balanced estimate
based on the macro-balance (MB) approach.



The CPI-based real exchange rate is now slightly above its historical average. However, Poland’s
real exchange rate is still considerably below that of regional peers, in cumulative terms, as Poland
underwent a sharper real depreciation in the earlier part of 2009. Consequently, there is no
evidence yet of Poland having become uncompetitive as a result of last year’s appreciation.



As regards other indicators of price and cost competitiveness, ULC-based measures of the REER
improved in the course of 2009, as weakening cyclical conditions helped to dampen wage
pressures.

18
IV. THE POLICY AGENDA
A. Embarking on a Credible Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation Strategy
13.
The general government deficit is likely to increase further. The recently approved
2010 budget will, in staff’s view, entail an increase in the state deficit to about 4½ percent of
GDP, taking into account an expected revenue over-performance. With continued high
deficits in the National Road Fund, social security system, and local governments, the general
government deficit is set to increase to about 7½ percent of GDP in 2010, or about 7 percent
of GDP in cyclically-adjusted terms. Uncertainty around these projections remains high,
especially with regard to the deficits of sub-national governments, whose 2009 outturn has not
yet been finalized, and whose plans for 2010 can change during the year, as they are not
directly under the control of the central authorities.
14.
The authorities have yet to fully specify a plan for how to reduce the fiscal deficit.
Their target is ambitious: a deficit of 3 percent of GDP by 2012, as required under the
Excessive Deficit Procedure and outlined in their revised Convergence Programme. However,
the recently announced package of fiscal reform proposals, which remains to be implemented,
will in the view of staff only bring down the deficit modestly, to just under 7 percent of GDP
in 2011 and about 5¾ percent of GDP in 2012 (Box 4). As a result, the general government
debt-to-GDP ratio on an ESA95 basis is set to continue to increase, peaking at about
62 percent of GDP by 2014 (including debts of the National Road Fund that are excluded
from the national definition of debt).
15.
A consolidation strategy should balance short-term cyclical and medium-term
consolidation objectives. In light of the still incipient and uncertain recovery, staff believes
that aiming at a deficit of 3 percent already by 2012 is too ambitious and that a more gradual
reduction in the deficit is warranted. Staff suggests additional structural fiscal measures—
over and above those announced already—of ½ to 1 percent of GDP annually during the next
4-5 years. With such measures, the deficit would fall below 3 percent of GDP by 2013–14 and
the debt-to-GDP ratio would begin to decline from then onward.

19
16.
The substantial fiscal adjustment needed over the medium term will require
changes in entitlement programs. Given that statutory spending represents about ¾ of total
expenditures, a durable expenditure reduction is unlikely to be achieved merely by the
proposal to introduce a rule limiting the real growth of discretionary spending to one percent
per year. Staff agrees, however, that such rules, reinforced by comprehensive expenditure
reviews, could prove helpful in controlling discretionary spending. Regarding statutory
spending reforms, possible options include tightening pension indexation, rationalizing other
benefits (sickness, disability, etc.), and increasing the flexibility of limits on defense spending.
These could be complemented with further revenue-enhancing measures, such as better
linking contributions to income for the self-employed, extending coverage of the PIT to
include farmers, unifying VAT rates at a higher level, improving the targeting of child
benefits, and revamping the property tax system.
17.
The medium-term fiscal framework needs to be further strengthened. The fouryear rolling fiscal plans that were introduced as part of the revamped Public Finance Act in
late 2009 are useful in providing guidance on medium-term policy goals. However, they are
non-binding and remain focused on nominal deficits, retaining the potential pro-cyclical bias
in fiscal policy. Hence, there is a need to adopt a permanent, binding expenditure rule with a
deficit or debt anchor that is consistent with the authorities’ medium-term targets. The
framework could be further strengthened by the implementation of the ongoing multi-year
performance budgeting reforms at all levels of government.
18.
Poland has been ahead in implementing reforms to ensure the long-term
sustainability of its pension system. This is evident from cross-country comparisons using
more comprehensive, intertemporal measures of Poland’s net worth.5 Paradoxically,
traditional deficit and debt indicators are worse as a result of these reforms. With the deficit
now above the Maastricht limit and debt running against the ceilings imposed under Polish
legislation, the authorities have been considering, among other options, lowering transfers to
private pension funds (which currently add around 1.5-2 percent of GDP per year to the deficit
and debt).6 Staff is concerned that this could be seen as a more fundamental reversal of
pension reforms at a time when the credibility of Poland’s commitment to medium-term fiscal
consolidation hinges on reforms of entitlement programs. As regards alternative proposals,
including redefining the national debt definition and corresponding debt thresholds in the
Public Finance Act, this should be done in such a way as not to undermine confidence in the
fiscal framework and not to encourage spending pressures.
5

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper entitled: “A Leap Beyond Traditional Fiscal indicators: Measuring
Poland’s Intertemporal Net Worth and Deriving its Policy Implications.”

6

Under the Public Finance Act, two debt thresholds are established at 50 and 55 percent of GDP (they apply to
the national definition of debt): breaching of the first threshold triggers mild policy changes, serving mainly as a
warning signal to policymakers; breaching of the second threshold at time t triggers more stringent measures that
need to be implemented in the budget of the year t+2 aimed at curbing the growth in debt. A debt limit of
60 percent of GDP is set in the Constitution.

20
19.
The transparency of fiscal accounts could be increased. The authorities should
consider moving public entities (such as the national Road Fund) within the budget and
publishing the intertemporal net worth of the public sector on a regular basis.
20.
The authorities believed that their fiscal consolidation plans were sufficient to
achieve a significant reduction in the deficit. Even under an alternative scenario—with
macroeconomic assumptions closer to staff’s— they saw the deficit reaching 3 percent of
GDP by 2013 under the measures announced so far. Compared to staff, the authorities project
higher tax buoyancy and the same growth rate for other expenditure categories as for
discretionary expenditures that are covered by the CPI+1 rule. They agreed that strengthening
the medium-term fiscal framework is key to anchoring expectations in the sustainability of
public finances for the medium and long run. In this regard, they noted that they were working
on the details of a permanent fiscal rule and intended to provide a road-map for its
implementation later this year.7 The authorities also noted that a final decision had not been
taken regarding the proposal to lower transfers to the private pension funds and acknowledged
that any action to this effect would need to be carefully designed and communicated so as not
to undermine policy credibility.

7

A forthcoming IMF fiscal technical assistance mission will be collaborating with the authorities in the
development of such a rule.

21
Box 4. The New Fiscal Consolidation Package
The authorities have unveiled a package of fiscal consolidation and development priorities. While the
plan is important, it is not fully specified and is, in staff’s view, expected to yield only modest
savings, of about 0.1-0.3 percent of GDP per year in the medium-run. It is yet to be approved.
The plan contains concrete measures to broaden the tax base and improve tax collection:
 Rules on VAT reimbursements for company cars and fuel will be tightened.
 Fiscal registers for lawyers and doctors will be introduced.
 E-taxes will be introduced.
It also aims to improve the fiscal framework, including through new fiscal rules:
 A temporary nominal spending limit on discretionary spending, the “CPI+1 rule”—capping its real
growth to 1 percent—will be in effect until the medium-term objective (1 percent structural deficit)
is attained.
 A permanent fiscal rule will replace the nominal limit. It would apply to a broader scope of public
expenditures and rely on a real growth rate in a reference period and an inflation target. The details,
including coverage, target, and timing, are yet to be specified.
 An additional measure of public debt will be defined, based on an idea of the public sector’s
intertemporal net debt.
 Performance budgeting will be helped by the implementation of multi-year budget planning.
 Liquidity management of public resources will be strengthened through a monitoring system of all
budgetary funds and obligatory placement of all deposits of selected public-finance sector
organizations on Ministry of Finance accounts.
It advances reforms of pensions and disability benefits:
 Disability pensions will be aligned with social security contributions paid.
 Pensions of uniformed personnel will be merged into the general system starting in 2012. With
grandfathering, savings will be obtained only after 2030.
 A debate about changing the farmer pension scheme (KRUS) will be restarted.
 The investment efficiency of the private pension system (OFE) will be improved by modifying
investment limits, lowering fees, and prohibiting advertisement of pension funds.
It accelerates the privatization agenda:
 Privatization of public enterprises in 2010 will be accelerated, to generate 25 bn zloty. Additionally,
arable land would be sold.
But it also includes measures to improve state administration that will require additional spending:
 These measures include improving the judiciary system, increasing teacher salaries, advancing
R&D, etc.

B. Maintaining a Flexible Monetary and Exchange-Rate Policy
21.
Staff believes that a rise in policy rates would not be warranted any time soon.
This is in line with its view that inflation, under current policies, is set to stay around the
NBP’s inflation target of 2½ percent for the foreseeable future. It contrasts with the
projection in the NBP’s February Inflation Report that inflation is likely to exceed the upper
end of the tolerance band in 2012 and with the market’s consensus view that policy rate
hikes are in the offing before the end of 2010.
22.
If upward pressures on the zloty persist, and inflation remains contained, the
policy rate should be cut. The recovery in global risk appetite, not least in the demand for
assets of countries that have weathered the crisis well, suggest that foreign demand for
Polish assets could continue to build, resulting in further zloty appreciation. In that case,
staff believes that the MPC should revert to an easing bias and cut the policy rate.
23.
In this case, the NBP could also respond by undertaking limited pre-announced
foreign-exchange intervention. The intervention policy should be transparent and wellcommunicated so as not to compromise the integrity of the inflation-targeting framework.
The experience of other countries has shown that such a policy can be successful at a time
when the economic cycle permits a looser monetary policy.8 With subdued inflation and a
negative output gap, Poland appears well poised to successfully implement such a policy on
a temporary basis if upward pressures on the zloty continue during 2010. Intervention would
also boost international reserves, which are still low relative to standard metrics. The
limitations on foreign-currency lending for prudential reasons discussed below could have
the auxiliary benefit of slowing capital inflows. However, if capital inflows persist and
cause overheating, there would be no alternative but to tighten fiscal policy and allow
appreciation.
24.
The authorities had mixed views on the monetary policy stance. While most of
the mission’s interlocutors believed that the neutral bias remained appropriate, the
discussions showed different views regarding the balance of risks going forward: some
MPC members stressed the need to signal a possible near-term increase, reflecting the view
that risks were dominated by the possibility of a faster absorption of the remaining slack in
the economy and attendant increase in inflationary pressures; others, however, agreed with
staff that the more likely risk is that the zloty continues to appreciate, driven by capital
inflows, while the economy continues to operate below potential, which would call for a
renewed loosening bias. In this regard, while policy makers generally saw some scope for
further appreciation without jeopardizing competitiveness, there was a growing concern that
a rapid zloty appreciation could jeopardize the recovery.
8

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper entitled: “Coping with Capital Flows under An Inflation Targeting
Regime: Lessons for Poland.”

23

C. Ensuring Financial System Resilience and Enhancing Prudential Regulations
25.
Efforts to strengthen financial system resilience are continuing. The recent
introduction by the KNF of Recommendation T is expected to strengthen what are
considered to be uneven lending standards as far as household credits are concerned.
Moreover, in view of international efforts to tighten liquidity and capital standards, the KNF
continues to closely monitor and enforce quantitative liquidity requirements, and it plans to
ensure that the weaker tier of banks rebuild their capital buffers. It is also working on
bottom-up stress tests of banks, complementing the NBP’s top-down tests. In response to
what is widely perceived to be a potentially serious financial sector vulnerability, a law has
recently been approved that subordinates cooperative credit unions (SKOKs) to supervision
by the KNF and makes them eligible for lender-of-last resort support from the NBP,
although the law is currently subject to a review by the Constitutional Tribunal. Finally, the
authorities are advancing legislation allowing the government to recapitalize financial
institutions in emergency situations.
26.
Risks stemming from un-hedged foreign-exchange exposures should be curbed.
With liquidity problems having eased and domestic risk appetite returning, regulators and
market participants expect banks to increase foreign-exchange lending, not least eurodenominated mortgages. In view of this, staff believes that the KNF should take forceful
steps to limit such lending. The KNF should ensure that foreign-exchange lending is funded
and hedged on a longer-term basis, and capital requirements on foreign exchangedenominated mortgages should be raised decisively to reflect the higher credit and valuation
risks in the event of a sudden depreciation. These measures could be calibrated so as to
reduce the attractiveness of such mortgages. If prudential measures were ineffective in
slowing the growth of these mortgages, the government should consider legislating
constraints.
27.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s recommendations. The KNF has
been recently using moral suasion to stop banks from offering yen-denominated mortgages.
Moreover, it indicated that it was now working on a formal recommendation that would
require long-term funding and hedging for all currencies. The KNF stressed, however, that
the effectiveness of higher capital requirements would hinge on the cooperation of the home
regulatory authorities of parent banks, to prevent these banks from providing foreign
currency-denominated mortgages directly to local borrowers. An alternative was to place
constraints at the product level, which could then be enforced locally, using the KNF’s
existing consumer-protection powers or new legislation. Finally, the authorities indicated
that discussions are underway on how to permanently improve crisis management and
resolution processes, building on the strong resolution powers on the part of the KNF. They
welcomed the prospect of an FSAP update.

24

D. Adopting the Euro and Increasing Structural Flexibility
28.
Delaying euro adoption is appropriate at the current juncture. The authorities
have played down prospects for early euro adoption. In staff’s view, the large adjustment
needs in the next few years and the continued uncertainty in the external outlook suggest that
early ERM-II entry would be risky. More important, in determining when to adopt the euro,
the authorities should be mindful of the fact that exchange-rate flexibility has served Poland
well, providing a shock absorber that significantly facilitated adjustment to the global crisis;
such flexibility was an important reason for Poland’s having avoided a recession in 2009.
Staff believes that a higher degree of synchronization between Poland and the Euro area as
far as external shocks are concerned should be achieved before giving up an independent
exchange-rate policy. The credibility of Poland’s monetary policy framework, not least what
has proven to be a well-functioning inflation-targeting framework, also suggests that there is
no urgency to Euro adoption. Nevertheless, Euro adoption should remain an important goal.
29.
There is considerable scope for boosting potential growth through structural
reforms. Priority should be given to increasing Poland’s exceptionally low labor
participation, especially among those above 50 years of age. With significant population
aging expected in the coming decades, this bottleneck will likely hamper competitiveness
and weigh heavily on its long-run growth. The authorities have taken important steps to
address this concern, including by strengthening active labor market policies, reducing the
tax wedge, and tightening eligibility criteria for early retirement. But more should be done,
especially on reforms with a complementary long-term fiscal impact, such as pension
reforms aimed at gradually increasing and equalizing the retirement age between men and
women and unifying special pension schemes within the general system. Such efforts should
be complemented by actions to enhance product-market flexibility, including vigorously
pursuing the ambitious privatization agenda and further reducing administrative barriers to
business activity.
30.
The authorities confirmed that increasing labor participation remained an
over-arching priority. In this regard, they noted that work was underway on advancing
labor supply-enhancing reforms, including on unifying special pension schemes within the
general system and reforming the tax system for farmers. These efforts are in line with their
objectives established in their Solidarity 50+ and Poland 2030 plans. The authorities also
pointed out that privatization efforts were on track, with more than one fifth of the total
planned receipts for 2010 already achieved by end-March, and more revenues expected later
in the year from the privatization of several key public energy companies.

25

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Poland has adjusted its economic policies in a timely and effective manner in
response to the global crisis. It weathered the crisis well, being the only EU country not to
have fallen into recession in 2009. This is due, in part, to Poland’s large domestic market
and attendant limited reliance on exports, which—coupled with a well-capitalized and
profitable banking system—limited the negative spill-over from the crisis through both the
real and financial channels. But it also reflects sound economic policies prior to the crisis,
which contained macroeconomic imbalances and allowed considerable room for maneuver
when the crisis struck. Policy-makers took full advantage of this room to provide significant
monetary and fiscal stimulus. Looking forward, with the relative cyclical position
continuing to advance, but the recovery still feeble and uncertainty high, the challenge
facing policy-makers now is when and how to begin withdrawing fiscal and monetary
stimuli, i.e. how to adjust the policy mix as circumstances evolve.
32.
With inflation falling steadily and the economy operating below potential, staff
sees no case for an increase in policy interest rates at this juncture. Indeed, in view of
the steady recovery in capital inflows and attendant upward pressures on the zloty, staff
believes that the decision last October to end the loosening cycle and adopt a neutral bias
might have been premature. If such inflows persist, and if inflation remains contained, the
MPC should reduce policy rates further. Staff also sees a case for transparent interventions
in the foreign-exchange market at the current juncture, without fuelling inflation
expectations or undermining confidence in the inflation-targeting framework.
33.
The highly counter-cyclical fiscal policy has been a main reason for Poland’s
having avoided a recession. The large discretionary relaxation was fortuitous in as much as
it reflected the delayed coming-into-effect of measures adopted well before the crisis. Be
that as it may, the government’s decision in mid-2009 to abandon plans to offset the revenue
shortfall—through what would have been severe pro-cyclical spending cuts—was a much
welcomed change of heart. In this regard, the availability of the FCL enhanced the policy
space at this sensitive juncture, as it allowed policy-makers to recognize significantly higher
deficits going forward without unsettling markets. Indeed, spreads fell notably even as
announced deficits widened.
34.
The government now needs to be clearer about its fiscal exit strategy. With the
economy continuing to recover, the fiscal stimulus should be gradually withdrawn. The
government’s official objective—meeting the SGP target of 3 percent of GDP by 2012—is
ambitious, yet its plan for achieving it is unclear. In staff’s view, the measures announced by
the authorities so far will only slowly and modestly lower the deficit in the next few years to
slightly below 6 percent of GDP by 2012. This is too slow, and staff suggests taking
additional measures of about ½ to 1 percent of GDP annually. This would reduce the deficit
to 3 percent by 2013–14. Staff believes that its proposal strikes a more appropriate balance

26

between short-term cyclical and medium-term consolidation objectives: going faster—as
envisaged under the SGP—is too risky in view of the still feeble recovery in Poland and
abroad, but going as slow as implied by the government’s announced measures would limit
the ability to react to unforeseen changes.
35.
Thus, a reduction in the deficit is important for the authorities’ ability to adjust
the policy mix in a timely manner as circumstances change. In the near team, there
appears to be little risk that the slow withdrawal of the stimulus implied by the
government’s announced measures might be a source of inflationary pressures in the event
of a stronger-than-expected recovery in private sector demand. However, this risk increases
as the time horizon is extended and the output gap closes. In this regard, considering that it
could prove difficult for the authorities to tighten fiscal policy in a timely manner during
what will be a prolonged cycle of presidential, parliamentary, and local elections in
2010-11, staff is concerned that the slow fiscal adjustment implied by current plans could
force the authorities to adopt an inappropriate policy mix, with excessive reliance on
monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures, and attendant upward pressures on the
zloty. For now, the MPC has room to respond to the upward pressures on the zloty
associated with the large public sector borrowing need by lowering policy rates, but as
inflationary pressures gradually reemerge, such room will disappear, and continued large
public sector borrowing could be a source of excessive zloty appreciation.
36.
The KNF has responded effectively during the crisis. Its proactive move to
encourage banks to retain the record-high 2008 profits and its recent recommendations
aimed at strengthening lending standards for household loans speak to the effectiveness of
its supervision. Looking forward, the KNF should take forceful steps to counter what
appears to be a renewed appetite for foreign-exchange lending, not least the extension of
foreign currency-denominated mortgages. In this regard, the authorities should be mindful
of the experience of regional peers during the 2008–09 crisis that large un-hedged foreignexchange liabilities significantly curtailed policy options, in effect exacerbating the
recession through pro-cyclical policies. Foreign-exchange lending should be funded and
hedged on a longer-term basis, and capital requirements on foreign exchange-denominated
mortgages should be raised decisively to reflect higher credit and valuation risks. If such
prudential measures were ineffective in slowing foreign currency-denominated mortgages,
the government should consider legislation imposing explicit constraints.
37.
Staff does not support early euro adoption. While this should remain an important
goal, entering ERM2 any time soon would not be advisable in view of the uncertain global
outlook and the rigidities in the macroeconomic policy mix discussed above. More
importantly, the crisis has underscored the importance of being able to use the exchange rate
to facilitate adjustment to external shocks. In staff’s view, the swift change in the real
exchange rate was one of the key reasons for Poland’s not falling into recession in 2009.

27

38.
Overall, staff believes that Poland’s enviable performance during the global crisis
owes much to good and timely economic policies—before and during the crisis—including
a sound institutional framework. This augurs well for the authorities’ ability to meet the
challenges ahead.
39.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation remain on a 12-month cycle.

Projected Obligations to Fund: None
Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Since April 12, 2000, the zloty has floated freely.
Prior to that, the zloty had been pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar,
deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. As of January 1, 1999, the
currency composite was changed to a basket comprised of 55 percent Euro and 45 percent
U.S. dollar. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl 1 equaling old
Zl 10,000. The central parity of the zloty was adjusted under a crawling peg policy at a preannounced monthly rate. On May 16, 1995, a band of ±7 percent was introduced around the
central rate. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty initially appreciated
by about 5 percent above the central rate. In September 1995, the exchange rate was allowed
to appreciate a further 1 percent within the band. In December 1995, the central parity was
raised by 6 percent, and at the same time the authorities allowed the actual exchange rate to

3
appreciate by 22 percentage points. On January 8, 1996 the monthly rate of crawl was
reduced to one percent. On February 26, 1998, with the zloty pushing towards its upper limit,
the newly formed Monetary Policy Council (RPP) widened the fluctuation band from
±7 percent to ±10 percent. At the same time, the rate of crawl was reduced from one percent
to 0.8 percent per month. On July 17, 1998, the crawling peg’s monthly rate of depreciation
was cut from 0.8 percent to 0.65 percent. On September 9, 1998, the monthly rate of
depreciation was reduced further to 0.50 percent. On October 29, 1998, the zlotys trading
band was widened to 12.5 percent. On March 25, 1999, the zloty’s trading band was widened
to ±15 percent, and the rate of crawl was lowered to 0.3 percent per month. On
December 31, 1999, the official rate was PLN 4.08 per US$1. On April 12, 2000, the
crawling band regime was abolished and the zloty has since floated freely.
Poland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed
by Poland solely for the preservation of national or international security as introduced by the
European Union within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The
consolidated list of such sanctions is available at:
http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/sanctions/consol-list_en.htm. These sanctions
include freezing of funds and economic resources of selected persons and entities from: Al
Qaeda, Usama bin Laden and Taliban, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Côte d’Ivoire,
Croatia, DRC, Eritrea, Republic of Guinea (Conakry), Iran, Zimbabwe, Burma/Myanmar,
Iraq, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Lebanon, Liberia, Somalia,
Sudan, Syria, Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
VIII.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 13, 2009. In concluding the
consultation, Directors noted that the strength of Poland’s fundamentals, policies, and
institutions had enabled it to withstand the global crisis better than most of its peers. They
noted that a deceleration in economic activity was underway and commended the authorities
for the timely, well-focused, and measured policy response. Directors welcomed the
accommodative stance of monetary policy. On fiscal policy, Directors noted the need to
balance short-term cyclical priorities and longer-term objectives and called for fiscal
consolidation to start in 2010 if the recovery materializes as expected. They also stressed the
importance of strengthening Poland’s medium-term budgetary framework. Directors called
for continued vigilance of the financial system and welcomed plans to conduct bottom-up
stress tests of the banking system. They encouraged the authorities to reinvigorate their
structural reform agenda, including the privatization plan, to help enhance the economy’s
flexibility, bolster its long-run potential, and facilitate successful euro adoption in the
medium run.

POLAND—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of April 12, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: There are inconsistencies between annual and higher frequency data reflecting differences
in weights and in coverage. Electronic retrieval of the data is challenging. The sub-annual data are collected on
a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed.
Seasonal adjustment on relatively short interval leads to frequent and large backward revisions.
Price statistics: The CPI does not cover the imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings. The scope of the index
covers all resident households, except those in some rural areas. The PPI does not include any estimation for
missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government finance statistics: Consolidated general government data are published only on an annual basis,
at the time of the budget. The limited breakdown of expenditure by category hinders analysis and identification
of priority areas for fiscal consolidation; consequently, the data play a limited role in the public policy debate.

Monetary statistics: The shares and other equity on the asset side of the balance sheets of the NBP and other
depository corporations are not valued at market prices. The 2003 data ROSC mission noted material
differences between government finance statistics and the corresponding monetary data. It recommended that
the NBP, in cooperation with the MoF, reconcile monetary and government finance statistics and carry out a
reconciliation exercise on a regular basis. Data based on the SRFs have been published in the February 2008
issue of the IFS Supplement. They provide previously unavailable breakdowns of the claims on and liabilities to
the central and general government; the breakdowns are not available for other resident sectors.

Balance of payments: The customs and payment-based trade data compiled by the NBP need to be checked for
consistency. The NBP reports net foreign assets rather than the net international reserves previously shown in
the monetary survey. The coverage and reporting of the stock of external debt, especially at maturities up to
one year, could be improved. The 2003 data ROSC mission recommended: including interest on an accrual
basis; making explicit the legal requirement that the NBP disseminate balance of payments statistics; separating
insurance from transportation when making the c.i.f./f.o.b. adjustment; publishing on a regular basis a
reconciliation table between international merchandise trade statistics and “goods” in the balance of payments;
and undertaking periodic revision studies.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Poland
On May 7, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background
Poland is the only EU economy to have escaped a recession in 2009. Similar to its
regional peers, it experienced spill-overs from the crisis through real and financial
channels, as an abrupt slowdown in capital inflows caused a credit crunch and a sharp
decline in investment. However, consumption held up relatively well, and the trade
balance began to contribute positively to growth from the onset of the crisis. This
reflected Poland’s large domestic market and attendant modest reliance on exports; a
flexible exchange rate policy; and, not least, significant fiscal stimulus and monetary
easing, as policymakers took advantage of the room for maneuver afforded by Poland’s
contained external and internal imbalances on the eve of the crisis.
The rapid contraction in the trade balance resulted in a decline in the current account
deficit from 5 to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2009. Foreign direct investment has
declined notably, although higher retained earnings have cushioned the fall. Portfolio
inflows have performed particularly well, especially since the middle of last year, driven
by renewed external appetite for zloty-denominated assets, especially government debt.
As a result, after its initial sharp fall, the zloty has been recovering steadily.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
Fiscal policy has provided significant counter-cyclical stimulus, with discretionary
relaxation estimated at 1¾ percent of GDP in 2008 and 2½ percent of GDP in 2009,
mainly due to tax cuts enacted in 2007 but coming into effect with a delay. While the
government initially intended to offset revenue shortfalls to the extent needed to
maintain the state budget deficit below the limit of zloty 18 billion in 2009—through what
would have been highly pro-cyclical expenditure cuts—it appropriately altered such
plans at mid-year. As a result, the general government deficit increased from under
2 percent of GDP in 2007 to over 7 percent of GDP in 2009.
The Monetary Policy Council continued to cut rates through the first half of 2009, to
3.5 percent. It maintained a loosening stance until October 2009, when it changed its
informal bias to neutral, reflecting an improved outlook and renewed concern about
inflation. Nevertheless, helped by subdued wage growth and commodity prices, and
renewed appreciation of the zloty, inflation has recently fallen from around 4 percent in
mid-2009 to well within the National Bank of Poland’s tolerance range of
1½- 3½ percent. Core inflation followed a similar path, declining to around 2 percent in
recent months.
The banking system has withstood the crisis relatively well, while facilities for
exceptional liquidity support have been phased out. Capital adequacy ratios have risen
to over 13 percent at end-2009, from 11 percent a year ago. Moreover, profits remained
robust in 2009, reaching about two thirds of the record-high level of the preceding year.
While nonperforming loans rose from around 4 percent in 2008 to about 7½ percent in
2009 as economic activity declined, their growth appears to be slowing. Banks’ balancesheet restructuring is coming to an end. They have recently started to ease lending
policies for housing loans and short-term corporate credits and resumed foreigncurrency lending, especially for Euro-denominated mortgages.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors expressed their deepest sympathy to the people and authorities of
the Republic of Poland for the death of their President, his wife and many senior country
officials in the recent airplane crash.
Directors commended the authorities for their swift and timely response to the global
crisis. Anchored in a strong macroeconomic framework and financial system, and
buttressed by access to the Flexible Credit Line, this response enabled Poland to
escape a recession in 2009.
Directors noted that economic growth is set to increase gradually as the global
environment improves, banks’ risk appetite reemerges, and the inflow of EU funds
accelerates. Given the still fragile recovery and surrounding uncertainties, the timing and
manner of the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimuli will have to be carefully
managed.
Directors considered that policy interest rates should not be raised at this stage, in view
of the contained outlook for inflation and the excess capacity in the economy. If
increased capital inflows put persistent upward pressure on the zloty and inflation
remains subdued, interest rates could be further cut, possibly complemented by

3
transparent foreign-exchange interventions. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to euro adoption, while not setting a target date at this juncture. This will
allow them to continue to take all the steps, including on the structural front, for
successful euro adoption at an appropriate time, while preserving exchange rate
flexibility in the face of external shocks.
Directors stressed the need to gradually start withdrawing the fiscal stimulus while
carefully balancing short-term cyclical priorities and longer-term objectives. They
welcomed the steps already taken by the authorities to reduce the deficit and called for
further measures, including reform of entitlement programs and revenue enhancements,
to meet the deficit target of 3 percent of GDP. A number of Directors endorsed the
authorities’ intention to achieve this target by 2012, noting that although ambitious, this
would be achievable. A number of other Directors, however, were of the view that a
somewhat more gradual consolidation would be preferable so as not to stifle the
incipient recovery. In order to help anchor confidence in fiscal policy, Directors
recommended introducing a permanent fiscal rule with a deficit or debt anchor
consistent with the authorities’ medium-term targets.
Directors considered that, although the financial sector has been well buffered,
continued vigilance is necessary. They welcomed the Polish Financial Supervision
Authority’s recent recommendations aimed at strengthening lending standards for
household loans. Directors noted that the renewed appetite for foreign-exchange
lending could pose risks. They encouraged the authorities to ensure that such lending is
funded and hedged on a longer-term basis as well as to raise capital requirements on
foreign-exchange-denominated mortgages to reflect higher credit and valuation risks.
Directors also underscored the importance of cross-border cooperation in this area.
Directors stressed that despite Poland’s strong fundamentals, raising its exceptionally
low labor participation rate remains critical to boosting long-term growth. They
encouraged labor supply-enhancing reforms with complementary measures such as
equalizing and gradually increasing the retirement age and merging special pension
schemes with the general scheme. This, together with vigorous pursuit of the ambitious
privatization agenda, would help to enhance the economy’s flexibility and bolster its
long-run potential.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency
of the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent
of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board
discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of
developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post

Statement by Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, Alternate Executive Director for the
Republic of Poland and Pawel Gasiorowski, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 7, 2010
On behalf of the Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
discussions during the consultation and the comprehensive set of documents that provide an
accurate picture of the Polish economy. Our authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment.
Economic outlook
Poland has weathered the crisis relatively well. Economic growth slowed down to 1.8 percent
in 2009 from an average of 5.4 percent during the previous five years. However, in the last
quarter of 2009, the real GDP accelerated to 3.3 percent year-on-year. Further recovery is
underway and the preliminary data for the first quarter are encouraging. Industrial output has
increased by 9.4 percent in January-March 2010 (year-on-year). However, a sluggish
recovery in the euro area poses some risk to the base-case scenario.
Fiscal policy
Significant revenue shortfall, mainly due to discretional fiscal relaxation in 2008 and 2009,
has led to the deterioration of the fiscal position. The general government deficit widened to
7.1 percent of GDP in 2009 (despite of the undertaken net expenditure cuts of 1.1 percent of
GDP), while debt amounted to 51 percent of GDP. However, a large and timely fiscal
stimulus provided strong support for the economy. Employment declined only marginally,
and domestic consumption rose by 2.3 percent in real terms.
The authorities consider fiscal consolidation as the most important channel of bringing down
the debt-to-GDP ratio. The 2010 budget is based on a conservative macro scenario. In
February, the government approved the strategy for fiscal consolidation aimed at reducing
and then stabilizing the structural deficit at the medium-term objective level. The fiscal
adjustment will involve both quantitative and qualitative measures, including strengthening
and streamlining of the fiscal framework by implementing temporary and permanent fiscal
rules, comprehensively reviewing expenditures and fully implementing the performancebased medium-term budgeting.
Our authorities remain fully committed to the fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria, as well as
the budgetary policy framework under the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact. According to the
latest Convergence Program update, the general government deficit should be reduced below
3 percent of GDP by the end of 2012, which is a very ambitious but manageable goal.
Monetary policy
The negative output gap and the considerable zloty appreciation keep inflationary pressure
contained. The March CPI moved closer to the inflation target of 2.5 percent and amounted
to 2.6 percent y/y, compared to 3.5 percent y/y in December 2009. The decrease was mainly

2
due to the high base of last year, which was, among other reasons, related to the changes in
regulated prices (e.g. energy prices) and developments in fuel and energy prices.
During the April meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the reference rates were kept
unchanged and the Council maintained its (unofficial) neutral stance.
Since 1999 the direct inflation targeting strategy has been used in the implementation of
monetary policy and the National Bank of Poland (NBP) does not aim to set predetermined
zloty exchange rates against other currencies. It reserves, however, the right to intervene if it
deems it necessary in order to achieve the inflation target. Within this framework, on
April 9th, 2010 the NBP purchased a certain amount of foreign currencies at a favorable
exchange rate.
Euro adoption
The Government still represents the view that the euro is beneficial for the Polish economy
and should be adopted as soon as possible. However, aiming at preserving credibility of the
integration strategy, the Government decided not to set a new target date until the economic
situation has stabilized, enabling a more plausible assessment of the prospects for the
convergence criteria fulfillment. Regardless of the situation, the Government continues
preparations for the euro adoption and takes all steps that are feasible under the current
circumstances so as to be ready when external conditions improve. In 2009 the Government
Plenipotentiary for Euro Adoption and the organizational structure were set up. A document
specifying activities that should be undertaken in the process of monetary integration and its
timetable (Guidelines for National Changeover Plan) will be published in the 2Q2010.
The Monetary Policy Council maintains the opinion that Poland should join the Exchange
Rate Mechanism II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary
legal, economic and organizational conditions.
Financial sector
The conditions in the economic environment of the domestic financial system have
improved, following the developments in global financial markets. Despite that fact, the
lower turnover in some segments of the domestic market remains low, also as a result of
decreased confidence, in some cases derived from the problems noted by parent banks. As a
result, credit activity decreased.
Against this background, liquidity provided to domestic banks by their parent banks, the
availability of liquidity providing operations from the NBP and the increase in the value of
government’s bonds held by banks helped to considerably reduce short-term risks to banks’
liquidity during the crisis. The use of foreign parent bank funding slightly declined in 2009,
and demand for liquidity providing operations of the NBP waned to near zero.
The balance-sheet structure of the domestic banking sector and the structure of banks'
revenues curtailed the decrease of banks' earnings in 2009. Owing to this fact, a strong
deterioration of operating conditions did not produce losses in the whole banking sector, and
only lowered the earnings. Nevertheless, the banking sector in 2009 was highly profitable –

3
the majority of non-resident-controlled commercial banks reported a higher return on assets
than their parent institutions.
Turmoil in the financial markets and the related lower availability of market funding forced
banks to compete for stable sources of funding, especially for households' deposits. This led
to an increase of the share of non-financial sector deposits in banks' liabilities, which has a
favorable influence on banks' funding stability. Therefore, the average funding gap
decreased. It should also be noted that the liquidity position of Polish banks and the risk
related to liquidity management is subject to supervisory regulation developed before the
onset of the crisis.
Retention of a major part of profits generated in 2008 to increase regulatory capital, as well
as a lower rate of lending, contributed to the increase of the capital adequacy ratios of the
domestic banking sector and the capacity to absorb any credit risk costs. As of December
2009, the average risk-based capital ratio in the banking sector (excluding branches of credit
institutions) amounted to 13.3 percent and was higher than at the end of 2008.
Macroeconomic stress tests performed by the NBP indicate that a majority of the sector is
able to absorb higher than expected costs of credit risk with the revenue it generates and the
capital buffer it holds, without threatening its capital adequacy even if the rise in credit risk
cost is accompanied by a significant decrease in banks' revenues.
The sector of non-bank financial institutions does not pose material threats to the financial
system stability.
While the f/x lending risk has not significantly materialized in Poland, our authorities agree
that the f/x exposure to unhedged borrowers should be limited. In this light, the recently
approved Recommendation T focuses the risk analysis on the debt repayment capacity of
potential household borrowers. Recommendation T was generally welcomed by our
interlocutors from the financial sector as leveling the playing field for the banks. Moreover,
the current regulations for calculating capital requirements already provide for different risk
weights for mortgage loans in local and foreign currencies. The Polish Financial Supervision
Authority (KNF) is also working on the amendment to Recommendation S concerning good
practices related to credit exposures secured by a mortgage. Nevertheless, it should be noted
that foreign currency housing loans are of a much better quality than local currency housing
loans.
Our authorities agree that an effective macro prudential framework requires not only a close
cooperation between the national authorities but also cross-border cooperation where the host
country supervisors maintain sufficient regulatory powers, especially with regard to
prudential supervision. While the establishment of the European Banking Authority and
European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will be a step in the right direction, both frameworks
still have to become fully operational and a proper balance between competences and
responsibilities (burden sharing) must be achieved.
Our authorities still expect that the FSAP update planned for 2010 will also cover the issues
related to the supervision of Poland’s credit unions (SKOKs).
