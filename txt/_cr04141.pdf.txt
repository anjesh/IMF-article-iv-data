REPUBLIC OF BELARUS
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2004 Consultation with the Republic of Belarus
Approved by Carlo Cottarelli and Anthony R. Boote
April 22, 2004
The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Minsk during January 26–February 9,
2004. The team—T. Richardson (head), V. Bacalu, E. Jafarov, J. Vacher (all EUR), and Z. Brixiova
(resident representative for Belarus and Lithuania)—was assisted by J. Lyskova and E. Kovalenko of
the Minsk office. W. Kiekens, the Executive Director, and M. Nikitsenka, the Belarusian
representative to the World Bank Executive Board, took part in some of the discussions. The mission
met with National Bank of Belarus (NBB) Chairman Prokopovich, Deputy Prime Minister Kobiakov,
Minister of Economy Zaichenko, Finance Minister Korbut, and other senior officials. The mission
also met with members of parliament, NGOs, trade unions (both official and independent),
representatives of commercial banks and industry, and liaised with the World Bank office in Minsk.
Belarus has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of
Agreement (Appendix I). The authorities intend to permit publication of this report.
Data needed for Fund surveillance have been provided on a timely basis, and the authorities
announced their intention to subscribe to the SDDS. Although data dissemination is improving, the
quality of some basic (particularly national accounts) statistics is problematic (Appendix V). Draft

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Belarus continues to pursue a gradual approach to economic reforms, hoping in this way to
mitigate the social costs of transition. Recorded real GDP growth was robust during 2003, though
the staff has growing concerns about the reliability of the official national accounts data. Inflation
declined modestly, but remains the highest in the region, reflecting lax fiscal and monetary policies.
The fiscal stance continued to be constrained by lack of financing, and quasi-fiscal activities—
including directed lending—remained pervasive, raising concerns about the health of the banking
system. Structural reforms have largely stalled.
Prospects for establishing a currency union between Belarus and Russia seem to be dimming,
and the current timetable (introduction of the Russian ruble in 2005) now appears unlikely. While this
process is fundamentally political rather than economic, the Belarusian authorities recognize that
entering a currency union will necessitate significant changes in monetary and fiscal policies, as well
as faster structural reforms. At the same time, delays in privatizing Belarusian energy sector firms
have led Russia to curtail subsidized deliveries of natural gas.
Policy issues and discussions
The authorities target rapid real GDP growth in 2004, as they seek to achieve the ambitious
objectives of the president’s socio-economic program for 2001–05. They hope to secure 9–10 percent
real growth by tightening administrative control over the economy while also encouraging
development of small and medium size enterprises. By contrast, the staff projects more modest
growth broadly in line with projections for their main trading partners, including Russia.
The authorities do not agree that tighter fiscal and monetary policies will be needed to deliver
further disinflation in 2004. They believe that rapid remonetization will continue, and feel that the
fiscal stance is prudent given the modest deficit and level of government debt. The staff is less
optimistic regarding the likely improvement in money demand, and is concerned that substantial
quasi-fiscal deficits will eventually be reflected in higher public debt.
The exchange rate regime has begun to show signs of strain. Although de jure tied to the Russian
ruble, de facto the authorities’ crawling band regime has focused on the dollar. The authorities have
announced they will discontinue this practice in 2004, but the experience of the first several months
of the year suggests they may be reluctant to do so. Moreover, the staff feels it would be inadvisable
to enter the currency union before supportive macroeconomic policies and structure reforms are in
place.
The authorities, particularly in the presidential administration, are ambivalent about the need
to accelerate structural reforms. In the staff’s view, priority areas include the energy sector, the
business environment, agriculture, labor markets, public administration and public enterprise reform
and privatization. Weaknesses in the banking system should also be addressed urgently.
The authorities have withdrawn their request for discussions on a Stand-By Arrangement. They
have long resisted another track record period or SMP, which the staff has recommended, and have
concluded that their relationship with the IMF should instead emphasize economic policy
consultations and technical assistance in the Fund’s areas of expertise, which they highly value.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
President Lukashenko continues to dominate political life in Belarus. Under the
constitution, he would not be allowed to serve beyond his current term, which extends to
2006. However, the opposition seems weak and the president is reportedly preparing a
referendum amending the constitution such that he could run for a third term.
2.
Macroeconomic performance in 2003 was mixed. Driven by consumption and
public investment (especially on housing construction), officially reported real GDP grew by
about 6¾ percent in 2003, as did industrial production and agricultural output.1 However,
there are growing concerns about the reliability of national accounts statistics, in addition to
persistent methodological differences with international practice.2 Rosy macroeconomic data
notwithstanding, the financial situation of the enterprise sector continues to be very difficult,
as indicated by high inventory levels and the fact that almost half of industry (and two thirds
of agriculture) are reporting losses.

Although headline inflation continued to decline gradually, core inflation began
to creep up during the second half of 2003.3 As monetary policy loosened, the authorities
employed administrative measures late in the year—including slower increases in utilities

Belarus was one of the wealthiest republics of the USSR, and it continues to report comparatively good
poverty indicators.

The staff has repeatedly urged the authorities to publish the alternative estimates of industrial production and
GDP that were developed in consultation with the IMF’s Statistics Department. These estimates indicate that
official figures are likely to have overstated growth by at least 1 percentage point.

The authorities have constrained fiscal deficits to available financing. During
2003, the general government cash deficit was only 1¼ percent of GDP (1 percent on a
commitment basis), reflecting disappointing privatization receipts as well as limited access to
external financing. Revenue was

administrative department of the presidential administration.
5.
The balance of payments situation remains difficult. The current account recorded
a deficit of about 2.6 percent of GDP in 2003, about the same as in 2002, and the
merchandise trade deficit remained at 6.2 percent of GDP. Trade turnover rose very sharply

Data limitations prevent the staff from assessing the deficit of the public enterprise sector, though it is
undoubtedly significant.

on high energy prices, as demand for oil products exports—and thus crude oil imports—was
high. (A significant portion of the USSR’s oil processing capacity was located in Belarus.)
Nevertheless, the energy prices Belarus faces (particularly for natural gas) rose on average by
about 20 percent in 2003. 5 FDI was low as privatization stalled, but high interest rates
attracted some short-term capital from Russia. Gross international reserves jumped in late
2002 (following a large privatization sale), but since then have remained at about ½ month of
imports.
6.
The exchange rate regime began to show signs of strain in 2003. Belarus has a
crawling band regime that is de jure linked to the Russian ruble, but which de facto tracks the
U.S. dollar. Despite warnings from the staff about the impossibility of pursuing an
overdetermined system for long, their approach did prove useful in bringing down inflation
during 2001–02.6 It worked because the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) was also targeting the
dollar, but it became less sustainable as the Russian ruble began to appreciate in 2003. Thus,
the rubel appreciated by 9½ percent in real terms against the dollar during 2003, while
depreciating by almost 10 percent vis-à-vis the ruble. (The real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 7½ percent.7)

The terms of trade worsened marginally during 2003, and there was little change in the trade regime over this
period. WTO discussions are proceeding slowly (pending Russia’s application), while the impact of regional
arrangements (Eurasian Economic Community and related groupings of CIS states) remains unclear.

6

High levels of liability dollarization in the banking system may also contribute to the authorities’ fear of
floating against the dollar.

The REER tracks the ruble, as Russia accounts for about 60 percent of Belarusian trade.

Growing demand for money contributed to gradual disinflation despite
relatively lax monetary policy. Led by increases in NFA and credit to government, reserve
money grew by about 50 percent in 2003, giving rise to the underlying pressure seen in the
core inflation numbers. Moreover, the budget was modified at the end of December to permit
the NBB to double the flow of inflationary budget financing in 2003; as a result two thirds of
the reserve money growth stemmed from credit to government. CPI inflation declined despite
these large increases, as rubel broad money velocity fell by 17½ percent. The NBB reduced
the refinance rate from 38 percent at end-2002 to 23 percent at present (still positive in real
terms).

Despite good reported soundness indicators, the banking sector is increasingly
vulnerable. With 80 percent of the banking system being state-owned, and at least ¾ of
banking system exposure to state-owned enterprises, the government’s role in the financial
sector remains considerable.8 Notwithstanding their commitment under the 2001 SMP to
eliminate directed lending, the president and the cabinet have continued to issue decrees and
resolutions “recommending” quantitative lending targets to the six largest banks for favored
projects, regions and sectors. At the same time, senior officials, including the president, have
also become concerned about the level of non-performing loans (NPLs). As a result, the
NBB required banks to ensure that the level of NPL fell below specific thresholds by end2003. These thresholds were indeed met, with NPLs reportedly falling from 14.4 percent of
loan portfolio at end-2001 to less than 4 percent at end-2003. Much of the improvement was
due to portfolio growth, but the authorities also attribute it to strengthened payments
discipline and the weaker dollar (which made it easier to repay foreign currency loans). The
staff, however, fears that much of the reduction in NPLs was due instead to “evergreening”
(replacing NPLs with new loans). Capital adequacy ratios and liquidity are reported at
satisfactory levels as well, though underprovisioning is substantial.9 With full loan

The presidential administration has recently proposed a decree requiring SOEs to move their deposits to state
banks, which could have adverse implications for private banks.

The authorities have made substantial capital injections to Belarusbank and Belagroprombank in each of the
past three years.

about the quality of asset classification and overall risk management techniques (Box 1).

With a few exceptions, structural reforms seem to have stalled. Energy sector cost

faces, as they are likely to undermine growth over the medium term. Ultimately, the source
of the high inflation is fiscal policy—including quasi-fiscal activities—since lax monetary
policy essentially accommodates the needs of public finance. At the same time, the low level
of reserves gives rise to significant external vulnerability, particularly in light of the
Belarusian exchange rate regime. Although progress toward a currency union with Russia
dominated the 2003 discussions, there is much less momentum in this direction at present
(Box 3).
11.

Against this background, the discussions centered on the following questions:

•
•

Is the authorities’ macroeconomic framework realistic and appropriate?
Is there a need for monetary and fiscal policy adjustment in order to deliver lower
inflation, reduce vulnerability and set the stage for stronger medium-term growth? If
so, how large should the adjustment be?
What is the appropriate exchange rate regime, particularly if prospects for a currency
union are diminishing? and
What should be the authorities’ structural reform priorities, given that Belarus lags
behind its neighbors in almost all areas?

Box 1. Financial and Corporate Sector Vulnerability
Financial sector vulnerability indicators are belied by weak corporate sector figures. On paper, the share
of non-performing loans is declining, but corporate sector profitability is weak, suggesting that bank assets may
be more impaired than official indicators show. In addition, the high level of dollarization suggests a significant
risk of currency mismatches, as many borrowers of foreign currency have largely rubel receipts.

Box 2. The Golden Share in Belarus
The golden share mechanism in Belarus differs sharply from international practice. In particular,
the Belarusian authorities appear to be alone in retaining the right to issue a golden share after a
firm has been incorporated and privatized. Moreover, in most countries the state is usually
permitted to exercise its golden share powers to affect only a limited range of actions taken by a
firm’s board of directors. For example, in the UK, France and New Zealand, golden share powers
have only entitled the state to veto sales of large shareholdings to third parties, and then normally
only for reasons of national security.
The golden share was introduced in Belarus in 1997, reportedly in order to protect the interests of
the state (especially in the areas of defense and safety). The decree stipulated that the golden
share could be introduced into any company where the state owns at least one share (even if not
stipulated at the time of incorporation) and allowed the state to veto shareholders’ decisions on
restructuring and liquidation of the enterprise, changing its capital, use of net profits, and
appointment of the manager. By end-2003, the golden share had been introduced in about
25 enterprises, many of which had little to do with national defense. For example, in 2000 the
state used the golden share to block the sale of a 51 percent stake in a confectionary factory (in
which the state share was only 2.5 percent).
During the past two years, the authorities have considered proposals to limit, if not eliminate, the
use of the golden share.* Specifically, it was suggested that the golden share be limited to
strategic enterprises, that it only be introduced at the corporatization stage, and then only for a
specified period. However, on March 1, 2004, the president signed a decree substantially
expanding its scope. Under the decree, the state can not only veto, but also take independent
decisions in enterprises with a golden share, including in operational matters, and the share can
now be introduced in all companies which were initially state-owned, even if 100 percent private.
____________________________
*

Progress toward abolition of the golden share was a structural benchmark under the 2001 SMP.

A. Economic Integration with Russia
12.
The staff maintained an agnostic
view of the long-run merits of a currency
union with Russia, but stressed that the
timing is critical if it goes forward. As in
the past, the staff argued that the long-run
cost-benefit calculus is not clear on purely
economic grounds (thus, the decision is
mostly political). However, the staff and the
authorities agreed that it would be
inadvisable to enter the currency union
before supportive fiscal and structural

policies are in place. The staff argued that these policies are plainly not in place; in particular,
core inflation remains well above that of Russia, while structural reforms lag well behind.10
B. Outlook for 2004
13.
The authorities noted that they target extremely robust economic growth in
2004. In line with the ambitious 2001–05 plan set by President Lukashenko, real GDP
growth is targeted (not projected) at 9–10 percent in 2004. Fixed investment is to grow by
18–20 percent, while at the same time enterprises (both public and private) are being pressed
to ensure that average wages rise from about $130/month at present to $190/month by endyear.11 The authorities argued that their growth targets were achievable if administrative
measures were taken to tap “hidden reserves” in the economy. They also placed high hopes
on a new government program to improve the business environment—though some measures
in the program (e.g., streamlining the golden share) have already been rejected.

Inflation

14.
The staff considered the authorities’ 2004 growth objectives too optimistic,
arguing that they are based on an inconsistent macroeconomic framework. First, the
external environment is not conducive to a
sharp jump in the growth rate, as key

almost half the enterprise sector is lossmaking, (ii) the authorities program a modest monetary tightening, and (iii) external

prospects in Belarus. In the CIS, only Uzbekistan (which also had high inflation) and the
Kyrgyz Republic (which suffered from a drought and a mining disaster) have had lower

It is uncertain whether the benefits of a currency union, including lower transaction costs, would exceed the
potential costs, including the fact that external shocks are likely to be asymmetric. Further, as a commodity
exporter, Russia’s currency could appreciate significantly over the medium term, giving rise to possible Dutch
disease effects in Belarus (IMF Country Report No. 03/117).
11

The five-year plan calls for an increase in wages from below $100/month in 2001 to $250 by end-2005.

Box 3. Belarus-Russia: Status of the Currency Union
There was only moderate progress toward establishing the currency union during 2003. A
key technical agreement was initialed in August on converting to the Russian ruble during the first
half of 2005. Under this agreement, two Belarusian representatives would be appointed to the
CBR Board of Directors, and a short-term CBR loan of up to Rub 20 billion ($650 million) could
be available to the NBB to ensure stability in the payments system. In addition, a bilateral credit to
the government is under consideration (subject to ceilings on debt and deficits). The agreement
postponed a decision about the conversion exchange rate, but most observers expect it to be at or
close to the market rate.
At the same time, the authorities in both countries are sending mixed signals about their
readiness to create a currency union. On paper, they still confirm the agreed timetable, which
envisages a peg of the Belarusian rubel to the Russian ruble in mid-2004 and “ruble-ization” from
January 2005. However, President Lukashenko has repeatedly asserted that he will not give up the
rubel without additional financial commitments. For their part, senior Russian officials have
suggested the currency union be pushed back to 2006. Russia has also stepped up the financial
pressure on Belarus, chiefly in the form of higher delivery prices for natural gas. Indeed, Gazprom
disrupted deliveries to Belarus twice during early 2004, citing persistent payments arrears.
Privatization of Beltransgaz is a major stumbling block. A 2002 agreement granted Belarus
access to natural gas from Gazprom at internal Russian prices, conditional on the sale of a
significant stake in the gas transport and distribution firm Beltransgaz. President Lukashenko has
since put up hurdles to divestiture of Beltransgaz, and Gazprom, in turn, has threatened to raise
gas delivery prices substantially in 2004 (in which case Beltransgaz would raise transit fees paid
by Gazprom).

growth since 2001. The staff welcomed the market-oriented elements of the government plan
to achieve the growth targets, but remained skeptical that it would contribute several
percentage points to growth in 2004, particularly in view of the fact that similar programs
have been promulgated—to little effect—in each of the past several years.
15.
On current policies, the staff projected growth at 4.8 percent—about one half the
authorities’ target, owing mainly to weaker investment (given the authorities’ planned wage
hikes) and a deteriorating current account. Under the staff’s reform scenario, growth would
be still lower in 2004—about 4.0 percent—given the need for tighter macroeconomic
policies, but would rise over the medium term (Table 5). In both cases, it is assumed that the
crawling band exchange rate regime is retained at least through end-2005. The mission
argued that on current policies inflation during 2004 is likely to be around 22 percent, well
above the authorities’ target, given the substantial monetary impulse in late December 2003.
16.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the trade balance is likely to deteriorate
in 2004. On current policies, the staff projected both the current account and the trade
balance to weaken by just under 1 percent of GDP, of which about 0.5 percent is due to the
impact of moving natural gas trade to the prices that now apply to Ukraine. The staff
forecasted a modest additional deterioration because of lost competitiveness owing to
excessive wage growth and delayed structural reforms, which have undermined needed
investment inflows, as well as a loss of international reserves.12 The authorities’ projections
did not differ sharply from those of the staff—except for the loss of reserves.

1 percent in cash terms, as the
government would run arrears). The mission pressed for a balanced budget, arguing that
contingent liabilities have long been building in the banking system (as quasi-fiscal lending
to agriculture and industry will eventually be converted to government debt). The mission
also pointed to the lack of non-inflationary financing; the reserve money base is so small that
financing even a deficit of 1 percent of GDP would involve excessive monetary creation.13

13

Under a longstanding commitment to Russia, from 2004 the NBB should no longer provide direct credit to
government.

Box 4. Belarusian Responsiveness to IMF Policy Advice
In concluding the last Article IV consultation on April 16, 2003, Directors emphasized the need
to strengthen the policy framework in order to further reduce inflation and increase external
competitiveness. They considered the current policy mix to be inconsistent with plans to peg the
Belarusian rubel to the Russian ruble. Directors urged elimination of dollar wage targets and placed
particular emphasis on expenditure rationalization in view of the large size of the government. They
encouraged the authorities to reduce vulnerabilities in the financial sector and regretted the
reappearance of directed lending. Directors stressed the need to improve business environment,
including by eliminating the “golden share” rule. Directors emphasized that a good track record of
policy implementation would be a prerequisite for a possible Fund financial assistance to Belarus,
and supported expansion of technical assistance and related forms of collaboration with Belarus.
The authorities’ responsiveness to Board recommendations has been mixed. Despite the call to
tighten policies to bring inflation down more rapidly, they were loosened late in the year during 2002
and 2003. Wage growth was relatively moderate during 2003, but the authorities’ plans for 2004
represent a return to imprudent practices. Regarding elimination of direct NBB financing of the
budget and emphasizing expenditure reductions, the 2004 budget represents a step in the right
direction. However, there has been little movement in key areas of structural reform; privatization
has stalled, the “golden share” has been expanded (not eliminated), and the business environment has
not improved.

reform scenario, expenditure cuts would need to sum to about 3 percent of GDP relative to
current policies, or about 1 percent of GDP beyond those already in the budget.14 The staff
recommended additional reductions in subsidies (including reduction in support to collective
farms) and the ill-designed housing construction program, as well as zero budgetary lending
and more modest road construction. In addition, the mission suggested that education
spending return to the level of 2002 as a share of GDP, supported by public sector wage
restraint.15 Despite the large scale of fiscal consolidation, social spending (including
pensions) would remain adequate at about 25 percent of GDP.

Discussions on the exchange rate regime focused on the appropriate choice of a
target currency. Before the mission, the authorities announced that in 2004 they would

the end-2003 rate. Although the Russian
ruble has also moved very little against the dollar during February–March, the staff has
warned of the danger that expectations in Belarus could form around a soft peg to the dollar.
20.
Moreover, the NBB indicated that they are still inclined to introduce a peg to the
ruble in July, notwithstanding the concerns of the staff regarding the need to put appropriate
fiscal and structural policies in place beforehand. The mission suggested maintaining the
crawling band regime against the ruble, with the rate of crawl designed to help rebuild
reserves and to ensure that competitiveness does not suffer if the Russian ruble appreciates in

The budget envisages significant cuts in agricultural spending, housing and communal services, and net
repayments of old budgetary loans. However, the budget has recently been amended to accommodate higher

21.
The authorities did not agree with the staff on the need to tighten their monetary
program for 2004. Given the rate of crawl under the reform scenario, the staff pressed for a
revision of the monetary program to offset the impact of the large monetary impulse which
took place on December 30, 2003. Although the authorities acknowledged that the December
revised budget (financed by extra NBB credit) will have additional inflationary consequences
in 2004, they placed their hopes on a faster-than-expected increase in money demand. The
staff was less sanguine about the prospects for continued growth in money demand. At the
same time, the authorities recognized that administrative measures were an important factor
explaining the slowdown in inflation at end-2003, and acknowledged the staff’s view that
these steps are an inefficient and ultimately futile way to disinflate. However, they also felt
obligated to deliver on the inflation objective in the approved macroeconomic framework for
2004, and thus may resort to them again.
E. Structural Policies
22.
The authorities were ambivalent about the need for deep, market-oriented
structural reforms. A number of senior officials, including in the presidential
administration, were not convinced of this need, explaining that they wished to avoid
mistakes made by neighboring countries, and ensure that any reform measures they
undertake will not lead to a worsening in the standards of living. On the other hand, many
officials in the government and the NBB agreed with the staff that there is a need to

The staff also noted that the possible currency union argues for building a modest competitive margin into
the rate of crawl, given the medium-term prospects for real appreciation in Russia.

accelerate structural reforms, not only to promote growth and competitiveness, but also to
prepare for the possible currency union.
23.
On many questions, the authorities agreed with the staff that reform is
necessary, but disagreed on the pace or timing of the measure. In other areas, there was
simply disagreement about the need for reform at all. The staff particularly emphasized the
following areas:
Belarus: Structural Reform Priorities
Proposed structural reform

Authorities’ reaction

Extending energy sector reform by introducing
independent regulation and by raising cost recovery
levels, especially for enterprises.

Although they agreed that further cost recovery
increases are important, the authorities were also
concerned not to undermine disinflation.

Redesigning the housing construction program to
target needy groups in a more cost-effective manner.

The authorities felt the housing construction program
has appropriately supported economic activity over
the past three years.

Undertaking agricultural reform, beginning with
allowing private ownership of land and streamlining
of rural income support from the budget.

Although the authorities recognized the enormous
size of transfers to agriculture, they resisted
politically sensitive measures to scale them back.

Improving labor market flexibility.18

The authorities acknowledged that labor-market
flexibility is essential under a pegged exchange rate
regime, but they also felt constrained by the wage
increases specified in the five-year plan.

Bolstering the medium-term fiscal consolidation by
undertaking a thorough civil service and public
administration reform.

The authorities were aware that similar measures are
being undertaken in Russia, but have not begun to
prepare them in Belarus.

Improving public enterprise management, including
through further corporatization and trust management
arrangements.

Apart from a few cases of trust management, the
authorities have concentrated on the initial stage of
corporatization—that is, separating SOEs from the
branch ministries.

Proposed structural reform

Authorities’ reaction

Eliminating the “golden share” provision.

The presidential administration considers it an
important safeguard of workers’ rights.

Accelerating privatization, including by using
internationally-reputable advisors in preparing large
tenders.

Belarus and Russia have agreed to employ an
international firm to assess the value of Beltransgaz.
Otherwise, the authorities did not consider it costeffective to hire foreign advisors.

Improving the business environment by limiting ad
hoc inspections and regulations, ensuring stability of
the legal system, and by developing a timetable to
move accounting standards to IAS.

The authorities recognized the importance of
improving the business environment.

24.
The mission emphasized that weaknesses in the banking sector need to be
addressed urgently, and urged the authorities to tighten prudential regulations, including by
limiting lending in foreign currency (particularly for firms without foreign-exchange
earnings), preventing “evergreening” (¶8), and by refraining from all forms of directed
lending. Rapid credit growth needs to be kept under close watch in Belarus, as elsewhere in
the region. Moreover, the staff argued that the lack of restructuring of loss-making public
enterprises is the source of most problems in the banking sector, and urged the authorities to
consider a comprehensive program of corporate and financial sector reform.19 The authorities
pointed to excellent vulnerability indicators, and noted that foreign exchange exposure limits
have recently been tightened. They are looking forward to the FSAP later in 2004, which
could aid the design of a financial sector reform program.
F. IMF Relations
25.
The authorities withdrew their request for a Stand-By Arrangement, in
recognition of longstanding disagreements with the staff regarding appropriate
macroeconomic policies. The staff had noted that a program would in any case require a prior
track record of successful policies (possibly an SMP). At the same time, the authorities
reconfirmed their interest in continued technical cooperation with the Fund, and
responsiveness in this area has generally been good (Appendix II).
19

The reform program would include corporate sector restructuring and eventual bank privatization—as
improvements in the prudential framework permit. Chapter IV of the selected issues papers considers financial
sector reform issues.

- 23 -

26.
A voluntary safeguards assessment was conducted in December. Although
potential users of IMF resources have long been encouraged to undertake a voluntary
safeguards assessment, Belarus is the first member country to do so. The staff noted
significant vulnerabilities in the safeguards framework, including in the areas of the legal
structure and independence of the NBB, internal and external audit, and financial reporting
(including the need to publish IFRS-based financial statements). The authorities found the
safeguards assessment useful and have provided detailed comments on the assessment. In
some areas they have begun to implement the staff’s recommendations; in other areas, they
are considering the most appropriate steps to address the shortcomings identified by the staff.
G. Medium-Term Outlook
27.
The mission argued that, on current policies, Belarusian medium-term prospects
are not bright. Although subject to considerable uncertainty, the staff projects growth to
slow to about 2½ percent, as investment stagnates and FDI fails to materialize.20 Reserves
cannot fall much below their current level, meaning the balance of payments deficit would
need to be financed by arrears accumulation. In the absence of even this form of financing,
import compression would further undermine growth.
28.
The authorities were generally not convinced that macroeconomic adjustment
and structural reform in the short run would yield better outcomes over the medium
term. Under the reform scenario, the staff argued growth rates would stabilize at about the
levels expected in Russia (4½ percent), supported by a higher savings rate and stronger
investment, particularly by the non-government sector. The current account deficit would
become more sustainable, with stronger FDI inflows and higher international reserves. The
authorities felt that the trade-off between reform now and growth later is a false one, and
explained that their priority is to deliver on the promises in the plan for 2001–05. Baseline
debt sustainability (DSA) projections (tables 6 and 7) indicate a modest build-up of external
debt through 2008, though the debt dynamics are explosive under some stress test scenarios
(mainly owing to projecting forward the high volatility of the 1993–2003 base period).
Although the public debt dynamics generally do not give rise to concerns (table 8), under
some stress test scenarios the debt could approach uncomfortable levels. Nevertheless, these
scenarios are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, further underscoring the need for fiscal
consolidation.
29.
The medium-term outlook is subject to a number of down-side risks. First, an
unexpected sharp revenue decline could result from transition-related fiscal adjustment (as in
other FSU countries) or from tax harmonization with Russia. Second, Belarus is vulnerable
to external shocks, particularly those coming from Russia, which itself faces risks associated
with oil price volatility. Third, demographic factors make pension reform a priority. Fourth,
20

Both the reform and current policies scenarios assume that Belarus will import Russian monetary conditions
beginning in 2006—either via a peg or by entering the currency union.

- 24 -

external financing is subject to large uncertainties, as the Eurobond market may have little
appetite for Belarusian debt. Finally, Gazprom could raise gas delivery prices to the levels
now paid by Poland, while the low level of official reserves and the high share of short-term
debt (and arrears) are of concern. Nevertheless, in view of the relatively low debt burden and
good repayment record, the staff expects that Belarus will continue to meet its obligations to
the Fund (which end in 2005) in a timely fashion.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
In a number of areas, Belarus has recorded significant achievements over the
past 2–3 years. First, growth has been robust, however measured, while the fiscal and
current account deficits have been modest by regional standards. Second, inflation has
continued to decline and exchange rate liberalization has been consolidated. Third, energy
sector cost recovery levels have increased, and cross subsidization has been reduced. Finally,
poverty and inequality indicators have continued to perform well by transition country
standards.
31.
Nevertheless, medium-term growth prospects continue to be jeopardized by the
highest inflation in the region and the slow pace of structural reform. The observed
disinflation stems less from prudent macroeconomic polices than from a region-wide trend to
remonetization, as well as administrative measures and the effects of a nominal anchor
defined in terms of the dollar. Achieving a breakthrough to the levels of inflation of
neighboring countries must be a key objective of the authorities going forward. Similarly,
robust medium-term growth is unlikely without structural reforms to improve the
performance of public enterprises and enhance the business environment.
32.
The authorities could be losing an important window of opportunity. Belarus is
still at the beginning of the transition process, and the authorities should seek to make
progress while the external environment is relatively favorable. At present, the regional
process of remonetization, combined with low levels of debt (and a large stock of
privatizable assets), could permit the authorities to manage the costs of transition much more
easily than was the case for neighboring countries in the mid-1990s.
33.
In that context, the authorities’ macroeconomic framework for 2004 is not
appropriate. Its assumptions for growth and investment are derived from the 2001–05 plan,
rather than from unbiased economic projections, and are not supported by consistent fiscal
and monetary policies. In particular, it is regrettable that the authorities have again resorted to
targeting unrealistic wage growth in dollar terms. Attempting to hike average wages to
$190/month will undermine enterprise finances, reduce private sector investment, and drive
firms to run tax arrears (as was the case in early 2002).
34.
Tighter monetary and fiscal policies would be needed in order to reduce inflation
to the authorities’ target range. Elimination of direct NBB financing to the budget is longoverdue, and should not simply be replaced by additional policy lending through the banking

- 25 -

system. Expenditure rationalization is called for in order to buttress the fiscal adjustment
envisaged in the budget, as well as to conform to the available level of financing.
35.
Although the decision on whether or not to join the currency union with Russia
is more political than economic, it will be important to get the timing right if the process
goes ahead. Belarus should neither peg nor consider joining the currency union until fiscal
and monetary policies have adjusted appropriately, supported by deep structural reforms.
36.
The crawling band regime affords the flexibility to ensure competitiveness and
strengthen the reserve position. Given the importance of Russia in bilateral trade, it is
appropriate—both de jure and de facto—to set the band in terms of the ruble, rather than the
dollar. But the rate of crawl should take into account possible movements of the ruble over
the medium term, as well as possible financial sector vulnerabilities. Indeed, despite
relatively favorable debt dynamics, the balance of risks over the medium term is negative,
underscoring the need for an early change in economic policies.
37.
A number of important structural reforms would be needed, chiefly elimination
of the “golden share” rule, which serves as a strong disincentive to investors—both foreign
and domestic. In addition to privatization and public enterprise reform, it will be important to
ensure stability of the legal framework, move forward with accounting reform, and minimize
unnecessary inspections and interference in small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally,
weaknesses in the financial sector should be addressed as a priority.
38.
The staff supports strengthened technical cooperation between the IMF and
Belarus. Belarus generally has a good record of implementing TA recommendations, and the
authorities are encouraged to continue working toward addressing the shortcomings
identified by MFD, fiscal and data ROSC missions.
39.
There are weaknesses in some areas of economic data, particularly the national
accounts, which appear to overstate real economic growth. Nevertheless, these shortcomings
are relatively well-understood, with predictable signs, meaning the quality of data is
generally adequate for IMF surveillance purposes. It is hoped that the process of SDDS
subscription will contribute to improvements in the statistical area.
40.
The next Article IV consultation with Belarus is expected to be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Safeguards Assessments:

As there is no arrangement in place, under the Fund’s safeguards assessments policy, the
National Bank of Belarus (NBB) is not subject to a full safeguards assessment. However, as a
potential borrower, the NBB requested a voluntary safeguards assessment, and an on-site
assessment was conducted in December 2003.. The assessment concluded that significant
vulnerabilities exist in the safeguards framework, especially in the areas of the legal structure
and independence, external and internal audit, and in financial reporting. The assessment made

- 38-

APPENDIX I

specific recommendations to correct the identified shortcomings. The authorities have begun to
take steps to address some of these issues, and are considering appropriate measures to address
the remaining concerns.
VIII. Exchange Arrangements:
As of August 20, 1994, the rubel (Rbl) became the unit of account replacing the
Belarusian ruble, which was formally recognized as the sole legal tender only on May 18, 1994.
The conversion took place at the rate of 10 Belarusian rubles = 1 rubel. The authorities decided
to drop three zeroes from the rubel denomination as of January 1, 2000. The exchange rate for
the U.S. dollar was Rbl 2,151 on March 11, 2004.
In mid-September 2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the market-determined rate
resulting from daily auctions at the Belarus Currency and Stock Exchange. Since then, the
official rate on any day is equal to the closing rate of the previous trading day. In line with the
objective to reach monetary union with Russia by 2005, the authorities adopted a crawling band
vis-à-vis the Russian ruble in January 2001, with monthly rates of devaluation that are revised
quarterly and a band of currently 5 percentage points around central parity. On November 5,
2001, Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles
of Agreement. During the same month, the NBB suspended all ad hoc exemptions from the 30
percent surrender requirement.

APPENDIX III

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Partnership in Belarus’ Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank Group program in Belarus was rather limited during the period
1995–2000, and the FY99 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) set a strict trigger (exchange
rate unification) for the resumption of IBRD lending. The trigger was met in September
2000, leading to an improvement in the quality and intensity of the dialogue between Belarus
and the Bank. The current CAS was approved in 2002 to advance cooperation with Belarus
in critical areas, help the country open up its economy and society, minimize social and
environmental risks, and address global public good concerns. CAS implementation,
however, has been neither smooth nor satisfactory and has recently encountered major
setbacks in reaching agreed program objectives.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.
The Bank and Fund teams work closely in Belarus and maintain an extremely good
relationship. The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the World Bank focuses on
the structural agenda, social and environmental issues. The Bank and the Fund teams work as
complements and carry out joint activities on the key fiscal and structural issues. The joint
work on the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) is an example of excellent
cooperation between the two institutions. There are other joint activities planned, i.e., on
FSAP and a Country Economic Memorandum.
Areas in which the World Bank leads
3.
Social sphere. The second Poverty Assessment (PA) was launched in the Fall of
2002. The study objectives were to update the understanding of the evolution of poverty,
inequality, vulnerability and opportunities as compared to the first PA (1996), to analyze
more deeply the non-income dimensions of poverty, to assess the poverty reduction impact of
various public subsidies, to build local capacity in order to improve poverty measurement
and analysis and its use in policy formulation, and to provide policy recommendations that
can assist Belarus in consolidating and accelerating its economic transformation while caring
for the most vulnerable. For Belarus, the PA could lay the basis for strengthening its social
policy agenda, developing a concrete and prioritized Poverty Reduction Strategy and
improving poverty monitoring. The PA will be discussed with the government at the end of
FY04.
4.
The World Bank technical engagement with Belarus has generated a significant
amount of analysis in areas of relevance to the assessment of poverty and living conditions in
the country. A strong platform for technical collaboration on poverty issues was provided by
technical assistance under the IDF grant for Strengthening of the Capacity of the Ministry of
Social Protection in Policy Formulation and Analysis for preparation and introduction of
targeted social assistance program (TSAP). The Grant was implemented successfully during

- 42-

APPENDIX III

2000–03 and completed in June 2003. Since then, there has been no progress in the dialogue
on the TSAP agenda.
5.
Driven by demographic and socio-economic factors, Belarus faces a need for deep
reforms in the pension system. In the Fall of 2003, the World Bank team initiated a Pension
Policy Dialogue to analyze the current pension system and discuss pension reform options.
The major directions of this work, agreed with the government and to be carried out during
FY 2004, include: offering Belarus the menu of strategies that have been tried and proven
likely to work in other countries and particularly in neighboring ECA countries: assisting
with analytical and simulation work, as well as developing communication/education
strategies. To assist in the long-term projections for the main pension reform alternatives
under consideration, the World Bank will provide training in a pension reform model
(PROST).
6.
Health sector. Building on the dialogue initiated by the preparation of the
Tuberculosis and AIDS prevention project, the Bank has considered options for more general
reform in the health sector. A Health Policy Note was prepared in 2001 and revealed a
number of inefficiencies in the sector, which provided the basis for reform recommendations.
The TB/AIDS project was designed as the first lending operation under the new CAS to
assist Belarus in meeting the challenges posed by the spread of TB and HIV/AIDS. Although
more than three years have been spent on preparation and project fine-tuning, the
Government recently informed the Bank of its decision not to borrow for the stated purposes.
7.
Energy sector. The Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (US$22.6m) aims to
assist in the rehabilitation of the heating system, thermal insulation, and lighting in over 450
public buildings across the country. The project targets schools, hospitals, orphanages, and
community homes for the elderly and the disabled. It also includes measures to reduce
energy consumption.
8.
Environment. Belarus has made good progress in the protection of environment.
However, the country is still facing many environmental problems, including coping with the
legacy of the Chernobyl catastrophe. The Chernobyl theme occupies a central role in the
current CAS. The Chernobyl review identified the key problems caused by the Chernobyl
accident, analyzed the existing government mitigation programs and provided the
government and donor community with recommendations on improving these programs. The
report drew upon previous work by the Bank, such as the Environment Sector Review, which
examined in detail the environmental and agricultural consequences of Chernobyl, and
provided the basis for possible World Bank support.
9.
The PHRD Climate Change Pilot project (supported by the Japanese Climate Change
Initiatives Grant, approved in 2003) is aimed at demonstrating opportunities for greenhouse
gas (GHG) emission abatement through energy efficiency and renewable energy utilization
in the supply of heat and hot water to social sector buildings, and assisting the Belarusian
government with the development and implementation of emission standards for biomassfired boilers, thereby removing an institutional barrier to broader introduction of energy
supply based on biomass fuel.

APPENDIX III

10.
After a two-year dialogue and preliminary activities in cooperation with the UNEP
Chemicals and the World Bank, Belarus has recently ratified the Stockholm Convention on
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). As required by the Convention, Belarus needs to
develop a National Implementation Plan. The government and the Bank team are currently
drafting an Enabling Activity Proposal for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) POPs
Program.
11.
The Bank views Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a powerful
instrument for development, and has already provided resources and support for several
grants extended through the Information for Development Program (InfoDev). The recently
prepared ICT Infrastructure and E-Readiness Assessment (2003) evaluates the level of ICT
development in Belarus and its readiness to integrate with the network world.
Areas of shared responsibility
12.
Private sector development. The most challenging reform agenda for Belarus is in
the area of structural reforms and private business development. During the last two years a
reduction in cross-subsidization and progress in price liberalization has taken place.
However, no further serious advances in the area of structural reforms have been observed.
Small-scale privatization is yet to be completed and there is very little progress in large-scale
privatization. The share of the private sector in GDP is about 25 percent—the lowest among
all transition economies. Despite some improvements in business regulations (first of all,
streamlining of licensing procedure), the business environment remains unfavorable. The
Bank Group seeks to improve the general environment for the creation and operation of
private business in Belarus through technical assistance, policy dialogue and ESW. The Bank
and the IFC conducted a number of studies including Improving the Business Environment
and Costs of Doing Business Surveys to track the developments in this area, define
impediments to private business development and provide policy recommendations. The
Fund focuses on macroeconomic policies aimed at sustainable growth and encouraging
private sector development. The Fund also provides technical assistance to improve taxation,
banking regulations and banking supervision.
13.
Public expenditure management. The current CAS attaches great importance to
fiscal issues, emphasizing the goals of greater effectiveness, transparency, and accountability
in the use of public resources. In 2003 the World Bank with the IMF participation completed
the first Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) for Belarus. It is mainly focused
on broad systemic questions rather than sectoral issues and provides a number of
recommendations to strengthen fiscal sustainability, improve the budget process, and
increase the allocative efficiency of budgetary spending. The report includes a detailed
Action Plan for strengthening the Belarusian budget system. The Review draws upon the
IMF reports (Future Development of Treasury and Public Expenditure Management:
Strengthening the Legal Framework and Budget Preparation) as well as on preliminary work
for a Country Financial Accountability Assessment.

- 44-

APPENDIX III

14.
An IDF Grant for Public Expenditure Management (US$250,000) was approved in
early 2003 to support the development of institutional capacity of the Government of Belarus
—in particular, the Ministry of Finance—in the area of budget management. The government
has failed to make this Grant effective. The Bank with the participation of the Fund staff
organized a seminar on Public Expenditure Management in Belarus in December 2003 to
discuss reform priorities in this area.
15.
The IMF has provided continuous Technical Assistance to Belarus in the area of
public expenditure management. The government (ministry of finance) has determined the
following priority areas: modernization of budget classification, Budget Code preparation,
MTEF, reform of inter-budgetary fiscal relations, and development of sectoral strategies.
Most of these areas were supposed to be covered by the IDF grant. In the absence of the
Grant the Bank will be in position to provide assistance on a very limited scale.
16.
Financial sector. Analysis of the financial sector is an area of joint responsibility.
The government and the National Bank of Belarus sent requests to the IMF and the Bank to
undertake an FSAP. The FSAP preparation has been agreed in principle, but has yet to be
scheduled. The Bank and the IMF also carry out joint responsibility for providing assistance
to Belarus in the prevention of anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism.
Areas in which the IMF leads
17.
The IMF is actively engaged with the Authorities in discussing the macroeconomic
program providing them with technical assistance and related support, including on economic
and financial statistics, tax policy, monetary operations and fiscal transparency. The IMF is
leading the dialogue on setting the objectives for monetary and exchange rate policies, public
debt management, overall budget envelope and tax policy. The IMF is also actively involved
in the talks with the government regarding the steps and timetable required for pegging to the
Russian ruble and entering a currency union with Russia.
18.
The IMF analysis in these areas serves as inputs into the Bank policy advice. The
Bank and the IMF teams have regular consultations and the Bank staff takes part in the IMF
Article IV consultation missions. This helps to ensure a consistency of the policy
recommendations by the two institutions.
The World Bank Group Strategy
19.
Belarus joined the World Bank in July 1992. Bank relations with Belarus have
generally paralleled those of the IMF. Under the 1999 CAS, liberalization of the exchange
rate was set as a trigger for moving to a low case lending (one project per year) scenario.
Thus, unification of the exchange rate in September 2000 allowed the Bank to proceed with
the preparation of a $22.6m Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project, approved on
June 5, 2001.
20.
The current CAS for 2002–04 was completed in February 2002. The CAS centers
around the following issues:

- 45-

APPENDIX III

•

Advisory activities on reform, particularly with regard to business environment and
social policies, and to nurture involvement of civil society;

•

Lending concentrated in three areas: (i) global public goods; (ii) mitigation of social
risks, including the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the lack of greater
social inclusiveness; and (iii) fostering private sector development through a better
business and investment environment.

21.
The CAS has two lending scenarios—a low case and a base case. Under the low case
scenario, lending would be concentrated essentially on global public goods (i.e., TB/HIV
prevention, environmental protection) and projects directly targeted to the poorest segments
of society, and is limited to $140m (excluding grants from the Global Environmental
Facility). Under the base case, lending would reach up to $270m for the three-year period.
Lending under the base case would only commence after the government has accumulated a
one-year track record in improving the business environment and fiscal transparency. Belarus
is currently in the low case.
22.
To date, loans to Belarus total $190.6m. (on a commitment basis), and $15m. has
been provided in the form of grants. The IBRD Belarus active portfolio has one ongoing
operation—Social Sector Energy Retrofitting Project totaling $22.6m.
23.
Non-lending activities include grants and analytical work. The most recent work
includes the Chernobyl Review (Belarus: Chernobyl Review, Report No.23883-BY,
July 15, 2002), a Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (Belarus: Strengthening Public
Resource Management, Report No.26041-BY, June 20, 2003) and a Poverty Assessment
Update (Belarus Poverty Assessment: Preparing for the Future, Report No.27431-BY, being
finalized). The preparation of Country Economic Memorandum is planned for FY 2004–05.
24.
One of the key objectives of the current Belarus CAS is to help the development of
civil society through information dissemination, dialogue with the government and
involvement of the civil society organizations (CSOs) in Bank supported activities. The Bank
maintains the on-going dialogue with CSOs on the CAS priorities. The Bank also implements
a number of civil society capacity building programs, such as the annual Small Grants
Program and Development Marketplace, aimed at empowering small communities
development, encouraging the inter-sector partnership, establishing basic mechanisms for
cooperation of CSOs with local authorities to be improved over time and used as best
practices.
25.
The IFC activities in Belarus. The IFC strategy for Belarus is to foster the private
sector development through technical assistance and lending operations. The IFC began its
work in Belarus with technical assistance to the government in devising and implementing an
auction based privatization model in the retail sector in 1993. The IFC facilitated the
privatization of more than 1,100 enterprises in 35 cities and regions of Belarus. To assist the
newly-privatized businesses at the initial stage of their operation, it launched a Post
Privatization Project in 1995, under which local business support centers were created.

- 46-

APPENDIX III

26.
Since 1997 Belarus has halted the process of privatization and restructuring of
industrial property. Private business in the country is represented mainly by small and
medium enterprises (SMEs). IFC technical assistance efforts are aimed at creating an
enabling environment for SME growth. To this end, in 2002 the IFC started a two-year
Business Associations Capacity Building project. The project focuses on improvenemt of
business associations mangement and strengthening their lobbying and advocacy capacity.
The IFC also interacts directly with government and local administrations to improve policies
and legislation affecting the SME sector and investment climate in general. The corporation
is a founder and active participant in the Foreign Investment Advisory Council, an advisory
body to the Council of Ministers of Belarus. As of January 2004, the IFC has implemented
five technical assistance projects totaling $9.4m. In the banking sector, the IFC provides
long-term funding to local banks to strengthen their balance sheet and to help them better
meet the needs of SME sector in Belarus. In June 2003 the IFC extended a five-year $14m
loan to Priorbank for on-lending to private enterprises.
27.
Given the recent problems in the CAS implementation and attaining agreed
objectives, the Bank has communicated to the Belarus Authorities that it will prepare the
Strategy Completion Report by the end of the FY04 and will attempt to identify possible
areas for cooperation in the nearest future.
Questions may be referred to Deborah Wetzel (202 473 1698) or Sergiy Kulyk (202 458

APPENDIX IV

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
1.
Belarus joined the EBRD in June 1992. The first country strategy papers, those of
October 1992 and 1994, focused on identifying the main sectors in which the Bank could
operate in Belarus. These included energy, the financial sector (especially support for
SME’s) as well as supporting privatization and restructuring in the private sector. By the time
of the third country strategy in March 1995, the Board had approved six loans, mainly for
public sector projects. However, the Bank drew attention to the slow pace of reforms that
was affecting the volume of its activities.
2.
An interim strategy was prepared in June 1996. This noted the satisfactory progress
with the projects signed to date, but reiterated the concerns over the slow pace of reform and
the resulting difficulties for the Bank in financing additional projects. In this strategy the
Bank introduced two scenarios, the distinction between the base and high case reflected the
speed with which the government adopted market-oriented reforms.
3.
In the October 1997 strategy paper, the Board of the EBRD reflected the international
community’s concerns over political developments in Belarus. Three scenarios were
identified for the future scale of EBRD activities—a base case, which reflected the
continuation of current conditions, and an intermediate and high case which reflected
progress towards implementing market oriented policies and resolving the political issues.
The Board decided that no sovereign projects would be approved under the base case.
Attention would, therefore, be focused on the promotion of the private sector (mainly the
financial sector, SMEs, Turn Around Management—TAM and the provision of direct
financing to commercial banks to enable them to on-lend to the private sector).
4.
This approach was largely endorsed in the following strategy paper, approved by the
Board in December 1999. The Bank, however, also proposed to provide direct financing to
commercial entities under the Direct Investment Facility (DIF) and considered the case for
lending to micro-enterprises. The next strategy, approved in April 2001, drew attention to the
Board’s concerns over Belarus’ inadequate compliance with Article 1 of the Agreement
establishing the EBRD. The EBRD reverted to two scenarios on this occasion, with the
emphasis on a continuation of SME and micro lending, the TAM program, as well as an
expansion of the Trade Facilitation Program (TFP) under the base case.
5.
The current strategy for Belarus was approved by the Board in April 2002 and
stressed the concerns over the political situation and the slow pace of economic reform.
Three alternative scenarios were outlined for the Bank’s operations, referred to as the
baseline, intermediate and regular scenario. This approach made the extent and nature of the
EBRD’s operations mainly dependent on the willingness of the Belarus authorities to deliver
improvements in both the political and economic spheres. A number of specific benchmarks
were included in the strategy paper to enable the extent of such progress to be measured.

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

6.
Since this Strategy was approved, the Bank has continued to operate under the
baseline scenario. Thus, the Bank has focused on developing business initiatives in the
private sector, especially support for SMEs as well as micro lending, making selective direct
investments in local and foreign-owned private companies including through the DIF. There
has also been assistance through the TFP as well as the TAM. In addition the Bank has
continued its policy dialogue with both the government and the National Bank of Belarus
over various aspects of the reform program. It has also participated in the recently formed
Foreign Investor Advisory Council (FIAC).
7.
By the end of 2003, the EBRD had signed nine projects in Belarus (although one
project has been fully repaid). The total project value was Euro 232.4 million. These projects
amount to a historical net business volume for the EBRD of Euro 157.8 million. Of this
amount Euro 57.5 million represented the Portfolio (operating assets plus undrawn
commitments), of which 39 percent were assigned to the private sector and 61 percent to the
state sector. Operating assets amounted to Euro 45.5 million at end-2003.
8.
The EBRD has signed five public sector projects in the transport, agribusiness, power
generation and telecommunications sectors (the last of these was fully repaid in 2002). In
addition in November 1994 the EBRD signed a loan for a credit line of Euro 25.8 million for
participating commercial banks (currently two) to provide medium to long-term hard
currency loans to SMEs in the private sector. In June 2000, a micro lending component was
added to the line of credit. By the end of 2003 more than 70 SMEs and almost 1000 micro
enterprises had benefited from the line of credit. The credit line has been supported by
technical assistance provided by a limited number of donors. Of the four non-sovereign
projects, the main emphasis has been on support for the banking sector. In 1998, the EBRD
made an equity investment in the largest private bank in Belarus—Priorbank. A major
western commercial bank subsequently purchased a majority stake in Priorbank (in 2002).
Last year the EBRD arranged an international syndicated loan for Priorbank—the first such
transaction for a Belarus borrower.
9.

The EBRD will prepare a new country strategy for Belarus during 2004.

- 49 -

APPENDIX V

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 1, 2004)
1.
While some weaknesses remain in the statistical system of Belarus, the authorities—
with the help of technical assistance from the Fund—have made significant efforts and
improvements over the past years in a number of key areas, as described below. The ministry
of statistics publishes a large amount of data and has a predetermined publication schedule.
The provision of data over the last year has generally been adequate for the analysis of
economic developments on a regular basis (Table 1). Data are usually provided through the
Resident Representative’s office, in a timely fashion.
2.
The country’s IFS page has been published since November 1996 and is updated on a
monthly basis. A statistics law was signed by the president in February 1997. A multisector
statistical advisor sponsored by the Fund was in place from August 1996 to August 2000.
3.
The authorities are considering subscribing to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), and the ministry of statistics has set up a working group to support the
process. A national coordinator is expected to be appointed in the near future.
National Accounts
4.
The Ministry of Statistics and Analysis, with technical assistance from the
OECD and the IMF, switched to the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA),
and discontinued the calculation of net material product. A first set of quarterly
national accounts was published in January 1996 and is continuously updated on a timely
basis. Quarterly national accounts data are published in the IFS. A full set of annual national
accounts has been prepared for 1990–2002.
5.
GDP figures are likely to be distorted by the underreporting of the newly emerging
sectors, in particular services, and an active informal sector. A systematic upward bias in
measuring industrial output has also led to significant inaccuracy in GDP estimates. In
addition, problems remain in calculating holding gains from inventories. Problems continue
to exist in measuring the capital stock and consumption of fixed capital. Estimates of GDP by
expenditure categories are still uncertain. The authorities prepare an alternative series on
industrial output that corrects some of the above problems, but this data, and the requisite
revisions to GDP, are not published.
Prices
6.
Data on Consumer Price Indices (CPI, both weekly and monthly) and the Producer
Price Index (PPI) are being reported to the Fund on a timely basis. Both indices were
developed with substantial technical assistance from the Fund. As regards the PPI, in
January 1995 a Laspeyres formula recommended by the Fund was adopted. Other
recommendations, such as inclusion of exports, adequate specification of items, and better
selection of representative products and prices, have either been adopted or are in the process
of being adopted. Since January 2001, the PPI has been compiled using 1999 weights; and
beginning with 2003 data, with 2001 production weights.

- 50 -

APPENDIX V

Government Finance Statistics
7.
Government finance data on revenue and expenditure in the functional classification
are provided for the consolidated state budget (republican and local governments) on a
monthly basis, about 3 to 4 weeks following the end of the reference period. The economic
classification of monthly expenditure has been available since the first quarter of 2001 for the
republican budget, but only quarterly for the consolidated state budget. Social Protection
Fund statistics are reported only on a quarterly basis and with a delay of about six weeks. A
new plan of budget accounts, which conforms to the GFS manual methodology, has been
implemented from January 1998; a number of extra budgetary accounts have been
incorporated into the budget since the start of 1998. Central and local government annual
data for 1992–2000 were published in the 2001 GFS Yearbook. Monthly data, covering the
budget sector, excluding social security, are published in IFS.
8.
The ministry of finance compiles detailed monthly data on tax and expenditure
arrears by government level (central and local). The further implementation of the treasury
project holds out the promise of significant improvements in preparing regular and timely
reports on spending commitments and deliveries.
9.
Detailed information on domestic bank financing of general government institutions
is compiled by the NBB in coordination with the MoF. Data covering foreign financing of
general government institutions as well as government domestic and foreign debt and debt
guarantees, have improved significantly in the past year. This has led to an improvement in
reconciling spending and revenue records with financing data, although some discrepancies
still remain. The system to record contingent liabilities should be improved.
Monetary Statistics
10.
With help from STA, the NBB has made significant progress in improving the quality
of monetary statistics. The balance sheet of the NBB and the monetary survey are usually
provided with a lag of no more than two weeks, with the NBB monthly balance sheet
available on about fifth of the month following the reference period, but monetary data for
publication in IFS are reported with a lag of about 2 months.
11.
There continue to be some difficulties in reconciling budget financing data from the
ministry of finance with data on net credit to government derived from the banking system
because of the existence of extra budgetary funds not accounted for in general government
operations. In case of discrepancies, the Fund staff relies on banking data.
12.
Interest rate data on bank deposits and credits, as well as data on NBB credit auctions
and the placement of NBB and government securities, are provided with a one-month lag.
Exchange rate data is readily available on the NBB’s web site, and periodically reported to
the Fund in electronic file.

- 51 -

APPENDIX V

Balance of Payments Statistics
13.
The overall quality and timeliness of data is satisfactory. The NBB publishes
quarterly balance of payments and international investment position statements in the BPM5
format on a regular basis. The MSA publishes monthly foreign trade data, with a lag of about
six weeks. Gross and net official reserves are now available on a bi-weekly basis, generally
with little or no lag. The net foreign assets position of the commercial banks is compiled
monthly, with minimum delay. Scheduled interest and amortization payments on public
sector debt are tracked by the ministry of finance, and timely information is available on
arrears on government and government-guaranteed debt.
14.
The August/September 2003 technical assistance mission noted that most of the
November 2000 mission report recommendations had been implemented. Among others, the
International Transactions Reporting System has been broadened to permit a more accurate
classification of external transactions, while coverage and reporting forms for enterprise
surveys were also improved.
15.
Since August 1998, Belarus has been reporting its annual and quarterly balance of
payments to STA for publication. Quarterly international investment position statements are
now also reported to STA for publication.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 7, 2004
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Although growth was reportedly robust in early 2004, so was inflation. On
official data, real GDP grew by 9.3 percent in Q1 (year-on-year, yoy), driven by industrial
production (itself up by 13 percent). Inventories fell slightly, but the share of loss-making
enterprises remained high at 46 percent. Inflation stayed at 22 percent (yoy). Preliminary data
suggest that strong growth in external trade turnover continued; goods and services exports in
January–February grew by 23 percent over the same period of 2003, while imports grew by
15 percent. International reserves crept up slightly. (The authorities intend to bring gross
reserves to about $1 billion—one month of imports—by year-end.)
3.
Fiscal policies for 2004 have been loosened somewhat. Although the fiscal stance
was quite tight during Q1 (the general government cash surplus is estimated at over 3 percent
of quarterly GDP), the 2004 budget has been amended twice since initial passage in
December. The deficit target for the year has been increased by 0.3 percentage points of
GDP, mainly to accommodate spending on subsidized housing in rural areas, and is now just
under 2 percent.
4.
The exchange rate anchor has helped to restrain inflation, despite relatively
loose monetary policy. Reserve money grew by 71 percent (yoy) at end-March, and broad
money by 50.3 percent. To some extent, stronger money demand is due to the fact that the
exchange rate has been essentially fixed against the dollar since January 1, 2004. Although
the currency union with Russia seems increasingly unlikely to materialize in 2005, the
authorities still say they intend to peg to the Russian ruble on July 1, 2004 (albeit within a
±5 percent band).
5.
Progress with structural reforms continues to be mixed. In a positive
development, the Social Protection Fund has been brought into the budget and, from April 1,
2004, its accounts are being serviced by the treasury system. Also, the proposal to require
public enterprises to shift their bank accounts to state commercial banks (SCBs) seems to
have been shelved (though some smaller enterprises have moved their accounts to SCBs
voluntarily). On the other hand, a March presidential decree rescheduled all of the tax and
energy debt of the agricultural sector on very favorable terms, while under another decree
bankruptcy was prohibited for 183 strategically important enterprises.
6.
The authorities are implementing measures proposed by a recent STA data
ROSC mission, as they hope to subscribe to the SDDS fairly quickly. In particular, the
reserves template is now on the NBB website (http://www.nbrb.by/statistics/Sstandard/report.pdf),
though STA has not reviewed it. Similarly, long-term time series price indices are now
posted by the Ministry of Statistics (http://www.president.gov.by/Minstat/en/specst/price3.htm).

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Republic of Belarus
Mikhail V. Nikitsenka, Advisor to Executive Director
May 7, 2004
Economic Developments
Disciplined fiscal management and tighter monetary policies have enabled Belarus to
continue the steady growth of recent years.
The staff paper points out that Belarus’ “growth has been robust, however measured.”
Real GDP grew by 6.8 percent in 2003. This is a good performance, even if it turns out that
the staff is correct in thinking that the official figures probably overstate growth by at least
1 percentage point. It is also important that this GDP growth was mostly export-driven.
Belarus leads the CIS region in economic openness. It is one of the ten most open
economies in Europe. Average year-to-year export growth for the last four years was
15.5 percent. Total exports grew by 24.2 percent in 2003, to $10.0 billion or about
60 percent of GDP. The share of exports going to non-CIS destinations has grown to
45 percent, showing an enhanced competitiveness on international markets. These trends
have continued in 2004 despite a further worsening of the terms of trade caused by higher gas
prices.
Although the 2003 current account balance showed a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP, it
was still the lowest among non-energy producing CIS countries and central European
countries. The balance turned positive in January-February 2004. Other important external
accounts, such as official reserves, net foreign assets of the National Bank, foreign debt, and
external arrears, also registered quite positive outcomes.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
A major factor in Belarus’ growing competitiveness in external markets was its
declining inflation. Despite another increase in utility prices, the inflation rate continued to
fall. The 2004 target is 14-18 percent. Inflation in the first quarter of 2004 was half of that
in the same period last year.
Exchange rate stability under the crawling peg also helped to improve the external
accounts.
The combination of lower inflation, a relatively stable exchange rate, and robust real
GDP growth was responsible for the significant improvement of broad money demand. The
level of monetization of the economy increased further in 2003, while domestic broad
money, total broad money, and credit to the economy increased substantially. On the other
hand, the share of barter transactions declined from 43.8 percent in 2001 to 26.9 percent in
2003.

-2The assets of the banking system grew in 2003 by 53.8 percent and have continued to
grow in 2004. Household deposits in local currency increased by 81.2 percent last year and
by 23.8 percent in the first quarter of 2004. This is substantially higher than the growth of
deposits in hard currencies, which grew by 40.8 percent and 3.5 percent during the same
periods. Positive real interest rates boosted confidence in the rubel, as did the accumulation
of foreign currencies and gold by the National Bank. These reserves stood at $594.8 million
at end of last year.
The data in Box 1 of the staff report clearly show that practically all measures of
financial soundness in the banking sector--capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability,
liquidity, and foreign exchange risk--have improved substantially over the last four years.
The share of non-performing loans in the total loans of the banking system fell from 14.4
percent at the end of 2001 to 8.3 percent at the end of 2002, and has fallen further to less than
4 percent in 2003.
The authorities know that the banking system needs a lot of improvement. They are
confident that the FSAP later this year will significantly contribute to a new financial sector
reform program. The authorities also accept and began to implement the recommendations
of the Fund's safeguards assessment conducted in December 2003, when Belarus became the
first country to volunteer for it.
Fiscal Policies
Last year's deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP and the substantial surplus achieved in the
first quarter of 2004 show that Belarus maintains fiscal discipline. Since 1995 the
consolidated budget deficit has never exceeded 2 percent.
In 2004 revenue collection is buoyant, which allowed the reduction of debt levels to
the National Bank and commercial banks. For the 2004 budget, the government has followed
staff's advice to substantially reduce subsidies for agricultural, housing and communal
services. This year the total tax level is already 1.6 percent of GDP below the level of last
year. The sales tax has been eliminated. Following Russia’s example, VAT rates have been
reduced from 20 to 18 percent. The government no longer has access to central bank credit.
Public debt is about 6.2 percent of GDP, low by any standard.
In considering Belarus’ budget performance we should always bear in mind the costs
related to the Chernobyl disaster which is expected to exceed over time ten times Belarus'
annual GDP.
Structural Policies
In 2003 the authorities continued strong efforts to reduce and eliminate cross
subsidization. Utility cost recovery ratios increased further from 40 percent to 50 percent.
These efforts improved enterprise profitability, from 7.8 percent of produced value in 2001 to
9.1 percent in 2003. Also from 2002 to 2003 the share of loss making enterprises fell from

-334.9 percent to 27.2 percent, and inter-enterprise arrears shrank from 17.7 to 13.7 percent.
The cuts in cross subsidization required a further salary increase to cushion the social
consequences of the sharp increase in utility prices.
The efforts to harmonize the conditions in Belarus with those in Russia have further
improved institutions’ and business’ conditions, including the licensing and taxation of small
businesses.
The chart on page 16 of the staff report shows that in the period 2000-2002 Belarus
received more FDI per capita than Ukraine and not substantially less than Russia. However,
FDI in Belarus is much lower than in the EU accession countries.
Relations between Belarus and the Fund.
Given the last four years of successfully implementing the Fund's recommendations,
the authorities do not favor a new Staff Monitored Program, but consider their track-record
as sufficient for starting negotiations for a Stand-By Arrangement.
The authorities would have preferred an agreement with the Fund on a program of
continued reforms. However, because of the improvements in the economy, as explained in
this statement, they no longer request a financial arrangement.
As has happened before, they disagree with the staff on two issues: the pace of reform
and the projections for future periods. As for the pace of reform, the authorities prefer a
strategy of gradual transformation with a minimum of social damage. They insist that a
country has the right to choose the pace of its economic reforms, and have shown why
gradualism is the best way for Belarus to achieve economic stability and maintaining high
social standards. Belarus’ per capita GDP has grown to $1,765 and the government actively
pursues such social goods as poverty reduction, education, and health care, which rank
among the best in CIS region.
As for the projections, the staff usually makes a pessimistic assessment about the
possible rate of GDP growth. Last year again, Belarus’ actual GDP growth was much
stronger than forecast, even though the staff corrected its forecast upward in the middle of the
year. This year, first quarter data show GDP growth of 9.3 percent and export growth of 21.1
percent, confirming that Belarus’ actual performance is at least twice as good as the staff
expected. In several years, Belarus’ GDP performance has exceeded the staff's projection by
a factor of three.
The staff argues that the authorities' real GDP targets are much higher than those of
its major trading partners. But experience confirms that the performance of Belarus’ trading
partners does not always provide a good benchmark for projecting Belarus’ performance.
The staff's projections are also influenced by Belarus’ very limited external financing,
which cannot support higher growth. The authorities disagree with the staff's passive
approach to identifying the sources of growth. The staff overlooks the increasingly important

-4positive export performance, as well as Belarus’ ability to concentrate its internal resources
on the task of renovating its industrial potential. The authorities wish the staff would use a
broader approach when projecting Belarus’ growth trends, which would make their forecasts
more reliable.
Although the authorities do not entirely agree with staff's overall view of the
macroeconomic situation in Belarus, they are very grateful for the technical assistance
provided as a result of last year's consultation. They have made good use of the Fund's
technical assistance and look forward to its continuation.
Finally, we wish to touch on the role of the Fund's resident representative in
maintaining dialog between Belarus and the IMF. Belarus had no program with Fund for
almost ten years. The location of the nearest Fund representation in Vilnius during most of
that period made the relations with the Fund less than optimal. Now that Lithuania has
joined the EU there may be a good occasion to move the resident representative’s office to
Minsk. This could help improve the dialog between the Fund and Belarus. The benefits of
moving the resident representative to Belarus will definitely outweigh the cost. Our
Belarusian authorities are firmly committed to continue policies aimed at further tightening
monetary and fiscal discipline, expanding privatization, and liberalizing the economy, in
order to improve the business climate and accelerate economic growth. They hope the
Executive Board will make an accurate assessment of macroeconomic developments in
Belarus, and encourage the Management to base the Fund's relationship with Belarus on
comprehensive assistance aimed at helping the country further strengthen its economic
stabilization and reform.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Belarus
On May 7, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Belarus.1
Background
Macroeconomic developments in 2003 were mixed. Although in real terms GDP, industrial
production and agriculture all grew by 6.8 percent—according to official data prepared on
Belarusian national methodology—growth would be lower on international methodology.
Despite high recorded economic growth figures, the financial situation of the industrial sector
continues to be difficult, as indicated by high inventory levels and the fact that one third of
industry (and 60 percent of agriculture) reported losses in 2003.
Although gradual disinflation continued in 2003, Belarus continues to have the highest inflation
in the region. Moreover, core inflation, which excludes the impact of administrative price
changes, began to grow more rapidly during the second half, suggesting that the reduction in
inflation to 25 percent (December to December) was partly due to administrative measures,
such as delayed increases in utilities prices and a narrowing of retail trade mark-ups. Within the
authorities’ crawling band exchange rate regime, the Belarusian ruble appreciated in real terms
against the dollar, but depreciated in real terms against the Russian ruble as well as in real
effective terms. Nevertheless, the trade balance has remained weak, in part as a result of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2higher energy prices (especially for natural gas). International reserves remain very low at about
a half-month of imports.
Fiscal policy was fairly tight during 2003, due mainly to limited sources of available financing,
such as privatization proceeds. The general government cash deficit is estimated at 1¼ percent
of GDP, and budgetary arrears of 0.3 percent were repaid. However, quasi-fiscal activities
remained significant, including widespread directed lending through the banking system, energy
sector cross-subsidization and ad hoc tax preferences.
However, monetary policy was lax, as rubel broad money and rubel reserve money both grew
by more than 70 percent. In particular, inflationary financing from the National Bank of Belarus
(NBB) to the government—which will be eliminated in 2004—was expanded very substantially
during the last days of the year. Further, a substantial portion of banking system credit was
issued under the influence of government or presidential decisions, raising questions about the
health of the banking system and the reliability of financial sector vulnerability indicators.
Structural reforms seem to have stalled. Increases in energy sector cost recovery levels and a
reduction of the number of activities requiring licenses are welcome. However, privatization has
slowed, and the private sector share of GDP remains at around 20 percent. Further, the “golden
share” rule—which is unique in Belarus, in that it may be declared after a firm has been
privatized—not only remains in place, but has been expanded. The poor business environment,
including the golden share, reduces the flow of foreign investment to Belarus and discourages
private sector investment.
The outlook for 2004 is uncertain. Under current policies, inflation is expected at around
22 percent, and real GDP growth is likely to slow to about 4¾ percent. However, the external
environment—particularly growth in the Baltics and CIS states—is favorable, while on the other
hand the era of subsidized deliveries of natural gas from Russia seems to be coming to an end.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the achievements of the past year, including strong growth, gradual
disinflation, and progress in several areas of structural reform. Nevertheless, they observed that
Belarus faces a number of medium term economic challenges, including reducing the size of
the government and making further progress toward a market-based economy, private-sectorled economic growth, and macroeconomic stability. Directors stressed that meeting these
challenges will require a strengthening of macroeconomic policies and a quickening of the pace
of structural reform. Noting that neighboring countries are growing rapidly, external debt is low,
and remonetization in Belarus is proceeding well, Directors considered that adjustment costs
should be manageable for Belarus at this juncture.
Accordingly, Directors urged the authorities to tighten monetary and fiscal policies in 2004 to
further reduce inflation and establish conditions for sustained high growth. Directors considered
that a tighter fiscal stance is also warranted by the limited availability of noninflationary financing
and the need to bring the size of government to a more manageable level and more in line with

-3that in neighboring countries. They welcomed efforts to reduce the tax burden in 2004, and
encouraged further efforts in this direction, but urged that expenditure be cut also to reduce the
budget deficit. In this regard, they considered that the planned dollar wage increase in 2004 is
likely to adversely affect external competitiveness and public enterprise finances. Directors
commended Belarus for achieving relatively good poverty indicators. However, they felt that
general government spending, which amounts to nearly half of GDP, could be significantly
lowered without undermining the authorities’ social objectives.
Directors welcomed the elimination in 2004 of direct financing of the budget deficit by the NBB.
At the same time, they advised the authorities to discontinue the practice of directed lending
through the banking system to finance quasi-fiscal deficits. They stressed that priority should be
given to strengthening the banking system, including through loan-loss provisioning in view of
sizeable non-performing loans, better loan classification, and tightened prudential regulations. In
this context, they welcomed the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program. They noted
that weaknesses in the public enterprise sector are a source of vulnerability in the banking
sector, and urged implementation of a comprehensive program of corporate and financial sector
reform. This should include privatization or closure of state-owned banks and a strengthening of
efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, including through legislation
consistent with international standards and the establishment of a well-functioning financial
intelligence unit.
Directors recommend that, if the authorities decide to peg the exchange rate, appropriate fiscal
policies and structural reforms should be in place. They considered that, with foreign reserves
equivalent to only two weeks of imports, a fixed exchange rate would make Belarus vulnerable
to external shocks. Needed reforms would include strengthening the legal structure,
independence, and auditing and financial reporting of the NBB, as recommended in the
safeguards assessment that was undertaken at the request of the authorities. A number of
Directors also cautioned against a currency union with Russia before closer macroeconomic
convergence is achieved and a firmer commitment is made to move towards market-based
policies. Some other Directors emphasized that a currency union would be consistent with
Belarus’ high degree of economic integration with Russia and could lead to stronger economic
policies.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate structural reform—including elimination or
modification of the “golden share” rule, which they considered a significant impediment to
investment in Belarus. They urged the authorities to make progress with privatization and
improve the business environment, particularly by reducing unnecessary inspections and
regulation of small and medium-sized enterprises. Directors advised against repeatedly
forgiving the debts of the agricultural sector, in order to create incentives for an improvement in
the performance of that sector. Directors called for an improvement of fiscal transparency,
including by reducing the quasi-fiscal activities of the government, following the
recommendations of the fiscal Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).
They also considered trade liberalization to be a priority, given that a number of non-tariff
barriers are still in effect.

-4Directors supported active technical cooperation between the IMF and Belarus, recognizing that
Belarus has a generally good record of implementation of technical assistance. They welcomed
plans to subscribe to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard, and the authorities’
intention to implement the recommendations of the data ROSC. These and other efforts will
help improve the quality of Belarusian official statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2004
Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Belarus is also available.
