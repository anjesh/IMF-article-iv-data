EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Lao P.D.R.’s economic performance continues to be strong, but progress on structural
reform has been mixed. Growth is robust and increasingly reliant on large export oriented
mining and hydropower projects. Inflation has declined to historical lows, reserves have risen
rapidly, and poverty has declined. Progress on reforms has been hampered by slow
implementation of key reforms. The outlook is promising, but the outcome depends on the
government’s policy response to the emerging resource bonanza.
Policy Challenges and Discussions
Challenge: Sustaining macroeconomic stability
•
Fiscal policy. The authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation and debt
sustainability over the medium term. However, the draft 2007/08 budget, approved almost
two months after the mission ended, departs from the prudent stance of the last two years.
Staff believes there is room for correction and is urging the authorities to act. Looking ahead,
the announced medium-term policies (introduction of a VAT, and reform of the revenue and
expenditure management and intergovernmental relations) should help achieve fiscal
consolidation. Expenditure decisions need to be taken within a yet-to-be developed integrated
fiscal framework that accounts for resource revenue volatility.
•
Monetary policy. Pressures on monetary expansion from rising reserves are likely to
continue, posing a risk to inflation. The authorities intend to keep money growth under
control, counting on a further reduction in the domestic financing of the deficit. In addition,
staff advised the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) not to relax prudential requirements to expand
credit to the private sector, and to introduce a standing deposit facility (remunerated banks’
deposits) to mop up liquidity, until other market-based instruments and the interbank market
are developed.
•
Exchange rate policy. The managed float regime has worked well and the nominal
exchange rate level is in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The authorities will allow
market conditions to prevail despite concerns about volatility. They plan to develop the
interbank foreign exchange market.
Challenge: Managing resource revenues in support of growth and poverty reduction.
There is an urgent need for expert advice to help develop a sound and transparent regime as
an integral part of a medium-term fiscal framework.
Challenge: Broadening the Sources of Growth. There is a need for a renewed impetus on
economic reform, especially to accelerate the restructuring of the state-owned banks and
enterprises, and improving the investment climate. This together with sustained efforts to
achieve greater trade integration should help raise and sustain broad-based growth.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In recent years, Lao P.D.R. has recorded a strong economic performance, but
progress on structural reform has been mixed. Growth has been robust, inflation has
declined markedly, international reserves have risen, and poverty has declined.1 Of notice is
the increasing role of the export-oriented large mining and hydropower projects (the resource
sector), which have helped to strengthen public finances and the balance of payments. So far,
the resource sector has not had visible adverse macroeconomic effects, mainly because
resource-related foreign exchange inflows have been substantially offset by imports for large
resource projects and net imports from the non-resource sector. However, some pressures are
building up, particularly on monetary growth and exchange rate appreciation, as the resource
sector’s net inflows outpaced the net imports of the non-resource sector. It follows that the
full economic impact of the newly emerging resource sector is yet to be seen, and it could
become either a blessing or a curse depending on the government’s policy response and
reform effort.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.

Macroeconomic performance remains strong.

•

Real GDP growth (7½ percent in 2006) continued to be robust, driven by the resource
sector. Non-resource sector growth remains moderate (4½–5 percent), but there are
signs of an incipient slowdown, including a slower growth of non-resource imports
and a decline in credit to the private sector.

•

Headline and core inflation declined to historical lows (3½ and 2 percent y-o-y in
June 2007), reflecting favorable oil and food prices, and the appreciation of the kip.

•

The current account deficit narrowed markedly in 2006. Strong resource exports and
tourism receipts partially offset high imports led by petroleum products and
construction materials. This, combined with high foreign direct investment (FDI) and
official development assistance (ODA) inflows, resulted in a substantial surplus.
These trends continued, and by end-June 2007 gross international reserves reached
$460 million (4.6 months of non-resource imports and 62 percent of foreign currency
liabilities, including deposits), reflecting partly sizable mining-related tax payments.

3.

Fiscal performance strengthened, contributing to lower demand pressures.

Poverty indicators are presented in Appendix II.

In 2005/06, 2 the overall cash deficit declined to 3¾ percent of GDP (4½ percent in

In the first eight months of 2006/07, revenues continued to perform strongly, led by
resources revenues. Domestic expenditures were in line with the yearly target.
Altogether, there was an overall cash surplus and a low non-resource deficit. Net
domestic financing continued to decline (equivalent to almost 90 percent of resource
revenues). However, external financing and grants were significantly below the
annual target.

•

Banking system. A new commercial banking law became effective in April 2007, but
implementing regulations are still under preparation with assistance from the
International Finance Corporation. Meanwhile, a domestic private bank and a stateowned commercial bank (SOCB) for policy lending to the agricultural sector started
operations, and a reputable international bank has taken a majority stake in a small
private bank. Relevant indicators to assess the soundness of the banking system were
not available.

•

State-owned commercial banks. Management changes and prudent lending
practices have lowered non-performing loans (NPLs) on new lending and reportedly
improved profitability. However, the two major SOCBs still carry high NPLs (about
60 percent of loans) and the plan for their recapitalization has not proceeded as
smoothly as anticipated.3 The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) is providing
technical assistance.

•

State-owned Enterprises (SOEs). The 12 largest SOEs undergoing restructuring are
together generating profits. However, some of them still make losses, and several
remain heavily indebted. They no longer receive direct subsidies, but there was a
sizable onlending operation for the national airline company in 2006.

•

Management of public finances. The 2006 state budget law envisages the
centralization of tax, customs, and treasury administration and the reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations. Some changes in revenue assignments are expected to

Half of the SOCBs’ capital deficiency (estimated at 4 percent of GDP at end-2005) was to be covered by
government recapitalization bonds and the rest by SOCBs’ profits or strategic investors. So far, only a third of
the bonds has been issued (a second tranche has been authorized, but not issued yet). There is no active search
for strategic partners.

be implemented in 2007/08,4 but preparatory work on other components of the law,
such as a new expenditure allocation norm, are still under discussion. The World
Bank, AsDB, and Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) are providing technical guidance.
A detailed implementation plan for the introduction of the VAT in late 2008/09 is
being crafted. FAD and other donors have provided extensive comments on draft
regulations and implementation procedures. Several measures to strengthen public
expenditure management have also been taken, including a new chart of accounts,
developed with the assistance of the World Bank, which is expected to be fully in
place by 2008/09.

Several steps to facilitate trade and improve the investment climate have been
taken, but the perception remains that the cost of doing business is high.

III. OUTLOOK
8.
The economic outlook is promising, but the outcome clearly depends on the
government’s policy response to the emerging resource bonanza.

4

Taxes accruing fully to the central government will now include import duties, turnover and excise taxes on
imported goods, and mining taxes. Taxes accruing fully to local authorities will be limited to land and personal
income tax. The turnover and excise taxes on domestic goods and the corporate income tax will be shared
according to criteria yet to be decided.

8
•

The direct macroeconomic impact of the resource sector is likely to be significant.5
Staff estimates that the sector could: contribute 3 percentage points to annual GDP
growth in the next five years and 1 percentage point thereafter; generate an annual
average external surplus of 7 percent of GDP in the next five years; and, raise fiscal
resource revenues up to about 3 percentage points of GDP in 2008, starting to decline
gradually thereafter in line with proven mineral reserves depletion. Revenues from
electricity companies will remain subdued (around ½ percent of GDP) over the next
decade as their pre-tax profits remain low due to a heavy debt service burden.

•

The outlook for the whole economy, however, will be ultimately determined by the
supply response of the non-resource sector. Assuming the government adopts sound
policies and accelerates reforms to shelter the non-resource sector from an adverse
impact of the resource sector (a proactive policy response, see Box 2), staff projects
that over the medium-term real GDP annual growth could be sustained at about
6½ percent (increasingly driven by non-resource sector growth), inflation kept below
5 percent, and international reserves strengthened to about five months of nonresource imports. Waiting to take policy action until the “resource curse” has set in (a
reactive policy response) would eventually raise inflation, reduce investment
incentives generally, and weaken international reserves.

9.
There are several risks to the outlook. Upside risks include additional proven
mineral reserves and mine development, and construction of more hydropower plants.
Downside risks comprise adverse commodity price shocks, delays in construction of
hydropower plants, and relaxation of the stabilization policy stance and significant delays in
implementing economic and institutional reforms, particularly in the fiscal area.
10.
In addition, Debt Sustainability Analysis results continue to indicate a high risk
of debt distress, although debt service remains manageable (Appendix III). The debt
outlook is highly sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions which, in turn, will
depend in part on the policy response. A proactive policy response would bring all debt
indicators below the thresholds faster than a reactive policy response, increasing the
resilience to shocks. However, under a reactive scenario, a combined shock could even create
debt service problems. The debt outlook is also sensitive to the degree of concessionality of
newly contracted debt, suggesting that future external financing of the deficit should continue
to rely on grants and highly concessional borrowing.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Against this background, discussions focused on several policy challenges
confronting the authorities, including (i) sustaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) ensuring an
5

9
appropriate and transparent use of resource revenues; and (iii) accelerating banking and SOE
reform and broadening the sources of growth.
A. Sustaining Macroeconomic Stability
Fiscal policy
12.
The expected fiscal outcome for 2006/07 should continue to help reduce
demand pressures. Staff projects the overall deficit could fall to 1¼ percent of GDP (about
2 percentage points of GDP below this year’s target and the 2005/06 outcome), with the nonresource deficit at 3½ percent of GDP (1¼ percentage points lower than 2005/06). Continued
high revenues and tight control of domestic expenditures would help reduce net domestic
borrowing by about 1¼ percent of GDP (equivalent to about one-half of projected resource
revenues). Foreign financed capital expenditure is likely to fall short of target, mainly
reflecting optimistic expectations. The authorities agreed with the staff views, but found it
prudent not to revise its revenue projections yet. Staff urged the authorities to minimize the
outlays carried over into the next fiscal year and to monitor carefully unpaid obligations.
13.
Staff discussed the broad outline of the budget framework for 2007/08 and
encouraged the authorities to pursue further consolidation.
•

Staff projects revenues will continue strong, mainly driven by resource revenues.
Staff suggested that (i) current expenditures be programmed cautiously (especially
wages) aiming to reduce net domestic financing further to help confront a potential
revenue impact of commodity price volatility; and (ii) efforts be made to shore up
non-resource revenues ahead of the introduction of the VAT, including by avoiding
ad hoc exemptions and closely monitoring exemptions under the investment law;
reviewing outdated terms of leasing and concession contracts on state property;
expediting the process of centralizing administration; and bringing the large taxpayer
units in the provinces and the main regional customs offices under central
government control. With foreign financed capital expenditures declining further in
line with an expected reduction in foreign assistance, the overall deficit could be
reduced by about ¾ percent of GDP in 2007/08, with a more gradual reduction in the
non-resource deficit.

•

The authorities agreed that a stepped-up effort to strengthen tax and customs
administration would be required, and indicated they were enhancing their monitoring
of exemptions. They noted, however, that centralization is a politically sensitive issue
and can only be done gradually. Discussions made it clear that the authorities were
trying to find a balance between raising expenditure to attend to long overdue
demands (including public wages) and setting aside some of the resource revenues.
There is a contingency reserve fund created under the new budget law that could be
used for this purpose, but details on its operation were under discussion.

to decline by the
equivalent of about 15 percent of resource revenues. The approved budget, if fully
implemented, will exacerbate the country’s risk of debt distress. Pending access to more
detailed expenditure information, staff believes that lower but better targeted and prioritized
subsidies and transfers could make the budget outcome consistent with the authorities’
medium term fiscal objectives.
15.
In discussing the medium term fiscal strategy, the authorities reiterated their
commitment to fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability. Discussions covered the
following areas:
•

Non-resource revenue mobilization. The authorities are committed to centralize tax
and customs administration and start implementing a VAT in 2008/09. It is important
that the VAT be designed to be revenue-enhancing to help offset a possible, albeit
moderate, reduction in trade taxes under trade agreements. Staff also suggested to
eliminate the discretionary tax relief, align corporate tax rates with those of
neighboring countries, and simplify the personal, excise, and land tax structure. The
2007/08 budget includes a general commitment to review the tax system, but only
mentions specifically the review of land and property taxes and fees.

11
•

Reform on inter-governmental fiscal relations. Progress in this area has been
encouraging. On current plans, developed with World Bank and other donors’
assistance, all shared revenues will be pooled and put under central administration
management and distributed to provinces with a simple sharing rule. Expenditure
assignments have not been finalized yet, but the authorities have been advised to
ensure assignments are clear and to adopt a transfer system based on objective
criteria. Staff recommended to calculate the expenditure bonus given to provinces that
exceed revenue collection targets on the basis of non-resource revenues only, and
eventually to abolish it.

•

Strengthen a public expenditure management system. The authorities have made
significant progress towards the introduction of a new chart of accounts. However,
there is a need for setting a time-bound plan for the establishment of the national
treasury and the introduction of a single treasury account.

•

Developing an integrated medium-term fiscal framework. The authorities agree
that expenditure decisions need to be made in a multiyear context. Such a framework
should account not only for the volatile nature and uncertainties associated with
resource revenues, but should align expenditures to the priorities of the National
Socio-economic Development Plan (NSEDP). It is important that future budgets
include this type of framework.

Monetary and exchange rate policy
16.
Staff shares the authorities’ concern about the inflationary risk posed by the
ongoing rapid monetary expansion.
•

The authorities plan to reduce monetary expansion through a targeted reduction in
BoL’s NDA (led by a further reduction in the net domestic financing of the deficit)
and keeping tight limits on SOCBs’ credit expansion. Staff suggested that, in
addition, a standing deposit facility (remunerated banks’ deposits) be introduced to
help mop up liquidity. At the same time, they are facing demands to increase credit to
the private sector by lowering policy interest rates, raising SOCBs’ lending ceilings,
and relaxing prudential regulations. Those arguing in favor point to the need to
support private sector growth, the benign inflation, and the low NPLs of the SOCBs’
new lending. Staff recommended against such measures, because the SOCBs’ overall
financial condition is still very weak, and the banks’ low loans-to-deposits ratio
reflects mainly difficulties in realizing collaterals and complex bankruptcy
procedures.

•

Staff also supported the authorities’ interest in broadening their tools to manage
liquidity, and developing the interbank market to allow policy rates to play a more
fundamental role. To this end, staff suggested that the BoL should (i) enhance its

12
liquidity forecasting framework by incorporating explicitly detailed fiscal operations;
(ii) start developing market-based instruments for managing liquidity using treasury
bills; (iii) start discussions with the ministry of finance on a new financial
arrangement to share the net cost of monetary operations.
17.

The authorities believe the exchange rate should reflect market conditions.

•

The current managed float framework has appropriately helped smooth exchange rate
movements and strengthen the reserve position, and is also consistent with external
stability. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of the market outcome
for the preceding day and the current nominal exchange rate level is deemed to be in
line with economic fundamentals.

•

The authorities have not received complaints about loss of competitiveness owing to
the continued nominal appreciation. However, they expressed concerns about
potentially large exchange rate adjustments given their increasing exposure to
commodity price volatility.

•

The authorities agreed that upward pressures on the kip are likely to continue, but had
no intention to intervene. Most private foreign exchange transactions are channeled
through one of the major SOCBs, and the BoL sets reference rates based on the
market clearing rate of the previous day. The authorities are, however, committed to
develop a well functioning interbank foreign exchange market and will take steps to
build up the BoL’s intervention capacity for smoothing purposes.
B. Ensuring an Appropriate and Transparent Use of Resource Revenues

18.
The current fiscal regimes for the resource sector have several sound features,
but some improvements are needed to align them to best international practices.6
•

Staff stressed the importance of developing a transparent and standardized fiscal
regime across concessions. A predictable framework that ensures a level playing field
is key to attract investor interest. Most existing concessions have been negotiated on a
case-by-case basis without full disclosure of fiscal terms, complicating fiscal
administration and giving rise to governance concerns. The authorities broadly agreed
with staff, but noted they had limited technical capacity to change the system. While a
comprehensive framework is developed, staff suggested to adhere to the IMF’s
Guidelines on Resource Revenue Management and participate in the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative.

See accompanying Selected Issues Paper, Chapter II.

13
•

Staff also suggested that the authorities take a fresh look at the pros and cons of
taking equity stakes in resource projects. Direct participation could become costly
given the financial risks associated to resource sector activities, and give rise to a
conflict of interest between the government’s dual role as regulator and as
shareholder. Staff noted that taxation can be designed to generate equivalent and
more predictable revenues than dividends, and depending on the design, they could
even collect revenues before the activities start generating profits. The authorities
noted that the decisions to acquire equity stakes had been done mainly at the request
of their investment partners, and should not be read as the government’s general
policy. They agreed to continue the dialog and seek expert assistance.

•

Regarding the utilization of resource revenues, the authorities are considering ways to
set aside for future use some of the resource revenues. The use of a reserve fund
could be considered provided that (i) the size of the contributions and the conditions
for the withdrawals from a fund be decided within an integrated medium-term fiscal
framework; (ii) all expenditures are on-budget; and, (iii) there are clear operating
rules for the fund that ensure transparency, good governance, and proper
accountability.
C. Accelerating Banking and SOE Reform and Broadening the Sources of Growth

19.
A sound and competitive banking system is key to support long-term growth.
Full implementation of the new banking legislation should intensify competition by leveling
the playing field and facilitating new entry. It is therefore important that relevant
implementing regulations be in place, that the system be in good health, and the supervisory
and regulatory framework be effective and strictly enforced.
•

Bank soundness. There is a need to assess the soundness of the banking system.
Efforts to develop standard soundness indicators should be expedited, and preparatory
work for an eventual Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) initiated.
However, limited information available indicates that the restructuring of the
two major SOCBs.(that share about 55 percent of the market) needs to be accelerated.
These banks still carry sizable NPLs, have negative capital, and are heavily exposed
to foreign exchange risk. The authorities expect to conclude their restructuring by
2010. In their view SOCBs are making gradual but firm progress, as evidenced by
their very low NPLs and rising profitability of new lending operations.

•

Regulation and supervision. Prudential requirements are broadly in line with the
Basel I guidelines, but some regulations lack clear definitions and important
regulatory concepts. There is also a need to improve enforcement and avoid
forbearance, particularly for SOCBs. Most commercial banks are not complying with
foreign currency exposure limits. The anti-money laundering decree was approved in
March 2006, but full implementation is constrained by the lack of an operational

14
financial intelligence unit. BoL officials indicated that the system health was
generally satisfactory, except for a very small bank which was experiencing some
problems, and that they were currently working on strengthening the regulations.
20.
Further progress in SOE reform is essential to strengthen the banking sector.
Staff recognizes the importance of having turned around the combined financial outcome of
the largest SOEs under restructuring. The authorities and the staff agreed that closer attention
should be paid to those enterprises that still have a relatively weak financial situation or are
highly leveraged. While noting that reliance on subsidies has virtually stopped and requests
for sovereign guarantees have become less common, staff advised that any future budgetary
support be limited and conditional on a viable business plan.
21.
Promoting broad-based growth will require significant improvements in the
investment climate and expanded regional and global market opportunities.
•

Investment climate. The NSEDP clearly identifies the need for improving the legal
and regulatory framework to help promote private sector initiative and attract FDI.
The strategy, the approval of the enterprise law, and some of the steps taken (such as
accelerating investment approval and maintaining an active dialog with the private
sector) are in the right direction. However, it is clear that more needs to be done to
reduce the cost of doing business, enhance transparency, and combat corruption.

•

Trade integration. Staff encouraged the government to continue WTO accession
efforts. It will also be important to start acting on the trade reform areas identified in
the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, such as simplifying lengthy procedures for
starting business and acquiring business property, eliminating redundant trade
licensing, and streamlining the customs clearance process.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

22.
Lao P.D.R.’s recent economic performance and progress in reducing poverty
have been impressive, but the economic reform record is mixed. Favorable export
commodity prices and a rapidly growing resource sector have boosted growth and
strengthened the balance of payments. The resource bonanza has induced an appreciation of
the kip, which together with a prudent fiscal policy has helped contain demand pressures and
lower inflation to historical lows. There has been some progress in banking and SOE reform
and some steps taken to improve the investment climate. But there have also been significant
delays in implementing key strategies and laws which would have advanced economic
reform further.
23.
The economic outlook is promising, but it will require that the authorities take
measures to maintain stability and accelerate the reform effort before the “resource curse”
sets in. Such a proactive policy response would also help mitigate the various risks to the
outlook, including that of debt distress.

15
24.
Staff supports the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and debt
sustainability over the medium term. However, the 2007/08 budget, if fully implemented,
would be inconsistent with the government’s medium-term objectives. Staff believes there is
room to contain expenditures and would strongly encourage the authorities to identify
appropriate measures to return to the recent path of fiscal prudence. Looking ahead, a timely
introduction of the VAT and a review of the tax system, coupled with stepped-up efforts to
improve revenue administration, expenditure management, and intergovernmental fiscal
relations, should help pave the way for fiscal consolidation. Expenditure decisions need to be
taken within an integrated medium-term fiscal framework that makes explicit a deficit
reduction path and takes into account the volatility and uncertainties of projected resource
revenues. Given that Lao P.D.R. continues to face a risk of debt distress, it will be essential
that, in addition to firmly pursuing fiscal consolidation, future external financing should
continue to rely on grants and concessional loans.
25.
Expert advice is urgently required to develop a sound and transparent resource
management framework. To maximize resource rents, the authorities should weigh the
benefits of direct and effective resource taxation versus equity participation. It would also be
advisable to save some of the resource revenues until an integrated fiscal framework is
available.
26.
The ongoing rapid monetary expansion warrants a tight control of BoL NDA
and bank credit to the private sector. The BoL’s liquidity management tool kit needs to be
upgraded. An early introduction of a standing deposit facility could usefully precede the
introduction of open market operations using treasury bills. Steps should also be taken to
develop the interbank money market and mechanisms to avoid quasi-fiscal costs of managing
liquidity.
27.
The current exchange rate policy has served Lao P.D.R. well and the nominal
exchange rate is in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to let the kip reflect market conditions and share their concern about the
risk of large exchange rate fluctuations. Building the BoL’s capacity to smooth fluctuations,
developing a well-functioning foreign exchange market, and strengthening reserves further
should help manage such risks. However, this should not be taken as a substitute for pursuing
sound policies and deepening reform to reduce external vulnerabilities.
28.
There has been some progress in banking and SOE reform but a renewed
impetus is required. Besides ensuring full banking law implementation and strictly
enforcing a strengthened regulatory framework, the recapitalization of SOCBs needs to be
expedited, including by involving strategic investors. Deepening SOE restructuring will also
help strengthen the banking sector. Extension of public guarantees on SOEs’ borrowing
should be conditional on demonstrable and viable business plans.

16
29.
Enhancing trade integration and improving the investment climate will help
raise and sustain broad-based growth. In particular, the preparations to join WTO should
be sustained. However, reaping the full benefits of trade integration will require more efforts
to reduce the high cost of doing business and improve the business climate more generally.
30.
The macroeconomic and financial data need to be improved to support policy
decision making and effective surveillance. Priority should be assigned to improving the
compilation of the balance of payments, broadening the coverage of external debt, and
preparing and disseminating bank soundness indicators. Closer interagency cooperation
would be advisable.
31.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Lao P.D.R. take
place on the standard 12-month cycle.

17

Box 1. Competitiveness
Real effective exchange rate (REER) developments in recent years have not affected
competitiveness significantly. Following a long upward trend, the trade-weighted REER
remained broadly stable in 2006. The relative price of nontradables and tradables (domestic
REER) has also fluctuated within a narrow range in recent years. Against this backdrop, nonresource exports have grown on average by 8 percent per year since 2001. During the same
period, garment exports, the most important non-resource exports, have maintained their
market share in EU countries, a key destination.

The impact of the real appreciation on exports has been mitigated by several factors.
First, the bulk of Lao P.D.R.’s exports are commodities that are not too sensitive to exchange
rate fluctuations because of their low domestic cost components. Second, there is a high degree
of dollarization. Finally, garments exports have managed to maintain its market share because
of EU preferential treatment.
On the cost side, the non-resource sector has benefited from low labor costs but confronts
a high cost of doing business and poor governance.

SOEs continue fragile posing a fiscal risk. GDP growth initially increase to nearly 8 percent,
buoyed by higher consumption stimulated by government expenditures. Soon thereafter,
however, non-resource exports start to weaken, and the BoL loosens monetary policy in an
attempt to counter declining activity and maintain consumption. The government continues to
borrow externally, while avoiding recourse to domestic financing. After an initial rapid growth,
real GDP decelerates to 4–5 percent.

APPENDIX I: THE AUTHORITIES’ RESPONSE TO RECENT FUND POLICY ADVICE
Advice from the 2005 Article IV Consultation

Actions Taken

Maintaining macroeconomic stability
Ensure a sound budget framework for 2005/06.

Fiscal performance improved in 2005/06 with increased
revenue and contained expenditure. However, higher wage
growth, reflecting a wage hike, squeezed domesticallyfinanced capital expenditure.

Make the expansion in civil service employment
conditional on strengthened revenue mobilization.

Employment growth has been contained.

Continue to gear monetary policy toward reducing
inflation.

BoL’s net domestic assets have declined, partially offsetting
the impact of reserves accumulation on rapidly rising
monetary aggregates.

Reduce the exposure of state-owned commercial banks to
a government-sponsored project.

State-owned commercial banks have reduced exposure to the
project.

Public finance issues
Introduce VAT.

VAT law was approved in 2006, and it is scheduled for
introduction in late 2008.

Establish a strong tax and customs administration.

The government plans to centralize tax and customs
administration.

Establish a strong national treasury.

A new Treasury decree was drafted with the aim of
establishing a national treasury.

Review center-province relations.

Budget law was approved in 2006, and its operational
details, including revenue and expenditure responsibilities,
are under preparation.

Maximize grant financing and concessional borrowing.

The government intends to borrow commercially for a hydro
project.

Structural issues
Expedite the restructuring of the state-owned commercial
banks.

Little progress. Only the first tranche of the recapitalization
bonds has been issued, and there is no active search for
strategic partners.

Strengthen the trade and investment climate.

Some progress in trade liberalization, but limited progress in
improving the investment climate.

Improve the quality of economic statistics.

Some progress, but signified improvements required.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative

Lao P.D.R. is eligible for assistance under the HIPC Initiative. However, to date the authorities
have indicated that they do not want to avail themselves of this facility.

VIII.

Safeguards Assessments

A safeguards assessment of the Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BoL) was completed in April 2003 with
respect to the PRGF arrangement approved in 2001. The main findings, recommendations,
and progress thereon, were reported in Country Report No. 03/308 and Country Report
No. 05/8. Progress on safeguards recommendations has been slow. The authorities indicated
that they were not in a position to implement an earlier agreement to undertake a joint-audit
of the BoL’s 2003 and 2004 accounts by the state auditor and an international audit firm.
These audits have subsequently been completed by the state auditor, but the joint-audit issue
remains unresolved.
IX.

Exchange Rate

In September 1995, Lao P.D.R. adopted a managed floating exchange rate system. From
October 1997, commercial banks have been encouraged to follow the parallel market closely.
From October 27, 2003, the commercial bank exchange rate is calculated by the BoL as the
weighted average of the previous day’s commercial banks’ and interbank market rates. The
BoL provides this reference rate to the commercial banks, who then set their own rates,
keeping them close to the parallel market rates. The foreign currency and precious metal
decree (No.02/BoL, August 29, 2003) is under review.
X.

Exchange and Payments System

Lao P.D.R. no longer maintains restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV,
Section 2, but maintains restrictions imposed for the preservation of national or international
security, which have been notified pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51), and a restriction
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII (tax payment certificates are required for some
transactions). A joint LEG/MFD mission in August 2004 conducted a review of the exchange
system to establish the remaining measures that would facilitate Lao P.D.R.’s acceptance of
the obligations under Article VIII, including the elimination of an exchange restriction on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. During the 2007
Article IV consultation, the authorities informed staff that they would consider the
elimination of the exchange restriction during the WTO accession process (expected to take
place by 2010 under the current government plan).
XI.

Last Article IV Consultation Discussions

The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during November 7–
18, 2005. The staff report (Country Report No. 06/399) was discussed by the Executive
Board on March 8 2006 and was published on November 7, 2006.

ANNEX II. LAO P.D.R.: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
IMF-Bank Collaboration
The IMF takes the lead in advising the government of Lao P.D.R. (GOL) on macroeconomic
policy. The support covers tax, fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, and economic
statistical issues. The Bank takes the lead in supporting the GOL in formulating a growth and
poverty reduction strategy and implementing structural reform, such as in public finance
management, SOE restructuring, private sector development, trade, legal and judicial
development, and natural resource management. The Bank and IMF have coordinated their
work on some structural areas that have important implications on macroeconomic
performance, for example, in areas of the financial sector, public expenditure management,
trade policy, and poverty reduction strategy.
IMF and Bank Joint Role in Policy Dialogue
Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Bank and the IMF, together with the UNDP, have provided
assistance to the GOL’s process of formulating its medium-term poverty reduction strategy.
In 2003, the GOL prepared the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, called the
National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES). The Bank and the IMF’s Joint
Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of the strategy was presented before IDA and IMF Boards in
November 2004. In 2006, the government prepared the Sixth National Socioeconomic
Development Plan (NSEDP) 2006–2010 with a strong poverty focus and wide consultations
with the Bank, donors and the IMF, key domestic stakeholders in Vientiane and provinces,
and presented it to the development partners in November 2006 at the 9th Round Table
Meeting with donors.
The Bank is supporting the implementation of NGPES and NESDP through the Poverty
Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs). The focus of PRSOs includes public finance
management reform, social and infrastructure sectors, regional integration. and private sector
development. PRSO-1 ($10 million) was approved in March 2005), followed by PRSO-2 ($8
million) in April 2006, and PRSO-3 ($10 million) in June 2007. The next cycle of PRSO is
under discussion and is expected to go to the Bank Board early next year.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has provided extensive technical assistance in
developing and implementing the government’s multi-year Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review in early
2007, jointly with the IMF, other donors, and GOL and a Public Expenditure Tracking

Reduction and Economic Management Department, East Asia and Pacific Region, email:

6
Survey (PETS) for education and health sectors in mid-2007. The Bank is also assisting GOL
in the preparation and implementation of the GFS compatible Chart of Accounts, the new
Budget Law, especially to improve intergovernmental fiscal relations.
Financial Sector Reforms. The Bank and the IMF have worked closely to support the
government in developing and implementing a banking reform program. The Bank has
supported restructuring of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), and drafting of banking
sector legislation.
Trade Policy. The Bank led preparation of the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS),
jointly with the GOL, and other Integrated Framework donors. A Multi-Donor Trust Fund (to
be administered by the Bank) is currently being set up to support the action matrix in the
DTIS, and a Trade Facilitation Project is being designed in close collaboration with the IMF
to support customs modernization through implementation of ASYCUDA system.
The Bank’s Key Roles in Policy Dialogue
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The SOEs have been a debtor to SOCBs and one of the
sources of their NPL problems. The Bank has supported the GOL’s SOE reform and
restructuring program, aimed at improving transparency by institutionalizing the reporting
and recording of annual performance of all SOEs and international standard audits of large
SOEs, at restructuring the largest SOEs to reduce losses or raise profits, and reforming the
pricing policy for public utility SOEs in water, power, and telecoms.
Private Sector Development. The Bank supports the development of the private sector, both
economy-wide and in the sectors. Main activities include a joint ADB-Bank Investment
Climate Assessment of manufacturing and tourism firms, a review of the regulatory
procedures and private sector promotion initiatives of local governments, a review of the key
business laws, and coordination of the donor working group on macroeconomic and private
sector development issues. In addition the Bank conducts policy dialogue to improve the
climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign.
Forestry Development. The GOL is involved in a continuing process of reforming its
forestry sector and improving the implementation of forestry programs and projects. The
Bank is trying to ensure that the GOL’s objectives and strategy for forestry are consistent
with the NGPES, Rural Development Program, and Agriculture Development Strategy.
The Nam Theun 2 Hydro-power Project. The Bank has supported the project through an
IDA partial risk guarantee, an IDA grant for environmental and social mitigation, and a
MIGA guarantee, all done in March 2005. The World Bank decision to support the project
was based on a “decision framework” with the following three pillars: (i) Lao P.D.R.
establishing and implementing a viable development policy framework, characterized by
concrete performance, and national programs for poverty reduction and social and

7
environmental protection; (ii) the technical, financial, economic and implementation aspects
of the project, as well as the design and implementation of safeguards policies, being sound;
and (iii) wider understanding and broader support from the international donor community
and global and local civil society for Lao P.D.R.’s development framework and the project.
The Bank is supporting and monitoring the implementation of the NT2 project, and its
progress remains good; it is expected to be operational in early 2010.
Bank Strategy and Lending Operations
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The full CAS was presented to the Bank’s Board in
March 2005, and the CAS update (and extension through 2011) was submitted to the Board
in June, 2007. The CAS selectively targets key NGPES priorities, including: (i) sustaining
growth through linking to and capitalizing on regional opportunities and better natural
resource management; (ii) improving social outcomes through strengthening financial
management and service delivery capacity; (iii) strengthening management capacities,
partnerships, and monitoring for NGPES implementation; and (iv) implementing the NT2
program as a model for supporting sustainable growth, improving social outcomes, and
building key development capacities. The CAS consists of a lending and non-lending
program, with a notional amount of about US$128 million in new commitments (credits and
grants) between July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2008 (subject to the IDA Performance Based
Allocation system).
Lending Operations
As of March 15, 2007, a total amount of US$835.88 million equivalent of IDA credits and
grants had been approved. This included support for adjustment operations, rural
development, forestry, transport, energy, telecommunications, education, health, industry,
capacity building, and risk guarantees. In the last three years, IDA support has focused on the
CAS objectives, with an average disbursement of US$32 million.

ANNEX III. LAO P.D.R.: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has extended development assistance to Lao P.D.R.
since 1968. In the 1970s and 1980s, AsDB assistance was focused mainly on economic
growth projects involving infrastructure development in the transport and energy sectors, as
well as agriculture. AsDB has been active in the development of the financial sector since the
latter part of the 1980s, and broadened its assistance to Lao P.D.R. to include rural
development, social development and environment in the 1990s. AsDB has focused its
activities on poverty reduction since the late 1990s.
AsDB’s new Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Lao P.D.R. for 2007–11 is anchored
in and closely aligned to the Lao P.D.R.’s 6th National Socioeconomic Development Plan,
2006–10 (NESDP). A results-based strategy, the CSP focuses on promoting sustainable propoor sustainable growth, strengthening governance, developing government’s capacity,
improving social inclusiveness and gender, enhancing regional cooperation and integration,
managing the environment, and supporting private sector (including banking) developments.
These strategic focuses are shaped by the country’s specific requirements and capabilities
after extensive stakeholder consultations. The CSP is designed to achieve high impact and
sustainable development results and to contribute to the government’s Millennium
Development Goals and sector-specific commitments as set out in NSEDP, with specific
goals, targets, and progress indicators for AsDB interventions.
Lao P.D.R. is a key actor in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region (GMS) program as a land-link
among the other GMS member countries. The AsDB will aim to explore various options to
maximize the benefits to Lao P.D.R. from sub-regional cooperation. To enhance the
development impact of projects and ensure their close monitoring, AsDB’s interventions will
focus primarily on the poor northern region provinces and along the East-West economic
corridor, which links Thailand to Savannakhet and Vietnam.
Since 1970, the AsDB has approved 71 loan and grant financed projects for a total of
$1.18 billion―of which 28 projects were currently active―and 224 technical assistance
projects for a total of $113.0 million (as of end-December 2006).
In 2006, six new loans and grants were approved (comprising two for agriculture, two for
education, and two for rural finance, of which one loan each in education rural finance were
programs to support sector reforms). In addition, eight technical assistance projects
amounting to $4.7 million were approved.

ANNEX IV. LAO P.D.R.: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The macroeconomic and financial data needs to be improved to support policy decision
making and effective surveillance. In this regard, a multisector STA mission visited
Vientiane during October 2002 to facilitate the preparation of the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) metadata. It recommended greater coordination between the
various agencies responsible for compiling macroeconomic statistics, including the formation
of an inter-agency working group. While a GDDS coordinator has been appointed, the
authorities have yet to finalize the GDDS metadata and a strategy for statistical
improvement. Two STA missions took place in April/May 2004 in the areas of government
finance statistics and monetary and financial statistics. Economic and financial data are
published in periodic reports by the National Statistical Center (NSC) and the Bank of Lao
P.D.R. (BoL). An expert on national accounts provided assistance in late 2006.
National accounts
National accounts consist of annual estimates of GDP by activity at current and
constant 1990 prices, broadly following the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA).
The lack of regular surveys to collect comprehensive data on current economic activities and
the use of inadequate compilation methods raise questions about the coverage and reliability
of the GDP estimates. The estimates rely heavily on data on production or volume indicators
collected by line ministries. The October 2002 multisector STA mission recommended that
the authorities establish a system for collecting data on current economic activities based on
regular surveys and implement compilation methods in accordance with the System of
National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). The Swedish International Development Agency
(SIDA) is providing technical assistance to the NSC to improve the national income
accounts. With SIDA support, the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2002–03
(LECS 3) has been finalized and released. An STA regional advisor visited Vientiane in
November/December 2006 as part of APD staff visit to update the assessment of the quality
of national accounts statistics. The advisor assessed that there had been progress in
improving the quality of source data, including implementing annual enterprise and
household surveys, but weaknesses remained in estimates for deflators, constant price
estimates, and expenditures.
Prices
The NSC compiles a monthly CPI that is available on a timely basis. The latest CPI was
introduced in January 2006 (with December 2005 as the reference period), using the results
of the 2002/03 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS) for deriving a
consumption basket. Similar to earlier CPI series, the consumption baskets only include
goods and services purchased in the market, and own consumption is not reflected in the
basket weight. The NSC is planning to introduce a producer price index (PPI) in 2007.

13
Government finance
Government finance statistics are weak and there is scope to significantly improve their
accuracy, coverage, timeliness, and transparency. The Budget Department produces monthly,
quarterly, and annual revenue and expenditure statistics. Most data are recorded on a cash
basis. Expenditure data by economic type are compiled by central government and the
provinces. Data on bank and nonbank financing of the budget, including treasury bill
operations, need to be made consistent with the monetary accounts. The social security fund
and off-budget activities are not included in fiscal data. Annual budget and outturn data are
not disseminated according to an international standard, which complicates fiscal analysis. A
government finance statistics mission in 2004 recommended improving the quality of fiscal
statistics and developed a roadmap for eventual migration to GFSM2001. No data are being
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or International
Financial Statistics.
Budget planning, execution, reporting, and cash management require significant upgrading,
as noted by the October 2002 FAD mission on public expenditure management. Moreover,
greater decentralization in 2000/01 further complicated the timely reporting of fiscal data
from lower government levels, as monitoring systems are weak and skilled staff limited. This
continues to hamper the accurate reporting of various items to the central budget, such as
timber-related royalty payments.
Central government debt data are compiled by two departments of the MOF; external debt by
the External Financial Relations Department and domestic debt by the Budget Department.
Debt data are comprehensive and available by type of debt holder and instrument. Efforts are
being made to further improve coverage, particularly relating to SOE debt.
Monetary statistics
The latest monetary and financial statistics mission in April/May 2004 identified a number of
problems in the compilation of monetary statistics and made further recommendations for
(i) improvement in the sectorization of various institutional units (e.g., nonfinancial public
enterprises) and uniform treatment of sectors on both asset and liability sides of the
commercial bank balance sheet; (ii) valuation of financial assets and liabilities (e.g., valuing
monetary gold at market prices); (iii) classification of financial instruments (e.g., classifying
loan loss provisions as other liabilities and valuation adjustments as part of shares and other
equity); (iv) improvement in the chart of accounts for BoL and commercial banks, including
preparation of a “Manual of the Chart of Accounts”; (v) improvements in the coverage and
identification of IMF accounts; (vi) reconciliation of differences between the accounting data
(from the Accounting Department of the BoL) with monetary data sent to APD and STA
(compiled by the Economic Research Department using source data from the Operations
Department of the BoL); and (vii) on investigation of discrepancies in bank financing
between monetary and government finance statistics. Many of the recommendations of the

14
mission have yet to be implemented, including those to rectify the inconsistent sectorization
of units on the asset and liability sides of the commercial bank balance sheet.
Balance of payments
Data on foreign reserves are reported weekly and derived from the monetary survey at the
prevailing kip per U.S. dollar end-month exchange rate. Balance of payments statistics need
significant frequency and coverage improvements in the following areas: (i) customs trade
data; (ii) the commodity composition of external trade; (iii) services and income; (iv) actual
foreign direct investment flows; (v) separation of current and capital transfers as well as
coverage of some type of grants, especially from international nongovernment organizations;
(vi) the reconciliation of fiscal and balance of payments data on external loans and grants;
and (vii) monitoring of external debt, especially of state owned enterprises. In 2001, the
ministry of finance adopted the Commonwealth Secretariat-Debt Recording and
Management System (CS-DRMS) for processing and maintaining external debt data.
New customs procedures (the Customs 2000 system) and equipment permitted (with FAD
technical assistance) production of more accurate trade data in October 2000. However, for a
range of technical reasons, the customs department has not yet produced these data on a
regular basis. Fund missions have emphasized that this problem needs to be urgently
addressed. In order to produce accurate balance of payments updates on a regular basis, there
is a need to improve the coordination between the agencies involved in BOP compilation, for
example., the BoL, the NSC, the Customs and the External Financial Relations Departments
of the Ministry of Finance, the Department of International Cooperation of the Committee of
Planning and Investment, and the commercial banks. The Japanese government is providing
technical assistance to address some of these issues.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
July 19, 2007
1.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted during the 2007 Article IV
consultation discussions indicates that Lao P.D.R. continues to face a high risk of debt
distress.1 The current DSA points to an improved outlook compared to the previous DSA.
The stock indicators are expected to decline faster and the debt service burden is projected to
be lower in terms of exports. Moreover, debt service ratios remain relatively low. However,
despite these improvements, the debt stock indicators remain well-above the policy-based
indicative thresholds and could increase further depending on future macroeconomic
performance and the concessionality of external financing.
A. Background
2.
Lao P.D.R.’s external public and publicly guaranteed debt (PPG) ratios have
declined in recent years (Text Figure 1). While nominal debt stocks have increased, strong
growth has led the nominal debt-to-GDP ratio to steadily decline since 2002. All debt service
indicators reversed their upward trends in 2006, reflecting continued strong GDP and export
growth helped by high commodity prices.

Despite these positive developments,
Lao P.D.R.’s external public debt stock
remains at an elevated level. The total
external public debt stock amounted to
US$2.4 billion (70 percent of GDP) at end2006, with a net present value of
US$1.7 billion. At these levels, Lao P.D.R.’s
debt stock indicators are significantly above
the policy-based indicative thresholds for
countries with similar CPIA rating (Text Table
1).2 However, debt service ratios remain below
the indicative thresholds due to a high degree of
concessionality.

About 75 percent of Lao P.D.R.’s
external public debt are concessional loans
from multilateral creditors, primarily the
AsDB and IDA (Text Table 2).3,4 Debt to bilateral
and commercial creditors amounted to
approximately US$633 million. Traditional
bilateral creditors include Russia and Japan. In
recent years, neighboring countries, including
China, Vietnam, and Thailand, are becoming
increasingly active, although information is
limited regarding their lending activities. Since
the signing of the rescheduling agreement with
Russia in 2003, Lao P.D.R. has not accumulated
any external debt payment arrears.5

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) provides indicative levels (thresholds) of
debt burdens beyond which a country’s risk of debt distress reaches levels that are considered unacceptable. See
IDA/R2004-0253, “Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries—
Further Considerations.” The LIC DSF recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to manage
higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy dependent. Lao P.D.R.’s policies and institutions,
as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “weak
performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are indicated in Text Table 1 above.

Except for two loans for the NT2 project from AsDB and EIB for which near-market terms apply.

The assessment in this annex is based on available information and any debt that has not been identified by the
authorities would further increase the risk of debt distress. For example, some sources indicate higher domestic
debt due to unaccounted quasi-fiscal liabilities; more research is needed to quantify this component of domestic
debt.

This excludes the non-payment of an amount due in May 2007, which the Russian authorities consider to be in
arrears, while the Lao P.D R. authorities have informed the staff that they had communicated in June 2007 to the
Russian authorities their desire to renegotiate the rescheduling agreement. Debt to Russia was rescheduled on a

The size of domestic public debt is negligible. At the end of 2005/06, the stock of
domestic public debt stood at around Kip 560 billion (1¾ percent of GDP).
B. Debt Sustainability Outlook
6.
The medium- to long-term debt sustainability of Lao P.D.R. depends on the
government’s choice of policies to deal with potentially adverse effects of the resource
bonanza. The proactive scenario (baseline) assumes that policies are put in place in
anticipation of adverse effects on the non-resource sector (such as greater appreciation of the
real exchange rate–see Box 1).6 To examine the implications of an alternative policy
response, staff have developed a reactive scenario, where policies are undertaken as the
adverse effects materialize (Box 2). Under each scenario, standard stress tests are carried out
to check the resilience of the debt outlook in the event of external shocks.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2007–27
The assumptions in the baseline scenario are consistent with a proactive policy response to the recent increase in natural
resource revenue. In particular, the government is assumed to save a large portion of resource revenue for future use,
while pursuing fiscal consolidation of the non-resource budget. Moreover, improvements to the investment climate
envisioned in the National Socio-economic Development Plan (NSEDP) are assumed to be realized.
Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate in the early years fueled by high investment demand in the resource sector,
later stabilizing at around 6.5 percent increasingly
Text Table 3. Lao P.D.R. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions
supported by non-resource sector growth.
(Proactive scenario)
Inflation is projected to remain around the recent levels
(4.5 percent) as the BoL’s enhanced set of market-based
tools for conducting monetary policy helps to contain the
monetary impact of external surpluses from natural
resources.
The real exchange rate is expected to appreciate due to
the resource sector boom, but only moderately.

Export growth is volatile in the early years reflecting the
mining output profile, commodity price changes, and the
timing of the start of operations of the NT2 dam project. In
the medium term, nominal export growth stabilizes at around 11 percent, increasingly driven by non-resource exports.
Import growth is projected to increase sharply in 2007–08 due to the dam construction projects, then to decline
thereafter, stabilizing around 11 percent after 2012.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to stabilize at around 1 percent of GDP from 2008 onward as
construction-related imports decrease and electricity and non-resource exports increase. FDI is assumed to decline from
an average of 13.9 percent of GDP in 2007–11 to 1.9 percent of GDP after 2012 as earlier levels were related to dam
construction and mining projects that should be completed by that time.
Fiscal revenues are expected to increase from 12.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to around 13.5 percent of GDP in the long
term, while total expenditures are assumed to remain roughly constant as a percent of GDP. As a consequence, the
primary fiscal deficit is assumed to decrease from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to around 1 percent after 2012.
External financing is assumed to be on highly concessional terms, with a grant element over 40 percent.

bilateral basis in December 2003, with a 70 percent up-front debt stock reduction and a rescheduling of
maturities.
6
This also requires the authorities carry out its reform commitment under the NSEDP and continue the fiscal
consolidation effort in the medium term.

4

Box 2. Reactive Policy Response (Alternative) Scenario
To examine the implications of a different policy response to the boom in natural resource revenues, the staff
have also considered a reactive policy scenario characterized by higher expenditures and slower progress in
structural reforms.
Under the reactive policy scenario the government spends all resource revenues, leading to a sharp increase in
government expenditures. As a result, its net position with the banking system would remain unchanged. The
BoL would take time in developing monetary management tools and inflationary pressures would emerge,
exacerbating the appreciation of the exchange rate and adversely affecting the competitiveness of non-resource
exports.
Efforts to enhance the business environment are projected to advance only gradually in this scenario, and
SOCBs and SOEs continue to pose a fiscal risk and burden to the budget. GDP growth is projected to initially
increase to nearly 8 percent, buoyed by higher consumption stimulated by government expenditures. Soon
thereafter, however, non-resource exports would start to weaken, which could lead the BoL to loosen monetary
policy in an attempt to counter declining activity and maintain consumption. The government is assumed to
continue to borrow externally, while avoiding recourse to domestic financing. After an initial rapid growth, real
GDP is projected to decelerate to 4–5 percent. Key assumptions of the reactive scenario are summarized in
Text Table 4 below.

C. Outlook for External Public and Publicly Guaranteed Debt
Proactive scenario (baseline)
7.
The results of this DSA suggest Lao P.D.R. is still at a high risk of debt distress
even with the proactive policy response assumed in the baseline scenario (Figure 1).
However, the debt outlook is expected to improve in the projection period.
•

In the near term, debt stock indicators will remain at elevated levels, but they are
projected to steadily decline to below the relevant indicative thresholds within the
projection period. Lao P.D.R. had a high NPV debt-to-GDP ratio of 48 percent at
end-2006, which, under the proactive scenario, is projected to decline substantially
over time to reach below 20 percent by 2027, crossing the 30 percent indicative

5
threshold by 2014 (Table 1). The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to decline
from 135 percent to below 60 percent toward the end of the projection period.
•

The debt service ratios are expected to remain well below the thresholds. As a
percent of exports or revenue, debt service during the entire projection period is
expected to be at comfortable levels.

8.
The standard stress tests indicate that the Lao P.D.R.’s external debt outlook is
fairly resilient to exogenous shocks under the baseline scenario (Figure 1 and Table 2).
Except for the simulations based on historical averages, all stress tests lead to higher, but
stabilizing ratios below the relevant thresholds. Under the historical trend simulation, the NPV
of debt-to-GDP ratio and NPV of debt-to-export ratio would deteriorate to stay above the
thresholds throughout the projection period, mainly because the historical averages
incorporated little impact from the recent rapid development of mining and hydropower sectors,
which are expected to improve Lao P.D.R.’s growth and export performance as well as its
balance of payments and fiscal balance substantially in the medium term and beyond. Similarly,
the debt service to exports ratio would worsen, although remaining below the thresholds.7
Reactive scenario (alternative)
9.
The risk of debt distress—already high in the proactive scenario—would
deteriorate further under the reactive scenario (Figure 1 and Table 3). Although the debt
stock indicators based on GDP and exports are still expected to decline over time, they would
approach the relevant thresholds only toward the end of the projection period. The debt
service burden in terms of exports, despite at a low level, would be higher than that under the
proactive scenario. Finally, under the reactive scenario, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
would remain at an unsustainable level and the debt service burden in terms of government
revenue would rise in early years, but stabilize at a higher level of around 20 percent toward
the end of the projection period.
10.
The standard stress tests under the reactive scenario further highlight the
significant risk of debt distress in the event of exogenous shocks. All stress tests under
reactive scenarios will lead the debt stock indicators to be well above the sustainability
thresholds. The outlook on the fiscal side is more precarious as the NPV of debt-to-revenue
ratio could rise to more than twice the threshold level. The stress tests will also cause the
debt service indicators to rise significantly with the debt service to revenue ratio exceeding
sustainable threshold (Figure 1 and Table 4).
7

Due to the sharp declines in copper price already incorporated in the proactive and reactive scenarios, further
temporary shocks to commodity prices will only worsen the external debt indicators modestly. For example, if
both the copper and gold prices took the 10-year historical average between 2008–12, the NPV of debt-toexports ratio would increase by 6 percentage points from the baseline.

D. Outlook for Total Public and Publicly Guaranteed Debt
11.
Because the majority of public debt is to external creditors, the public debt
trajectory will closely follow the external debt (Figure 2 and Table 5). Under the proactive
scenario (Baseline), both the NPV of public debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios
(51 percent and 345 percent, respectively, at the end of 2005/06) are envisaged to fall
steadily to 20 percent of GDP and around 120 percent of GDP, respectively, by 2026/27. The
debt service to revenue ratio―which is currently relatively low due to high concessionality
―is projected to decline to less than 7 percent by 2026/27.
12.
The public debt outlook will be less benign under the reactive (alternative)
scenario (Tables 7 and 8). The NPV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline only
moderately through the projection period. The debt service to revenue ratio could even rise in
the middle of the 2010s, if the government fails to increase revenues.
III. Conclusion
13.
Although Lao P.D.R.'s debt ratios continue to improve, the overall debt burden
remains elevated and the risk of debt distress is high. While the debt service ratios are
expected to remain below the thresholds, suggesting low risk of a liquidity crisis in the short
term, Lao P.D.R.’s debt-stock indicators are expected to remain significantly above their
thresholds for a number of years. To mitigate these risks, sound macroeconomic policies
need to be put in place and a renewed impetus given to the economic reform effort to raise
the growth and export performance of the non-resource sector. The current high risk of debt
distress also calls for an extremely prudent approach for future external borrowing. In
particular, Lao P.D.R. should continue to rely on grants or highly concessional resources for
its development needs.

1/ comprehansive data on private sector external debt are not available.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 23, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with the Lao People's Democratic Republic
On August 3, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance remains strong. Real GDP growth increased to 7½ percent in
2006, driven by the resource sector such as a sizable expansion of mineral production and the
construction of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) hydro-electric dam. The non-resource sector continued
to grow moderately. Inflation has fallen below 4 percent in recent months, due to favorable oil
and food prices and the lagged impact of the exchange rate appreciation. The current account
deficit narrowed, reflecting buoyant resource exports and rising tourism receipts, and together
with higher foreign direct investment and official development assistance inflows, resulted in an
increase in the balance of payments. By end-June 2007, gross international reserves increased
to about US$460 million, 4.6 months of non-resource imports. The rapid accumulation of
international reserves led to an acceleration in the growth of monetary aggregates. By end–May
2007, reserve and broad money growth accelerated to 45 and 39 percent, respectively.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Fiscal policy in 2005/062 and the first eight months of 2006/07 contributed to lower demand
pressures. Higher-than-anticipated resource revenues, coupled with non-resource revenues
gains from the full implementation of tax changes in 2005 helped to reduce the deficit and lower
net domestic borrowing. Bank credit to the private sector has also fallen in recent months.
Progress in economic reform has been mixed and the cost of doing business remains high.
Restructuring of state-owned banks (SOCBs) and enterprises (SOEs) is proceeding, but
SOCBs are far from being solvent and some SOEs are still making losses or are heavily
indebted. Several laws for reforming the budget system (such as tax and customs
administration and intergovernmental relations), introducing a VAT, and improving the
investment climate (including the 2005 Enterprise Law and 2006 Commercial Bank Law) have
been approved, but there is considerable delay in finalizing the respective implementing
regulations. ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreement is being pursued, and work to gain
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession is ongoing.
The economic outlook is promising, but much depends on the way in which the government
handles the natural resource bonanza. Were the government to adopt sound policies and
accelerate reforms in anticipation of an adverse impact of the resource sector, growth would
remain strong at around 6½ percent in the medium term, and inflation would stay below
5 percent. On the contrary, the outlook would be less benign if the government does not take
timely policy actions, with lower growth and higher inflation. There are several risks to the
outlook. Upside risks include additional proven mineral reserves, new investment in the mining
sector, and construction of more hydropower plants. Downside risks comprise adverse
commodity price shocks, delays in construction of hydropower plants, and slow process in
important economic reform.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Lao P.D.R.’s recent record of robust growth, low inflation, and
strengthened external position, which reflects a rapidly growing mining and hydropower
resource sector as well as a favorable external environment. Poverty has been reduced
significantly. Directors were encouraged by Lao P.D.R.’s strong fiscal performance, by the
progress achieved in banking and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, and by the steps taken
to improve the investment climate.
Directors concurred that the economic outlook for Lao P.D.R. is promising. They considered
that the implementation of policies to sustain macroeconomic stability and accelerate the pace
of reform will be key to realizing the full benefits of the resource sector, by supporting a strong

supply response in the non-resource sector. This will be needed to help Lao P.D.R. mitigate the
risks associated with the increased reliance on the natural resource sector and to help reduce
exposure to debt distress.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability
over the medium term, but expressed concern that full implementation of the recently approved
2007/08 budget will be a move away from the realization of the government’s medium-term
fiscal objectives. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to identify additional measures
that would maintain fiscal prudence. Directors underscored the importance of a timely
introduction of a VAT and a review of the tax system, coupled with stepped-up efforts to
improve revenue and expenditure administration, and reform intergovernmental fiscal relations.
In order to support the alignment of expenditures with national priorities, Directors called on the
authorities to put in place an integrated medium-term fiscal framework that takes into account
the uncertainties of resource revenues. Future external financing should continue to rely on
grants and concessional loans.
Directors stressed that the development of a sound and transparent resource management
framework, with appropriate expert assistance, will be key to ensuring a level playing field and
attracting investor interest. In this regard, the net benefits of taking an equity stake in future
resource projects should be closely evaluated, given the associated financial risks and the
potential conflict of interest with government’s dual role as regulator and shareholder. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative.
Directors underscored the need for maintaining a tight control of Bank of Lao P.D.R.’s (BoL) net
domestic assets and bank credit to the private sector. They agreed the BoL’s liquidity
management instruments should be upgraded, and supported the introduction of a standing
deposit facility until instruments using treasury bills are in place. Steps should also be taken to
develop the interbank money market and mechanisms to avoid the quasi-fiscal costs of
managing liquidity.
Directors considered that the Lao P.D.R.’s exchange rate policy is appropriate, and that the
exchange rate appears to be in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. They shared the
authorities’ concern about the risk of large exchange rate fluctuations. To help manage such
risk, Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen international reserves further, to build
up the BoL’s capacity to smooth fluctuations, and to take steps to develop a well-functioning
foreign exchange market.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate banking and SOE reform, including by fully
implementing the banking law, strictly enforcing prudential regulations, and strengthening bank
supervision. Directors encouraged the authorities to expedite the recapitalization of the stateowned commercial banks, including by involving strategic investors. They noted that deepening

4
SOE restructuring would help strengthen the banking sector. With the reduced reliance of SOEs
on the budget, the extension of public guarantees on SOEs’ borrowing should henceforth be
conditioned on the viability of business plans.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to enhance trade integration and improve the
investment climate. The authorities’ efforts to gain WTO accession should be sustained.
Directors considered that more decisive steps to reduce the high cost of doing business will
help Lao P.D.R. to reap the full benefits of trade integration.
Directors observed that improving the Lao P.D.R.’s macroeconomic and financial data will
support more effective surveillance and enhance decision-making, and encouraged the
authorities to focus, in particular, on data on the balance of payments, government finances,
and external debt, and on bank soundness indicators.

Statement by Chantavarn Sucharitakul, Alternate Executive Director for Lao P.D.R.
August 3, 2007

Introduction
My authorities are most grateful to the staff for the productive discussions and the highquality papers which cover impending and structural, longer-term issues. There is broad
consensus between the staff and the authorities on most aspects of diagnosis of and policy
recommendations for the Laotian economy.
The economic and social performance of Lao P.D.R. during the last decade has been
outstanding, supported by prudent policy management and anchored by a focused and
ambitious forward looking strategy. Nevertheless, Lao P.D.R. remains a poor country and
continues to be highly vulnerable to weather-related and external shocks. Moreover, a low
tax revenue-to-GDP ratio has impeded the government’s ability to finance crucial
development expenditure. To address these challenges, my authorities are determined to
pursue the necessary adjustments and promote a more rapid diversification of the economy
which they hope will ensure a more sustainable level of growth to meet the MDGs. To meet
these objectives, the government strategy has included fiscal consolidation, efforts to
improve the business climate and the continued opening up of the economy in order to avail
themselves of the benefits from globalization.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
As in the previous year, real GDP growth in 2005/06 was robust. The estimated 8.1 percent
growth was attributable mainly to the mining and hydropower sectors and the supportive
regional economic environment. This positive growth momentum has been sustained into the
first half of 2006/07 and economic developments have been largely favorable on the back of
stronger external demand, strong growth in construction activity, and a renewed domestic
and foreign investment. Meanwhile, inflation remains well-contained, averaging 4.25 percent
for the six months of 2007, while the exchange rate continues to be broadly stable against the
U.S. dollar during the past four years. During 2006, the kip appreciated by 10.4 percent
against the U.S. dollar.
The macro-economic outlook for 2006/07 remains buoyant, reflecting the continuation of
strong growth in the mining and hydropower sectors. Real GDP growth is expected to
increase to about 7.5–8.0 percent and the CPI inflation is expected to decline to 4 percent by
end-2007. The current account deficit (including official transfers) is expected to be about

2
3.0 percent of GDP, due to stronger net exports. Gross official international reserves are
expected to reach five months of import coverage.
The authorities fully recognize that strong and sustained growth is key to reducing poverty
and achieving the MDGs. They have, therefore, continued to implement sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to achieve these goals. They are committed to
promoting private sector-led growth by fostering a conducive business climate and
strengthening the financial environment. Particular attention will also be given to reducing
the cost of doing business, monitoring the soundness of the banking sector, and developing
microfinance institutions.
Fiscal Policy
My authorities believe that fiscal consolidation is the cornerstone of their development
strategy. They have adopted an integral approach to strengthen revenue collection, enhance
the quality of public expenditures, and improve debt management. In terms of tax policy, the
government undertook in 2005 their most comprehensive reform of the last decade, which
has begun to reap dividends. During the fiscal year of 2005/06, the tax and non-tax revenue
outturn was 108.7 percent of the planned target. However, the outturn of the government
revenue including grants was only 93.9 percent of the planned target due to some slippages
of the revenue from project grants. It is estimated that the fiscal performance in 2006/07 will
be more favorable than the previous fiscal year.
The authorities are determined to further reduce the budget deficit over the medium term,
through a combination of measures to improve revenue performance and tighter expenditures
controls.
Specifically, with the recently approved budget and VAT law, the government will continue
to strengthen tax administration by (i) reinforcing the central tax department;
(ii) reorganizing the tax and customs departments on a functional basis; and (iii) integrating
large provincial customs offices into the national administration. Preparations for the
introduction of a VAT have begun and will be accelerated in 2007/08, including through
continued improvements in administrative systems. The implementation of VAT is scheduled
to be in late 2008 or early 2009.
In addition, the authorities plan to streamline the tax policy and broaden the taxpayer base by
limiting ad hoc tax exemptions and rate reductions, and fighting tax evasion. In doing so, the
authorities hope to raise additional revenue to place future budget outcomes on a sustainable
path. They will further restrain expenditure where they can, to compensate for budget
slippages from project grants. They also intend to step up the clearance of the budget arrears,
especially the arrears on capital expenditures.

3
The authorities acknowledge the challenges of managing the resource sector and appreciate
the staff assessment of the various scenario analyses of proactive and reactive policy
responses. In this respect, they would carefully examine these scenario analyses as an
important input into developing their fiscal framework going forward.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The BoL has been successful in implementing its monetary policies with the view to
maintaining a low and stable inflation rate, and in managing the floating exchange rate
regime.
Monetary developments were well above the planned target in 2006. M2 increased by
30 percent, above the targeted 18 percent. This is mainly due to the short-term increase of net
foreign assets of 53.3 percent. In this connection, the BoL has been monitoring closely the
monetary expansion in the first and second quarters of 2007 and stand ready to tighten
monetary policy, with available monetary tools, should inflationary pressures emerge. In
order to maintain the current low inflation rate, the monetary stance of the BoL will continue
to remain firm. Tight control over the BoL’s net domestic assets will continue to be the main
anchor of its monetary policy. Going forward, BoL intends to develop market-based
instruments for managing liquidity by using both domestic securities and sale of foreign
exchange.
At present, the authorities feel comfortable with the competitiveness of the exchange rate and
the level of reserves. Intervention in the foreign exchange market has been aimed at
smoothing transitory fluctuations in the exchange rate, and maintaining an adequate level of
reserves.
Financial Sector
My authorities concur with the staff that a well-developed financial sector plays a pivotal role
in promoting efficiency and stimulating productivity. In December 2006, the National
Assembly adopted the commercial bank law, which was promulgated by the President of the
Lao P.D.R. in January 2007. This is testimony to the priority the government attaches to the
importance of financial sector reform.
The performance of commercial banks has improved. All banks have low NPL ratios. The
income statement of the two state-owned commercial banks (Banque Pour le Commerce
Exterieur Lao and Lao Development Bank), which have been restructured under the Asian
Development Bank’s Banking Sector Reform Program Loan, have registered some profits
since 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB), which is the
third state-owned bank, is now being restructured under the Rural Finance Sector

4
Development Program Loan of Asian Development Bank, drawing lessons from the
restructuring of the earlier two state-owned commercial banks.
While the taking over of NPLs has helped improve the balance sheets of banks, my
authorities note that the health of the banking sector remains fragile. They intend to work
closely with the International Financial Institution (IFIs) to ensure a forceful implementation
of its recommendations aimed at addressing weaknesses in banks’ management and
supervision.
Investment Climate and Regional Integration
The authorities are committed to reforming the economic system to support the integration of
its economy with the rest of the world. To this end, the National Assembly adopted two main
laws to support trade and investment in the country, namely, the new enterprise law in 2005,
and the new foreign investment law in 2004 to facilitate trade and foreign investment into
Lao P.D.R..
Following the enactments of these two laws, the approval of foreign investment in Lao
P.D.R. in 2006 rose to around US$2.6 billion from US$1.2 billion in 2005. The registration
of new enterprises in the Ministry of Industry and commerce during 2006 was about 115
units compared to 97 units in 2005. Foreign participation in the Lao P.D.R. economy has
largely been in the mining and hydropower sectors, which accounts for more than two-thirds
of the total value of foreign direct investment in the country.
Import and export procedures have also been further simplified. All goods can be freely
imported by making declarations at the customs point, except for four product groups subject
to control goods (fuel, vehicles, cement, steel bars), and those restricted for health and
security reasons. In addition to the requirements related to the accession of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the government will continue to liberalize their trade regime based on
their commitments to the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA).
My authorities are cognizant that all reforms aimed at reviving the economic activity and
attracting investors must be complemented with a strengthening of the business environment.
In this connection, the authorities launched the Second Lao Business Forum on March 15,
2007 to discuss progress in resolving issues facing the private sector and government plans to
improve the business environment.

5
Statistics
The authorities will continue to make efforts to improve the collection and compilation of
data on the balance of payments, external debts, SOEs financial statements, and provincial
fiscal operations. In addition, the authorities will work towards enhancing the accuracy of the
national accounts based on the SNA 1993 framework which the authorities have started since
1999.
Conclusion
My authorities highly value the continued support from the international community,
including the Fund and the World Bank. Despite the numerous difficulties of the past, my
authorities have achieved significant economic success, not least of which is stabilizing the
economy. Nevertheless, they recognize that much remains to be done before the country can
achieve its medium-term poverty reduction goals. My authorities are fully committed to
continuing prudent macroeconomic policies, liberalization of the economy and improvements
in the business climate.
I am pleased to inform the Board that the authorities consent to the publication of the staff
report for the 2007 Article IV consultation, and the accompanying documents, with the
necessary deletion of market-sensitive information.
