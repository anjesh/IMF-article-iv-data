IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Belarus
On May 13, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Belarus.
Belarus continues to be highly vulnerable to economic shocks, as was illustrated by the
turbulence in foreign exchange and debt markets late last year. Frequent bouts of expansionary
macroeconomic policies, in a context of deep structural rigidities, have fueled inflation and
external imbalances and left Belarus dependent on ad hoc external support.
Selective policy tightening and a Russian loan helped Belarus navigate large external imbalances
during much of 2014. Yet the slide of the Russian ruble in the fourth quarter triggered acute
exchange market pressures in Belarus, which eventually prompted a stepwise devaluation of the
rubel by 30 percent against the dollar starting in late December. Meanwhile, real GDP grew by
about 1½ percent in 2014, primarily driven by the recovery of potash exports, while inflation
hovered around 18 percent.
In 2015, growth has slowed sharply as high uncertainty, reductions in real incomes,
administrative measures, and declining trade with Russia weighed on activity. The inflationary
impact of the exchange rate depreciation has been muted by a ban on price increases that was
eventually lifted in April. The exchange rate has stabilized and bond spreads have narrowed,
while macroeconomic policies have tightened further in a context of increasingly constrained
external financing.
The outlook is for a recession and continued external pressures. With Russia—the largest trading
partner—in a downturn, the Belarusian economy is projected to contract by 2¼ percent in 2015,
led by falling exports. The current account deficit is expected to remain around 7 percent of
GDP—contributing to significant financing needs. The devaluation is forecast to push inflation
to 22 percent this year despite weak domestic demand. In the medium term, it is expected that
financing constraints will force current account adjustment, while growth will remain weak
reflecting structural rigidities.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Noting Belarus’s continued high vulnerabilities and challenging near-term outlook, Executive
Directors called for a decisive reorientation of policies to promote stability and a sustainable
recovery. Macroeconomic policies should focus on reducing external imbalances and lowering
inflation, while structural reforms are needed to raise the economy’s growth potential.
Directors welcomed last year’s reduction of directed lending growth. They emphasized that new
lending should be further reduced this year and phased out over the medium term so as to
improve credit allocation, contain contingent liabilities, and contribute to a reduction in domestic
demand pressures. Directors also recommended retaining the savings from eliminated oil duties
in 2015, which would result in a small surplus on the headline fiscal balance and help alleviate
financing constraints.
Directors called for containing wage increases in 2015, following their excessive growth in
recent years. They noted that wage restraint would help curb demand and consolidate the
competitiveness gains from rubel depreciation. In the medium term, wage developments should
closely follow productivity growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to make the exchange rate more flexible, and
called for further steps towards exchange rate flexibility to protect the already-low reserves and
ensure adequate adjustment in the volatile external environment. Directors also recommended
that the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) fully implement a money-targeting
framework that is focused on bringing down inflation to single digits.
Directors underscored the importance of closely monitoring risks in the banking sector, noting
that a diagnostic study would help assess the impact of recent shocks on banks’ asset quality.
Any detected problems should be addressed decisively, and any problem banks should be
recapitalized or resolved as soon as feasible. Directors also stressed that the development bank
should be appropriately supervised, and that the NBRB should divest as soon as possible
Moscow-Minsk Bank in light of the conflict of interest arising from the bank being owned by its
supervisor.
Directors agreed that deep structural reforms remain critical to enhance the role of the market in
the economy, boost productivity and competitiveness, and promote sustainable growth. They
urged the authorities to adopt and implement decisively an ambitious, well-sequenced reform
agenda, which should include price liberalization, measures to bring utility and transport tariffs

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

to full cost recovery, steps to phase out mandatory targets for enterprises, and privatizations in
the corporate and banking sectors. While recognizing Belarus’s low levels of poverty and income
inequality, Directors emphasized that social safety nets, including the unemployment insurance,
should be strengthened to protect the most vulnerable.
Directors noted the authorities’ interest in a new Fund-supported program. Recognizing the
benefits it could bring to the country, Directors underscored that any future arrangement would
require a credible and strong commitment at the highest level to a comprehensive package of
deep structural reforms and consistent macroeconomic policies. They looked forward to
continued close engagement with the authorities on these issues.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Belarus’ economic model continues to make it highly vulnerable to economic
shocks. This was illustrated once more by the turbulence in foreign exchange and debt
markets late last year, to which the authorities initially responded with administrative
measures before allowing partial exchange rate adjustment. With Russia in recession, a
large projected current account deficit, sizable debt repayments, limited market access,
and presidential elections in November, risks remain high.
Challenges: Further facilitating external adjustment through the implementation of
strong and consistent macroeconomic policies. Also, enhancing the market orientation
of the economy through bold, frontloaded structural reforms, to bring it on a more
sustainable path.
Policy recommendations:
x

Reduce subsidized lending and resist further wage increases this year to contain
domestic demand;

x

Make the exchange rate fully flexible and tighten monetary policy to facilitate
orderly external adjustment;

x

Assess the health of banks and decisively address any uncovered problems including
by recapitalizing or resolving undercapitalized banks where necessary;

x

Remove price controls and mandatory targets for enterprises and devise credible
privatization plans to improve resource allocation and raise sustainable growth.

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

CONTEXT
1.
An ineffective economic model and low buffers make Belarus highly vulnerable to
shocks. In late 2014, Belarus experienced its third exchange rate crisis since 2008 (Box 1). The
recurrent pressures are rooted in the persistent inability of its over-determined central-planning
model to deliver sustainable growth. Frequent bouts of expansionary macroeconomic policies, in
a context of deep structural rigidities, have fueled inflation and external imbalances and left the
country highly dependent on ad hoc external support. Absolute poverty and income inequality
are at low levels in Belarus but life expectancy, at 72 years, remains 9 years below the Western
European average. Official unemployment is steady and very low at less than 1 percent of the
labor force, but there is significant excess employment in state-owned enterprises reflecting
deep reluctance to restructure inefficient companies and industries. Inadequate unemployment
insurance also deters labor mobility.
Box 1. Belarus: Recent Exchange Rate Crises
Belarus has experienced two earlier crises in the last six years. Although the specific triggers for each case
differed, the macroeconomic vulnerabilities underlying the episodes were broadly the same: high credit
growth and wage increases, a tightly managed exchange rate, a large current account deficit, and
precariously low levels of international reserves. Recent developments echo many of the elements of the two
earlier crisis episodes.
2009—After a decade of strong performance, Belarus was badly hit by the global financial crisis,
which revealed long standing vulnerabilities. These included an overvalued currency, an outsize current
account deficit, and heavy dependence on Russian energy subsidies. A relaxation of macroeconomic
policies in 2008 and a government-driven credit boom exacerbated the situation. External shocks, including
a deep recession in Russia, collapsing demand from other trading partners, a steep rise of the REER due to
Russian ruble depreciation, and limited access to international credit, led to a precipitous fall in reserves,
from already low levels. The situation resulted in an agreement on an exceptional access 15-month
Stand-by Arrangement (SBA), aimed at adjusting to the external shocks and addressing Belarus’ most
pressing challenges by replenishment of reserves, realignment of the exchange rate, demand management,
more robust exchange rate regime and structural reforms.
2011—A sharp loosening of macroeconomic policies following the end of the SBA undid progress
and led to another crisis. Stabilization policies, adopted during the 2009–10 Fund supported program,
were reversed and substituted with highly expansionary wage and credit policies in an attempt to spur
growth. Together with a fixed exchange rate this led to a rapid loss of competitiveness and a sharply
widening current account deficit, creating pressures on reserves. Attempts to maintain the peg with
administrative controls led to the development of a parallel market where foreign exchange (FX) was traded
at a rapidly increasing premium from the official exchange rate. Eventually, the control over the official
exchange rate was abandoned, resulting in a devaluation by 65 percent as the official rate was realigned
with the parallel rate. Pass-through effects caused a sharp acceleration of inflation to over 100 percent.
Growth was anemic in the second half of 2011, and has remained well below pre-crisis levels since then.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Selective policy tightening and a Russian loan helped navigate large external
imbalances during much of 2014 (Figures 1–3, Tables 1–2). Following a period of expansionary
macroeconomic policies and high wage increases (real wage growth outpaced productivity by a
cumulative 30 percent in 2012–14), Belarus started 2014 with a large current account deficit and
a tightly-managed currency that was, on staff estimates, substantially overvalued. The National

Yet the slide of the Russian ruble in the fourth quarter triggered acute pressures.
The gradual depreciation of the Russian ruble during the second half of the year steadily
increased the overvaluation of the Belarusian currency further but this did not prompt major
policy changes. In mid-December, however, when the ruble depreciation accelerated, FX demand
soared abruptly, putting heavy pressure on already-low reserves. The weak ruble also prompted
a surge of imports from Russia. Bond yields spiked as foreign investors reassessed risks.

The initial crisis response centered on heavy-handed administrative measures. The
authorities introduced a temporary 30 percent tax on FX purchases, effectively giving rise to a
dual exchange rate given the implied wedge between buy and sell rates. A number of banks
offered rubel deposit instruments that were indexed to the U.S. dollar rate, which helped stem
the deposit outflow to some extent but exposed banks to significant currency risk. The NBRB’s
overnight credit rate was hiked from 24 to 50 percent and foreign exchange surrender
requirements for exporters were raised. The authorities also introduced a moratorium on
consumer price increases that made it illegal for retailers to raise prices, causing product
shortages and negatively impacting the viability of retail trade.
5.
Eventually substantial adjustment of the exchange rate was allowed. The
administrative measures were not sustainable and a parallel FX market quickly developed.
Following a high-level reshuffle in the government and NBRB in late December, the NBRB
changed course and phased out the FX tax, while stepwise 120

measures, and declining trade with Russia weighed on activity. Monthly GDP data show output
down 0.6 percent y-o-y in the first two months of the year, led by a 6 percent y-o-y contraction
in industrial output. The inflationary impact of the exchange rate depreciation was muted by the
ban on price increases—which remained mostly in effect until it was fully lifted in April.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The outlook is for a recession and continued external pressures. With Russia—the
largest trading partner—in a deep slump, the Belarusian economy is projected to contract by
2¼ percent in 2015, led by falling exports. While lower oil prices are also a net negative for the
Belarus economy (Box 2), ongoing energy subsidies from Russia buffer the shock to domestic
demand to some extent. As the room for current account deterioration is limited by external
financing constraints and low reserves, further exchange rate adjustment will be required to
maintain balance of payments equilibrium. Therefore, an additional 7 percent real effective
depreciation is envisaged under the baseline scenario this year, which would allow the authorities
to stabilize reserves at a low level of US$2½ billion (less than one month of imports) with a
current account deficit of 7 percent of GDP. The rubel depreciation (realized and projected) is
expected to fuel inflation, pushing it to 22 percent this year despite weak domestic demand. In
the medium term, it is expected that financing constraints continue to force further current
account adjustment and gradual exchange rate depreciation, while growth remains weak
reflecting structural rigidities.

Box 2. Belarus: Direct Impact of Lower Oil Prices
The overall direct effect of lower oil prices on Belarus’ economy is negative but modest.
The decline in oil prices has a relatively modest direct effect on Belarus. The direct impact of the recent
sharp drop in oil prices on the Belarus economy is modest and estimated to lower 2015 GDP growth by
0–½ percent and to worsen the current account balance by about ¾ percent of GDP. These estimated
negative direct effects result on balance from two,
largely offsetting, forces:
Oil Export and Import Projections, 2015

x

x

Refining proceeds. Belarus imports crude oil from
Russia and re-exports refined oil products to both
Russia and to Western Europe. While oil product
export prices broadly follow world market prices,
import prices of crude are determined by a
negotiated formula and are less sensitive to world
oil prices—specifically, import prices rise only by
about 60 cents for every dollar increase in the world
oil price. The substantial decline in world oil prices
therefore has a substantial negative impact on
Belarus through this channel.

Domestic energy use. Belarus is not a producer of oil or gas and is a net importer of oil with some
30 percent of total imports used domestically. The price gain on energy imports for domestic use has a
substantial positive impact on the economy.

The indirect impact of the lower oil prices is more substantial. The main impact of low oil prices on
Belarus is through their effect on the Russian economy and the Russian ruble exchange rate.

8.
More external financing could alleviate
strains, but prospects are uncertain. The financing
outlook is clouded, including on account of spillovers
from Russia, which is Belarus’ main source of interbank
lending and foreign direct investment (FDI). The
Russian government will provide additional support in
the form of a waiver to pay duties on re-exports of its
oil that was provided at discounted prices. It has also
indicated it will refinance debt service due to Russia
this year. Further bilateral support could help ease
conditions, but there are no concrete indications that
more support is forthcoming. The high level of
Eurobond spreads following the recent crisis will likely
prevent a successful new debt issuance in international
markets this year.

Risks are high and stem from both domestic and regional sources. The main
domestic risk stems from the Presidential elections in the fall, which could prompt
macroeconomic stimulus measures that would exacerbate inflation pressures and external
imbalances. A deterioration of bank balance sheets on account of the sharp rubel depreciation
and the weak economic environment is another key domestic risk. Externally, financing shortfalls
could deepen the recession or force a sharper exchange rate adjustment. Oil price developments
and geopolitical tensions in the region, to the extent that they impact Russia, are also key
sources of risks. A deeper-than-envisaged recession in Russia or further ruble depreciation would
negatively impact the balance of payments and growth in Belarus. However,
better-than-expected Russian growth, or ruble recovery, are upside risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
Discussions focused on the need for a decisive reorientation of policies to manage
external adjustment and restore stability. Staff and the authorities discussed the need for an
exit from remaining administrative crisis measures, paired with comprehensive macroeconomic
policy tightening to restore stability. The urgency of long overdue deep structural reforms,
needed to bring the economy permanently on a more sustainable path, was also discussed. The
staff’s reform scenario illustrates that consistent implementation of such policies would result,
after an initial adjustment period, in gradually reducing external imbalances, increasing foreign
investment, strengthening reserves, and higher medium-term growth (Figure 4, Table 3).

volume of new directed lending declined to about 4 percent of
GDP in 2014 (from 5 percent of GDP in 2013). At this volume, however, directed lending largely
crowded out more viable commercial lending. Pauses in government-led wage increases at the
beginning and end of 2014 helped slow economy-wide wage growth, with real wages roughly
flat over the full year. While this moderation alone was not sufficient to start making up the
competitiveness losses from high wage increases during 2012–13, the more recent exchange rate
depreciation implied a more significant correction of Belarusian wages in U.S. dollar terms.

preliminary data indicate that the government over performed its original balanced budget
target and ran a 1 percent of GDP surplus in 2014—a result achieved by sharp cuts in
expenditures on goods and services and capital investment (Figure 5, Table 4). On staff’s
augmented measure of the fiscal balance, which includes off budget quasi-fiscal operations and
directed lending, however, a deficit of about 4 percent of GDP remained. For 2015, the official
government budget that was adopted in December again aimed at a budget surplus reflecting
the intention to save the temporary windfall of an estimated US$700 million that arises this year
from Russia’s agreement to waive oil duties. However, in light of the worsening of economic
conditions since the budget was passed, the authorities have announced that the budget will be
substantially revised. The staff’s augmented measure of the fiscal balance is projected to
deteriorate to a deficit of about 7 percent of GDP, mostly on account of expected recapitalization
needs of state-owned banks.

Policy discussion
13.
The staff pressed for a rapid further reduction of directed lending and tight wage
control. Staff welcomed the reduction of directed lending growth in 2014 but noted it remained
too high and urged the authorities to further reduce the flow of new lending to no more than
2 percent of GDP in 2015 and 1 percent of GDP in 2016 so as to contribute to the needed
reduction in domestic demand and external imbalances. Over the medium term, directed lending
should be phased out entirely to improve credit allocation and contain contingent liabilities. Staff
also recommended keeping nominal wages constant in 2015 to help curb demand and
consolidate the competitiveness gains from rubel depreciation. Such wage restraint should help
real wages adjust following the excessive growth of past years. Medium-term wage
developments should be closely linked to productivity growth.
14.
Staff recommended staying with the plan to save the oil-duty windfall in full. The
resulting 1.2 percent budget surplus should help bring down domestic demand and alleviate
financing constraints. Staff advised running an even larger surplus if directed lending was not
sharply reduced, so as to offset its effect on demand and help prepare for the implied contingent
liability. Further fiscal savings should be achieved over the medium term by containing growth of
the public sector wage bill and reducing subsidies and transfers.
15.
The authorities emphasized that given the financing constraints fiscal and
quasi-fiscal policies would tighten in 2015. They indicated they will not allow the growth of
real wages to exceed that of productivity this year, but were hesitant to implement the nominal
wage restraint recommended by staff in light of the shock to real wages that had already taken
place. The volume of new directed lending will also be cut as the authorities’ prioritize
investment projects with a high degree of completion over others to fit a substantially reduced
resources envelope for 2015. Whether the volume of new directed lending will meet staff’s
recommendations, however, depends critically on housing lending, the volume of which has yet
to be decided on. There are no plans for a further reduction of directed lending in 2016.
Regarding the headline fiscal balance, the authorities were concerned that the adverse external
environment and domestic downturn will result in additional revenue shortfalls that will make it
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

difficult to achieve the originally targeted surplus. They indicated nonetheless that the revised
budget, which remains under preparation, will aim to salvage a small surplus. To this end, the
draft budget envisages increases in excises, profit taxes for banks, and the income tax rate as well
as further expenditure cuts.

B. Monetary Policy: Facilitating Exchange Rate Adjustment and
Reducing Inflation
16.
Monetary policy has been uneven, amid stubbornly high inflation (Box 3). Policy
implementation remains hampered by an ineffective framework, inconsistent objectives, and the
disruptive impact of large-scale subsidized lending. In 2014, the NBRB gradually lowered policy
interest rates to lower the cost of credit but at the same time used quantitative controls and
moral suasion to engineer a significant slowdown in credit growth (Figure 6, Table 5–6). More
recently, policy rates were hiked (and then lowered again) in response to rubel pressures, but the
rate decisions were taken in an inconsistent manner with different policy rates moving in
opposite directions.
Box 3. Drivers of Inflation in Belarus
A study with this consultation investigates the factors behind the persistently high inflation in Belarus during
2012–14.1 It finds that price growth has been driven mostly by administrative price hikes and expansionary
polices. Exchange rate pass-through is likely to play a role in 2015.

x

Administrative prices. Regulated goods prices contributed on average about half to total inflation.
Administrative prices often rose faster than non-regulated prices, owing to the constant budgetary
pressures associated with large price subsidies.

x

Expansionary policies. Almost a third of inflation was associated with overly loose macroeconomic
policies such as excessive wage growth and high volumes of credit, which fueled domestic demand.

x

Exchange rate. The study finds a high pass-through coefficient of 0.4 to 0.6 for changes in the nominal
effective exchange rate. Exchange rate movements had a limited impact in recent years, however, as the
rubel was relatively stable. Given the recent devaluation, pass-through is expected to have a significant
impact on inflation in 2015.

1

See Selected Issues chapter “Inflation in Belarus.”

17.
With rubel adjustment likely uncompleted, the new nominally more flexible
exchange rate regime remains to be tested. Following the January devaluation, the NBRB
abandoned the prior crawling peg against the U.S. dollar and announced that exchange rate
policy will be guided by a currency basket comprising the Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. At the same time, the NBRB suggested that the new regime will allow more flexibility. The
emerging regime remains unclear, however. Reserve losses have continued and while rubel
volatility vis-à-vis the dollar has notably increased, the exchange rate against the new basket has
been very stable since mid-January. The latter is remarkable in light of the wider turbulence in
international FX markets during this period and given staff estimates that the rubel, at its present

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

level, remains significantly overvalued (Box
4). Meanwhile, to curb high dollarization, the
authorities banned the use of FX for a range
of domestic transactions.

intention to make the exchange rate more
flexible. It emphasized, however, that to save reserves and ensure adequate adjustment of the
exchange rate in a volatile external environment, the NBRB should rapidly complete the
transition to a free float and remove remaining impediments to the proper functioning of the FX
market. Staff also recommended that the NBRB fully implement, without further delay, a basemoney targeting framework (in line with Fund technical assistance advice) that is squarely
focused on bringing inflation rapidly down to single digits. Ensuring adequately tight money
targets would also provide support for the exchange rate. Reduced scope for one-way bets
under the free float and enhanced inflation control under the money-targeting framework would
help reduce incentives for dollarization.
19.
The NBRB agreed but underscored that the exchange rate regime was quite
flexible. It explained that under its new regime interventions were made only to limit daily
volatility and without obstructing trend shifts in rubel valuation. The NBRB argued that despite its
stability the exchange rate had correctly reflected demand and supply in recent months. The
receding pressures were explained by seasonally stronger trade accounts and FDI in the first
quarter and by a dissaving trend among crisis-hit households who sold FX holdings to
supplement their reduced household incomes. In contrast to staff, the authorities (both in and
outside the NBRB) assessed the current exchange rate level as being broadly in equilibrium and
did not anticipate significant further exchange rate adjustment in the remainder of the year. To
anchor monetary policy, the NBRB indicated it would be shifting to a money targeting framework
as recommended by staff, although the precise timeline was unclear and the current monetary
policy guidelines continued to also include targets for a range of other variables, including
inflation and interest rates.

Box 4. Belarus: External Stability Assessment
A CGER-type assessment suggests that the rubel remains significantly overvalued.
After recent depreciation, the real value of the rubel is back at the level of last spring. Inflation
differentials and rapid depreciation of the Russian ruble and the euro caused the rubel REER to appreciate
by about 20 percent in the year to December 2014. However, the sharp depreciation of the rubel since late
December (about 40 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and about 20 percent on a nominal effective basis) has
largely undone this real appreciation. The current real value of the Belarusian rubel is therefore close to that
at the time of the previous exchange rate assessment during the 2014 Article IV Consultation.
An updated CGER assessment follows the methodology
of the 2014 Article IV consultation.1

x

The Macroeconomic Balance approach estimates a
slightly declining gap between the current account and

The External Sustainability approach indicates a gap of

An assessment based on wage differentials supports the
CGER findings. GDP per capita and hourly labor cost in
U.S. dollars show a strong positive correlation across CESEE
countries. Belarus’ deviation from the equilibrium level implied
by this cross-country relationship suggests that at the current
exchange rate labor costs in Belarus remain significantly
higher than fundamentals would warrant.

high degree of state control in the Belarus economy and
related administrative interference with price formation have significantly weakened price signals relative to
a market based economy. Moreover, the assessment is highly sensitive to the volatile developments of the
Russian ruble (with a 45 percent weight in the NEER) and the euro (30 percent). The ongoing adjustment of
these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar introduces considerable additional uncertainty.

C. Banking Sector: Maintaining Financial Stability
20.
Risks in the banking sector have further increased. Weaknesses in Belarus’ majority
state-owned banking system are difficult to monitor owing to regulatory forbearance and
pervasive evergreening of government-directed lending. However, banks are under increasing
pressure from the weak macroeconomic environment, high interest rates, and the recent
exchange rate adjustment in a context of high loan dollarization. In addition, banks face rising

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

funding risks related to jittery depositors and the weakening of Russian banks (responsible for
almost half of interbank funding flows). Nonperforming loans jumped to 5.2 percent in February
and a further worsening is expected (capital adequacy ratios remained at a relatively high level
due to a reduction in the risk weight for FX assets, back to 100 percent from 150 percent earlier).
Also, a small private bank was recently intervened. The dollar-indexed deposits that expanded
from late December are a specific source of risk, although their volume is small (around 4 percent
of household’s local currency deposits) and the practice has been largely discontinued.
21.
The structural evolution of the financial sector also remains a source of major
concern. The Development Bank (DB), established in 2011 and originally envisaged as a
transitional vehicle to consolidate and wind down directed and subsidized lending, has instead
become an additional source of subsidized lending and is now the fourth largest bank in the
system. At the same time, the DB remains unsupervised and is not included in banking statistics.
Separately, the NBRB last year purchased Moscow-Minsk bank, the tenth largest bank in the
system, from VTB of Russia following failed attempts by VTB to sell it to a private investor. The
acquisition has created a conflict of interest between the NBRB’s role as supervisor and its role as
owner of this bank.

Policy discussion
22.
Staff recommended that the NBRB conducts a diagnostic study to assess asset
quality in the aftermath of the recent devaluation and interest rate hikes. Any detected
problems in banks should be addressed decisively, and undercapitalized banks should be either
recapitalized or resolved as soon as feasible. As recent events likely have lagged effects on
banking sector stability the NBRB should remain vigilant to any newly emerging risks.
23.
Staff also urged containing the activities of the Development Bank. With the DB
playing a growing role in the financial sector, the authorities need to ensure proper supervision
and regulation of its activities. In addition, they should devise a clear plan for the containment
and winding down of the operations of the DB, consistent with the full phase out of directed
lending. The staff also urged the NBRB to swiftly divest Moscow-Minsk Bank.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

24.
The authorities acknowledged the risks in the banking sector, but believed they
were contained. The NBRB was closely watching the banks, noting that they seemed to have
weathered the devaluation well owing to adequate buffers. Also, the NBRB, the government,
banks, and large corporate borrowers, had joined forces to analyze the situation of key
borrowers and to ensure continued financing to keep credit risks under control. The government
was also exploring the possibility of transferring some problem loans from subsidized lending
programs to the DB, and task the latter with optimizing the recovery on those assets. The
authorities agreed on the need to supervise the DB, but concrete plans had yet to crystallize. The
NBRB further indicated that it was unlikely to sell Moscow-Minsk Bank soon as the current
adverse environment limited the range of potential buyers. In the meantime, it believed that
Chinese walls established within the NBRB between the managers and supervisors of the bank
adequately addressed the potential conflict of interest between its respective roles.

D. Structural Reform: Fostering Resilience and Raising Potential Growth
25.
Progress on structural reform has been minimal. Deep reforms to reduce state
influence and enhance the market orientation of the economy, which would help improve
resource allocation and competitiveness, remain critical for medium-term sustainability. However,
reforms have stalled in recent years (Box 5). The main area where some advancement had been
made was price liberalization as the number of goods subject to price controls had been
gradually reduced in 2014. However, the outright ban on consumer price increases at the end of
the year effectively reversed this progress. Utility and transportation tariffs remain substantially
below cost recovery levels, in spite of several increases in 2014 and early 2015. Meanwhile, earlier
intentions to privatize selected companies have been mostly abandoned and no meaningful
privatization has taken place. The economy also remains burdened by pervasive
government-imposed targets for enterprises which set production volumes and other key
variables, thereby severely constraining companies’ business independence and flexibility.
Regional trade integration in the recently established Eurasian Economic Union is not expected
to have a large near-term impact on Belarus and will in any event require increased
competitiveness to yield full benefits (Box 6).

Policy discussion
26.
Staff urged the authorities to adopt and implement an ambitious, frontloaded
reform agenda. This agenda should be unambiguously aimed at enhancing the market
orientation of the economy and include decisive price liberalization, comprising a detailed,
time-bound plan to bring utility and transport tariffs rapidly to full cost recovery. It should also
envision the swift and complete phase out of mandatory targets for enterprises and contain
credible plans for large-scale privatization. Social safety nets should be strengthened to protect
the vulnerable, including by raising unemployment insurance at least to subsistence levels.

Box 5. Belarus: Structural Reforms—A Mostly Unfinished Agenda
Among all the economies in CEE, Belarus’ transformation to a market economy is by far the least advanced
and reforms have stalled for the past five years. There is urgency for market-based reforms in several key
areas to improve the competitiveness of the economy.
Privatization: Despite the efforts of the National Privatization
Agency (NIPA) and officially stated intentions to privatize
companies, no significant privatizations have taken place since
2011.

Price liberalization: price controls remain pervasive. Progress
was made in reducing the number of controlled “socially
important goods,” whose share in the CPI basket fell from
49 percent in 2011 to 25 percent in 2014. However, the
government retained the right to impose temporary price
controls and at end-2014 price increases were prohibited for all
goods and services.
Utility prices: The government has raised utility prices,
including as an element of conditionality under the ACF
program but they remain far below cost recovery levels. At
end-2014 the authorities devised a plan to reach full cost
recovery by end-2017 (for heating by 2020) but it remains
unclear how the plan will be implemented and phased.

exports to the customs union have not increased significantly. The impact of the EEU on trade creation is
unlikely to provide extra benefit in the short-run and medium-term effects will depend on how the Union’s
rules and regulations will be implemented.

The authorities acknowledged the necessity of structural changes but emphasized
the need for a very gradual approach. The authorities believe that the mindsets and skills of
workers, managers, and the population more generally will need considerable time to adapt to
change and that any rapid reforms would have a low chance of success. They also argued that
the current weak external and domestic economic environment was not conducive to
implementation of rigorous reforms. In this context, they believed that there was no scope for
privatizations in the short term, pointing to concerns about receiving a “fair price” for state
assets. Instead, the authorities’ reform plans focused primarily on improving incentives for
managers within the current state-controlled system, including by making official targets more
indicative and by prioritizing profit targets over other objectives. Separately, they envisaged
bringing utility and household tariffs to full cost recovery over a three year period but without a
specified timeline and with only small improvements planned for 2015. The effort also excluded
heating tariffs. The authorities indicated they are planning to gradually reorient their labor
market policies from protecting jobs to protecting incomes. In this context, technical assistance
to improve targeting of social assistance to vulnerable groups is being sought from the World
Bank.

FUND RELATIONS
28.
With the 2009–10 SBA fully repaid, the authorities reiterated their interest in a new
Fund program. Staff indicated that a program would require credible commitment at the
highest level to a comprehensive package of deep structural reform and consistent
macroeconomic policies. This package should include a fully flexible exchange rate, appropriately
tight macroeconomic policies, and bold, frontloaded structural reform.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Belarus remains highly vulnerable and a decisive reorientation of policies is needed
urgently. To promote stability and a sustainable recovery, macroeconomic policies need to focus
unequivocally on rapidly reducing external imbalances and lowering inflation.
30.
Directed lending needs to be rapidly further reduced. Last year’s reduction of directed
lending growth is welcome but should be built upon to further bring down the flow of new
lending in 2015 and 2016 so as to contribute to the needed reduction in domestic demand. Over
the medium term, directed lending should be phased out entirely to improve credit allocation
and contain contingent liabilities.
31.
Nominal wages should not rise further in 2015. This would help curb demand and
consolidate the competitiveness gains from rubel depreciation. It would also help make up for
excessive wage growth of past years. In the medium-term, wage developments should closely
follow productivity growth.

32.
Saving the oil-duty windfall in 2015 would imply a small surplus on the headline
fiscal balance. This would help curb domestic demand and alleviate financing constraints. A
larger headline surplus will be appropriate if directed lending is not sharply reduced, so as to
offset its effect on demand and help prepare for the implied contingent liability. Further fiscal
savings should be achieved over the medium term by containing growth of the public sector
wage bill and reducing subsidies and transfers.
33.
The exchange rate should be made fully flexible, and monetary policy tightened.
The authorities intention to make the exchange rate more flexible is welcome but to save
reserves and ensure adequate adjustment of the exchange rate in the volatile external
environment, it will be important to complete the transition to a free float soon. The NBRB
should also without further delay implement a money-targeting framework that is squarely
focused on bringing inflation to single digits.
34.
The banking system needs to be monitored closely in view of increasing risks.
Conducting a diagnostic study would be useful to assess the impact of recent events on asset
quality. Any detected problems in banks should be addressed decisively and undercapitalized
banks should be recapitalized or resolved as soon as feasible. To promote sound governance and
oversight of the system, arrangements need to be made for the supervision of the DB. Also, over
the medium term, its operations should be wound down, in line with the phase out of directed
lending. The NBRB should swiftly divest Moscow-Minsk Bank, including to resolve the conflict of
interest between its role as supervisor and its role as owner of this bank.
35.
Deep structural reform remains critical to promote sustainable growth and break
with the cycle of recurrent crises. The authorities should adopt and implement an ambitious,
frontloaded reform agenda. This agenda should include decisive price liberalization, comprising a
detailed plan to bring utility and transport tariffs rapidly to full cost recovery. It should also
prepare for the swift and complete phase out of mandatory targets for enterprises and contain
credible plans for large-scale privatization in the corporate and banking sectors. Social safety
nets, including unemployment insurance, should be strengthened to protect the vulnerable.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Relative

Looser macroeconomic

Medium

Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and
emerging economies

Impact if Realized

Policy Response

Likelihood

High

Geopolitical fragmentation in
Russia/Ukraine that erodes
the globalization process and
fosters inefficiency
Medium

Weakening economic
environment and exchange
rate adjustment could reduce
banks’ asset quality

High
Stimulus efforts would boost
demand and further fuel pressures
on the exchange rate and
inflation.

x

Tighten macroeconomic
policies including monetary,
wage, exchange rate, and
directed lending policies.

High/Medium
Slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies (Russia)
would produce negative spillovers
through trade, and remittances,
causing further current account
deterioration and raising external
financing needs.

x

Ensure adequate exchange
rate flexibility and tighten
monetary policy.

x

Tighten macroeconomic
policies to reduce external
imbalances.

x

Speed-up structural reforms
to improve competitiveness
of the economy and increase
potential output.

x

Intensify supervision and
oversight over large banks
including through more
frequent onsite monitoring.

x

Ensure that all banks in the
system comply with capital
adequacy norms and reserve
requirements.

x

Reduce new subsidized and
directed lending.

High
Recession and lower growth
prospects in Russia/Ukraine,
increase in risk aversion, and
higher interest rates would
produce negative spillovers.
Tensions could also affect support
from Russia (in negative or
positive way).
Medium
Potential state-owned bank
recapitalization costs could be
substantial and deteriorate public
debt dynamics.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

1/ Projections are shown at the official exchange rate.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal
appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBI.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - ȷ (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessments:
Voluntary (non-program related) assessment of the NBRB was completed in April 2004. The
assessment concluded that significant vulnerabilities existed in the safeguards framework, especially
in the areas of the legal structure and independence, external and internal audit, and in financial
reporting. The assessment made specific recommendations to correct the identified shortcomings.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

An updated assessment of the NBRB, which was completed in May 2009 in connection with the
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved on January 12, 2009, found little progress in addressing
previously identified vulnerabilities. The assessment determined that risks have increased since the
voluntary 2004 assessment and recommended the following measures:


Adopting a new law that provides operational and financial independence for the NBRB to ensure
the effectiveness of the NBRB’s internal and external audit mechanisms and the control systems,



Conducting special audits of NIR and NDA data to reduce the risk of misreporting,



Divesting the NBRB’s investment in non-financial subsidiaries, and



Publishing the audited IFRS financial statements.

The NBRB implemented only some of the recommendations. Special audits of NIR and NDA data for
March, June, September and December 2009 test dates were completed. The NBRB divested most of
its non-financial subsidiaries in 2011, but also increased involvement in quasi-fiscal activities, e.g., in
the first half of 2011 the NBRB purchased bonds issued by domestic banks at higher than market
prices and subsequently sold them to the Development Bank to acquire bonds issued by the latter.
While the new Banking Law provides some improvement over its previous version, NBRB autonomy is
still undermined, in particular, by powers of the President to amend the NBRB Statute at any time, to
direct NBRB operations by his decrees, and to dismiss Board members.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Belarus is the Belarusian rubel, which was introduced in 1994.
The de jure exchange rate regime is managed float. Starting from the last quarter of 2012, the
Belarusian rubel has followed a gradually depreciating trend with a 2 percent band. Therefore, the de
facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified from other managed to crawl-like
arrangement, effective September 19, 2012.
Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement
on November 5, 2001.
An Article VIII mission took place in 2013 and identified exchange restrictions and multiple currency
practices (MCPs) subject to the Fund’s jurisdiction. The exchange restrictions arise from the
requirement of an NBRB permit for (i) advance payments for imports and (ii) payments for imports
with delivery outside of Belarus. The MCPs arise from (i) the potential deviation by more than two
percent of the exchange rates in the over-the-counter (OTC) market and the Belarusian Currency and
Stock Exchange (BCSE); (ii) the potential deviation by more than two percent of the exchange rates in
the OTC market and the BCSE exchange rate or the official exchange rate with respect to the
mandatory resale of unused foreign exchange by resident legal entities and foreign exchange
amounts subject to mandatory sale requirement; and (iii) broken cross rates among the currencies for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

which the NBRB establishes official exchange rates with monthly frequency with respect to the
mandatory resale of unused FX by resident legal entities and FX amounts subject to mandatory sale
requirement.
Based on the mission’s recommendations, the NBRB developed and approved a plan to eliminate all
restrictions in the near future. Legislative amendments to this effect are in process. Also, staff is
currently assessing the implication of measures taken by the authorities with regard to the MCPs
arising from the mandatory resale of unused foreign exchange by resident legal entities and foreign
exchange amounts subject to mandatory sale requirement. The authorities have indicated that the
remaining issues will be revisited in the second quarter of 2015. At this time, the authorities do not
request Board approval of the identified exchange restrictions and MCPs. The staff supports the
authorities’ plans to eliminate the remaining measures and encourages them to implement these as
soon as possible.
UFR/Article IV Consultation:
Belarus is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
April 28, 2015. The report was published:
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41782.0.
Stand-By Arrangement:
A 15-month SBA in the amount of SDR 1.6 billion (US$2.5 billion, 418.8 percent of quota) was
approved by the Executive Board (Country Report No. 09/109) on January 12, 2009. An augmentation
of the SBA was approved on June 29, 2009 in conjunction with the completion of the first review
(Country Report No. 09/260), bringing the Fund’s financial support to SDR 2.3 billion (US$3.5 billion,
587.3 percent of quota). The final review was completed on March 26, 2010. Total disbursements
under the program amounted to SDR 2.3 billion (US$3.5 billion).
FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:
Two FSAP missions took place in 2004 and an FSSA report was published on

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. The World Bank Group Strategy
1. The World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2014–17 was
discussed by the WBG Board of Executive Directors in June 2013. The CPS supports Belarus to
improve: (1) competitiveness of the economy by supporting structural reforms, including reducing the
role of the state, transforming the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, promoting private and
financial sector development and integration into the global economy; (2) quality and efficiency of
public infrastructure services, use of agricultural and forestry resources and global benefits of public
goods; and (3) human development outcomes through better education, health and social services.
The WBG program includes Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), investment lending by the World
Bank and investments in the private sector by the IFC.
2. WBG lending is focused on investment lending in sectors with an adequate and improving
policy framework, a sufficient knowledge base, a solid implementation track record and
demonstrated Government commitment. The CPS envisages new investment lending, totaling up
to US$570 million during 2013–15. Lending operations will support investments in private sector
development, public financial management (PFM) systems, forest management, energy efficiency,
district heating, water supply/sanitation, education, and transport.
3. The WBG also supports a program of analytical and advisory activities. Core diagnostics
around critical developmental issues will continue, including structural reforms, fiscal, PFM, trade,
WTO accession, private and financial sector development. These advisory and technical
engagements—many of them of a programmatic nature—will underpin the policy dialogue in critical
reform areas, supporting the government in designing and implementing policies to achieve stated
objectives of economic modernization and strengthened competitiveness. Analyses in such areas as
municipal services, forestry, education and health will underpin future investment operations.
4. The WBG’s program in Belarus will be calibrated according to the depth, breath and speed
of structural reforms. Accordingly, the AAA and lending programs have been identified only for the
first two years of the CPS. Should structural reforms accelerate, lending scope and instruments could
be revisited at mid-term of the CPS period.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

5. The IFC will support private sector development and energy efficiency improvements
through a combination of investments and advisory work. The IFC program in Belarus will
support: (i) trade development in critical sectors such as agriculture, with strategic focus on small and
medium-sized exporters and importers; (ii) micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises’ (MSMEs)
access to finance; (iii) investments into energy efficiency improvements; and (iv) advisory work on
regulatory simplification, including in agriculture and forestry. Agriculture will remain a priority sector,
with support directed at improvements in agricultural output and efficiency, access to finance,
regulatory environment, and food safety standards.

B. IMF-World Bank Group Collaboration in Specific Areas
6.
The WBG and the Fund teams will continue to work closely in delivering their assistance.
The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the WBG focuses on the structural reform agenda,
business regulatory environment and investment climate, energy efficiency, infrastructure and social
and environmental issues. Recent examples of close cooperation and coordination between the Bank
Group and the Fund include ongoing discussions under the IMF post program monitoring and Article
IV Consultations and during the preparation of the WBG CPS, and joint work with the government
working group on structural reforms issues.

Areas in Which the World Bank Group Leads
7.
Structural reforms and private business development. Under the CPS, the Bank will continue
to support the design and implementation of structural reforms through its programmatic structural
reform technical assistance. This programmatic TA which will be implemented through 2016 is
focused on providing targeted analytical and advisory support on structural reforms, including further
liberalization of factor and product markets to support a more efficient allocation of resources in the
economy, transformation of the SOEs and enhancing private sector growth, including the services
sector. As part of this TA, the World Bank is also providing focused technical assistance to support
Belarus’ WTO accession. In addition, the WBG is implementing a privatization TA (which was initiated
during the previous CPS and is largely funded through a donor Trust Fund) to provide advice on legal
and institutional instruments and implementation capacity to successfully launch an enterprise
privatization program that is on par with international best practice. The WBG has initiated a new
private sector development TA which supports the Government in establishing an effective system for
the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, the IFC will continue to deliver an
active advisory program around challenges facing the private sector and international “best practices”
for improving the regulatory environment and investment climate.
8.
Public Financial Management. The WBG will continue to provide technical assistance to
improve public financial management systems in Belarus. During the previous CPS work has been
initiated on strengthening the medium-term perspective in fiscal planning, enhancing debt
management and moving towards a more result-oriented budget management system. To assess the
current state of PFM performance, the Bank has updated the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment. The PEFA is a key diagnostic to underpin the preparation of the
planned PFM modernization investment loan to improve transparency and efficiency of public
financial management and strengthen accountability of the Government for the use of public funds.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

9.
Energy Sector. Currently, two energy efficiency projects are being implemented in Belarus with
World Bank’s financial support: Energy Efficiency Project (EEP) (US$215 million), and Biomass District
Heating Project (US$90 million).
10. Road Transport. The Road Upgrading and Modernization Project (US$150 million) is aimed at
developing Belarusian transport infrastructure on a strategic route, the Trans-European Transport
Corridor IX, connecting the Black Sea with the Baltic countries. A new Transit Corridor Improvement
Project (US$250 million) is under preparation.
11. Environment. The Bank supports Belarus’ efforts in strengthening its environment institutions,
addressing key public health challenges, and complying with its international commitments. Progress
is being made towards achieving improved water, wastewater and solid waste management services
under the Water Supply and Sanitation Project (US$60 million) and Solid Waste Management Project
(US$42.5 million). Additional Financing Loan (US$90 million) to enhance the impact of the Water
Supply and Sanitation Project has been approved.

Areas of Shared Responsibility
12. Macroeconomic development. The two institutions discuss and consult with each other in the
preparation of macroeconomic framework and debt sustainability analysis, as well as in the
preparation of analytical pieces on macro-growth issues.
13. Public expenditure management. Building on the recently completed PER 1 and 2, the Bank will
continue to focus on improving the efficiency of public spending. The first two volumes of the
programmatic Public Expenditure Review focused on spending efficiency in agriculture, energy, social
assistance, pension sectors, intergovernmental fiscal relations, and the efficiency of public spending in
health and education. The Bank will continue to provide targeted analytical and advisory services to
support fiscal reforms within a consistent macroeconomic framework, to ensure fiscal and debt
sustainability and to provide for growth supporting expenditure and revenue policies. Integrating
recommendations of the two volumes, the Bank will deliver a synthesis report on fiscal reforms. The
Fund, jointly with the Bank, has been working on supporting the authorities in their fiscal
consolidation effort, including TA on expenditure rationalization.
14. Financial sector. The Bank and the Fund will jointly support the authorities in addressing key
vulnerabilities in the financial sector and designing needed reforms. The Bank and the IMF are
collaborating in financial sector monitoring, including on key developments, such as the newly
established Development Bank. The World Bank will maintain an active dialogue with the authorities
on financial consumer protection and financial literacy and the overall development of the financial
sector, including through a joint FSAP Development Module, completed in May 2014.

Areas in which the IMF Leads
15. The IMF is actively engaged with the authorities in discussing their macroeconomic program
and policies, providing TA and related support, including support on economic and financial statistics,
monetary operations, public financial management, and fiscal transparency. The IMF is leading the
dialogue on monetary and exchange rate policies, and overall fiscal policies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

16. The IMF analysis in these areas serves as an input to the Bank’s policy advice. The Bank and the
IMF teams have regular consultations, and Bank staff takes part in selected IMF missions. This helps to
ensure consistency of policy recommendations by the two institutions.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 1, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts:
The National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus (BelStat) compiles and disseminates
quarterly and annual GDP estimates at current and constant prices The quality of the estimates is
good, and the timeliness and periodicity exceed the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
requirements. In addition to the quarterly and annual estimates, a monthly GDP is compiled 15 days
after the end of the reference month. The BelStat compiles annually a full set of accounts (up to the
financial accounts), institutional sector accounts, and input-output tables. Since 2008 Belstat has been
compiling regional GDP estimates. The accuracy of the source data is good, and the statistical
techniques used are sound. The national accounts estimates are internally consistent, and they are also
consistent with other macroeconomic statistics. All other real sector data are disseminated in
accordance with the SDDS requirements.
Belarus participates in the STA project for the Sustainable Compilation of Real Sector Statistics in
Eastern Europe, funded by the government of Japan, and receives technical assistance and support
from a statistics advisor resident in Moldova. BelStat has made good progress to date implementing
the concepts and methods of the 2008 SNA and to improve the compilation of the national accounts
as needed.
Price Statistics:
The CPI covers 31 towns and the PPI covers approximately 1,800 industrial organizations. They are
published monthly. The NSC also publishes indices for foodstuffs, nonfood goods, and services. CPI
weights are based on expenditure data from 2012, while the PPI is based on weights from 2011. For
the most part, Belstat is producing the CPI and PPI in accordance with international standards and
best practices as noted in the CPI and PPI Manuals. They also are in compliance with SDDS
standards, including updating their metadata for the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
on an annual basis.
Government finance statistics:
Government finance statistics are compiled in broad compliance with the recommendations of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Areas that need improvement include
classification of some expenses (e.g., subsidies to corporations, social benefits to households, capital
transfers to corporations); inconsistency between GFS and monetary data; valuation of assets and
liabilities (at nominal or market value); and compilation for public corporations.
Monetary statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics are compiled by the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB),
broadly following the methodology of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The
NBRB has implemented most of STA recommendations regarding monetary statistics.
External sector statistics:
The NBRB publishes quarterly balance of payments and international investment position statements
in the BPM5 format (for 1996–2011) and in the BPM6 format since 2012 (revised data available
from 2000). Overall the timeliness and serviceability of external sector data is satisfactory.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Belarus subscribed to the Special Data
A data ROSC report was published on
Dissemination System (SDDS) on
February 1, 2005.
December 22, 2004 and met all SDDS
requirements at the time of subscription.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Mr. Canakci, Executive Director for the Republic of Belarus; Mr. Just,
Alternate Executive Director; and Mr. Misyukovets, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 13, 2015

The Belarusian authorities appreciate the useful dialogue with the Fund management and staff
during the 2015 Article IV Consultation and the Spring Meetings. Since they fully associate
themselves with the staff’s assessment of macroeconomic developments and the
recommendations on economic and financial policies, we will elaborate on the recent
developments and the authorities’ policy response to the current and emerging challenges.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
In 2014-2015, Belarus has been facing strong combined exogenous shocks. After slowing for
three consecutive years, economic growth recovered to 1.6 percent during 2014, driven
moderately by domestic demand and some improvement in net exports, albeit mainly due to
sharply declining net imports. The economic slowdown in Russia, mutual sanctions between
Russia and the European Union, tensions in Ukraine and accelerated currency depreciation in
Russia and Ukraine have sharply weakened external demand in these key export markets which
together receive 70 percent of Belarus’ non-mineral exports. Even though the rubel lost
60 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar between February 2014 and February 2015,
Belarus has also lost competitiveness against these two countries, with the Russian ruble and
Ukrainian hryvnia depreciating even more over the same period. A sharp decline in oil prices in
the second half of 2014 has had a double adverse effect through further contraction of demand
for Belarusian commodities in Russia and lower than expected revenues from the export of
refined oil products. In addition, a rapid weakening of the Russian ruble in late 2014 heightened
depreciation expectations that triggered additional demand for foreign exchange.
Despite the efforts to address inflationary pressures by containing liquidity and credit
growth, inflation remained high and reached 16.2 percent in 2014 (December-on-December)
fueled by the need to increase regulated utility and public transport tariffs, fiscal revenue
enhancing measures (increases of excise taxes), and rubel depreciation. Following a 25 percent
depreciation of the rubel in response to growing pressures on the balance of payments, inflation
spiked in January 2015. That being said, no acceleration of inflation was observed in the first
quarter, and the annualized inflation for 2015 is projected to be at the same 16.2 percent level as
a result of the authorities’ tight macroeconomic policies.
Fiscal policy continued to be prudent despite adverse developments. Lower-than-projected
growth rates, declining external trade, and a deterioration in enterprises’ financial performance
brought about a sizeable central government budget revenue shortfall of 1.5 percent of GDP in
2014. Nevertheless, the consolidated budget in 2014 reported a surplus of 1 percent of GDP as a
result of stringent fiscal consolidation measures.
Owing to tighter macroeconomic policies, the current account deficit narrowed
considerably from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 6.7 percent of GDP in 2014. In
January-February 2015, merchandise exports contracted by 29.4 percent in dollar terms
compared to the same period a year earlier, while imports dropped by 36.1 percent. As a result,

2
the trade balance in goods and services turned positive ($0.7 billion). Merchandise exports to the
CIS, including Russia, declined by 40.2 percent, reflecting continued weak demand for
manufactured goods. Exports to the non-CIS decreased by 16.8 percent y-o-y, including to the
EU by 24.2 percent, mainly due to lower prices for oil products, the key export item.
Real GDP is likely to decline in 2015 due to weak external demand and subdued oil prices,
as well as owing to domestic demand compression in line with the authorities’ stabilization
policy. Russia’s economy is likely to contract considerably in 2015 and output will be much
weaker in Ukraine. With refined oil accounting for one sixth of industrial output and for more
than a third of Belarus’ exports, low oil prices will affect the external accounts, fiscal revenues,
and, as a result, growth. On balance, real GDP in Belarus may decline by about 3.5 percent in
2015. Although Belarus will retain oil customs duties from 2015 onwards under a new energy
trade agreement with Russia, shortfalls in export revenues, and foreign exchange denominated
debt repayment and servicing needs will exacerbate balance of payment pressures. The
weakening economy will affect real wages and may lead to higher unemployment, posing
poverty risks.
Macroeconomic Policy Response
The new Government and Management of the National Bank pursue policies aimed at
macroeconomic balancing and reasonable restraint of domestic demand. To address the external
pressures and domestic imbalances, the Belarusian authorities have elaborated and started to
implement a powerful package of economic policy measures aimed at compressing domestic
demand, restoring macroeconomic stability, and creating conditions for resuming sustainable
economic growth through the implementation of deep structural reforms. The new
macroeconomic framework hinges on a tight monetary and fiscal stance, exchange rate
flexibility, market-determined credit supply, and productivity-based wage dynamics.
Monetary and interest rate policies are clearly aimed at slowing down inflation. To achieve
this objective, the authorities have tightened up control over money supply and will limit broad
money supply growth to 30 percent on a December 2014 to December 2015 basis. The
refinancing rate was increased from 20 percent to 25 percent in January 2015 and may be revised
upwards as necessary to remain in real positive territory. Deposit interest rates are kept positive
in real terms and lending activities are managed using standard market toolkits. In the context of
currency depreciation, growing tax rates, and administrative price liberalization – including the
prices of natural monopolies – inflation is likely to stay in the double digits in 2015, but the
authorities believe that monetary targeting will allow for a single-digit core inflation from
2016 onward.
A more flexible exchange rate regime has been in place since January 2015, which envisages
minimizing foreign exchange interventions, while allowing wider exchange rate fluctuations, as
initial steps towards a floating exchange rate as an ultimate goal. As a result, net interventions of
the National Bank in the foreign exchange market have been brought virtually to zero, while the
rubel depreciated by 17.4 percent against the basket of currencies (comprising the U.S. dollar

3
and the euro at 30 percent each, and the Russian ruble at 40 percent).1 A notable depreciation of
the real exchange rate of the rubel took place, thereby improving price competitiveness of the
Belarusian merchandise. The achieved stability allowed the authorities to lower surrender
requirements for exporters to the pre-crisis 30 percent level and to make arrangements for
liberalizing the foreign exchange market further, including reopening of the over-the-counter
market. Coupled with measures to contain wage growth and fiscal consolidation, the new
exchange rate regime caused a rapid reversal of the market sentiment—in March, the volume of
net sale of foreign exchange by households amounted to $244 million, or 3.7 times as much as in
February. The balance of trade in foreign exchange of corporate market participants was at zero,
with sales and purchases of $4.5 billion each. In April, net sale of foreign exchange by
individuals and enterprises continued to grow and international reserves reported a moderate
increase.
The financial system is broadly stable, although weaknesses emerged in some banks. The
Belarusian financial system weathered the crisis relatively well and is broadly in compliance
with prudential standards, but weak economic activity, policy tightening, and significant
depreciation resulted in an increase in nonperforming loans which stood at 1.9 percent of the
loan portfolio as of March 1, some deterioration of asset quality, and reduction of profitability. In
view of these developments, the authorities are exercising continuous monitoring of transactions
in the banking sector, with a specific focus on credit risk, and of financial sustainability of banks
on the basis of Basel III recommendations.
The consolidated budget for 2015 envisions a surplus of 1.7 percent of projected GDP.
However, slower economic growth, lower oil prices, weakening rubel, and a higher refinancing
rate strongly impact fiscal performance. The authorities firmly aim at maintaining a budget
surplus and have made a sizable fiscal adjustment to sustain the revenue base and to contain nonpriority expenditures. As a result, the general government budget in the first quarter of 2015 was
executed with a surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP. As of January 1, 2015, Belarus’ government debt
was at a safe level of 22.3 percent of GDP. The government has met all of its debt obligations,
including making the last repurchase under the 2009–10 Stand-By Arrangement on March 31,
2015, and is confident of its ability to honor all external and domestic debt obligations, although
2015 will be a challenging year, with foreign exchange denominated government debt repayment
and servicing needs of $3.8 billion. In terms of refinancing, about $0.7 billion may be mobilized
in the domestic market and the Russian authorities have committed to advance further support to
help refinance Belarus’ upcoming debt payments to Russia, with the first tranche of $110 million
provided in April. Since there are no technical obstacles to tapping international financial
markets and investors have demonstrated strong interest in a new Eurobond, the authorities stand
ready to issuing new sovereign debt as soon as the market allows for borrowing at a reasonable
cost.

The rubel depreciated by 24.5 percent against the U.S. dollar, by 16.6 percent against the euro, and by
13.5 percent against the Russian ruble in January-March. In April, the rubel depreciated further by 3.5 percent to the
basket, including by 14.6 percent to the Russian ruble, with an appreciation by 1.3 percent to the U.S. dollar and by
5.5 percent to the euro.

4
During the first quarter of 2015, the Government and the National Bank have lifted most of
the earlier temporary restrictions. All limitations have been removed in the foreign exchange
market, liberalization of foreign exchange regulation is steadily progressing, and work is well
underway to introduce an exchange rate fixing mechanism on the “continuous order matching”
basis. All administrative price restrictions have also been eliminated, while the general price
policy is moving towards full liberalization. In addition, all output targets for SOEs have been
abolished and replaced with indicative and qualitative ones, such as profit, value-added per
worker and efficiency.
The mechanism to align wages and productivity has yielded impressive results. Real wages
in 2014 grew by only 0.3 percent as compared to 16.4 percent in 2013. In January-March 2015,
real wages decreased by 3.1 percent against January-March 2014. For the first time in many
years, a decrease in household income in real terms is planned for full year 2015 as a necessary
condition for macroeconomic stabilization undertaken by Belarus’ authorities.
A more stringent approach to financing government programs is in place. Lending under
government programs for 2015 has been downsized by 36.7 percent as compared to earlier plans,
focusing mainly on the projects that are at least 80 percent ready. Starting from February 2015,
lending for new government projects has been provided solely through the Development Bank.
To mitigate the vulnerabilities of the banking sector and enhance its attractiveness to foreign
investors, it is planned to purchase certain problematic assets from commercial banks for budget
funds and transfer those to the Development Bank for management. It should be noted that the
net increase in lending under government programs in 2015 (without accounting for exchange
rate fluctuations) will be 2 percent of GDP. For 2016, this ratio will decrease further to 1 percent
of GDP.
Structural Reform Agenda
Coupled with tight and stability-oriented macroeconomic policies, deep and consistent
structural reforms are required to correct economic imbalances and unleash Belarus’
growth potential. The authorities, in close cooperation with the World Bank, have elaborated a
package of consistent, interrelated policies. These measures have been supported by the World
Bank. Increasing the competitiveness of the Belarusian economy requires productivity led
growth, which in turn necessitates reallocating labor and capital to high productivity segments,
transforming the SOE sector, and implementing reforms to support and expand the private
sector.
The reform agenda embraces the following key areas.


Creating efficient financial markets to improve allocation of capital. The first issue to
address in the financial sector is to remove imbalances in the credit market through a
reduction – and ultimately elimination – of subsidized lending under government
programs in order to ensure equitable allocation of resources across the economy. Work
is underway on the preparation of the following policy steps in this area: (i) creating and
enforcing legal foundations for macro prudential supervision of the Development Bank;
(ii) curtailing the growth of outstanding debt under preferential loans.; (iii) improving
competition and governance in the banking system by strengthening international

5
corporate governance standards and attracting on this basis reputable foreign investors
into the sector, including through divestiture of state ownership in commercial banks.
Concurrently, measures to deepen the capital and non-bank financing markets will be
implemented through improving the regulatory environment and upgrading the existing
infrastructure in the securities and insurance markets.


Facilitating a dynamic labor market for a more efficient labor reallocation and
placement of robust social safety nets. Along with the shift toward a more efficient and
market-based economic growth model, social protection and labor market policies will
also change. In order to mitigate negative social consequences caused by structural
transformation, the authorities are aiming at moving away from protecting jobs to
protecting income of workers and their ability to earn income, enabling them to transit to
new, more productive jobs and find higher returns on skills. This will require designing
and implementing new mechanisms to support the temporary unemployed during their
transition to new jobs. Safety net programs will partially be financed by savings from
optimization and respective changes of budget expenditures.



The reform of state-owned enterprises is critical to the success of the government’s
economic program, contributing to medium-term fiscal consolidation efforts, as well as
to economic recovery through improved economic efficiency. Changing the incentives in
the state-owned sector requires a multifaceted strategy. First, state support and subsidies
will be rationalized to impose market discipline and incentives on enterprises. Second,
the imposition of hard budget constraints will be accompanied by modernized approaches
to managing enterprises and by corporate governance practices that strengthen their
commercial autonomy and enhance investors’ interest. On this basis, a well-sequenced
strategy of privatization of small- and medium-sized companies will be an initial
important factor of mobilization of domestic and international investment and bringing in
technological and management changes.



Facilitating private sector growth and job creation through improvements in the
investment climate. Further efforts will be made to improve the business climate and
regulatory quality, aiming at ensuring consistent, predictable and efficient enforcement.
Cross cutting reforms of the business climate will be accompanied by catalytic support to
accelerate the development of the SME sector.



Creating efficient product and service markets. The remaining direct controls of prices
for socially important goods are gradually eliminated, along with indirect modes of
interference, to allow for price formation based on market principles. In markets with
natural monopolies, such as the utility sector, tariff setting will become cost-reflective in
the medium run.

A detailed roadmap for structural reform and an implementation matrix have been presented to
the Fund staff.

6
Collaboration with Multilateral Partners
Concerted efforts of the authorities and international partners are essential to ensure that
reforms are mutually reinforcing and irreversible. In addition to the ongoing lending and
knowledge engagements in a variety of areas, financial support for the enhancement of
competitiveness, private sector development, and public financial management is in the World
Bank’s lending pipeline for Belarus. As an interim step in the privatization agenda, a
memorandum of understanding with the EBRD on the assistance in pre-privatization of the third
largest state-owned bank is ready for signing in the coming days during the Annual Meeting of
this institution. In addition, Belarus has applied for a new program of the Anti-Crisis Fund of the
Eurasian Economic Community, which would incorporate policy action across the
macroeconomic stabilization and structural transformation spectrum.
A Fund-supported program for Belarus would play a catalytic role in pursuing the change.
Financial support from the Fund would help solidify the gains of the adjustments, contribute to
building strong macroeconomic fundamentals, and create much needed buffers to address the
inevitable economic and social costs of reforms for faster implementation. Given that Belarus
has advanced considerably in macroeconomic stabilization and that the structural reform
program is currently being integrated in the draft strategy of social and economic development
for 2016-2020, the authorities reiterate their strong commitment to reform and would very much
appreciate the Fund’s early engagement in negotiations on a new program to ensure that the
program components be legislatively approved.
