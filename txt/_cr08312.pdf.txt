Executive Summary
Sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have delivered a prolonged
expansion, but the economy’s productive capacity has become increasingly stretched. A
commodity driven boom has pushed up against capacity constraints and inflation has
increased especially over the past year as resource pressures mounted. The authorities and
staff agreed that real GDP growth is likely to slow as required to ease inflation, and that the
outlook is more uncertain than usual. In the staff’s view, the balance of risk to growth lies on
the upside, stemming from an extraordinary jump in commodity export prices. On inflation,
the risks are clearly on the upside, reflecting capacity constraints, especially in the mining
and housing sectors.
With underlying inflation the highest in more than a decade, containing inflation
presents a significant challenge. A firm monetary policy stance is essential for keeping
medium-term inflation expectations well anchored. Given that the risks to inflation are on the
upside, the authorities and staff agreed that monetary policy should be tightened quickly if
leading indicators suggest that domestic demand will not slow as expected or the outlook for
inflation deteriorates.
Higher commodity export prices and capital inflows have contributed to the
appreciation of the currency, which in turn has eased inflation pressures. As of
June 2008, the staff estimated the real effective exchange rate (REER) to be about 10 percent
above its long-run equilibrium level. The authorities and staff agreed that the overvaluation is
temporary and that the currency is likely to fall back toward equilibrium over time as the
Reserve Bank of Australia reduces the cash rate once it is clear that inflation will moderate.
However, with a portion of the improvement in the terms of trade likely to be permanent, the
currency is expected to remain above its average for the last 10 years.
The new Labor Government stressed that the priority for this year’s budget is to help
fight inflation by constraining spending and increasing the surplus. Saving some of the
revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary
policy in the near term and enable increased infrastructure investment over the medium term.
The authorities agreed with the staff that if inflation persists at an elevated level, further
fiscal restraint may be needed.
Australia’s banks have demonstrated their soundness during the recent global financial
turmoil, but some vulnerabilities remain. The main impact of the crisis was a sharp
increase in funding costs, as banks had a small exposure to sub-prime assets. Although the
major banks were able to maintain access to funding from offshore markets, the turmoil
highlighted their vulnerability to rollover risks arising from short-term wholesale funding. In
response, banks are increasing their liquidity as well as lengthening the maturity of their
funding and diversifying the sources. The authorities are also taking measures to address
rollover risk by introducing new liquidity guidelines.

I. THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND COMMODITY PRICE BOOM
1.
Sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in Australia have
delivered more than 16 years of economic expansion, but the economy’s productive
capacity has become increasingly stretched. The pace of real GDP growth picked up in
2007 to more than 4 percent, driven by a commodity price boom in response to robust global
demand for iron ore and coal, especially from China. The commodity price boom has
elevated the terms of trade to its highest level since the Korean War and has boosted profits,
employment, and wages, which has helped cushion the impact of a severe drought and the
global financial market turmoil. However, the boom has pushed up against capacity
constraints, with unemployment falling to the lowest rate since the mid-1970s and capacity
utilization rising to historic highs in early 2008 (Table 1, Figure 1).

Inflation increased over the past year as resource pressures mounted. The
Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) measures of underlying inflation had been running close
to the top of its target of “2–3 percent, on average, over the economic cycle” for some years,
but rose to almost 4½ percent year on year in June 2008, the highest level in 16 years
(Figure 2). The inflation pressures are broad-based, reflecting an increase in tradables
inflation and wage growth.

The RBA responded to the rising inflation by tightening monetary policy. Since
2002, the gradual increase in the policy rate has been passed through into retail rates, but the
strength in the economy continued to surprise on the upside through end 2007 (Figure 3).
Despite the onset of financial market turbulence last year, which prompted policy easing in
many industrial countries, the underlying strength in the economy necessitated a renewed
RBA tightening cycle. Between August 2007 and March 2008, the policy rate was increased
by 100 basis points to 7¼ percent. In addition, higher funding costs from the global financial

6
turmoil have pushed up lending rates by a weighted average of around 60 basis points more
than the rise in the policy rate over the period August 2007–July 2008. Inflation expectations
have risen with the jump in food and energy prices, which has muted the impact of the recent
increase in the policy rate, with real interest rates now around the average for the past five
years. Nonetheless, credit growth has slowed sharply in recent months as tighter credit
standards have been applied by financial institutions.

The Commonwealth’s fiscal position has strengthened, but the states have begun
to run deficits. The Commonwealth government has run surpluses of around 1½ percent of
GDP in recent years, which has eliminated its net debt (Figure 4, Table 2). Revenue
outcomes have consistently surprised on the upside, driven by the stronger-than-expected
economy and buoyancy in corporate tax revenue related to the commodity boom. However,
increased spending and tax cuts over the last three years have offset some of the restraint
from the automatic stabilizers. In addition, the states have increased capital spending and
their budget balance has shifted to a deficit of about ½ percent of GDP in 2007/08.

The current account deficit widened in 2007 to more than 6 percent of GDP,
despite the commodity boom (Figure 5, Tables 3 and 4). The trade deficit deteriorated, as
export volume growth was constrained by drought disrupting rural exports and bottlenecks in
the export supply chain. Imports also grew strongly owing to buoyant domestic demand and
an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER). In addition, the investment

8
income deficit increased, reflecting higher interest payments on foreign debt and large
dividend payments, particularly from the resource sector. Net foreign liabilities rose to
67 percent of GDP at end-March 2008, mainly owing to an increase in foreign debt,
channeled primarily through financial institutions.

Australian banks have weathered the global financial turmoil reasonably well.
The four large banks that account for two-thirds of bank assets continued to report strong
profits through early 2008, together with adequate capital. While impaired assets are very
low (0.2 percent of assets), several large banks have increased their provisioning for bad
debts to reflect the potential impact of a downturn and rising interest rates (Figure 6). The
large banks have limited low-doc and nonconforming lending, with most of this activity
concentrated in the smaller banks and the nonbank sector.1 The smaller banks have a higher

Low-doc mortgages comprise 7 percent of total mortgages, and nonconforming (the equivalent of sub-prime)
an additional 1 percent.

impaired assets ratio (around ½ of a percent) than the four large banks, but this ratio is low
by international standards. Moreover, the smaller banks remain well capitalized, with the
aggregate capital ratio in excess of 10 percent.

The turmoil, however, highlighted the vulnerability of Australia’s financial
institutions to rollover risk. Sizable short-term funding from the wholesale market,
including from offshore, has resulted in an increase in funding costs (Box 1). Some of the
smaller financial institutions that relied more heavily on capital markets, particularly
securitization, for funding were more affected by the higher cost of funding than institutions
that had sizable deposit bases. As a consequence, the availability of home mortgages from
these institutions has fallen, especially for low-doc and sub-prime borrowers, and large banks
have increased their market share for prime mortgage lending. Corporates have issued fewer
bonds because of the turmoil, and instead have approached the banks for funding. This

protracted loss of access to international shortterm debt markets.
The global turmoil resulted in a sharp increase in funding costs in both domestic and offshore debt
markets. The spread between the 3-month bank bill rate and the overnight index swap (OIS) rate averaged
around 50 basis points in March–July 2008, compared to the average of 10 basis points in recent years.
Furthermore, credit default swap spreads for the major Australian banks widened sharply during the same
period, also indicating a higher cost of funding.
Despite the turmoil, the large Australian banks have maintained access to wholesale markets to
refinance themselves and to finance growth in their assets, albeit at significantly higher spreads. In
addition, they have been attempting to improve their liquidity, by attracting more deposits and issuing
short-term securities to one another (increasing the supply of eligible securities that can be used for repos
with the RBA).
Banks are also attempting to change their funding structure, by issuing longer-term securities
domestically and offshore, in particular through private placements of one-year extendible bonds in the
United States and through issuance of yen-denominated “samurai” bonds for the first time. However,
changing the maturity profile has been costly, as investors globally are demanding high premia for term
funding. As a result, the share of offshore wholesale funding has fallen by only 1¼ percentage point over
the period June 2007–May 2008, to 25½ percent of total liabilities, and the debt structure of Australian
banks remains predominantly short term.

business credit growth has declined in recent months with the increase in interest rates and
some tightening of credit standards.
II. HOW TO REDUCE INFLATION AND SUSTAIN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE?
8.
Discussion focused on the policies needed to reduce inflation associated with the commodity
boom and to maintain financial stability in the face of the global financial market turmoil.
A. Where is the Economy Heading?
9.
Baseline. The staff and authorities agreed that activity is slowing, and that the
outlook is more uncertain than usual because of large countervailing forces. Growth in
real domestic demand has begun to ease with the tightening of financial conditions, higher
energy and food prices, and a sharp decline in confidence (Figure 7). However, the
dampening effect of tighter credit conditions and slower trading partner growth is being
cushioned by an 80–240 percent jump in

should narrow to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2009
due to slower domestic demand growth, the jump in export prices, a rebound in rural exports,
and mining sector capacity coming on line.
10.
The staff viewed the balance of risk to growth is tilted toward the upside and
that the risks on inflation were clearly on the upside.

Upside Risks. Growth could exceed expectations, owing to the recent jump in
commodity prices, sizable immigration flows, and the increase in state infrastructure
spending (Figure 8). These factors could offset the impact of weaker consumer and
business confidence and support domestic demand. On inflation, the risks are clearly on
the upside. Capacity constraints, especially in the mining and housing sectors, could
push wage and CPI inflation higher than envisaged.

Cuts in personal income taxes that were introduced on July 1, 2008 will reduce revenue by about 2 percent of
GDP over the next four years. Further cuts in personal income taxes to be phased in from 2009/10 to 2011/12
will reduce revenue by about 1 percent of GDP over that period.

Downside risks. On the domestic front, activity could slow significantly if the
tightening in credit conditions apparent in the sharp fall in credit growth in recent
months has a greater-than-expected impact on domestic demand. In addition, farm
output may not rebound from the drought as projected. On the external front, a global
slump could weaken export demand and reduce commodity prices, although the oneyear contracts for iron ore and coal would delay the impact on the economy. Further
international financial turmoil could tighten credit conditions, leading to a sharperthan-expected slowing in global activity.

11.
The authorities viewed risks to the outlook for growth to be more balanced than
the staff. For growth, household spending may fall more than expected as consumer
sentiment has declined sharply in face of higher fuel prices and mortgage rates. The
authorities agreed that there is an upside risk to inflation, stemming from the extraordinary
jump in the terms of trade.

13
B. Appropriate Macroeconomic Policy Settings
Monetary Policy
12.
The staff advised that a firm monetary policy stance is vital for keeping mediumterm inflation expectations well anchored. With underlying inflation the highest in more
than a decade, containing inflation presents a challenge. The risk that wage inflation will rise
further if CPI inflation persists at current levels calls for the RBA to maintain a tight policy
stance until it is clear that inflation will abate. Reducing inflation back within the target range
will require a significant easing in domestic demand growth. Further tightening may be
necessary if the global financial market turmoil eases and business and consumer confidence
rebounds. In particular, the slowdown in the United States may not be as severe as projected
or the knock-on effects to the region may be limited (Box 2). With the risks to inflation on
the upside, the RBA should be prepared to tighten quickly if leading indicators suggest that
domestic demand will not slow as expected or the outlook for inflation deteriorates.
13.
The authorities agreed that a firm monetary policy stance was necessary. They
noted that the sequence of changes to the cash rate since August 2007, other adjustments by
lenders in response to the rise in funding costs, and tighter credit standards have combined to
produce financial conditions that were tight. The authorities considered that this tightening was
already resulting in slower growth in domestic demand. Moreover, they believed that the
tightening to date would be sufficient to reduce growth to below trend for the next two years
thereby easing capacity pressures and reducing inflation to less than 3 percent by end-2010.
They indicated that if the expected moderation in domestic demand does not occur or if
expectations of high ongoing inflation begin to affect wage and price setting they would not
hesitate to tighten policy further.
14.
The authorities remain fully committed to the inflation-targeting framework,
which has been subject to some public criticism in recent months. Several academics
have argued that inflation targeting is not well suited to dealing with negative shocks such as
the global increase in energy and food prices. The authorities have emphasized publicly that
there is no reason to believe that this shock cannot be handled by sensible implementation of
the RBA’s inflation-targeting framework. The staff and authorities agreed that the benefits of
the framework can be illustrated most clearly when there are large shocks to inflation.
Despite the pickup in short-term inflation expectations, the absence to date of a notable
acceleration in wage inflation demonstrates that the RBA’s inflation target has helped to
anchor medium-term inflation expectations.
15.
Recent steps to improve the transparency of monetary policy decision making
should enhance public understanding of monetary policy decisions. Since December 2007,
the RBA has published a statement explaining the board’s interest rate decision at the
conclusion of every policy meeting, regardless of whether the cash rate is changed. This is
followed two weeks later by the release of detailed meeting minutes.

Box 2. The Potential Impact on Australia of a U.S. Slowdown
Two models have been used to estimate the potential
impact of a U.S. slowdown: the IMF’s Global Economy
Model (GEM), calibrated to include Australia, and an
estimated small model of Australia and the United States.
The analysis is done in several steps. The first step looks at
the trade impact alone coming from weaker U.S. import
demand and the appreciation in the Australian dollar
resulting from lower U.S. interest rates. The second step
attempts to add the potential impact that could come through
other channels such as financial market linkages and
expectations. This is done by using the correlation between
U.S. GDP and Australian GDP from the small model (see
charts) to calibrate correlated shocks to private consumption
and investment demand outside the United States. The third
step holds the monetary policy rate in Australia unchanged
for the first year.

(Scenario 1). In 2008, GDP and inflation in Australia fall by
0.2 percent, allowing a 50 basis point easing in the policy interest rate. The impact dissipates quickly with
the economy back to baseline by 2010. The total potential impact based on the small model, however, is
larger (Scenario 2), reflecting the historical correlation. If the policy rate in Australia is not changed in the
first year in response to the slowdown, inflation falls by roughly 1.5 percentage points by the second year
(Scenario 3). Given the current rate of CPI inflation in Australia, such a decline would return inflation to the
top end of the RBA’s 2–3 percent target.

Because the estimation period for the small model starts in the early 1990s, the correlation between
Australian and U.S. GDP may be overstated. Over the period, Australia has become more integrated with
emerging Asian countries. As a result, the total simulated effect should be thought of as an upper bound on
what might occur.

Exchange Rate and External Stability

The appreciation of the Australian dollar in recent years has been driven by the
higher terms of trade and positive interest rate differentials. The stronger exchange rate
has eased inflation pressures directly

authorities agreed that the overvaluation
of the exchange rate is temporary, owing
to cyclical reasons. Over time, the
currency is expected to fall back toward equilibrium as the RBA reduces the cash rate once it
is clear that inflation will moderate. However, with a portion of the improvement in the terms
of trade likely to be permanent, the currency is expected to remain above its average for the
last 10 years.

The widening of the current account deficit in recent years and the buildup in
foreign debt has increased external vulnerability. The recent global financial turmoil
highlighted the rollover risks associated

2008 levels, and a depreciation of the
REER to equilibrium would narrow the current account further. In turn, this would slow the
accumulation of external liabilities and help to contain vulnerability.

The exchange rate is market-determined. In the past year, the RBA intervened to counter disorderly
movements in the exchange rate and to maintain sufficient net official reserves. Net official reserves increased
by $A 4 billion in the year to June 2008 and remained at about 1¾ months of imports. Gross official reserves
fell by almost $A 40 billion over the year to June 2008 as forward contracts expired. These contracts were used
for liquidity management.

16
Box 3. Australia’s Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate
Staff estimates suggest that the
Australian dollar was overvalued by
about 10 percent as of June 2008.1
These estimates are based on the
macroeconomic balance (MB)
approach, the equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) approach, and
the external sustainability (ES)
approach. The desk methodology is
outlined in Appendix I.
The baseline MB estimates suggest
an overvaluation of 7–9 percent over
the medium term, while the
overvaluation in 2008 is about
6½ percent. The estimates are subject
to significant uncertainty, as shown by
varying the projected underlying current
account deficit and changing the
elasticity of the current account balance
with respect to the REER. Plausible
sensitivity analysis suggests that the
overvaluation is about 2–22 percent.
The baseline ERER estimates suggest
an overvaluation of 7–12 percent. The
models attempt to explain the REER on
the basis of the terms of trade, relative
productivity, and relative government
consumption. An important determinant
is the terms of trade, with the
42 percent improvement over the past
five years contributing to an increase in
the equilibrium REER of about
15 percent. The overvaluation in 2008
is estimated at 10 percent, which
narrows slightly to 7 percent by 2013 as
the terms of trade is expected to rise.

The corresponding equilibrium value of the RBA’s real trade weighted index (TWI) is 128–135, assessed relative to an
estimate for June 2008 of 145. This estimate is based on real TWI data for March 2008 updated with TWI data through
June 2008. The nominal TWI index was at 73.4 as of end-June.

17
18.
The staff and authorities agreed that there are a number of factors mitigating
the external vulnerability. These include the limited currency risk associated with the
foreign debt, the sound banking system, and the strong economic policy and financial
supervision frameworks. About 40 percent of gross foreign debt is in Australian dollars, with
half of the remainder in U.S. dollars. Survey data suggests the bulk of the foreign-currencydenominated debt is hedged against currency risk. Moreover, less than 10 percent of the
gross debt is with the public sector, leaving most of the debt with financial institutions
(Table 6). Australia’s current account deficits largely reflect high investment rather than low
saving, and should be sustainable as long as investment leads to growth in export capacity.4
Fiscal Policy
19.
Fiscal policy, focused on medium-term sustainability, delivered a sequence of
surpluses that eliminated Commonwealth net debt. This leaves Australia with an enviable
fiscal position by international standards. The new Labor government aims to maintain a
conservative fiscal strategy by focusing on three objectives:
•

achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the medium term;

•

keeping tax as a share of GDP, on average, below the 2007/08 level (currently
estimated at 24.7 percent); and

•

improving the government’s net financial worth over the medium term.

20.
In the near term, the authorities stressed that the latest budget places priority on
helping to fight inflation and reprioritizing spending to build capacity. The 2008/09
budget slows the pace of growth of Commonwealth government expenditure and forecasts an
increase in the underlying cash surplus to 1.8 percent of GDP. This stance is slightly
contractionary, with the staff’s estimate of the structural balance increasing by ¼ percent of
GDP, broadly in line with the change in the underlying cash surplus (Figure 11). The budget
saves about half of the revenue surprise from the jump in the terms of trade and higher
nominal GDP.5 The remainder of the revenue surprise helps fund personal income tax cuts
targeted at lower income earners. Some other tax increases and expenditure cuts finance new
initiatives for health, education, climate change, and housing. Beyond 2008/09, spending is
projected to pick up and the underlying cash surplus is expected to fall slightly over the next
four years.

For outer years, about 1/3 of the revenue surprise is saved. The revenue surprise is calculated using the May
2007 budget projections as the baseline.

21.
The surpluses for 2007/08 and 2008/09 will be saved in three new funds for
infrastructure, health, and education to finance capital spending. About 3 percent of
GDP will be contributed to the funds, depending on the final budget outcomes and spending
from the funds is included in the budget. The funds are a means to constrain spending
revenue from the commodity boom in the near term, by saving for infrastructure spending
over the medium to long term.
22.
The staff advised that further fiscal restraint may be needed. The staff
encouraged the authorities to identify areas where additional spending cuts can be
implemented and to save any positive revenue surprises to assist monetary policy, until it is
clear that inflation will decline. Given the uncertainty about how much of the increase in
commodity prices will be permanent, saving the additional revenue in the near term may
avoid sharp changes in taxes and spending in the future. Moreover, state governments are
expected to run deficits and increase infrastructure spending, offsetting restraint at the
Commonwealth level.

19
23.
The authorities stated that if inflation pressures persist they would take the
necessary action to support monetary policy. They noted that the next budget would offer
another chance to constrain spending and direct it toward areas that are more productive,
such as education, health, and infrastructure. They also emphasized that they are committed
to saving any further positive revenue surprises in 2008/09. If there is a positive revenue
surprise in the 2009/2010 Budget and inflation remains high, the authorities indicated that
they would maintain tight controls on spending.
24.
To the extent that the improvement in the budget balance is structural,
associated with permanently higher commodity prices, there should be scope to reduce
taxes or increase spending over the medium term. Staff analysis suggests that a
combination of lower labor and capital income taxes, along with increased public investment,
will generate the largest economic gains.6 The gains from other options such as lower
consumption taxes or higher public consumption are not as large. Despite the expected
structural improvement in the medium term, significant long-term fiscal challenges remain,
particularly in the area of healthcare spending, and early adjustments will be key to
preserving fiscal sustainability.7
25.
The authorities noted that there would be scope to reform taxation and increase
spending in priority areas, if the recent gains in commodity export prices prove to be
permanent. The budget projections assume some easing in commodity prices over the
medium term from the record levels forecast for 2008/09. Nevertheless, in recent years the
authorities have been surprised by revenue on the upside, and commodity prices may not
ease as expected. The authorities made it clear that any changes in taxes and spending would
be consistent with the new government’s medium-term fiscal objectives, thereby further
strengthening the fiscal position.
C. Dealing with the Global Financial Market Turmoil
26.
The RBA responded promptly and fittingly to the domestic impact of the global
financial market turmoil. The RBA provided the necessary liquidity support to banks
through exchange settlement accounts and increased the range of securities accepted for repo
lending in late 2007, including residential-mortgage-backed securities. Since then, many
banks have securitized mortgages and are holding them on their books as a contingency
measure in case they need to obtain liquidity from the RBA.
27.
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) also reacted in a timely
and appropriate manner. APRA intensified its monitoring of asset quality, capital

consequences of alternative strategies for dealing with increased revenue from the commodity boom.

20
adequacy, and the liability structure of banks. In the context of Basel II, APRA is working
with large banks on stress tests, which include extreme scenarios such as the loss of access to
offshore credit markets for an extended period.
28.
In addition, banks are adjusting the structure of their funding in response to the
turmoil. They are increasing liquidity as well as lengthening the maturity of their funding
and diversifying the sources. However, the banks have found it costly to extend the maturity
because of higher interest rates for term funding and have made limited progress in reducing
the rollover risk associated with their short-term wholesale funding. Staff analysis using
extreme stress test scenarios applied to the large banks suggests that they could suffer a
significant fall in profits from an increase in funding costs associated with loss of access to
offshore markets for 90 days, but that their capital would remain adequate.8
29.
The introduction of new liquidity guidelines should further encourage banks to
reduce their rollover risk. APRA plans to introduce liquidity guidelines with a focus on
improved disclosure and stress testing. The aim should be to encourage banks to reduce the
risk of disruptions from restricted access to wholesale markets by diversifying their funding
sources, lengthening the maturity of their funding, and holding sufficient liquidity. The staff
advised that requiring banks to publish more detail on the maturity structure of their funding,
especially from offshore markets, would impose additional discipline.
30.
Banks are exposed to households, but appear resilient to an increase in default
rates on mortgages. Households have become increasingly indebted, with debt reaching
almost 160 percent of disposable income and debt-servicing costs at about 14 percent of
disposable income. As more than half of banks’ loans are mortgages, banks’ asset quality
would likely deteriorate with a large increase in interest rates, rise in unemployment, or fall
in house prices. Staff analysis show that a very large increase in default rates (to 10 percent
of all housing loans) would be required to reduce capital ratios of the four major banks below
8 percent.9 Moreover, staff estimates suggest that house prices are only moderately
overvalued (5-15 percent) and that continued strong immigration and household income
growth could increase equilibrium house prices.
31.
The failure resolution and crisis management framework is being strengthened,
as recommended in the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The
proposed Financial Claims Scheme is a key element of legislation to be introduced to
parliament, and it would provide depositors of a failed authorized deposit taking institution

with early access to their funds.10 In addition, the interdependence of the Australian
and New Zealand banking systems underscores the importance of the planned work on the
practical aspects of coordination of crisis management. Good progress has also been made on
a number of other FSAP recommendations (Table 7).
33.
The authorities are also addressing other supervisory and regulatory issues
identified as a result of the turmoil. The government intends to ensure a comprehensive
national approach to regulating a number of credit-related financial services.11 These include
mortgage brokers, trustee corporations, and property investment advisors. In addition, the
authorities are following up on the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum Report
on enhancing the resilience of financial markets and financial institutions.12 In particular,
APRA will strengthen the capital treatment of structured credit and securitization activities,
and is working on updating the risk parameters and other provisions of the Basel II
framework. The authorities are also encouraging banks to strengthen their risk disclosure to
the market.
D. Implementing Further Structural Reform
34.
The Commonwealth and state governments have set an ambitious reform
agenda. Areas of reform include taxation, emissions trading, healthcare, education,
infrastructure, business regulation, and labor relations (Box 4). The Commonwealth
government is working with the states on these reforms through an invigorated Council of
Australian Governments that meets quarterly. Reform at the state level is important as they
provide most of the health, education, and infrastructure services and administer some taxes
and business regulations. Differences exist among the states in these areas, which presents a
barrier to the movement of labor and capital across state boundaries in some industries and
hinders national competition. The aim of the reforms is to raise productivity and labor force
participation, including by reducing barriers to competition and the movement of resources.
35.
The staff agreed with the need for broad-based reform and noted that
governments should follow through on their commitments. Recent work by the staff
shows that the Australia’s productivity performance has been boosted by earlier structural

Box 4. Structural Reform Agenda
The Commonwealth and state governments have a wide-ranging structural reform
agenda, which is summarized below:
Tax Reform. A broad-ranging review of the tax system is underway that covers all taxes,
social security and transfer payments by the Commonwealth and the states, excluding the
goods and service tax (GST). The aim is to improve the tax and transfer system so as to
minimize distortions, enhance international competitiveness, and reduce complexity.
Commonwealth-State Financial Relations. A new model for Commonwealth-state financial
relations is being developed, with priority given to streamlining payments by the
Commonwealth for specific purposes and creating new incentive payments to states to energize
reforms. These reforms are aimed at clarifying roles and responsibility, reducing duplication
and waste, and enhancing accountability.
Emissions Trading. The new government has ratified the Kyoto Protocol and plans to put in
place a ‘cap and trade’ emissions trading scheme. It will set an overall environmental cap by
issuing a set number of permits, and then allow entities to trade permits, thereby putting a price
on carbon.
Healthcare. The government is developing a new national healthcare agreement, which
encompasses preventative health, primary care, aged care, and hospitals. The agreement will
clarify the roles and responsibilities of all levels of government in the provision of healthcare.
The government will establish a Health and Hospital Fund ($A10 billion) for investment in
health facilities.
Education. Substantial reform of Australia’s education and training system is being planned to
raise educational standards. The government intends to establish an Education Investment Fund
($A11 billion) to help build education facilities.
Infrastructure. A federal advisory council has been established to develop a blueprint for
unlocking infrastructure bottlenecks in transport, water, energy, and communications. In
addition, the government intends to establish a Building Australia Fund ($A20 billion) to help
finance key projects.
Business regulation and competition. Priority areas include national harmonization of
occupational health and safety law; national systems for trade and professional qualifications
and licensing; and reforms to pricing of energy, transport, and water.
Water management. The government has introduced a new ten-year $A12.9 billion national
water policy framework to address urban and rural water challenges. Reforms in the MurrayDarling river basin include implementation of a new governance arrangement and the intention
to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers.
Labor relations. The government plans to modernize and simplify the system of awards (i.e.,
agreements on conditions of work). The emphasis will remain on collective bargaining at the
enterprise level, with Australian Workplace Agreements (individual contracts that cover less
than 3 percent of the private sector workforce) being phased out. Individuals will still be able
to negotiate individual contracts.

23
reforms.13 Successful implementation of further reforms would enhance the economy’s
flexibility, lift productivity, and foster labor force participation. Reform is essential to take
full advantage of the mining boom that is centered on Queensland and Western Australia,
that will require capital and labor to move from other states.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The outlook is for real GDP growth to slow over the next two years, as needed to
reduce inflation. Higher debt-service costs, tighter credit conditions, and a decline in
confidence should deliver the required slowing in domestic demand. But upside risks to
growth and inflation stem from the extraordinary jump in export prices for commodities, which
will boost the terms of trade by 20 percent in 2008/09.
37.
A firm monetary policy stance is essential to reduce inflation. The RBA raised the
cash rate appropriately in the past year as inflation increased to the highest level in more than a
decade. Looking ahead, the authorities should act quickly to tighten monetary policy further if
leading indicators suggest that domestic demand will not slow as expected or the outlook for
inflation deteriorates. The inflation-targeting framework remains a suitable approach because it
helps anchor medium-term inflation expectations, making it easier to reduce inflation in the face
of higher commodity prices.
38.
The flexible exchange rate policy is appropriate and the appreciation in recent
years has eased inflation pressures. The Australian dollar is temporarily above its long-run
equilibrium level, but is likely to fall back toward equilibrium over time as the RBA reduces
the cash rate once it is clear that inflation will moderate.
39.
Fiscal policy is providing support for monetary policy, but further restraint may
be needed. The reduction in public spending growth in the latest budget will help reduce
inflation, and the intention to save any further positive revenue surprises in 2008/09 will
allow the automatic stabilizers to work. Nevertheless, additional fiscal restraint may be
needed to take pressure off monetary policy in light of the upside risks to inflation. To the
extent that the improvement in the budget balance is structural, associated with permanently
higher commodity prices, there should be scope to reduce taxes or increase spending over the
medium term.
40.
Australia’s banking system is sound, but some vulnerabilities remain. The
authorities’ response to the credit market turmoil has been timely and fitting, with the RBA
providing liquidity support and APRA intensifying its monitor of banks. The four large banks
remain profitable and well capitalized, but the turmoil highlighted their vulnerability to
rollover risks arising from short-term wholesale funding. The planned introduction of
13

Paper 08/4, January 2008.

24
liquidity guidelines will be helpful to reduce the risk of disruptions arising from loss of
access to offshore funding. Requiring the publication of more detail on the maturity structure
of banks’ funding, especially from offshore markets, would also encourage banks to reduce
their exposure to rollover risk.
41.
The authorities should seize the window of opportunity provided by Australia’s
robust economic performance and the strong fiscal position to advance structural
reforms. If implemented fully, the broad reform agenda should enhance the flexibility of the
economy and lift productivity and labor force participation.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Australia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Key Recommendations and Update on the Progress of Implementation

Issue

Key Recommendations

Progress of Implementation

Banking

Continue to ensure strong risk
management practices,
including through regular
stress testing.

The Basel II framework came into effect in January 2008, with
regular stress testing forming an important element of the
framework. Three of the four largest banks were approved to adopt
the internal ratings based approach with respect to credit risk, and
supervisors have appropriately put safeguards in place to ensure
that the reduction in banks’ capital is phased in. The fourth large
bank is expected to adopt the internal ratings based approach with
respect to credit risk by end-2008.

Failure
Resolution
and Crisis
Management

Continue to develop a formal
process to manage the failure
of individual institutions and
more widespread crises.

In June 2008, the Government announced its intention to introduce
to Parliament a Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) intended to provide
depositors in a failed authorized deposit-taking institution (ADI) with
timely access to the first A$20,000 of their funds, and policyholders
of a failed general insurer with a right to have claims met. The
proposed legislation also includes broader crisis management
arrangements, enhancing regulators’ ability to deal with a distressed
ADI or general insurer.

Supervisory
Capacity

Ensure that the supervisory
agencies have adequate
resources and flexibility.

In the 2007/08 Budget, APRA received additional funding over a
four-year period to improve its staff capabilities. The government
has also enhanced APRA’ flexibility by removing the requirement to
obtain ministerial consent before taking administrative actions. The
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) also
received substantial funding increases over recent years, in
particular to fund a better regulation initiative program, to streamline
the corporate register, and for the development of the ASIC’s
information technology systems over the next four years.

Cooperation
with New
Zealand
Regulators

Build on the progress made
within the Trans-Tasman
Council on Banking
Supervision to improve
coordination in crisis
management.

Legislative changes formalizing a requirement on regulators in the
two countries to be alert to each other’s interests in times of stress
came into force in both countries in December 2006.

Insurance

Push ahead with Stage II
reforms (e.g., capital
management, reinsurance
documentation, corporate
governance standards,
disclosure requirements).

Stage II reforms for nonlife insurance were completed in 2006.
From July 1, 2008, all Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers operating in
Australia must be authorized by APRA and subject to Australia’s
prudential regime. Discretionary Mutual Funds are now subject to
rigorous and compulsory information collection. APRA has a longerterm aim to harmonize prudential requirements between life
insurance, general insurance, and banking sectors.

AML/CFT

Give high priority to make the
appropriate legislative and
operational arrangements in
the AML/CFT area.

The AML/CFT Act was adopted in December 2006. This first
tranche of reforms covers the activities of financial service
providers, gambling services and bullion dealers. Implementation is
proceeding in line with the adopted 24-month schedule.

The work of the Trans-Tasman Council now focuses more on the
practical aspects of coordination in crisis management.

Work is underway on developing legislation for the second tranche
of legislative and regulatory reforms intended to capture designated
nonfinancial businesses and professionals.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures
in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2009. This scenario assumes foreign exchange hedging covers
79 percent of foreign currency debt, consistent with the findings of a survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as
reported in "Australia's Foreign Currency Exposure and Hedging Practices," RBA Bulletin, December 2005.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment Methodology and Confidence Intervals
The desk estimates of the equilibrium value of the REER under the macroeconomic balance
(MB) and the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approaches are based on panel
regression models estimated by the generalized method of moments (GMM). To control for
endogeneity, lagged explanatory variables are employed as instruments, where appropriate.
The tables and figures below summarize the results.

ANNEX II. AUSTRALIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). In recent years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
has taken several initiatives to further improve the quality of the data, such as including the
prices of financial services in the CPI and developing new measures of labor underutilization.
In September 2006, STA met with officials from the ABS, the Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority, and the Reserve Bank of Australia to encourage the reporting of
monetary data using the standardized report forms (SRFs) introduced in October 2004. The
SRFs provide for accounting data to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency.

AUSTRALIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by Asia and Pacific Department
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Tessa van der Willigen
September 5, 2008

1.
This supplement to the staff report summarizes the main developments since the staff
report was issued on August 11, 2008.
2.
GDP growth moderated in the second quarter as expected. Real GDP grew by
1.2 percent in the June quarter in annualized seasonally adjusted terms, reducing growth to
2.7 percent in y/y terms. Household consumption contracted slightly while private
investment remained strong. The slowing in GDP growth was in line with staff projections,
with growth in household consumption weaker than expected, but exports and private
investment stronger than expected.
3.
The staff’s real GDP projections remain broadly unchanged, but the risks have
become more balanced than characterized in the staff report. Household demand is
likely to be weaker than projected in the staff report, with tight financial conditions offsetting
the impact of personal tax cuts. Strong investment and exports, especially in the mining
sector, are likely to continue to support growth.
4.
Credit growth slowed sharply in recent months and the global financial turmoil
continued to put upward pressure on banks’ funding costs. Credit growth fell from
16 percent y/y in December 2007 to 6 percent in July 2008 (in seasonally adjusted,
annualized terms), in response to higher interest rates and tightened credit standards. The
financial turmoil continued to put upward pressure on banks’ funding costs, with variable and
fixed mortgages rates rising further in July.

5.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) moved to a less restrictive monetary
policy stance on September 2, 2008 by reducing its cash rate by 25 basis points to
7 percent. The RBA noted that financial conditions had become quite tight in recent months,
with heightened concerns over credit persisting in international financial markets. The RBA
move offsets the tightening in financial conditions in recent months and the RBA continues
to forecast inflation to fall below 3 percent in 2010.
6.
In the staff’s view, monetary policy remains sufficiently firm to reduce inflation
but looking ahead it will be important to take a cautious approach. Even after factoring
in the cut in the cash rate, bank lending rates are more than 150 basis points above mid-2007
levels and credit conditions more generally have tightened considerably. However, given
high core inflation and pressures stemming from the commodity price boom and large
immigration inflows, the RBA should take a cautious approach to policy adjustment.
7.
The exchange rate has depreciated in the past month as interest rate differentials
narrowed and some commodity prices eased. The Australian dollar has fallen by about
10 percent since June 2008, in nominal effective terms. The recent depreciation was driven
by market expectations of an easing in monetary policy and a decline in base metal prices as
global growth forecasts were revised downward. The staff report estimated an overvaluation
of the Australian dollar of about 10 percent and the recent depreciation brings the currency
into line with its medium-term equilibrium level.
8.
The current account deficit narrowed to 4½ percent of GDP in the June quarter.
The trade balance moved into surplus for the first time in six years, due to a sharp increase in
export prices for iron ore and coal and a broader pickup in export volumes. The improvement
in the trade balance was offset in part by a wider income deficit, as debt service costs and
dividend payments increased. Net foreign liabilities were revised down by 4–5 percent of
GDP for the past year, and stood at about 60 percent of GDP for June 2008.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Australia
On September 10, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Australia. 1, 2
Background
Sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in Australia have delivered more
than sixteen years of economic expansion. Recently a commodity price boom, driven by
robust global demand, has pushed the economy up against capacity constraints. As
resources pressures mounted, broad-based inflation pressures emerged, and CPI
inflation rose to 4½ percent. The large current account deficit increased net foreign
liabilities to 60 percent of GDP, accumulating primarily as debt on financial institutions’
balance sheets.
In response to rising inflation, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) tightened monetary
policy, raising the cash rate 100 basis points between August 2007 and March 2008. In
addition, higher funding costs from the global financial turmoil pushed up lending rates
further and tightened credit conditions. Recently, the tight monetary conditions and
deteriorating confidence slowed household expenditure, suggesting that the easing in
growth required to return inflation to the target band has commenced. In early
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

Discussion was based on the staff report dated August 8, 2008 and the selected issues
paper dated August 18, 2008, and updated by supplement 2 to the staff report dated
September 5, 2008.

2
September, the RBA reduced the cash rate by 25 basis points, assessing that markets
had tightened monetary conditions beyond what was required to reduce inflation.
The Commonwealth government has run surpluses in recent years that have eliminated
its net debt. Revenue outcomes have consistently surprised on the upside, driven in part
by the buoyancy in corporate tax revenue related to the commodity boom. However,
increased spending and tax cuts over the previous three years offset some of the
restraint from the automatic stabilizers. In addition, the states increased capital
spending, shifting their budget balances to small deficits. In the latest 2008-09 Budget
(July-June), the new government has taken a more contractionary fiscal stance, with
expenditure restraint and a higher projected underlying cash surplus.
The banking sector is sound with stable profits, high capitalization, and few
nonperforming loans. The global financial turmoil has increased funding costs and
highlighted the rollover risk associated with banks’ short-term debt. Banks are adjusting
the structure of their funding in response to the turmoil, increasing liquidity, and
lengthening the maturity of their funding.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Australian authorities on their impressive economic
management in the fiscal, monetary, and structural areas, which has spurred a
sustained and long-lasting economic expansion. Looking ahead, Directors considered
that the sound macroeconomic framework should permit Australia to weather the global
downturn and contain inflationary pressures.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ confirmation of their strong commitment to the
inflation targeting framework, which has served Australia well and will contribute to
anchoring medium-term inflation expectations and facilitating a lasting reduction in price
pressures. They noted that the RBA had responded to the buildup in inflationary
pressures in recent years through a substantial tightening of monetary policy. More
recently, against the backdrop of the global financial turmoil, the tightness of the
financial markets, and the evolution of economic conditions, the RBA moved to a less
restrictive monetary policy by reducing the cash rate. Directors welcomed this action and
the authorities’ readiness to follow a cautious monetary policy aimed at achieving the 23 percent inflation target range over time, based on a continuous assessment of
prospects for demand and inflation in the period ahead. Wage and price developments
in particular will require careful monitoring, taking into account the high core inflation and
pressures stemming from the commodity price boom.
Directors welcomed the support that prudent fiscal policy is providing for monetary
policy. They noted that the reduction in public spending growth in the latest budget will
help reduce inflation, and the intention to save any further positive revenue outcomes
in 2008/09 will allow the automatic stabilizers to work. Looking ahead, if growth and
revenues are stronger than expected, Directors recommended that the surplus be
allowed to exceed budget forecasts until it is clear that inflation will decline. They agreed
that, to the extent that the improvement in the budget balance is structural and
associated with permanently higher commodity prices, there should be scope to reduce
taxes or increase spending over the medium term. Directors welcomed the

3
establishment of three new funds for longer-term spending on health, education, and
infrastructure, with contributions to come from the 2007/08 and 2008/09 surpluses.
Directors regarded the flexible exchange rate policy as appropriate, and observed that
the currency appreciation in recent years had eased inflation pressures. Directors noted
the staff’s assessment that, with the recent depreciation, the Australian dollar is now
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. They observed that wider current
account deficits and the accumulation of external liabilities have increased external
vulnerability in recent years. However, Directors considered that vulnerability will be
contained as the associated high rates of investment contribute to export capacity, and
as the medium-term external current account deficit narrows to its historical norm.
Directors considered that the banking system is sound, but that some vulnerabilities
remain. They commended the authorities’ timely and fitting response to the credit market
turmoil, with the RBA providing liquidity support and the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority intensifying its monitoring of banks. Directors noted that the banking sector
remains profitable and well capitalized. However, they encouraged the authorities to
monitor carefully the sector’s vulnerability to rollover risks arising from short-term
wholesale funding and to the risks associated with the large indebtedness of the
household sector. Directors commended the authorities for the progress in implementing
the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, including the
strengthening of the failure resolution and crisis management framework. They also
welcomed the planned introduction of liquidity guidelines to reduce the risk of
disruptions arising from loss of access to offshore funding.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the positive macroeconomic
performance to advance structural reforms. They considered that, if implemented fully,
the broad reform agenda should enhance the flexibility of the economy and lift
productivity and labor force participation.

Statement by Richard Murray, Executive Director for Australia
September 10, 2008

As outlined in the supplement to the staff report released today, economic conditions have
evolved since Australia’s 2008 Article IV discussions were concluded at the end of July, with
the latest information confirming that economic activity has slowed. This has led to a change
in the authorities’ assessment of the economic outlook and balance of risks, with implications
for monetary policy.
Economic Activity and Inflation
The Australian economy is in its eighteenth year of expansion, underpinned by a strong
macroeconomic policy framework and a boost to productive capacity from microeconomic
reforms. In addition, strong growth in global commodity prices has pushed Australia’s terms
of trade to the highest level in over 50 years, boosting growth, profits and government
revenues. In the early part of this year, domestic spending remained strong and most
measures of capacity utilization were at levels consistent with previous cyclical peaks.
Available labour has become more scarce, with labour force participation rising to record
highs and the unemployment rate falling to levels last seen in Australia in the 1970s. It is
against this background, and in combination with rising global fuel and food prices, that
headline inflation rose to 4.5 per cent in the year to the June quarter 2008. Price pressures
have become broadly based, with measures of underlying inflation rising to around 4 per
cent. To date, however, wages growth has remained fairly stable, with annual growth around
4 per cent for the past three years.
Assessments of the economic outlook are complicated by the countervailing forces
confronting the Australian economy. Slower global growth, tighter financial conditions and
high petrol prices are exerting downward pressure on economic activity. On the other hand,
the rise in the terms of trade is continuing to boost national income and business investment.
On balance, the authorities’ assessment at the time of the Article IV discussions in June was
that these forces were likely to result in a slowing in GDP growth even as income growth
remained high.
In the event, the latest information confirms that a significant moderation in spending and
activity is now underway. The June quarter national accounts (released on 3 September)
show that real GDP growth slowed to 2.7 per cent over the year to the June quarter, with the
quarterly growth rate of 0.3 per cent the lowest in around four years. The slowdown is most
apparent in the household sector, with household consumption falling slightly in the June
quarter and consumer sentiment falling to 15-year lows. The housing sector has also

2
softened, with national house prices flat in the first half of the year and forward indicators
pointing to declines in housing construction activity in the near-term. Business investment,
particularly in the mining sector, continues to drive growth, although economy-wide
indicators of business conditions have moderated, measures of capacity utilization are falling
and there are early signs that demand for labour has started to ease.
Demand pressures are expected to ease further over the period ahead, with the likelihood that
growth will remain significantly below the trend rate in both 2008-09 and 2009-10.
Employment growth is also expected to moderate as economic growth slows and the
unemployment rate, while remaining low, is expected to rise to 4¾ per cent by mid 2009.
The Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) forecasts in its August Statement on Monetary
Policy were for underlying inflation to remain around 4 to 4½ per cent over the year to the
December quarter and then to decline gradually to 2¾ per cent by the end of 2010 –
consistent with the monetary policy target of 2 to 3 per cent inflation, on average, over the
economic cycle.
Monetary Policy
In recent years, the RBA has responded to building inflationary pressures through a
substantial tightening of monetary policy. The official cash rate was increased by a
cumulative 300 basis points from mid-2002 to March 2008, including a rise of 100 basis
points from August 2007. In the wake of the global financial turmoil, credit conditions have
also tightened due to banks passing on increased funding costs to borrowers (adding a further
50-80 basis points to average bank lending rates since August 2007), higher risk spreads in
corporate bond markets, falling equity prices and tougher lending standards for some types of
borrowing. Combined with some fall in demand, this has resulted in a significant decline in
credit growth, which slowed from an average monthly rate of 1.3 per cent over the December
quarter 2007 to an average monthly rate of 0.5 per cent over the June quarter, consistent with
other indicators of softer domestic activity.
In this context, the RBA Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points at its
September meeting to 7.0 per cent. The RBA Governor noted in his press statement
announcing the decision that tight financial conditions, in conjunction with other factors
including higher fuel costs and lower asset values, have exerted the needed restraint on
demand. Weighing up the latest information on economic activity and financial conditions,
both in Australia and internationally, the RBA Board judged that there was now scope for
monetary policy to become less restrictive.
Going forward, monetary conditions remain tight and the RBA Board will continue to assess
prospects for demand and inflation over the period ahead, setting monetary policy as needed
to bring inflation back to the 2-3 per cent target range over time.

Fiscal Policy
The new Australian Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy involves: achieving budget
surpluses, on average, over the medium-term; keeping taxation as a share of GDP on average
below the level for 2007-08, thereby ensuring that budget surpluses are achieved through
disciplined spending, not higher taxation; and improving the Government’s net financial
worth over the medium-term in order to promote medium-term fiscal sustainability and
policies that contribute to Australia’s long-term productive capacity.
Against this strategy, the Federal Government introduced a contractionary 2008-09 Budget
directed at easing domestic inflationary pressures, with an underlying 2008-09 cash surplus
equivalent to 1.8 per cent of GDP. Further budget surpluses in the order of 1½ per cent of
GDP are projected over the following three fiscal years, which would see the Government’s
net financial worth increase significantly. The combined budget deficit of the State and
Territory Governments rose to around ½ a per cent of GDP in 2007-08 due to increased
infrastructure spending, but is forecast to remain broadly stable in 2008-09 - implying no
additional fiscal stimulus.
The increase in the central Government’s cash surplus in 2008-09 will be achieved while
reducing tax as a share of GDP (from 24.7 per cent in 2007-08 to 23.8 per cent in 2008-09)
through restraint on the expenditure side, with growth in real spending reduced to 1.1 per
cent - the lowest rate in nine years. The Government has stated that further steps will be
taken as necessary to place further downward pressure on inflation. As noted in the staff
report, the Government is committed to maintaining tight controls on expenditure - including
through ongoing efforts to reduce spending and direct it to areas that are more productive and saving any positive revenue surprises in 2008-09.
In addition to reducing short-term inflationary pressures, the 2008-09 Budget also contained
measures to build the supply-side capacity of the economy over the medium- to long-term.
This includes personal income tax cuts to promote increased workforce participation and the
establishment of three new funds - which will amount to around 4 per cent of GDP designed to raise productivity growth through greater investment in infrastructure, education
and health. The Government will make initial contributions to these funds from the 2007-08
and 2008-09 Budget surpluses, once realised. The Government has also committed to making
further contributions from future surpluses as appropriate and ensuring that medium-term
spending from the funds does not prejudice the monetary policy inflation target.
Exchange Rate and External Stability
Australia’s flexible exchange rate has again proven to be an effective counter-cyclical force
during the current commodity price boom. Widening interest rate differentials and the rapid

4
increase in Australia’s terms of trade have led to substantial appreciation of Australia’s real
trade-weighted exchange rate, contributing to the overall tightening of monetary conditions.
A number of factors support the analysis in the staff report that any overvaluation of
Australia’s real effective exchange rate would likely be temporary, with expectations of
declining inflation, some narrowing of interest rate differentials and any further moderation
in global commodity prices all supporting a reduction over the medium-term. Indeed, since
the conclusion of the Article IV mission at the start of July, Australia’s trade-weighted
exchange rate has fallen by around 10 per cent in nominal terms, reflecting broader trends in
global commodity prices and currency markets and a changed assessment of the near-term
domestic interest rate outlook (detailed above).
Australia’s current account deficit fell sharply to 4.4 per cent of GDP in the June quarter.
High prices for export commodities have led to a sharp turnaround in the trade balance from
a sizeable deficit in the March quarter to a small surplus in the June quarter. However, the
net income deficit has remained high, reflecting robust growth in corporate profits,
particularly in the mining sector1[1], and rising net interest payments from a higher stock of
net foreign debt. The outlook is for Australia’s current account deficit to remain around
historical norms of 4 to 5 per cent of GDP as domestic demand moderates, rural exports
rebound and as significant investment projects in the mining sector continue to come on
stream.
Australia’s net external liabilities have risen in recent years, however there are a number of
factors mitigating Australia’s external vulnerability, including the minimal currency risk
associated with the foreign debt and the soundness of the banking system through which the
vast majority of Australia’s foreign debt is channeled. Moreover, from a sectoral net lending
perspective, the increase in Australia’s net borrowing position can be attributed to
exceptionally high rates of investment by the non-financial corporate sector. As a share of
GDP, gross investment by the non-financial corporate sector has increased by nearly
4 percentage points over the last five years, causing the net borrowing position of the nonfinancial corporate sector to increase despite strong growth in profits. Over time, this
investment is expected to raise the economy’s productive capacity and stabilize net external
liabilities, supporting the authorities’ view - shared by Fund staff2 - that Australia’s external
position is sustainable over the medium-term.

Financial Sector
Australia’s financial system has coped better with the ongoing turmoil than those of many
other advanced countries. The banks have continued to record high levels of profits, have low
levels of problem loans, and are soundly capitalized. They have maintained their high credit
ratings through the recent turmoil and it is notable that of the world’s largest 100 banks, only
a handful have higher ratings than those of the four large Australian banks.
The solid position of the Australian banking system partly reflects the high quality of its
assets. While non-performing loan ratios have picked up over the past few years, they remain
low by historical and international standards. Competitive pressures saw lending criteria
relaxed over recent years, but credit standards in Australia did not fall to the same degree as
they did in the United States. A strong legal and regulatory framework is one factor that
helped keep a check on this process. The Australian banks also have minimal direct exposure
to the sub-prime problems, and they typically earn less of their revenues from trading in
financial markets than many overseas banks.
Despite this relatively favourable position, the Australian banking sector has not been
immune from developments abroad. As elsewhere, bank share prices have fallen
considerably and funding costs have risen significantly. As noted above, the higher funding
costs have been passed through to borrowers, with banks raising their lending rates by more
than the increase in the cash rate over the past year.
The banks have also been taking a more cautious approach to their lending recently and have
significantly increased their holdings of liquid assets. Importantly, the large banks have
maintained their access to both the domestic and international capital markets, albeit at a
higher cost than previously, to help finance the strong growth in their assets. Earlier in the
year, in particular, the banks issued a record volume of bonds in offshore markets, and they
are now well ahead in their funding plans. Banks have also benefited recently from
considerably stronger growth in their deposits given the volatility in alternative investment
markets.
Notwithstanding the resilience of the Australian financial system, the authorities are actively
addressing the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) set out in its recent
report on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience. As a member of the FSF, the
Governor of the RBA has encouraged the large Australian banks to provide disclosures
consistent with the best-practice template recommended by the FSF. The Basel II capital
framework was implemented in Australia at the beginning of this year, and the Australian
Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is continuing to review its operation with a view to
strengthening requirements where necessary. In addition, APRA is undertaking a thorough
review of its liquidity prudential standards, with a focus on improved disclosure and stress
testing. The authorities are also conducting a review of the regulation of credit rating

6
agencies in Australia. The RBA’s open market operations are already sufficiently flexible,
including in relation to the range of collateral it will accept, such that it sees no need to
change them in light of the FSF’s recommendations.
In line with FSF and earlier FSAP recommendations, the authorities are continuing to
strengthen the framework for crisis management and resolution, including the establishment
of a Financial Claims Scheme, under which depositors in a closed deposit-taking institution,
or general insurance policyholders in a closed general insurer, would receive at least some of
their funds on a timely basis. This approach will strengthen the existing provisions of the
Banking Act which give depositors first claim over the assets of a failed authorised deposittaking institution. Legislative changes will also be made to enhance the regulators’ powers to
manage a troubled financial institution. The authorities are also continuing to engage with the
New Zealand authorities on trans-Tasman crisis management issues, including how they
would deal with stress at the parent and/or subsidiary of a bank with a significant transTasman presence.
Structural Reform Agenda
Since coming to office in late 2007, the Government has embarked on an ambitious structural
reform agenda, summarized in broad terms on page 22 of the staff report. In addition to the
three new funds announced in the Budget (detailed above), two areas of particular relevance
are: the Government’s commitment to introducing an emissions trading scheme from 2010;
and a comprehensive review of the tax and transfer system that is currently underway.
Conclusion
Finally, our Australian authorities would like to thank Ray Brooks and his team for the
constructive policy discussions during the Article IV mission, reflected in their high quality
staff report and selected issues paper.
