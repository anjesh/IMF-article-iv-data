STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
July 20, 2012

CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved by

Rodrigo Valdés and Martin Mühleisen

This supplement provides an update on major financial and fiscal sector policy initiatives that
occurred after the staff report was issued to the Board. The initiatives are in line with staff
recommendations and significantly alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Financial Sector: Policies to Accompany the Financial Assistance
1.
The key policies incorporated in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to
accompany the EFSF financial support, which was approved on July 20, are: (1) identifying
individual bank capital needs based on a comprehensive asset quality review and an
independent bank-by-bank stress test; (2) recapitalizing, restructuring and/or resolving weak
banks; (3) segregating legacy assets of weak banks into an asset management company;
(4) burden sharing from hybrid/subordinated-debt holders in banks receiving public capital;
and (5) strengthening supervision and regulation.
2.
The financial assistance will cover estimated capital requirements with an additional
safety margin, estimated as summing up to €100 billion in total, to be disbursed in several
tranches over the 18-month duration of the program, with an average maturity of
12½ years. A first tranche of €30 billion is expected to be pre-funded and kept by EFSF as a
contingency in case of urgent needs. The European Commission, in liaison with the ECB and
EBA, will verify at regular intervals that the policy conditions are fulfilled. The Spanish
authorities have also requested technical assistance from the Fund to support the
monitoring of the financial assistance with regular reporting.
3.
In staff’s view, the policies envisaged in the MoU are strong and in line with
recommendations of the FSAP and staff report. In particular, weak but viable banks are to
be supported and non-viable banks are to be resolved, a comprehensive strategy to deal

with legacy assets is developed, and supervision and crisis management and the resolution
framework are upgraded. If fully implemented, and in combination with the European
financial assistance, these policies would substantially complete the needed restructuring of
the sector. It remains important to sever the adverse loop between the sovereign and the
banks and help mitigate short-term risks by a timely transformation of the European support
into direct recapitalization.
Fiscal Sector: A Smoother Deficit Path and Additional Measures
4.
On July 10, the Council of the European Union issued a recommendation giving
Spain another year (until 2014) to reduce its deficit below 3 percent of GDP and loosening
the targets for 2012–14. The new path for the overall deficit is: 2012, 6.3 percent of GDP
(previously 5.3); 2013, 4.5 percent of GDP (previously 3.0); and 2014, 2.8 percent of GDP
(previously 2.2). To achieve this path, the Council called for an average annual improvement
of the structural balance of almost 2½ percent of GDP over this period. The new path is in
line with staff recommendations and is similar to the recommended “smoother” adjustment
scenario in Box 5 of the staff report.
5.
On July 11, Prime Minister Rajoy announced a significant package of additional fiscal
measures. Key measures include:

VAT: the standard rate was raised from 18 to 21 percent and the reduced rate from
8 to 10 (the super-reduced rate was left unchanged at 4 percent). A number of products
have also been moved from lower to higher rates. Other indirect taxes will also be raised.

The extra payment in December to civil servants was suspended for 2012 —
equivalent to nearly a monthly wage.


The mortgage income tax deduction will be removed.


Unemployment benefit was reduced (with the replacement rate after six months
falling from 60 to 50 percent).

Social security contributions are reduced by one percentage point in 2013 and a
further point in 2014.
6.
At the Fiscal Policy Council meeting of July 12, the central government initiated for
several regions the first step in the warning procedure established in the new budget
stability law (Appendix III). Regions will also begin monthly budgetary reporting from
October and a centralized fund was established to support regional financing. On July 14,
measures were also taken to liberalize retail opening hours and promotion periods, and to
reduce the electricity deficit.

The new fiscal package, regional government actions,
and structural measures, are broadly in line with staff

recommendations. Staff’s preliminary estimate is that
the cumulative size of the package between 2012–14, as 100
currently planned, is about 2 percent of GDP. This

8.
Staff expects the new fiscal consolidation measures to have a significant impact on
growth, especially in 2013. While the large role of indirect taxes should lead to a relatively
low multiplier, preliminary estimates suggest that the level of output would be lowered by
about 1 percent by 2014. Unemployment would also increase, although this might be
mitigated by the effect of lower social security contributions and unemployment benefits, as
well as the recent labor market reform. The VAT increase, combined with electricity price
increases, will also lead to temporarily higher inflation. Lower domestic demand would
further improve the current account, which would reach a larger surplus over the medium
term, putting the net IIP on a downward path.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 9, 2012

KEY ISSUES

1

Context: Spain is facing mounting market pressure and costly market access, with
possibly negative repercussions for the rest of the Europe, amid the longer-term
challenge of unwinding imbalances that built up during several years of excess private
sector spending. The economy is in the midst of an unprecedented double-dip
recession with unemployment already unacceptably high, public debt increasing
rapidly, and segments of the financial sector lacking capital and market access.
Headwinds from household and corporate deleveraging, combined with unavoidable
fiscal consolidation and persistent capital outflows, will likely translate into output
contractions this year and next.
Risks: Downside risks dominate. While the recently announced Euro area financial
assistance for banks and the Euro area summit statement help to mitigate short-term
risks, market tensions could intensify further, threatening market access, particularly if
policies fail to stem capital outflows or due to further stress elsewhere in the Euro area.
Private sector deleveraging could be faster than envisaged, and the fiscal consolidation
may have larger than expected output costs.
Policies and staff views: Many major policy actions have been taken in recent months
on several fronts. These include: significant efforts to further strengthen the financial
sector, an important labor market reform which should facilitate gains in
competitiveness which are critical, fiscal adjustment measures and improvements in the
fiscal framework. But market confidence remains weak and the outlook is very difficult.
This calls for a commensurately ambitious policy response and communicating it within
a comprehensive medium-term strategy. This strategy should be based around
concrete measures to deliver the needed medium-term fiscal consolidation, a clear

1

discussed in the attached Staff Supplement.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SPAIN

roadmap for restructuring the weak segments of the financial sector, and structural
reforms to support relative price adjustments and boost growth. In the short-term, the
main priority is securing market financing for both public and private sectors at
affordable rates. The prospective Euro area financial sector support is an important
plank in this strategy, with the recent Euro area summit decisions rightly aiming to
address market concerns on the implication of bank sector losses for the sovereign
balance sheet. Spain’s prospects for lowering borrowing costs would be critically
helped by a timely implementation of the summit decisions and continued progress
toward a banking and fiscal union at the European level.
Authorities’ views: The authorities viewed the renewed market tensions as reflecting
not only domestically generated imbalances but also the flaws in Euro area frameworks.
The authorities broadly shared the assessment of the ongoing adjustment of
macroeconomic imbalances, the near-term outlook, and the medium-term potential of
the recent reforms. They also broadly shared staff's view on the financial sector, and
expressed their willingness to implement recommendations of the FSAP and concurred
that the Euro area backstop gives the opportunity to clean up Spain's financial sector
once and for all. The government recognized the challenges of the envisaged fiscal
consolidation, but pointed to the substantial revisions in the fiscal framework, and
underscored their commitment to take additional measures as needed. The
government also argued that the labor market reform is profound, introducing
significant labor flexibility to provide adjustment mechanisms alternative to job
destruction, and that structural reforms would continue on several fronts.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK
1.
Imbalances accumulated over the long boom years are gradually being unwound while
the economy faces considerable stress. Spain is facing mounting market pressure and costly
market access, with possibly negative repercussions for the rest of the Europe, amid the longer-term
challenge of unwinding imbalances that built up during several years of excess private sector
spending. This unwinding is occurring as the economy enters an unprecedented double-dip
recession with unemployment already unacceptably high, public debt increasing rapidly, and
segments of the financial sector lacking capital and market access. The center-right Popular Party
won an overall majority in the November general election and took office in late December with a
strong mandate for consolidation and reform.
2.
The new government has taken prompt action on a range of fronts. Facing an
intensification of the euro area debt crisis, the economy falling back into recession, unemployment
rising even further, bank wholesale funding drying up, and the news that the fiscal deficit for 2011
would be at least 8 percent of GDP rather than the 6 percent of GDP targeted, the government
responded with a number of major policy actions:






Banks. Provisions and capital requirements have been raised, independent valuations
commissioned, the fourth largest bank is being restructured, and a credible backstop
provided with support from Spain’s European partners. The government adopted a pro
active approach to the FSAP and committed to draw on its findings rapidly.
Fiscal. A package of measures was introduced in December, an ambitious 2012 budget was
introduced, the fiscal framework significantly improved, and sub-national arrears are being
cleared.
Labor. A profound labor reform was enacted in February.

3.
After an LTRO-led respite, market tensions re-emerged in the Spring and the
government sought euro area financial support:

Successive 3-year refinancing operations by the
ECB in December and February saw a particularly large
take up by Spanish banks, which helped relieve concerns
about bank funding and allowed them to increase their
purchases of government bonds. However, banks access
to capital markets remained virtually shut and gross ECB
borrowing rose to €343 billion (around 9 percent of total
assets) as of end May. Including staff estimates of SMP
purchases, the Eurosystem held claims on Spain of close
to 40 percent of Spanish GDP as of end May.

spread over German bunds hit euro era highs. The 10-year bond yield differential with Italy also
reversed, moving from a peak of almost 200 bps in December in Spain’s favor above 90 bps in Italy’s
favor as of early July, although correlations remained high. The sovereign and banks also have
suffered multiple-notch downgrades from rating agencies and LCH Clearnet has increased the
margin requirements on banks using Spanish government debt as collateral in repo operations.
Downgrades and increased spreads have also led to much costlier market access for large
corporates.
In early June, the government announced its intention to request European financing for bank
recapitalization, which was welcomed by the Eurogroup, for up to €100 billion, with further
strengthening of the planned financial assistance at the Euro area summit of June 29 (Box 2).
Box 1. Spain’s External Financing
Over the past decade, Spain’s current account deficits had been financed by private capital
inflows: this came to a sudden stop in 2011. While

part by ECB intervention in the bond market (through the
SMP), and to a larger extent by a surge in bank refinancing with the Eurosystem.
At the end of 2011, both gross external debt and the net IIP were broadly unchanged in
magnitude compared to a year before. However their composition had shifted significantly toward
less portfolio assets and liabilities, and increased Bank of Spain liabilities to the Eurosystem.
Staff projects a gradual decline in reliance on ECB financing. In the central scenario, ECB financing
would not drop markedly before maturity of the 3 year LTROs and would still amount in 2015 to about
half current levels. A moderate decline in private sector reliance on external financing would be
compensated by external asset drawdown. Alternative scenarios include:



A resumption of private capital inflows combined with continued foreign asset drawdown, would
allow ECB refinancing to be paid down by 2015.



If foreign investors were not to rollover any of their portfolio holdings of Spanish government and
bank debt as they mature, reliance on ECB financing would increase and foreign asset drawdown
would accelerate.



If private capital outflows were to continue at the same pace that was seen over the second half
of 2011, non-resident holdings of Spanish government debt could soon drop to zero. ECB
refinancing would further rise.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Spain’s request for Euro Area Financial Assistance to Recapitalize the Banking
Sector
Purpose. On June 25, the Spanish Government formally requested financing from euro-area
Member States for the recapitalization of its weakest financial institutions. The Eurogroup
has welcomed the request. Financial assistance will be provided by the EFSF until the ESM
becomes available, and would then be transferred to the ESM without gaining seniority
status. The assistance is intended to backstop all possible capital needs estimated by the
diagnostic exercise commissioned by the Spanish authorities from external evaluators. The
envelope of up to €100 billion defined by the Eurogroup is intended to cover currently
estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin.
Process. Following the formal request, an assessment that eligibility conditions for access to
an EFSF/ESM financial assistance for the re-capitalisation of financial institutions were
satisfied was provided by the European Commission. In liaison with the ECB, EBA and the
IMF, the Commission has also prepared proposals for financial sector policy conditionality
that will accompany the assistance. Once agreed, a MoU will be signed by the Spanish
Government.



Amount: The specific amount will be determined based on the ongoing bottom-up
assessment of individual institutions.



Conditionality: The Eurogroup considers that the policy conditionality of the financial
assistance should be focused on specific reforms targeting the financial sector, including
restructuring plans in line with EU state-aid rules and horizontal structural reforms of the
domestic financial sector.



Commitments: Spain’s European commitments under the excessive deficit procedure and
with regard to structural reforms, with a view to correcting any macroeconomic
imbalances as identified within the framework of the European semester. Progress in
these areas will be closely and regularly reviewed in parallel with financial assistance.



Disbursement: The FROB, acting as agent of the Spanish government, would receive the
funds and use them to recapitalize the financial institutions concerned. The Spanish
Government will retain the full responsibility of the financial assistance. Assistance
provided as a loan, as opposed to direct equity stakes, will increase Spain’s general
government debt in gross terms. When a single supervisory mechanism for banks in the
euro area, involving the ECB, is established, the ESM could have the possibility to
recapitalise the banks directly via a new instrument.

Role of the Fund. As indicated by the Eurogroup, the Commission will continue to liaise with
IMF (as well as the ECB and EBA) for the preparation of the forthcoming assessment of capital
needs. The Eurogroup has also invited the IMF to support the monitoring of the financial
assistance with regular reporting. To that effect, Spain will request technical assistance from
the IMF.

4.
The economy has entered an unprecedented double-dip recession with unemployment
surging over 24 percent. The modest recovery from the 2008–09 crisis gave way to a new
slowdown in the second half of 2011 as financial tensions rose. By the end of the first quarter
of 2012, real output was some 3 percent below its 2008 peak, similar to Italy. Unlike France and
especially Germany, output has not recovered its pre-crisis level (though it has when excluding
construction). Private consumption and investment led the downturn and domestic demand is
almost 13 percent below its 2007 peak. Recent wage moderation proved insufficient to arrest the
pace of job losses, and Spain has net emigration for the first time since the early 1990s. Credit is
declining and house prices are falling at an increasing rate. An inflation differential with the euro
area has opened up while net exports are cushioning the fall in activity.

5.
Income inequality and poverty are on the rise, especially among the young, reflecting
labor market developments. Spain suffered one of the worst absolute deteriorations in income
distributions since the crisis, mainly due to unemployment, though additional income support
provided by informal occupations may have provided a limited buffer. In a dual labor market, the

8

SPAIN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

income gap between workers with permanent and temporary contracts further widened, with now
close to three quarters of temporary workers in the bottom half of the income distribution. Around
half of all youth are unemployed, a third has dropped out of school, and those who have jobs are
largely on temporary contracts.

Private sector imbalances are large but diminishing with deleveraging underway. The
trade balance was a bright spot. In 2011, exports were higher than their pre-crisis level at 30 percent
above trough. Imports fell more than domestic demand, helping the current account deficit narrow
to 3 ½ percent of GDP. The household savings ratio declined back towards pre-crisis levels in 2011
amidst weakening disposable income and housing investment. Nonfinancial corporate sector
balance sheets continued to strengthen and the sector is now a net lender to the economy.
However, this also reflects the lack of investment and access to finance of many businesses. Large
corporations that had access to the financial markets now find it increasingly difficult and SMEs are
constrained in their access to bank finance. House prices have fallen by some 30 percent since the
peak and construction investment is back to its 2000 level, representing 10 percent of total value
added.

But stock problems are little improved. While the
current account deficit has narrowed sharply, the net external
position has only stabilized at a very high level. Private sector
debt remains high. House prices are still overvalued,
potentially by a significant margin. The large stock of unsold
housing has little diminished, which suggest that while
investment in construction may be at historical norms, a
substantial period of “undershooting” may be necessary, as
inventory effects are poorly captured by traditional models of
overvaluation.

Private sector credit will likely contract further for the next few years. Although ECB
liquidity support has alleviated bank funding pressure, private sector credit is expected to shrink by
about 5 percent in 2012 and continue to decline until 2014. By 2017, the deleveraging process
would bring down private sector credit to about 140 percent of GDP. Deposits would decline
gradually in 2012–13, in the wake of a weak economy. The loan-to-deposit ratio would be lowerdecreasing only marginally wholesale financing needs—but at a high level while it converges to the
euro area average.
10.
Structural reforms could lead to a much improved medium-term scenario (Box 3). If
properly implemented and accompanied by other measures, the recent labor market reform could
lead to a substantial reallocation of resources towards more dynamic sectors. This could boost the
level of potential output by 4–5 percent by 2017 and bring unemployment down by an additional
3–4 percentage points by 2017 (though at above 15 percent would remain high). New jobs would
center in more knowledge-based and tradable sectors.

Box 3. Structural Reforms and Medium-term Growth
Structural reforms focusing on the supply side and leading to labor reallocation could boost
potential growth and employment by 4 percent over 4 years. This upside scenario builds on the
announced reforms (centered on the recent labor market reform) for 2014 and beyond. Reallocation
towards more productive and profitable sectors is assumed to bring about a moderate increase in the
capital-labor ratios of the targeted sectors and the entire economy, boosting growth potential even
without any additional positive contribution from TFP.
The upside scenario for employment reverts price misalignments accumulated during the boom
years. Construction, real estate activities, and the housing-related part of financial intermediation
contributed over a third of 2001–07 growth but their contribution will shrink or disappear in 2014–17.
The upside scenario mimics a sectoral pattern of recovery after the early 1990s recession resuming the
pre-crisis long-term trends in agriculture and business services. Estimates from the literature on the
degree of reallocation and frictionless (or intrinsic) employment are used to project sectoral growth.
The sectors that would make the largest contribution to employment growth would be business
services, wholesale and retail trade, and transport and communications.

To support job creation and bridge the gap between the baseline and the upside scenarios,
policies should support the expansion of the tradable sector. Policies needed for this necessary
reallocation include wage moderation, improved job search assistance and incentives, better
integrated employment services, and more competitive domestic markets. Further reforms at the
European level would increase even more Spain’s potential (IMF SDN/12/07 “Fostering Growth in
Europe”).

But downside risks greatly dominate the outlook. Macroeconomic risks include a faster
than expected private sector deleveraging and fiscal consolidation having greater than envisaged
output costs. Tail risks are significant and potentially extremely costly both for Spain and Europe
(Table 9).


Immediate homegrown risks primarily relate to a
repetition of a large fiscal slippage and debt
accumulation, accelerated by the recognition of
contingent liabilities and higher than expected capital
needs in the banking sector, and intensified funding
pressure on weak banks.

continued capital outflows amid renewed financial
market stress, focusing on sovereign/bank spillovers. Direct recapitalization of banks as
envisaged by the euro area summit could mitigate these adverse effects.



Although both the sovereign and banks have significant buffers, materialization of these
risks could threaten sovereign market access. Financing needs of the sovereign are large at
11 percent of GDP for the remainder of this year and 23 percent of GDP for next year. Given
Spain’s size, financing needs and external indebtedness, potential spillovers can be large.
German and French banks have considerable exposures while market correlations suggest
other southern European countries could be affected.

B. Authorities' Views
12.
The authorities viewed the renewed market tensions as reflecting the imbalances of
the Spanish economy but also flaws in Euro area frameworks. They emphasized the extent and
depth of reforms adopted since the beginning of the year, their comprehensive approach to
government finances and noted that although the economy has been adjusting, unwinding the
accumulated imbalances would take time. They noted that the Spanish economy is becoming more
competitive. The authorities saw the market risks faced by Spain as having a major Euro-area
dimension and thus requiring, along with national policy actions, a Euro-area response to mitigate.
They stressed that the solution to current tensions is more Europe, and that although Spain is ready
to play an active part and will continue on its reform path, additional measures by Spain in isolation
risk losing traction in the short term if significant Euro area-wide measures are not forthcoming.
13.
The authorities broadly shared the assessment of the ongoing adjustment of
macroeconomic imbalances, near-term prospects, and medium-term potential of the recent
reforms. The authorities also concurred with the analysis of the challenges facing the economy over
the medium-term. However, the government saw a stronger recovery starting from mid-2013 with
much lower output costs of fiscal consolidation. Even in the absence of any immediate growth
employment gains from reforms, the government reiterated its strong commitment to maintaining
the reform momentum.

THE POLICY AGENDA
14.
Continued strong implementation of a comprehensive strategy is needed to restore
confidence so that imbalances can be unwound smoothly and jobs and growth fostered. This
strategy should include strengthening the finances of the government and finalizing the banking
reform. The financial sector backstop allows the financing of the clean-up, restructuring, and
recapitalization of the weak segments of Spain’s banking sector once and for all. But the policy plan
also should include better functioning labor and product markets to support household incomes,
fiscal consolidation, banks’ asset quality, and social backing for reform. The recent labor market
reform offers a good stepping stone to intensify the ongoing reversal of the large misalignment in
prices and wages. Gains in employment and external competitiveness will be gradual but should
also be at the center of this agenda. It will be important to communicate such a package clearly and
cohesively.
15.
It is critical that Spain’s prospects be helped by decisive progress at the European
level. There is an immediate need at the euro area level to ensure adequate bank funding and
mitigate contagion. But a lasting resolution to the Euro area crisis will require a convincing and
concerted move toward a complete and robust EMU, as discussed in the Euro area Article IV staff
report. At their summit meeting on June 28–29, European leaders agreed upon significant positive
steps to address the immediate crisis. The agreement, if implemented in full, will help break the
adverse links between sovereigns and banks. These initiatives are in the right direction and will need
to be complemented, as envisaged, by more progress toward deeper fiscal integration and a fullfledged banking union. A clear commitment to implement steps in this direction, in particular
through an area-wide deposit insurance and resolution authority, and greater fiscal integration, with
risk sharing supported by stronger governance, is essential to chart a credible path ahead.

achieved through retained profits, conversion into equity of hybrid instruments, and below-par debt
pre-payments. Some de-risking of banks’ total assets has also taken place, partially reflecting the
decline in credit to the private sector. Provision and specific capital buffer requirements against real
estate were further increased in February and May, amounting to about 7 percent of GDP. This
would bring the coverage of the total problematic portfolio to about 70 percent. In addition, banks
were required to transfer real estate foreclosed assets into asset management subsidiaries.

The restructuring of the banking sector has
continued apace. By end-2012, ten institutions will
have been resolved since 2008, with most of the costs
borne by the banking industry, and the number of
former savings banks reduced to 8 (from 45 at the
beginning of the crisis). The number of bank employees
has been reduced by 11 percent and branches by
13 percent. The authorities and the industry (via the
Deposit Guarantee Fund) have outstanding funding
and capital support amounting to about 9 percent of
GDP. In early May, the FROB intervened the holding
company of the fourth largest bank, thereby taking a
46 percent ownership in the latter.

The outlook for banks remains highly challenging. Further significant deterioration in
asset quality is likely given the projected recession and further rises in unemployment. Deleveraging
and low credit demand will sustain margin pressure, despite the benefits of LTRO related carrytrade, while the need to increase loan loss provisioning will absorb a very large share of banks’ preprovision income. These factors will significantly reduce banks’ capacity to internally generate
capital, while regulatory and especially market solvency pressure has intensified. The inter-reliance
of banks and the sovereign has increased. Assuming the stability of domestic deposits, liquidity

buffers appear sufficient at the system level, but collateral posted at the ECB for repo purposes is
vulnerable to ratings downgrades and margin calls while asset encumbrance for some banks is high
and the capacity to generate new collateral is weakening. Spanish banks also face €158 billion
(medium- and long-term) debt redemption in 2012–13. Although the LTROs have provided a
sizeable cushion, the phasing-out of ECB funding will likely prove problematic if market access does
not improve and reliance on wholesale funding is not reduced. Indeed, liquidity stress tests in the
context of the FSAP show that liquidity risk can potentially become the biggest risk should ECB
support not be renewed.
20.
Stress tests in the context of the recent FSAP show that while the core of the system
appears resilient, vulnerabilities remain in some segments. Under the adverse scenario, the
largest banks would be sufficiently capitalized to withstand further deterioration of economic
conditions, while several banks would need to increase capital buffers by about 4 percent of GDP to
comply with the Basel III transition schedule (core tier 1 capital of 7 percent). Important caveats are
attached to these stress test results. In particular, feedbacks between banking system distress and
economic performance cannot be fully captured and capital needs in these banks would be larger
than this, as they would also include restructuring costs and reclassification of loans that may be
identified in the recently launched independent valuations of assets. For a core tier 1 of 10 percent
in the baseline scenario, the recapitalization needs would be around 5 percent of GDP. Stress tests
by independent consultants hired by the authorities reported in June a potential capital need under
an adverse scenario of around 5–6 percentage points of GDP. A more definitive estimate will need
to await the results of the independent valuations.4
21.
Recent reforms need to be followed through by a comprehensive strategy to decisively
clean up the system taking advantage of the European backstop. Reforms to date, while
substantial and increasingly well-designed and comprehensive, have yet to decisively clean up the
system and to convince markets. The recent FSAP identifies some key reform areas, many of which
are along the lines envisaged by the government. A final phase of the reforms should involve:


Independent valuation. The quality and transparency of the independent valuations and
stress tests should be assured (the inclusion of staff of independent institutions to advise on
the process is encouraging).



Triage. Banks should quickly be required to meet any resulting additional need for higher
provisions and capital, drawing on the backstop as needed. Banks should be triaged into:
(1) those that do not need support (2) viable banks that need government support, which
will be provided subject to tightly-monitored restructuring plans, and (3) non-viable banks.



Dealing with intervened banks. The new management of the fourth largest bank should
quickly present their detailed restructuring strategy and timetable. The strategy for the other

While the Eurogroup’s commitment of up to €100 billion (9.4 percent of GDP) includes an additional safety margin,

report, for example, in the debt sustainability analysis.

16

SPAIN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

intervened banks should be announced, including their restructuring plans and estimated
cost of government support. Consideration should also be given to strengthening the state’s
ability to manage its large stakes in a substantial share of the banking system, and to
enhance its ability to eventually exit, and ideally benefit, from the sale of such stakes.


Using the backstop. The exact cost to the government will depend on many factors,
including the results of the valuation exercise, the costs of restructuring intervened banks,
and the specific strategy adopted. Even if the cost were to reach the full Eurogroup
commitment of €100 billion, this would remain manageable from a debt sustainability
perspective, provided the envisaged fiscal adjustment is undertaken.



Legacy assets. A goal of dealing comprehensively with legacy real estate assets should be
announced, with options to be finalized after the independent valuations.



Liquidity. Banks should take full advantage of the new rules widening the range of collateral
eligible for repo-operations. The BdE should streamline and expedite current procedures to
facilitate the prepositioning of collateral by banks.

22.
In this context, an upgrade of the banking supervision and crisis management
resolution frameworks is key (Box 4). The BdE’s gradual approach in taking corrective action has
allowed weak banks to continue to operate and requires, inter alia, measures to improve the
timeliness and cost-effectiveness of remedial action. To this end, amendments should be introduced
to allow overriding shareholders rights, the partial transfer of assets and liabilities, the allocation of
losses to (left behind) creditors, the conversion of some categories of bank debt into equities, and
special administrative bank insolvency and liquidation procedures. In addition, FROB should be
allowed to use mechanisms more rapid and flexible than the current auction procedures to dispose
of an intervened bank if systemic considerations arise.

Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities largely concurred with staff’s analysis. They shared staff's view that the
Euro area backstop is a unique opportunity to clean up Spain's financial sector once and for all.
However, they expressed their preference, shared by staff, for direct recapitalization with European
funds to help break the adverse feedback loops between sovereign and banking stress at the
national level. In this respect, in follow up discussions after the mission, they strongly welcomed the
Euro area summit statement and the possibility of direct recapitalizations once a single supervisory
mechanism is in place. Regarding the practical implications of greater bail-in, while this would be in
line with the burden sharing principles outlined in the recent European Commission directive, the
authorities observed that since in Spain a high share of hybrid capital is held by retail customers, a
too strict bail-in could risk triggering undesirable reactions. A large bail in program could undermine
banks’ market access, including for larger institutions. The authorities also argued that ECB collateral
policies are more important than Bank of Spain procedures in alleviating eventual needs for greater
pools of collateral.

Box 4. FSAP Main Recommendations
The economic environment increases the risks to corporate and household balance sheets and
consequently, the soundness of the banking sector. However, vulnerabilities are unevenly
distributed across credit institutions. Most banks appear resilient and the results of the stress test
and the diagnostic analysis confirm the need to address segments of the system
Spain’s financial oversight framework is largely compliant with international standards. However,
it needs to be further enhanced in some aspects; in particular, by:


strengthening remedial actions and sanctioning powers of the banking and securities
regulators—currently shared with the Ministry of the Economy—so as to address
preemptively the build-up of risks in the system;



providing operational and regulatory independence to the banking and securities
regulators and financial-budgetary independence to the insurance and securities
regulators; establishing a risk-based regulatory framework for the insurance sector and
monitoring potential risk build-up in the system;



developing regular testing and contingency plans to further strengthening the resilience
of financial market infrastructures to liquidity shocks.

Although the BdE has flexible powers to deal with weak banks, the framework should be further
strengthened by putting in place a more forward-looking approach. The crisis management
framework should be buttressed by widening the array of resolution tools, in line with recent
international practices. And while significant progress have been made in reforming and
consolidating the savings bank sector, a clear long-term strategy on governance structures needs
to be designed to transform of savings banks into minority institutional investors over the
medium-term.

B. Fiscal Policy5
24.
The 2011 fiscal slippage was much worse than
expected, underlining the challenges of fiscal
consolidation at all levels of government. The 6 percent
of GDP target was missed by almost 3 percent of GDP and
the adjustment in 2011 was only 0.4 percent of GDP—even
less adjustment than in 2010 and not due to worse macro
conditions. The slippage is mainly (two-thirds) at the
regional level, which did not adjust at all in 2011. But the
central government and social security systems also slipped

GDP when considering offsetting measures (such
as a reinstated mortgage deduction for housing, the extension of a lower VAT rate on housing
transactions and a small pension increase). Some of the measures are temporary, covering the first
two years of the legislature—such as the increase in personal income tax and a revaluation of
property taxes.
26.
These emergency measures were included in the draft 2012 budget, which aims for
very ambitious consolidation. The initial target in the 2011 SGP for 2012 was set at 4.4 percent of
GDP, but rested on unrealistic growth forecasts and the assumption of no slippage in 2011. The
revised target of 5.3 percent of GDP remains highly ambitious (involving a structural improvement of
some 4 percent of GDP) and could have accommodated more fully the effects of the cycle. A tax
regularization program was introduced and expected to bring 0.2 percent of GDP. The expenditure
adjustment entailed ministerial cuts of 17 percent on average, and is designed to be achieved
through lower capital expenditures, and goods and services. In addition, the government introduced
measures to cut health and education expenditures by about 1 percent of GDP, and with an impact
mostly at the subnational level. The clearing of arrears at the subnational government level through
the creation of a special fund, financed by bank borrowing, implies a debt increase of around
3½ percent of GDP.
27.
Further substantial slippage is likely in 2012, though the adjustment could still be
significant.


The macroeconomic framework is largely in line with staff’s, but underlying revenue
weakness could be stronger than expected. Items such as social security contributions,
pensions or unemployment are likely to respond more negatively to the economic outlook.

specified. The international experience with
tax repatriation programs in particular suggests significant risks of underperformance. The
adjustment at the regional level seems optimistic given the very high deficits in some
regions, the difficulty of adjusting their expenditure (mainly health and education) and their
poor track record.


Staff expects an overall deficit of around 7 percent of GDP, a deviation with respect to target
of around 1 ½ percent of GDP. Structural slippage should be resisted, but given the weak
growth outlook, it should not be made up in a compressed timeframe. This could imply, for
example, immediately taking additional measures of at least 1 percent of GDP on a full year
basis to reach a 2012 deficit of about 6 ¼ to 6 ½ percent of GDP. The additional measures
could usefully include eliminating some VAT exemptions, raising VAT rates (especially
reduced rates) and other indirect taxes, taxing the thirteenth salary, and cutting fourth
quarter capital expenditure.

28.
Achieving the medium term fiscal targets will also be very challenging, but critical for
debt sustainability. Reaching a primary surplus of about 2-3 percent of GDP should allow
maintaining debt at manageable levels. However, the bulk of the planned consolidation from 2013 is
based on expenditure savings, many of which are yet to be specified.


The revenue to GDP ratio is projected in the SGP to barely rise over the period, though
indirect taxes are projected to grow and social security contributions to fall after an initial
increase in 2012.



Primary spending is projected to fall by almost 4 percent of GDP. Only a part of this
reduction has been linked to specific measures (such as raising co-payments on prescription
drugs and increasing class size); the bulk is to come from reviews of current spending at all
levels of government and rationalization of spending responsibilities across different levels
of government. The evolution of the wage bill in particular is underpinned only in part by
measures that would allow a significant nominal decline over time.



Interest expenditure is projected to fall by 2015 as the yield on 10-year Spanish government
debt is projected by the government to decline gradually to 3.7 percent. Under staff’s

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

framework, growth would also be significantly lower than the government’s were the deficit
targets to be achieved.


Under staff’s baseline, deficits remain high. Given the lack of detailed measures, staff
projects the deficit to substantially overshoot targets and to fall gradually to only about
4 percent of GDP in the medium term. This, plus debt from bank recapitalization and
financing regional arrears, would lead to debt surpassing 100 percent of GDP in the medium
term.

29.
Staff believes that the medium-term fiscal plan should be strengthened around three
dimensions:


Path. The deficit path envisaged in the SGP should be less front-loaded, in agreement with
European partners. The medium-term targets are broadly appropriate, but a smoother path
would be more desirable during a period of extreme weakness, when multipliers are likely to
be particularly large and the tax base soft, to reduce the risk of creating a negative feedback
loop with growth and NPLs, which may also undermine market confidence, especially if
targets are missed (Box 5). Such a smoother path should also be embedded in a prudent
macroeconomic framework.



Composition. Given the size of the needed consolidation, no options should be ruled out.
Revenue measures should play a larger role. In particular, there is considerable scope to
reduce tax expenditures and increase indirect tax revenue by broadening the base and
raising and unifying rates, especially on VAT and excises—actions that should be taken now.
Reducing social security contributions to induce an internal devaluation is desirable, but
should be contingent on first reducing the deficit (to, say, below 3 percent of GDP). The
reintroduced deduction for mortgage payments should be eliminated. It is also important
that the measures deliver permanent and not one-off gains (for example, there should be no
further amnesties or transitory rate increases). Spending on the most vulnerable should be
protected.



Certainty. Spending reductions are planned for the right areas. But they will take time to
identify, be difficult to implement, and their yields uncertain. To give assurance that the
envisaged savings will materialize, future public wage cuts to reduce the wage bill and
VAT/excise increases could be legislated now and only cancelled if the revised targets are hit.
Spain has privatized extensively in the past, but privatization on remaining assets should be
more aggressively pursued to give upside risk to debt projections.

Box 5. What is the Right Deficit Path?
The needed medium-term consolidation can either be achieved by a front-loaded adjustment
or a smoother reduction over time (a third approach of a back-loaded adjustment would very
likely not be considered credible by the market). Both have pros and cons. On balance, staff
recommends a less front-loaded strategy than envisaged in the government’s Stability
Program.



Smoother adjustment. Spreading the same primary balance adjustment more
smoothly would imply higher deficits in the near term and higher debt. To stabilize debt
from 2014 onwards, some degree of frontloading would still be needed, but the target
of a 3 percent deficit would be pushed back by one year (a completely smooth
adjustment towards the primary balance of 1 percent of GDP/year by 2014 would not
allow for a stabilization of the debt). A strong adjustment of the structural primary
balance of more than 2 percent in 2013 (instead of 4 percent), 2 percent in 2014 and
then ¾ percent every year until 2017 would allow a smoother profile, while still ensuring
debt stabilization. Debt would peak in 2014, at about 96 percent of GDP and would fall
back to 93 percent of GDP in 2017. In both scenarios, and although staff made a
conservative assumption to include the Eurogroup’s commitment up to €100 billion that
includes an additional safety margin, there are downside risks to the debt path, through
for instance the recognition of contingent liabilities.

Pros and cons. Compared to a smooth adjustment, the front-loaded strategy has the
advantages of: (1) improving the deficit and debt faster, which should boost market
confidence and reduce borrowing needs; and (2) possibly being more politically feasible as
adjustment measures, especially if permanent, could be more easily introduced early in the
legislature. The main disadvantage is that the front-loaded strategy would imply most
contraction when the economy is weakest, compounding the headwinds of de-leveraging
and labor market adjustment. This would likely lower significantly growth compared to the
baseline (using a multiplier of ½ in the first year and ¼ in the second) and raise

unemployment and non-performing loans. This could create a negative feedback loop with
adjustment. This would likely lower significantly growth compared to the baseline (using a
multiplier of ½ in the first year and ¼ in the second) and raise unemployment and nonperforming loans. This could create a negative feedback loop with fiscal consolidation,
especially if multipliers are even larger and tax bases weaker than envisaged. The benefits
of a front-loaded strategy would also be lost if the targets are missed by significant
margins. The smooth path could also be compatible with establishing credibility by: (1)
pre-announcing fiscal measures and with the path still being front-loaded in structural
terms; (2) strong action in other areas, such as labor markets (already undertaken) and
banks that would allow to compensate for the drag on growth in outer years; and (3) the
implementation of institutional fiscal reforms.

The fiscal framework has been significantly strengthened. A constitutional balanced
budget amendment was passed in September, supported by the Budget Stability Law in February
and a draft Transparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance Law. The laws apply to
all levels of government and stipulate a structural balanced budget and a debt ratio of 60 percent of
GDP by 2020, with transitional requirements in the interim, and limits expenditure growth to below
that of GDP. Monitoring and transparency requirements on subnational governments are enhanced,
as are tools to sanction non-compliance. For example, fines can be levied, transfers withheld and,
ultimately, sub-national financial autonomy removed (see Annex I). Public officials that deliberately
fail to comply with the fiscal targets in the organic law can also be directly sanctioned, including
removal and ineligibility for public office and loss of pensions. The center is also giving financing to
sub-national governments, in return for greater conditionality (Box 6).
While the recent legislation has many promising elements, implementation will be key
and further improvements in the fiscal framework are still necessary. It is important that the
new provisions in the Budget Stability Law be fully implemented (for example, immediately warning
some regions and quickly intervening if they fail to respond promptly). But the framework could
benefit from further improvement, and the stronger the framework, the more likely markets would
accept a smoother consolidation path.

31.



While significant progress has been made in recent months, including publishing quarterly
regional government outturns in national accounting terms for the first time, greater fiscal
transparency is essential. For example, providing monthly consolidated general government
accounts on a cash basis within six weeks. Regional budgets, fiscal plans and reporting should
be made more homogenous and user-friendly. A durable framework for funding regional
governments also needs to be established.



Moving to a fully-fledged medium-term budget framework with expenditure ceilings and
detailing measures covering at least 2013 and 2014, alongside measures that would aid subnational consolidation (for example by introducing savings in health spending).



Creating an independent fiscal council. This could, for example, analyze budgets and provide
their key macroeconomic assumptions, develop comparative regional performance indicators,
and conduct nationwide expenditure reviews of major programs.

Box 6. The Challenge of Regional Fiscal Adjustment
Spain’s regions have recently failed to meet their fiscal targets. Poor fiscal reporting and
transparency have made taking timely corrective measures difficult. Before 2012, enforcement of
agreed fiscal targets was non-credible and penalties for regions that violated agreed targets or
flaunted procedure went unused. Cyclical revenues (including linked to real estate) have failed since
the crisis but expenditure, which is over two-thirds related to structural social categories (e.g. education
and health), is yet to be significantly consolidated.

Even with strong efforts at the regional level and help from the central government, achieving
the 1.5 percent of GDP regional 2012 deficit target is challenging. Regions began 2012 with a
weighted average consolidation need of 2 percent of GDP (and some much more). Rebalancing plans
were finished only in May, leaving little time for execution. Moreover, the adjustment is tilted towards
current expenditure consolidation, which may be difficult given the structural nature of regional public
spending. Some regions showed difficulties already in Q1 2012, for example, Navarra and Murcia
reported Q1 outturns close to the 1.5 percent of GDP full-year target while Asturias had not agreed on
a rebalancing plan as of mid June.
The central government is reducing structural expenditure mandates on health, education and
other areas, to improve the likelihood of consolidation through two Royal Decree Laws. In health,
pharmaceutical copayment has been linked to income, and a raft of rationalization measures have
been introduced, e.g. requiring generics or limiting prescriptions. In education, class sizes and tuition
have increased, and in both sectors, working weeks have been extended, replacement rates limited,
and benefits reduced. Other measures, such as changing the public television requirements or
eliminating duplicate public services and entities are in progress.
The central government has also introduced and used a number of “carrots” to induce fiscal
cooperation, increase monitoring, and reach consensus on fiscal targets. The central government
has taken action on its declaration that no region would default, and raised the possibility of
mutualizing issuance via, for example, “hispanobonos” (central-government guaranteed debt to cover
regional amortizations). Liquidity pressures were reduced by advancing transfers and extending the

repayment of past revenue overpayment from five to ten years. Two financing facilities were created
with favorable terms, also to be used for repaying suppliers and rolling over maturing debt. The deficit
target was also relaxed from 1.3 percent in 2011 (and 2012) to 1.5 percent of GDP under the 2012 SGP.

But the government has also range of “sticks” which it has used less actively. The Constitutional
Amendment passed in September of 2011, the Organic Law for Fiscal Sustainability and Financial
Stability, and the Transparency and Good Governance Law provide several tools to increase fiscal
discipline. Expenditure and debt ceilings are extended to the regions and fiscal reporting is greatly
increased (including rebalancing plans, the standardization and increased content of budgets, and
improved reporting fiscal outturn, including in national accounting). Deviating regions must adjust
within one year instead of three and monitoring by the central government is quarterly. Warnings,
penalties and the possibility for taking a region into national administration are envisioned in the law
as progressive penalties for persistently deviating regions. Officials proven to have intentionally failed
to comply with mandates or disregarded implementation of measures face penalties including
dismissal, ineligibility for public service and loss of pension.
These sticks need to be used. In the short-run, establishing the legal mechanisms which ensure
transparency and deliver consolidations is critical to ensuring success. The rebalancing plans were
reportedly reviewed more stringently in 2012, which is promising. The functionality and credibility of
new tools, such as warnings, non-disposition of credit decrees, and dismissal of public officials should
be quickly and convincingly established. Stronger measures, such as imposing the recommendations of
a delegation of experts and taking a region into national administration, should also be executed as
promptly as the law permits. Ultimately, all options must be tabled to ensure the fiscal sustainability of
the regions, which are now more intertwined than ever with each other and the sovereign.

Authorities' views
32.
The government recognized that the envisaged fiscal consolidation is very ambitious
and challenging. They concurred with staff that a smoother path of consolidation would have been
preferable given the rapid deterioration of the economy. They assessed that a traditional approach
to fiscal multipliers might not be warranted, as the inter-temporal effects of fiscal consolidation
might differ between time periods. They concurred with the view that Spain has a low level of tax
revenue and the need to take revenue measures along the path of fiscal consolidation, although
they considered that legislating measures for the medium term was difficult in the current
constitutional framework of Spain.
33.
The authorities pointed to the significant changes in their fiscal framework and
underscored their willingness to take additional measures as needed. The authorities agreed
with the pressing need to bring greater certainty and transparency to fiscal outcomes at all levels of
government, and particularly at the regional level. They viewed initiatives including the Fund to Pay
Suppliers, the Organic Budget Stability Law and the Fiscal Transparency and Good Governance Law
as strengthening transparency and fiscal control in all levels of government. The authorities,
however, did not agree that an independent fiscal council would be useful, noting for example, the
risk of undermining existing institutions.

C. Structural reforms
34.
Spain urgently needs job-rich growth and further gains in competitiveness. Domestic
demand is likely to be structurally weak for the foreseeable future and the current account deficit
needs to improve further. This means focusing on policies to expand the tradable sector, raise
productivity and lower costs by addressing wage-price misalignments that have developed with a
decade long, credit-fuelled, boom. Though product markets require significant improvement,
Spain’s main structural problems are its labor market rigidities and high unemployment, with
adverse effects both on aggregate demand and potential output.



Wage rigidity: Wages react little to
unemployment and are more correlated to past
inflation than in other OECD economies. Spain’s
wage rigidity is due to collective wage
agreements that are automatically extended to
the whole province/industry, with very restrictive
opt-out clauses and widespread wage
indexation.

Cumulative change in Employment

35.
Spain’s labor market rigidities have resulted in highly cyclical and volatile
employment. Spain suffered one of the largest falls in employment in the OECD, even though its
GDP loss was mild. The negative performance of the Spanish labor market can be attributed to the
following structural rigidities (Box 7):



Insufficient flexibility of working conditions: Industry or region wide collective
agreements restrict the ability of firms to modify working arrangements to adjust to shocks.
For example, Spain’s hours worked per employee increased since 2007, when unemployment
was rising, while they fell in most OECD countries.



High labor market duality: Spain has the largest share of temporary workers in the OECD.
Workers on open-ended contracts enjoy high protection and job stability, while workers on
temporary contracts have low protection and face job instability. Given the rigidity of wages
and working conditions, and the high dismissal costs of workers on open-ended contracts,
Spanish firms keep a large share of temporary workers and adjust to negative shocks by
dismissing them. For example, temporary employment has fallen by 34 percent since end2007 while employment in open-ended contracts has fallen only by 6 percent.
Box 7. Unemployment Volatility and Labor Market Rigidities

Empirical analysis indicates that Spain’s labor market rigidities play a large role in explaining the cyclical
behavior of unemployment. A wage Phillips curve vector autocorrection equation with five variables ( labor
compensation, prices, labor productivity, unemployment and work hours), is used with the G7 economies as a
benchmark. In comparison to the G7 economies, Spain’s labor compensation stands out for its high inertia (high
responsiveness of labor compensation to a 1 percent increase in labor compensation) , high responsiveness to
inflation (a high increase of labor compensation in response to a 1 percent increase in inflation), and low sensitivity
to unemployment (labor compensation does not fall when the unemployment rate increases by 1 percent). In
addition, Spain’s work hours react little to labor market shocks. These rigidities result in large increases in
unemployment in response to shocks to wages or inflation.

The recent labor market reform can significantly improve the performance of Spain’s labor market over the
medium-term. This reform aims at reducing wage and working time rigidity, and if properly implemented, can
substantially increase the sensitivity of labor costs to economic conditions.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

36.
The recent reform promises a significant improvement in the functioning of the labor
market. This reform, enacted as a decree on February 2012, introduced measures that can
importantly reduce labor market duality, wage rigidity and firms’ internal inflexibility. These should
boost job creation over time by making wages more responsive to economic conditions, allowing
firms to agree wages and working conditions according to their needs, and making firms more
willing to offer open-ended contracts and step up in-job training. Most Spanish labor market
academics shared the view that this is a potentially major reform. The main elements of the reform
are:


Duality is reduced by lowering the dismissal costs of permanent workers for unfair
dismissals. More importantly, the reform eases and clarifies the use of fair dismissals for
firms in distress (those firms facing current or prospective losses, or a persistent decline in
sales). It also reduces procedural costs and eliminates the need for prior administrative
approval for fair dismissals. The goal is to make fair dismissals the regular channel to dismiss
workers with permanent contracts in distressed firms, thus significantly reducing dismissal
costs.



Wage rigidity and firms’ internal inflexibility are reduced by giving priority to firm level
agreements over wider collective agreements. The reform also allows distressed firms to
change working conditions, temporarily suspend contracts, and reduce working time. The
goal is to allow distressed firms to adjust wages and working time instead of dismissing
workers. In addition, the reform limits the automatic extension of expired collective
agreements to one year.

37.
The reform also introduces more targeted measures to foster employment and
training, although some may have potentially limited effectiveness. The reform includes a
number of measures aimed at fostering job creation for the youth and long-term unemployed, and
in-job training. However, some of these measures are based on subsidies and tax breaks, which have
been used in the past with little success. The measures that do seem more likely to foster job
creation are the authorization for temporary employment agencies to act as private placement
agencies, and the enhanced flexibility of part-time work and telework.
38.
The reform’s success hinges on its implementation and further strengthening labor
policies should be considered. Previous reforms have not been successful, largely as the changes
were marginal and not widely used, in part, due to interpretation by the courts. The reform could
also be strengthened, for example, by reducing the difference between protection for open-ended
and temporary contracts to make the labor market more inclusive and by eliminating the practice of
indexation and “ultra-activity”. The new flexibility options could also be better communicated to
firms. And if sufficient firm-level flexibility is not quickly forthcoming (which should be transparently
monitored), policymakers should prepare contingency plans, for example, by moving to an opt-in
system for collective bargaining. The planned review of active employment policies is welcome and
should carefully consider whether the unemployed are being given sufficient training and incentive
to secure employment and whether the use of subsidies (that has proven inefficient and expensive
in the past) offers the best alternative. Recent measures on fighting fraud, including on

unemployment benefits, should also contribute to decreasing the size of the grey economy and
strengthening labor policies.
39.
Further improvement in labor productivity will be needed to increase trend growth.
Since the beginning of the crisis, productivity per employee rose by 11 percent, largely reflecting
labor shedding, and the working week increased by almost 3 percent. Wage growth slowed helping
deflate unit labor costs. Yet, more progress will be needed for Spain to fully regain competitiveness
lost during the boom years and to sustain the needed export-led recovery. Further improvement in
labor productivity will have to be achieved not by means of additional layoffs but rather through the
better use of resources.
40.
The external position remains considerably weaker than would be consistent with
medium term fundamentals and appropriate policy settings. The current account has improved
significantly on the back of resilient export market shares, and Spain now has a trade surplus with
the euro area. Yet because the ongoing improvement partly reflects domestic demand compression,
a sizeable output gap, and labor shedding attaining full employment and strong and sustainable
growth would require a significantly weaker real effective exchange rate.



Competitiveness indicators based on either consumption prices or unit labor costs show that
the large gaps that opened up vis-à-vis trading partners since euro entry (when the current
account deficit was already 3 percent of GDP) have only partly corrected since 2008. EBA and
CGER model estimates still point to REER overvaluation of 10 to 15 percent (Annex V).
Recent competitiveness improvements significantly reflect cyclical productivity gains from
labor shedding, and a change in relative prices is the primary way to improve the external
balance while closing the output gap.



Further structural improvement bringing about a persistent current account surplus would
be appropriate to help improve the net IIP position, which would still remain very negative
for many years. External debt is also too high, and is to be further increased in gross terms
to the extent that the European financial assistance to bank recapitalization would take the
form of a loan rather than direct equity stakes. Although projected to gradually decline over
time, external debt remains a major source of external vulnerability as it generates large
financing needs.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

To improve the external position, an effective implementation of the labor market reform
should bring down labor costs, while financial sector restructuring should help banks reduce
reliance on the ECB. Delivering fiscal consolidation will also contribute significantly to
external adjustment.

41.
Other structural reforms are necessary to support the labor reform with decisive
changes in the product and service markets. The growth challenge is such that Spain should be
aiming to be have one of the most business-friendly internal markets in the world. Reforms to the
goods and service markets not only would help Spain to raise its growth potential, but also to
accelerate its employment recovery. Reforms aimed at increasing overall competitiveness in the
economy can help strengthen labor demand across all sectors, but may not be sufficient to absorb
the workers shed by the labor-intensive construction sector since 2007. A cooperative solution,
where workers accept greater wage moderation, employers pass on the cost savings to prices and
hire, and banks recapitalize, could result in a faster reallocation of resources to dynamic sectors and
a better outcome for all.
42.
The government’s reform agenda is promising and needs to be rapidly implemented.
Retail licensing has already been eased and the government’s reform agenda appropriately targets a
common regulatory framework in all regions, boosting the rental market, liberalizing retail hours
and professional services, and eliminating the tariff deficit. It would be important that these reforms
are rapidly and effectively implemented – a detailed and ambitious timetable would help structure
and communicate the efforts. Further reforms, such as policies to help small firms grow,
deregulating the fuel sector and postal services and supporting intellectual property rights, also
seem necessary to foster inclusive and job-rich growth. Establishing a clear goal, such as getting
Spain into the “Top 10” list of global indices of competitiveness and business environment could
help focus policy and popular understanding.

Authorities’ views
43.
The government argued that the labor market reform is profound, introducing
significant flexibility. They acknowledged that the reform needs time to take effect and it is too
soon to assess whether it is working as planned. Still, they noted that there are some early
indications that the reform is producing results. Notably, partial data for the first 3–4 months of
2012 show that wage increases in collective agreements signed during 2012 are low, the number of
opt outs from industry or sectoral level collective agreements has increased, and the severance
payments for collective dismissals has fallen. The authorities viewed their structural reform agenda
as comprehensive, already underway, and helping to revive growth in the medium-term. They
already enacted a reform removing the license requirement to start small retail businesses, a process
which previously took more than six months. The authorities agreed that ongoing competitiveness
gains were not sufficient, and that persistent current account surpluses would be needed to reduce
external vulnerabilities.

STAFF APPRAISAL

44.
Faced with great challenges on several fronts, the government reform momentum has
been strong, with many major actions initiated in recent months. In the financial sector,
provisions and capital requirements have been raised, independent valuations commissioned, and a
large backstop provided with support from Spain’s European partners. In the fiscal sector, a package
of measures was introduced in December, the 2012 budget is ambitious and the new organic
budget and transparency laws provide for greater transparency and control over regional finances. A
profound labor reform was also introduced.
45.
The outlook is very difficult. The economy is falling into an unprecedented double-dip
recession, with unemployment already at 24 percent, persistent capital outflows and risks of losing
market access. Large-scale fiscal consolidation is beginning, private sector de-leveraging has far to
go, credit is contracting, and banks rely heavily on the ECB. On the positive side, imbalances are
unwinding, especially the current account deficit, inflation and unit labor costs. Wage and price
realignment should be supported by the recent labor market reform. While upside risk exists,
especially related to a successful implementation of the labor reform, downside risks largely
dominate at this juncture. In particular, while the Euro area financial backstop and the end June Euro
area summit decisions help mitigate short-term risks, market tensions could further intensify. Private
sector deleveraging could also be faster than envisaged, and the fiscal consolidation may have
larger than envisaged output costs.
46.
Continued strong reform momentum and a clear medium-term vision are critical to
restore confidence so that imbalances can be unwound smoothly and jobs and growth
fostered. This strategy should be based around concrete measures to deliver the needed mediumterm fiscal consolidation, and a clear roadmap for restructuring the weak segments of the financial
sector. It also means better functioning labor and product markets to support household incomes,
fiscal consolidation, banks’ asset quality, and social backing for reform. Intensifying the ongoing
reversal of the large misalignment in prices and wages should be at the center of this agenda. A
cooperative approach, where workers accept greater wage moderation, employers pass on the cost
savings to prices and hire, and banks recapitalize, could result in a faster reallocation of resources to

Significant policy development occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board. The Staff Supplement
attached to this report provides the staff’s appraisal of these developments, reproduced here for convenience. On
the financial sector and policies to accompany the financial assistance: “In staff’s view, the policies envisaged in the
MoU are strong and in line with recommendations of the FSAP and staff report. In particular, weak but viable banks are
to be supported and non-viable banks are to be resolved, a comprehensive strategy to deal with legacy assets is
developed, and supervision and crisis management and the resolution framework are upgraded. If fully implemented,
and in combination with the European financial assistance, these policies would substantially complete the needed
restructuring of the sector. It remains important to sever the adverse loop between the sovereign and the banks and
help mitigate short-term risks by a timely transformation of the European support into direct recapitalization.” On the
fiscal sector and the smoother deficit path recommended by the Council of the European Union:

dynamic sectors and a better outcome for all. The prospective Euro area financial sector support is
an important plank in this comprehensive strategy, and the recent Euro area summit decisions
rightly aim to address market concerns on the implication of bank sector losses for the sovereign
balance sheet, Spain’s prospects for lowering borrowing costs would be critically helped by a timely
implementation of the summit decisions and continued progress towards a banking and fiscal
union at the European level, and actions to support and revive growth.
47.
The recent progress in the financial sector needs to be built upon to complete the
restructuring. The recent FSAP helps identify some key reform areas, which include ensuring the
quality of the independent valuations, supporting viable but weak banks while resolving the nonviable, and developing a comprehensive strategy to deal with legacy real estate assets. Banking
supervision and the crisis management and resolution framework also needs to be upgraded in key
areas. The government is to be commended for ensuring a backstop for the financial sector, which is
an opportunity to help complete this task.
48.
Significant consolidation efforts are in train for this year. Despite the considerable effort,
the very ambitious deficit target for 2012 will likely be missed by a substantial margin. Given the
weak growth outlook, however, slippage should not be made up in a compressed timeframe. Given
also the lack of detailed measures after 2012, the deficit will likely fall only gradually over the
medium term. This, plus debt from bank recapitalization and financing regional arrears, requires
achieving the medium-term targets to maintain debt at manageable levels.
49.
The medium-term fiscal plan should be strengthened. The deficit reduction path
envisaged should be made less front loaded and contain specific measures. Revenue should play a
larger role in the adjustment, especially indirect taxes—action in this area should be taken
immediately. Greater certainty could be given to the plans by legislating now measures to take
effect in the future, though the application of some could be contingent.
50.
An improved fiscal framework would facilitate the envisaged adjustment. Full and
proactive use should be made of new provisions to control regional government finances and the
transparency of their accounts greatly improved. The budget should also become more mediumterm oriented and an independent fiscal council considered.
________________________________________________________

“The new path is in line with staff recommendations and is similar to the recommended “smoother” adjustment scenario
in Box 5 of the staff report”. On the fiscal sector and additional adjustment measures: “The new fiscal package, regional
government actions, and structural measures, are broadly in line with staff recommendations. Staff’s preliminary
estimate is that the cumulative size of the package between 2012–14, as currently planned, is about 2 percent of GDP.
This should lead to deficits in 2012 and 2013 close to the revised targets, though more measures (for example, on the
VAT) would be needed for 2014 and beyond. Medium-term debt sustainability would improve with government debt
reaching 97 percent of GDP in 2015, but declining slightly thereafter. Implementation will be key and challenging, with
the risk of slippage, in particular by the regions, warranting close attention.”

Spain urgently needs job-rich growth and further gains in competitiveness. This means
focusing policies to facilitate reallocation of resources towards the tradable sector and lower costs.
The recent labor reform is most welcome as it has the potential to substantially improve the
functioning of the labor market. The reform’s success hinges on its implementation and it could
usefully be strengthened, including by improving active labor market policies. Labor reform should
be complemented by delivering on the structural reform agenda in other areas—a detailed and
ambitious timetable would help structure and communicate the efforts.
52.

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on the regular 12-month cycle.

______________________________________
On the economic outlook: “Staff expects the new fiscal consolidation measures to have a significant impact on growth,
especially in 2013. While the large role of indirect taxes should lead to a relatively low multiplier, preliminary estimates
suggest that the level of output would be lowered by about 1 percent by 2014. Unemployment would also increase,
although this might be mitigated by the effect of lower social security contributions and unemployment benefits, as well
as the recent labor market reform. The VAT increase, combined with electricity price increases, will also lead to
temporarily higher inflation. Lower domestic demand would further improve the current account, which would reach a
larger surplus over the medium term, putting the net IIP on a downward path”.

3. Banking sector

Market stress could intensify.
Deleveraging and fiscal drag could affect the
outlook for the euro area, with potential knock
on effects on the financial sector and increased




High
Implementation of Spanish fiscal adjustment
plans may falter as fiscal targets remain
ambitious amid recession. Regional fiscal
slippages could re-occur.
Debt could be further increased by contingent
liabilities.
High
Banks’ market financing may not be regained
quickly.
Following cleanup of balance sheets, capital

High
Direct effects through lower export
demand and inward financial spillovers,
indirect effects through deleveraging

High
Exacerbate ongoing non-resident
outflows.
Further widen sovereign borrowing
costs and impair market access.

High
The ECB’s LTROs have addressed
immediate bank funding pressures.
However, further ratings downgrades
and margin calls could worsen liquidity
situation of certain banks, potentially
requiring ELA.
The impact of capital needs is
mitigated by the mobilization of a large
backstop. Impact on debt would
however be muted if the ESM
implements direct recapitalization.
High
Implementation of structural reforms
could stall, undermining confidence.
Durable drag on potential growth.

High
Dampen activity in the short and
medium-term.
Could lead to deflation and worsen
debt sustainability for both private and
public sectors.

1/The RAM shows relatively low probability events that could materially alter the baseline discussed in this report. The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of risks surrounding this baseline.
2/Significant policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board, which are discussed in the
attached Staff Supplement.
3/ In case the baseline does not materialize.

SPAIN

Table 11. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations1
(Scale-fully consistent, broadly consistent, or marginally consistent)
IMF 2011 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policy I

Marginally consistent

Take additional measures, if near-term risks to outlook
materialize, to ensure the targets will be achieved. These
include further cuts in current and investment spending, as
well as an increase in VAT and excise rates especially on
petroleum products.

Fiscal policy II
Improve fiscal frameworks to underpin the fiscal
consolidation targets. The frameworks should aim at
enhancing transparency, strengthening mechanisms to
ensure subnational compliance, establishing an
independent fiscal council, and institutionalizing periodic
public-sector-wide review of major spending programs.
Financial sector policy
The financial sector reform needs to be decisively
completed. The reform should address carefully the viability
of weak banks based on deliberately conservative
assumptions, boost capital and provision buffers above the
minimum requirements, and perform a review of estimates
of loan losses by a leading independent firm.
Labor market reform
A bold strengthening of labor market reform to
substantially reduce unemployment. This calls for effectively
decentralizing collective bargaining to the firm level,
eliminating inflation indexation, and lowering severance
payments further to at least EU average levels. These
measures should be supported by broader reforms,
including further improving the retraining of workers with
mismatched skills, supporting youth employment, and
ensuring that the sufficient incentives to return to work.

A package of additional measures was introduced in
December, including a broad-based freeze on expenditure
authorizations, an extension of the wage freeze, and a
progressive increase of marginal tax rates on personal and
capital income as well as real estate. An ambitious 2012
budget was also presented.
Broadly consistent
The fiscal framework was significantly improved. A
constitutional balanced budget amendment was passed in
September 2011 and the government introduced an organic

Broadly consistent
A royal decree law on labor market reform was enacted in
February 2012, which introduced significant improvement to
the functioning of the labor market. The reform gives priority
to firm-level agreements over higher level collective
bargaining, reduces severance pay for unfair dismissal and
makes fair dismissal easier. It also introduces more targeted
measures to foster job creation for the young and long-term
unemployed, and in-job training.

ANNEX I. FISCAL AND EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY

7

Spain has large public sector and external funding needs for the next few years. Gross general
government debt financing needs would exceed 20 percent of GDP in 2012 and 2013. The
government’s funding pressure arises largely from amortization payments, with redemption of
outstanding securities alone amounting for 7.5 percent of GDP in the second half of 2012, and 11
percent in 2013. As of early July, the central government had raised 65 percent of projected gross
medium and long term debt issuance for 2012, in advance compared to previous years and taking
advantage of the positive effect of the ECB’s LTRO. Relative to its European peers the public sector
debt-to-GDP ratio remains relatively low, but growing rapidly absent any significant fiscal
adjustment. Stock flow adjustments are also substantial, for example the plan to clear arrears at the
subnational level that is potentially leading to an increase of debt by 3 ½ percent of GDP in 2012.
Debt rollover is a limited portion of central government debt—though the average maturity has
slightly declined to 6 ½ years, and the average maturity at the subnational level has decreased
significantly in some instances. There is a risk that depending on conditions for market access, the
maturity structure of debt may decline further. Market scrutiny of its ability to meet its financing
needs is high and interest costs on newly-issued debt have risen with 10 year spreads with respect
to the German Bund at above 570 basis points as of early July. The European financial assistance for

While the standard debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework
is limited by its medium term horizon and relatively
mechanistic assumptions, it provides a useful assessment that
can be complemented by longer-term analysis. Under
unchanged policies, and assuming that European financial
assistance provided as a loan via the FROB reached the full
€100 billion committed by the Eurogroup, the public debt DSA
for Spain projects further increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio

over the medium term, to 106 percent of GDP in 2017. Although expected additional measures
would contribute to stabilize that ratio, stress scenarios could result in further significant increases.
This is also highly dependent on the potential realization of contingent liabilities. Regarding external
debt, a large portion of financing needs is accounted for by non-resident deposits, with 2012
maturities estimated to about one third of GDP (including interbank deposits), as well as the
growing share of Eurosystem financing. Beyond the impact of the EFSF loan for this year, the
external debt sustainability analysis projects gross external debt to start declining significantly over
the medium term as external deleveraging proceeds.
A. Baseline Scenarios
In the current policies scenario for the fiscal sustainability assessment, the underlying fiscal position
is projected to improve slowly over the medium-term, and is based on current policies. Gross
government financing needs are expected to remain large. On the external side, while external
liabilities are to be impacted in 2012 by European financial support, projections of further current
account improvement, together with substantial foreign asset drawdown, contribute to putting
Spain’s external debt on a downward path.
B. Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Sustainability
Interest rate. Real interest rates in the current policies scenario are assumed to average 3.3 percent
over the projection period, and assume a gradual but not complete decline from current levels of
spreads (to 300 basis points in 2017). The impact of an increase in interest rate is expected to have a
non negligible effect on interest expenditure, which has already increased rapidly at the general
government level in 2011. There are also large downside risks should debt dynamics foster further
market concerns. Should real interest rates increase above the historical average of 1.4 percent (the
historical average is depressed in large part by relatively high GDP deflators in the mid 2000s) and
reach 5.5 percent (representing an extreme and tail 2 standard deviation shock), debt would increase
to 123 percent of GDP by 2017, about 17 percentage points of GDP above the current policies
scenario. The overall gradual impact on interest payment reflects the long average life of central
government debt, whose average maturity is 6 ½ years in 2011. As a result, debt rollover over the
forecasting period is expected to be relatively modest.
Growth. Relative to interest rates, Spain’s public debt profile is more sensitive to shocks to growth.
Should growth fall by about a little over 1 percentage point over the forecasting period, the debtto-GDP ratio could reach 124 percent by 2017, about 18 percentage points higher relative to the
current policies scenario.
Euro depreciation and contingent liabilities. In the case of a 30 percent nominal depreciation of
the euro, after adjusting for domestic inflation, and an additional contingent liability shock of
10 percent of GDP, the debt-to-GDP trajectory is expected to increase to 117 percent. It is notable
that the portion of the government’s liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is small, at less
than 2 percent. Thus, all else being equal, the impact of a sudden depreciation in the euro exchange
rate on the debt profile would be modest but not the impact of contingent liabilities.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

C. Alternative Scenarios for External Sustainability
Interest rate. The impact of a permanent ½ standard deviation shock to the interest rate for all
outstanding external debt— close to a 40 basis point increase from the baseline—would increase
debt compared to the baseline by more than 5 percentage points of GDP by 2017.
Growth shock. A permanent ½ standard deviation shock to the projected real growth rate—
corresponding to a continuing recession in 2013, no growth in 2014, and an anemic recovery of
growth to just 0.4 percent by 17—would increase debt compared to the baseline by close to
12 percentage points of GDP at the projection horizon.
Current account shock. A permanent ½ standard deviation shock to the projected non-interest
current account balance—corresponding to a slower return to overall balance—would increase debt
compared to the baseline by close to 8 percentage points of GDP at the projection horizon.
Standard combined shock. A permanent ¼ standard deviation shock applied to the projected
interest rate, real growth rate and current account balance would increase debt compared to the
baseline by about 11 percentage points of GDP by 2017.
Under all these alternative scenarios, gross external debt ratio to GDP would however remain on a
downward path at the projection horizon.

ANNEX II. MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE LABOR MARKET
REFORM OF FEBRUARY 2012
A labor market reform was enacted as a decree law on February 10, 2012, entering into force
immediately. It has now completed its way through Parliament with only minor changes. This reform
has the following objectives: (1) to enhance market efficiency and reduce duality; (2) to foster firms’
internal flexibility and avoid employment destruction; (3) to promote permanent employment and
employment creation in small firms; and (4) to make the workers more employable and fungible.
The detailed measures are as follows:
1. Measures to enhance labor market efficiency and reduce duality:
a. Compensation for unfair dismissals of permanent workers is reduced from 45 days per year
worked, with a maximum of 42 months, to 33 days per year worked, with a maximum of 24
months. Existing contracts keep their cumulated compensation of up to 42 months, but new
compensation days are cumulated at the rate of 33 per year and only until they reach the
new maximum of 24 months. New permanent contracts abide by the new rule.
b. Compensation for fair dismissals of permanent workers remains at 20 days per year worked,
with a maximum of 12 months. But fair dismissals for unfavorable economic conditions are
made easier. The causes are clarified to avoid excessive judicialization and to make fair
dismissals the regular channel to dismiss permanent workers. The objective reasons that
justify fair dismissals are defined as follows:
i)

Economic: At least when the company faces current or prospective losses, or a persistent
decline on its revenue or sales (for three consecutive quarters compared to the same
period of previous year).

ii) Technical: Changes in the means or instruments of production.
iii) Organizational: Changes in the system of work or the organization of production.
iv) Productive: Changes in the demand for products or services that the company wants to
sell in the market.
c.

60

Compensation for fair dismissals of permanent workers by small firms (less than 25 workers)
is reduced, with 8 of the 20 days of compensation paid with public funds (the wage
guarantee fund). Thus, duality is practically eliminated for small firms given the gradual
increase of compensation for temporary workers to 12 days. However, there is still a
significant difference between permanent and fixed term contracts if the dismissal is
considered unfair by a judge.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

d. Public administrations can also use fair dismissals for objective economic, technical, or
organizational reasons. Economic reasons are defined as a persistently insufficient budget
(3 consecutive quarters), while technical and organizational are as in b.
e. Reform of procedures to lower dismissal costs and increase efficiency in the use of fair
dismissal. Removal of processing wages (wages paid during the legal process) for all fair
dismissals, and removal of the administrative authorization required for collective dismissals,
which de facto was not granted without the unions’ agreement.
f.

The renewal of temporary contracts is limited to a maximum of two years starting in 2013.
The cost of termination of a temporary contract remains as established in the 2010 reform, at
9 days per year worked from January 2012, increasing by one year every year until reaching
12 days per year worked January 2015.

2. Measures to foster firms’ internal flexibility and avoid employment destruction:
a. Firm level agreements are given priority over regional or industry level collective agreements
on wages, working time, professional classification, type of contracts, and measures to
reconcile work and life balance.
b. Opt-out clauses from provincial or industry wide collective agreements for objective
economic, technical, organizational or productive reasons are eased and clarified. In the case
of a lack of agreement in the application of an opt out clause, a decision will be made by a
commission including employers, employees and the government. These opt-clauses can be
applied in areas such as wages, working time, shifts, and working functions. The objective
reasons are defined as follows:
i)

Economic: When the company faces current or prospective losses, or a persistent decline
on its revenue or sales (for two consecutive quarters).

ii) Technical: Changes in the means or instruments of production.
iii) Organizational: Changes in the system of work or the organization of production.
iv) Productive: Changes in the demand for products or services that the company wants to
sell in the market.
c.

Changes to working conditions for objective economic, technical, organizational or
productive reasons are eased and clarified. Working conditions are defined as wages,
working time, working system, and functional mobility. These modifications can affect the
workers’ conditions recognized in the contract or in collective agreements. In the case
conditions recognized in the contract are above those in collective agreements, the
modification might be done unilaterally by the employer.

d. Higher internal flexibility promoted by collective agreements. Unless otherwise specified 10
percent of the time schedule could be irregularly distributed over the year. Additionally,

SPAIN

occupations are defined in a broader manner, providing incentives for occupational mobility
within the firm.
e. Temporary contract suspension or working time reduction for objective economic, technical,
organizational or productive reasons are eased and clarified. Working time can be reduced
10–70 percent and contracts can be suspended temporarily. Affected workers are
encouraged to take training to make them more employable. Firms are entitled to
50 percent of the social security contributions for workers they suspend or reduce their
working time for a maximum of 240 days, and only if they keep the worker for at least a year
after the suspension or working time reduction expires.
f.

The automatic extension of expired collective agreements (ultra-activity) is limited to a
maximum of one year. Previously this extension was unlimited.

3. Measures to promote permanent employment and job creation in small firms:
a. New permanent contract for small firms (less than 50 workers) with a trial period of one year.
A deduction from tax payments by € 3000 if the first contract is with a youth (16–30 years
old), and an additional deduction of 50 percent of the worker’s unemployment benefit for
up to 12 months if the worker was unemployed.
b. Bonus for small firms (less than 50 workers) that hire youth unemployed (16–30 years old)
with permanent contracts: €3300 for males and €3600 for females. The worker must be
employed for at least three years.
c.

Bonus for small firms (less than 50 workers) that hire long-term unemployed (over 45 years
old) with permanent contracts: €3900 for males and €4500 for females. The worker must be
employed for at least three years.

d. Bonus for small firms (less than 50 workers) to convert internship, replacement or
substitution contracts into permanent contracts: deduction from their social security
payments of €500 for males and €700 per for females, during three years.
e. Reform to the current permanent part-time contract to allow overtime and make it more
flexible. Tele-work is promoted and regulated for the first time.
4. Measures to make the workers more employable and fungible:
a. New individual right to professional training of 20 hours per year. Increased supply of
professional training by allowing direct participation of private agents. New training account
associated to each worker to improve training itinerary in case of unemployment.
b. New training contract for youth 16–25 years old, allowing for theoretical training within the
firm, with a bonus to encourage the use of the contract.

i.

Minimum contract duration is 1 year and the maximum 3 years. No limit in the number
of training contracts as long as they are in different professional areas.

ii.

Firms of less than 250 workers signing this contract with an unemployed are exempt of
social security contributions for the worker for the full duration of the contract. Firms of
250 workers or more are exempt of 75 percent.

iii.

Firms transforming the training contract into a permanent contract can deduct from its
social security payments €1500 per year during three years for males, and €1800 per
year during three years for females.

5.
Temporary Employment Agencies are authorized to act as private placement agencies.
Previously, only the public employment service and a few private agencies were involved in job

ANNEX III. ORGANIC LAW FOR BUDGET STABILITY
AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
The Organic Law for Budget Stability and Financial Sustainability, which implements Spain’s
Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment of September 2011, represents another important step
towards strengthening fiscal control. The law was the first in Europe to comply with Treaty on
Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The amendment
passed in September 2011, and the organic law was approved by the cabinet in January 2012, ahead
of the March 2012 signing of the Fiscal Compact Treaty, and then passed the lower house of Spain’s
Parliament in April. The Amendment and the Organic Law meet the Treaty’s requirement for a
balanced budget rule at the highest legally binding level, which is also critical to ensure compliance
by Spain’s autonomous subnational governments. More broadly, the law represents an important
step in Spain’s broader reform of the fiscal framework. This ongoing effort strengthens transparency,
coordination, rationalization and sustainability through linked fiscal legislation, including the
pension reform and the transparency law.

Source: Government of Spain.
* Transparency law in draft form, regional financing facility expected in summer/fall 2012.

The Organic Law introduced fundamental improvements in Spain’s fiscal framework, including in
mandating fiscal targets, strengthening enforcement, and improving transparency.
The legislation introduced a debt ceiling, expenditure level and growth ceilings, and a deficit limit,
with the most binding of the four dominating the others in a given year. An escape clause is
introduced for catastrophes, negative annual real GDP growth, or emergencies, and requires a vote
by an absolute parliamentary majority. The law also prohibits subnational bailouts from the center to
the regions and municipalities, and from regions to the municipalities they control.
The law included a number of improvements to facilitate enforcement. Current penalties are kept,
including the threat of not authorizing financing long-term and short-term financing operations and
de-authorizing co-financing of joint projects for deviating regions. In addition, the law authorizes
the creation of financing mechanisms which can embargo shared revenues if a region deviates from
an agreed plan. Three year “rebalancing plans” for regions that deviate from targets have been

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

replaced with one-year “economic-financial” rebalancing plans (Table A1). Most critically, the law
explicitly links persistent fiscal deviation with intervention by central government into a subnational
administration and the de-authorization of subnational governance competencies. In this
connection, a region can be intervened by the central government within one year of detecting a
persistent deviation from the legal limits, and the law introduces “warnings” from the Ministry to
regions that could compel some corrective fiscal actions in an even shorter time period.
Transparency and monitoring are improved through increases in publication mandates. Quarterly
reviews, quarterly fiscal outturns at all levels of government, economic-financial rebalancing plans
and related reports are to be centralized and published by the Central Government. Economicfinancial rebalancing plans must include explanations of the causes of deviations from fiscal targets,
projections based on existing and corrective policies, a calendar and quantification of corrective
policies, multi-year budgeting and debt sustainability and macroeconomics sensitivity analyses.
Finally, regions and municipalities that participate in the new financing facilities, such as those for
arrears, report detailed financial positions, including amortization schedules and borrowing
requirements.
A transitional regime is introduced to help manage the fiscal consolidation necessary to meet debt
targets set for 2020 and to accommodate the current recession, and includes a minimum annual
adjustment in the structural balance, the enactment of the escape clause for the crisis, and a review
of the minimum adjustment during the period as part of the strategy to reach the debt target of
60 percent of GDP by 2020.

ANNEX IV. CLEANING-UP BANKS’ BALANCE SHEETS
In February 2012 and May 2012, the authorities introduced higher provisions and specific capital
buffers for banks’ outstanding real estate exposure as of end-2011 (RDL 2/2012 and RDL 18/2012).
The objective is to bring balance sheet valuation of troubled assets closer to market value and force
banks to recognize losses.
The measures are based on three complementary pillars:






Specific provisions to realize incurred losses in problematic assets; the new one-off
requirements are:
o

Land — 60 percent of the loans classified as substandard and doubtful;

o

Housing under development —50 percent of the loans classified as doubtful and
substandard, and 24 percent of the loans classified as substandard but where development
is ongoing;

o

Finished housing and other real estate collateral— the exceptions for minimum provisioning
requirements for doubtful and substandard loans (25 and 20 percent, respectively) are
eliminated.

General provision to take into account potential
migration from normal to problematic portfolio. To
this end, banks are requested to charge one-off
general provisioning for exposures against
construction and real estate developers classified as
standard, namely 52 percent for land, 29 percent on
housing under developments, 14 percent on finished
property and housing, and 52 percent on personal
guarantee and second mortgages.

Capital add-on to allow for valuation uncertainties regarding land and housing under
development. Capital add-on of 20 and 15 percent is computed, respectively, for land and
housing under development classified in the problematic portfolio.

The impact of these measures is estimated to amount to about €75 billion, thus bringing the
coverage of total problematic portfolio – which includes doubtful and substandard loans as well as
repossessed real estate assets and is estimated to be about €184 billion—from 29 percent to
70 percent.

To better gauge the extent of asset quality deterioration, an independent third party valuation on all
loan books (including residential mortgage and SMEs) will be performed on each bank by two
reputable auditor firms over the next two-three months.
In the meantime, banks have been required to segregate foreclosed assets into dedicated asset
management subsidiaries. Further refinement of the strategy to deal with legacy assets will be
determined on the basis of the results of the independent valuation.
The measures also included incentives for banks to merge. In particular, for banks that present a
merger plan by end-May 2012, the deadline to comply with the new rules is set 12 months after the
approval of the mergers. To foster the solvency of consolidating groups, FROB has been allowed to
purchase contingent capital securities issued by merging institutions.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX V. EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT

8

Despite recent improvement in the current account, staff assesses Spain’s external position as
substantially weaker than one consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. In
particular, net external liabilities are too high and indicators point to real effective exchange rate
overvaluation.
Negative Net International Investment Position and Capital Outflows
1.
Spain’s large negative net international investment position has remained around 90 percent
of GDP since 2009. High gross external debt has also stabilized close to 170 percent of GDP since
2010. Over 2010–11, portfolio liabilities have declined, while Eurosystem-related liabilities have
surged. Large portfolio outflows by non-residents took place in 2010–11 and early 2012, adding
external financing needs to the current account deficit. Despite residents’ portfolio repatriation, a
private financial account deficit opened up in 2011 and early 2012, with large private “other
investment” outflows over the recent period. Net private outflows were compensated to a limited
extent by ECB purchases of Spanish securities in the second half of 2011, and to a larger extent by
increased ECB refinancing of Spanish banks (reflected in TARGET imbalances).
2.
The negative IIP and large gross financing needs from external debt are major sources of
external vulnerability. Vulnerabilities have been materializing in relation with concerns about growth,
banking sector restructuring, and the viability of the fiscal path, amid volatile market conditions. A
further large improvement in the cyclically adjusted current account would be needed to reduce net
liabilities, and thereby address vulnerabilities stemming from a weak external position.
Current Account Improvement
3.
Since reaching 10 percent of GDP in
2007 as a result of a domestic demand boom,
the current account deficit has been adjusting. In
2011, the current account deficit dropped to 3.5
percent of GDP, with a cyclically adjusted deficit
close to the actual deficit. The current account
balance continues to improve as the economy
switches away from non-tradable sectors and
the output gap widens.

model estimate, the larger current account deficit is largely explained by the contribution of the
fiscal policy gap. Beyond the regression results however, the overriding need to improve the net
international investment position suggests that a significant decline in the cyclically adjusted current
account would be appropriate. Taking this into account, the 2011 cyclically adjusted current account
appears to be 3 to 5 percentage points of GDP weaker that the value implied by fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
Real Exchange Rate Assessment
5.
Competitiveness indicators based on either consumption prices or unit labor costs show that
the large gaps that have opened up between Spain and its trading partners since euro entry have
only partly corrected since 2008. Export market shares have been resilient. However, recent
improvements in unit labor costs significantly reflect cyclical productivity gains from labor shedding.
6.
Alternative competitiveness indicators exhibit a range of uncertainty, but suggest a real
effective exchange rate 10–15 percent above the level consistent with underlying fundamentals and
desirable policies. REER values as of the Spring 2012 WEO reference period resulted in a gap of 11
percent under the EBA analysis, and 18 percent under the CGER analysis of the real effective
exchange rate. Spain’s REER depreciated by about 4 percent between the reference period and the
time of the Article IV consultation.
Policy Implications
7.
Because the current account improvement expected in the near-term partly reflects
domestic demand compression and a sizeable output gap, attaining full employment and strong
and sustainable growth would require a significantly weaker real effective exchange rate.


An effective implementation of the labor market reform should bring down labor costs,
contributing to reduce both external and domestic imbalances.



Financial sector restructuring should help banks regain market access and reduce
reliance on the ECB, addressing vulnerabilities from the composition of the external
position.



Delivering fiscal consolidation will also contribute to external adjustment.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Spain
On July 25, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Spain.1
Background
The economy has entered an unprecedented double-dip recession with unemployment
already very high and public debt increasing rapidly. On the positive side, imbalances
are improving, especially the current account deficit, inflation, and unit labor costs, and
deleveraging is underway. But market confidence remains weak. Spain has suffered a
sharp reversal of private external financing flows in the second half of 2011 and early
2012. After an LTRO-induced respite, market tensions re-emerged in the spring. Yields
and spreads on Spanish government bonds remain high and banks unable to tap
private unsecured financing.
Many major policy actions have been taken in recent months on several fronts. On
banks, provisions and capital requirements have been raised, independent valuations
commissioned, and a backstop provided with support from Spain’s European partners.
The key policies incorporated to accompany this backstop are: (1) identifying individual
bank capital needs based on a comprehensive asset quality review and an
independent bank-by-bank stress test; (2) recapitalizing, restructuring and/or resolving
weak banks; (3) segregating legacy assets of weak banks into an asset management
company; (4) burden sharing from hybrid/subordinated-debt holders in banks receiving
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in
summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

public capital; (5) strengthening supervision and regulation. The financial assistance
will cover estimated capital requirements with an additional safety margin, estimated as
summing up to €100 billion in total, to be disbursed in several tranches over the
18-month duration of the program.
On fiscal policy, the 2011 fiscal slippage was about 3 percent of GDP, much worse
than expected, underlining the challenges of fiscal consolidation at all levels of
government. The new government introduced a first package of measures in
December, an ambitious 2012 budget was adopted in June, the fiscal framework was
improved, and a scheme for clearing sub-national arrears was put in place. In July, the
Council of the European Union recommended another year (until 2014) for Spain to
reduce its deficit below 3 percent of GDP and loosened the targets for 2012–14. To
help achieve the new targets, the government recently announced a series of
measures—including increases in VAT and reductions in civil service remuneration and
unemployment benefits. Regarding regional governments, the government initiated the
first step in the warning process for several regions at risk of missing targets, monthly
reporting from October, and a new funding mechanism.
On labor market policy, a profound labor reform was introduced in February with
measures to reduce labor market duality (by lowering the dismissal costs of permanent
workers for unfair dismissals) and wage rigidity and to increase firms’ internal
inflexibility (by giving priority to firm level agreements over wider collective
agreements).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Spanish authorities for taking decisive actions on
many fronts. Nevertheless, in light of the ongoing private sector’s deleveraging,
heightened market tensions, fiscal retrenchment, and the high unemployment,
Directors noted that the economic outlook remains very difficult and vulnerable to
significant downside risks. Accordingly, they emphasized the critical importance of
sustained efforts and a clear, credible medium-term strategy for fiscal consolidation,
financial sector restructuring, and structural reforms. Directors agreed that the success
of this strategy in restoring confidence, jobs, and growth depends critically also on
progress at the European level in strengthening the currency union.
Directors commended the Spanish authorities for the measures taken to restructure
the financial sector in a challenging environment. They welcomed the European
financial assistance for the recapitalization of Spanish financial institutions and the
accompanying policies, as well as the envisaged role of the Fund in monitoring
progress. Directors stressed the need to continue providing official support for weak but
viable banks, resolve non-viable banks, and implement a comprehensive strategy to
deal with legacy assets. Further efforts are also needed to upgrade supervision, crisis
management, and the resolution framework. Directors considered that allowing direct
recapitalization for Spanish banks through the European Stability Mechanism would
help break the adverse feedback loops between the sovereign and banks, and have
positive spillover effects for the wider euro area. Faster progress toward establishing a

common supervisory mechanism for euro area banks would also boost market
confidence.
Directors welcomed the new fiscal package that supports a smoother path of
consolidation in the context of weaker growth, although a few saw scope for a less
front-loaded adjustment. Directors urged the authorities to adhere strictly to the agreed
fiscal path, stressing the need for a credible medium-term budget strategy to reduce
deficits and safeguard debt sustainability, while protecting the most vulnerable. In this
context, they called on the authorities to take additional measures as necessary,
especially on the revenue side, as well as use the available tools to enhance fiscal
discipline, particularly at the sub-national level. Directors welcomed significant progress
in strengthening the fiscal framework and looked forward to further improvements.
Directors underlined the urgency of additional progress in boosting competitiveness
and jobs, given the high level of unemployment in particular among the youth. They
welcomed the recent labor market measures, aimed at reducing market duality and
wage rigidity, and increasing firms’ internal flexibility. These efforts should be
complemented with further steps to improve the product and service markets, and the
business environment. More broadly, Directors encouraged a rapid implementation of
the government’s structural
reform agenda.

Statement by Carlos Perez-Verdia, Executive Director for Spain
and Carmen Balsa, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 25, 2012
We thank staff for their work and their comprehensive set of papers. This Article IV,
together with the recent FSAP, comes at a decisive moment for Spain. Authorities are fully
aware of this situation and are acting decisively to reduce the uncertainty in the financial
sector, strengthen the fiscal accounts, boost growth, and fight unemployment. Consequently,
most of the recommendations in the Article IV report are already being implemented, as
noted in the staff’s supplement (SM/12/183 sup.2) that describes the most recent measures
and significantly alters the staff’s appraisal. This notwithstanding, authorities will stand
ready to adopt additional measures as necessary. Moreover, they are working hand in hand
with their European partners to face both domestic and Euro Area challenges.
The imbalances of the Spanish economy—mainly the debt overhang of the household and
corporate sectors associated to the real estate bubble—accumulated over a long period of
high domestic demand and credit growth, were crudely exposed by the crisis. Throughout
the last months, the Spanish government has embarked on a comprehensive plan that
encompasses a very intense fiscal adjustment program and bold financial and structural
reform processes.
The outlook is certainly challenging, as the correction of imbalances is hindered by an
economic context defined by global economic risks and uncertainties, acute market stress,
and widespread lack of growth. Nevertheless, the current strategy, together with
appropriate actions at the European level, has the potential to rebuild trust and get the
Spanish economy back on a sustainable growth path—supported by the dynamism of the
external sector.
The strategy mentioned above relies on three main areas: financial sector, fiscal accounts,
and structural reforms. To address one of the main sources of uncertainty, the government
has acted decisively to reform and reinforce the financial sector. Over the last five
months, two Royal Decree Laws were enacted raising regulatory demands on banks’
provisions and capital buffers. Beyond that, the measures included in the recently signed
Memorandum of Understanding on Financial Sector Policy Conditionality (MoU), in the
context of the financial assistance granted to Spain by its European partners, will constitute
the backbone of the Spanish financial sector reform program until its completion (as
explained in the supplement). Fully in line with the recommendations of the recent FSAP
and the Art. IV report, the policies contained in the MoU have the overarching goal of
restoring confidence in the financial sector by strengthening the resilience of individual
institutions and the soundness of the general framework.
In dealing with institutions, the first step is the evaluation of their individual capital needs to
be finalized in September. This stress test assessment, together with an asset quality review,
is being conducted by independent consultants—whose work is being monitored by the
Spanish authorities, the European Commission, the ECB, the EBA and the IMF. All entities
in need of more capital will have to present recapitalization plans to be jointly approved by

2
the Spanish authorities and the EC. In the case of banks requiring public funds, this approval
—and the launching of the subsequent recapitalization or resolution processes—will have to
be ready by year-end. Banks that do not need public support will have, as a maximum
deadline, until June 30, 2013 to raise the necessary capital from private sources. All
institutions requiring public funds will have to (i) remove impaired assets from their balance
sheets by transferring them to an external Asset Management Company that will be
operational by November, and (ii) require burden sharing from hybrid capital and
subordinated debt holders after allocating losses to shareholders.
In order to increase the soundness of the regulatory framework, Spanish authorities will
request, from December 31, 2012 onwards, a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of
9 percent for all credit institutions. At the same time, the regulatory framework will be
reviewed and improved in the areas of loan-loss provisioning, credit concentration,
governance (mainly of former saving banks and the commercial banks controlled by
them), and transparency. Regarding the supervisory framework, the internal procedures
and operational independence of BdE will be strengthened by acquiring the sanctioning
and licensing powers currently held by the Ministry of Economy.
The above description of tasks, to which the Spanish authorities are fully committed, is not
exhaustive but provides an idea of its comprehensiveness and the importance attached to the
culmination of the financial sector clean-up process. The latter will not only contribute to
regaining confidence, but will also facilitate the restoration of the normal flow of credit to
profitable enterprises and, therefore, contribute to the return to growth and the reduction of
unemployment.
Turning to the fiscal area, last December authorities reacted to the 2011 slippage by
announcing a package aimed at yielding a 1.5 percent of GDP consolidation—8.9 billion
euros in expenditure reductions, and 6.2 billion euros from increased revenues. However, as
for the financial sector, last few weeks have witnessed the adoption of very important
th
measures in the fiscal front that have altered staff’s original appraisal. First, on July 10 , the
Council of the European Union issued a set of recommendations to which Spain is fully
committed. Again along the lines of the IMF’s advice, the essential elements of the current
fiscal strategy are the new extended deadline (2014) for the correction of the excessive deficit
and the corresponding smoother deficit reduction path—expressed both in overall targets
(6.3 percent of GDP in 2012, 4.5 in 2013, and 2.8 in 2014) and in terms of structural yearly
improvements (2.7, 2.5, and 1.9). In order to achieve these targets, Spain will also adopt a
detailed multi-annual budget plan for the foreseen period.
Second, the government has recently adopted a substantial set of additional fiscal
consolidation measures. Once again in line with the suggestions included in the report, the
main building blocks are (i) the increase in VAT—by substantially raising rates and
widening the basket of goods to which the highest rates are applicable—and the tobacco
excise tax; (ii) the elimination of the mortgage income tax deduction; and, (iii) the reduction
in the public sector wage bill. Additional measures include a further cut in ministerial
spending of one billion euros, a 20 percent additional reduction in the financing of political
parties, unions, and business organizations, the streamlining of active labor market policies,

3
and steps aimed at guaranteeing the sustainability of the social security and dependency
long-term care systems. Moreover, the Budget Stability Law enacted in February enshrines
the principle of budget balance and sustainability at all levels of government. This normative
instrument contains new powerful instruments to control budgets and its forceful
implementation will be crucial. In applying this Law, the Ministry of Finance has recently set
in motion the warning procedure for those regions in risk of breaching annual targets. At the
th
same time, the Council of Ministers approved, on July 13 , a centralized fund to support the
financing of regions, subject to reinforced fiscal conditionality.
The reform of the public sector is also being boosted by a large number of measures that are
already being carried out. Their goal is to increase the efficiency and to streamline the range
of services provided. The main lines of action include the elimination of overlaps and
duplicities, clear definition of responsibilities and allocation of functions among government
levels, budget control, reduction in the number of elected public officials and capping of their
wages.
All these fiscal initiatives will have a significant impact on public debt trajectory, as analyzed
in the supplement. The public debt level will stabilize within the forecast period, even if the
total amount of the European assistance for the financial sector is included, as staff
conservatively assumes.
The Spanish authorities are also very aware of the need and importance of structural
measures. They will play a key role in fostering sustainable growth, correcting internal and
external imbalances, and boosting the competitiveness and flexibility of the economy. We
broadly share the staff´s analysis of the well documented problems of the Spanish labor
market. We also concur with the positive assessment of the February labor reform and its
potential to reduce the excessively high rate of unemployment. This will be done by
addressing the two main factors that make this market dysfunctional: duality and rigidity in
wages and employment conditions. Implementation is of the essence. Preliminary data on the
latter is positive: collective agreements signed in 2012 have led to wage moderation, opt-out
clauses are increasingly being used, and severance payments for collective dismissals have
decreased.
On other structural fields, authorities are also introducing improvements. The recently
announced measures include, beyond labor market reform, a number of actions that will
contribute to making the Spanish economy more flexible and competitive. Among others,
reforms are focused on the energy sector, the service sector—particularly professional
services—shopping hours, commercial distribution, and the transport sector.
All in all, the Spanish authorities have been proactive in the adoption of measures throughout
the crisis, with a significant intensification in recent months. The actions already taken and
the ones to be adopted in the future will decisively contribute to the improvement of the
economic situation. The Spanish authorities remain committed to their forceful
implementation. Nevertheless, ultimate success will hinge also on continued progress at the
European level in strengthening the currency union and in reducing stress in sovereign debt
markets.
